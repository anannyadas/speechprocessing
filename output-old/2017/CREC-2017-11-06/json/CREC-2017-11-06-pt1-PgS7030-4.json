{"content": [{"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "D000563", "text": "  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, yesterday there was another gun massacre \nand horrible circumstances. I know the Presiding Officer came to the \nfloor earlier today to say a word about his feelings and the feelings \nof his family. They are shared by all of us. It is heartbreaking to \nthink that some person so demented, so unusual would come into a \nworship setting and kill innocent people.\n  Yesterday, in Sutherland Springs, Texas, at least 26 people were \nkilled and 20 others were wounded when a gunman opened fire in the \nsanctuary of the First Baptist Church. The reported shooter, Devin \nKelley, used an assault rifle to commit this mass murder. The victims \nrange in age from 18 months to 77 years. About a dozen of those who \nwere killed were children, including the daughter of the church's \npastor. This is heartbreaking. Our nation grieves for the victims and \ntheir loved ones.\n  The shooter reportedly drove up to the church wearing a bulletproof \nvest and tactical gear, and he began firing in the parking lot before \nentering the church. At some point, a local resident who lived near the \nchurch began firing back. The shooter then drove off, with two \nresidents in pursuit, eventually crashing his car. He was found dead \nfrom a gunshot wound, which may have been self-inflicted.\n  President Trump and others have said that this exchange of fire with \ncitizens responding saved lives and shows that the policy response to \nthe shooting should be to arm more good guys with guns. Let us not \nforget that 46 people were shot before these citizens came on the \nscene.\n  This reported shooter, 26 years old, had served in the U.S. Air Force \nfrom 2010 until 2014, working on logistics readiness. In 2012 he was \ncourt-martialed for two counts of assault on his then-wife and child. \nHe was sentenced to confinement for 12 months. He received a bad \nconduct discharge in 2014. He remarried in 2014, and had worked as an \nunarmed security guard at a water park. He reportedly bought four guns, \none each year from 2014 to 2017, and three of those weapons--the \nassault rifle that he used in this crime and two handguns--were found \nat the scene.\n  Local law enforcement said that the shooter was likely motivated by a \ndomestic situation. His wife's grandmother was one of the victims.\n  There are so many things that come to mind. First and foremost is the \ngrief and sorrow we all feel for the families who were affected. It is \nso sad that when people go to church on Sunday, they are not safe from \ngun violence and gun massacres, which are occurring way too frequently \nacross the United States. Just over two years ago, nine people were \nkilled by a gunman in the Charleston Emanuel AME Church. And just last \nmonth we saw the worst mass shooting in modern American history in Las \nVegas, with 58 people murdered and over 500 wounded. In Chicago, at \nleast 29 people were shot, five fatally, over this past weekend.\n  There are things that we need to do, and that only we can do in \nCongress, to make the laws better and safer.\n  I respect the Second Amendment. I respect the fact that there are men \nand women in my family, friends, and people I represent across Illinois \nwho own guns and use them safely and responsibly. We have sportsmen and \nhunters in my family. We have people who buy guns for sporting purposes \nand for self-defense. They store the guns carefully and safely. They \ntake very seriously that they are dealing with a deadly weapon. They \ndon't want anyone innocent to be hurt. I respect that very much. I \nthink we all should. But I also call on them now. They need to lead us \ninto a more sensible policy when it comes to gun safety.\n  Owners of firearms, overwhelmingly, when asked, believe we should \nhave comprehensive background checks to keep guns out of the hands of \nthose who misuse them. Overwhelmingly, a majority of gun owners feel \nthat way, as most Americans feel. Why can't we do that? We certainly \nknow it is within our power.\n  In my State of Illinois, in the city of Chicago, we are approaching \n600 homicides this year--600--most of them from gunfire. It is \nheartbreaking. That doesn't include those who were injured by being \nshot as well. Where are these guns coming from? There are no gun stores \nin the city of Chicago. That is true. But when it comes to purchasing \nguns, it makes no difference. The suburbs have plenty of gun dealers. \nOf course, there are gun shows in neighboring States, like Indiana. We \nalso know gun stores in the suburbs of Chicago supply 25 percent of the \nidentified crime guns. We know many of those are sold in what is known \nas a straw purchase. They are sold to someone who buys a gun for \nsomeone who is not legally qualified. It is a girlfriend or someone who \nbuys a gun because she has no criminal record so her boyfriend can use \nit--misuse it--and kill innocent people. Can't we toughen that law and \nmake sure there are real penalties for straw purchases? That is not \ngoing to slow down any legitimate gun owner or anyone who wants to use \na gun in a responsible fashion. That is one thing we can do.\n  Then there is the gun show loophole. We know, with Columbine and \nother places, that it was a gun show loophole that opened the way for \nthe purchase of guns that killed innocent people. Let's do something \nabout that. We should. If we are serious, we should.\n  We also know that the 1996 Lautenberg amendment prohibits convicted \ndomestic abusers from buying or using guns. That applies, as well, to \nmilitary personnel. Questions need to be asked and answered about this \nshooter in Texas and what happened after he was court-martialed for \ndomestic abuse in the Air Force in 2012. How did he purchase a gun \nafter that, in violation of the Lautenberg amendment?\n  We need to also ask why in the world anyone needs to own an assault \nweapon. I understand people buy rifles and shotguns and even handguns \nfor sporting and self-defense. But why does anyone need to own a \nmilitary-style weapon--one that can be converted, as we found in Las \nVegas, to a weapon that discharges 100 rounds in 7 seconds?\n\n\nThat is totally unnecessary for any legitimate legal purpose. It is \navailable, perhaps, for military use, perhaps, for law enforcement but \nnot for the ordinary American citizen who would purchase and own a gun \nfor legitimate purposes.\n\n  Next, we need to make sure that we understand why gun violence is \ngrowing in America. The number of people who have been killed or \ninjured just grows by the year. It is getting worse. According to a CDC \nreport issued just last week, gun deaths increased for the second year \nin a row last year. There were more than 38,000 gun deaths in 2016, up \nfrom 36,000 in 2015 and from 33,500 the year before that. We are \nexperiencing a public health crisis of gun violence in America, \naccording to the American Medical Association.\n  Of course, there is no single law or policy that would prevent every \nshooting death, just as there is no single law or policy that would \nprevent every drug overdose death. But we have to start working \ntogether, on a bipartisan basis, to bring these shooting numbers down.\n  We need to also talk about the issue of mental health, raised by the \nPresident in response to this tragedy in Texas. The President said:\n\n       This isn't a guns situation. . . . I think that mental \n     health is your problem here.\n\n  Despite the fact that most violence in the United States has nothing \nto do with mental illness, many are arguing that mental health is \nreally the issue. What have we done in the Senate when it comes to \nmental health and guns this year? Senate Republicans used the CRA to \nrepeal a regulation that directed the Social Security Administration to \nshare mental illness information with the background check compilation \nof information. There was advocacy for massive cuts to Medicaid, which \nwould throw millions of people with mental health needs off coverage. \nThere was an attempt to repeal the Affordable Care Act, which would \nhave allowed insurers to refuse coverage of essential health benefits, \nincluding mental health treatment. And there was a refusal to provide \nadditional Federal funding to help provide mental health care. We don't \nhave a very good record this year in the Senate when it comes to taking \nmental illness seriously, and we should.\n  I will also introduce a bill that I am working on to encourage more \ncrime-gun tracing in light of last week's crime-gun trace report from \nthe Chicago Police Department.\n  We focus on terrorism and what it does to our country, and we should. \nThat is our responsibility. Anyone who would do harm to innocent \nAmericans--as in 9/11, killing 3,000 in that particular instance--needs \nto be taken extremely seriously by all of us in Congress and in the \nWhite House. Foreign sources of terrorism need to be carefully watched \nwhen it comes to our border security, when it comes to background \nchecks, and the like. But let's be honest. More Americans are dying \nfrom Americans killing Americans with guns than by terrorist activity. \nIt is just as much a death as any foreign terrorist threat would be, \nand we need to consider it just as seriously as we do when it comes to \nthe issues of terrorism and safety for the people of America.\n  Why doesn't the Congress take this up? Why don't we even have a \ndebate? I am on the Senate Judiciary Committee. We have not had a \nsingle bill this year that addresses gun safety--not one--despite the \ngun violence that takes place every day and despite tragedies like this \ntragedy over the weekend in Sutherland Springs, TX.\n  Every time a terrible shooting occurs, Republican leaders in Congress \nsay now is not the time to act. And then Congress never acts.\n  Congress still has not acted to close the 72-hour background check \nloophole that allowed the Charleston church shooter to buy his gun in \n2015.\n  Congress has done nothing to address the bump stocks that enabled the \nLas Vegas shooter to turn a concert into a war zone.\n  Congress still hasn't even addressed the gun show loophole that \nallowed the Columbine shooters to commit that massacre back in 1999.\n  Will Congress act in response to this latest tragedy? Will the \nRepublicans who control Congress finally stand up to the gun lobby and \nput legislation on the floor to bring down the number of gun deaths? Or \nwill the Republican-controlled Congress ignore this public health \ncrisis once again?\n  The Republicans in Congress are rushing to pass massive changes to \nour tax code in a matter of weeks, and yet they refuse to do anything \nto prevent the next mass shooting. If the Republicans treated this gun \nviolence epidemic with a fraction of the urgency they are showing when \nit comes to cutting taxes for the wealthiest one percent and the \nlargest corporations, we could save many lives.\n  I pray for the victims of gun violence in this nation, but I also \npray that my colleagues will act to reduce this gun violence epidemic.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. DURBIN", "itemno": 0}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 1}], "header": {"chamber": "Senate", "num": "180", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "S7030-S7031", "wkday": "Monday", "day": "6", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "TEXAS CHURCH MASS SHOOTING", "id": "CREC-2017-11-06-pt1-PgS7030-4", "title": "TEXAS CHURCH MASS SHOOTING"}
