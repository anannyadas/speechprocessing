Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and \ncongratulate Malvern Bank of Malvern, Iowa, for celebrating 125 years \nin business. The bank was founded in 1892.\n  Kate McGann, Executive Vice President said, ``after 125 years, we're \nhitting the refresh button with a new name and logo.'' Throughout its \nexistence, Malvern Bank has gone through a number of name changes \nbeginning in 1906 when it became Malvern National Bank, and in 1929, \nwhen Iowa banking laws changed to permit expanded trust offerings, the \nbank became the Malvern Trust & Savings Bank. Finally, it was in 1946 \nthat Eugene W. Burdic became president of the bank, and since then his \nfamily has retained ownership. They have remained at their original \nlocation on 404 Main Street, continuing to providing the same type of \ncustomer service and community leadership the bank was founded on.\n  Mr. Speaker, I'm proud to represent Malvern Bank in the United States \nCongress and it is with great pride that I recognize them today. I ask \nthat my colleagues in the United States House of Representatives join \nme in congratulating them for this outstanding achievement and in \nwishing everyone at the Malvern Bank nothing but continued success.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. YOUNG of Iowa", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 3}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "180", "extension": true, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "E1516", "wkday": "Monday", "day": "6", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "TRIBUTE TO MALVERN BANK", "id": "CREC-2017-11-06-pt1-PgE1516-3", "title": "TRIBUTE TO MALVERN BANK"}
