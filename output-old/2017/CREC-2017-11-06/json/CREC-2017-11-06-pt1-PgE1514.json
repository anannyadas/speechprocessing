Mr. Speaker, I rise today \nto recognize the heroism and bravery of Albuquerque native, Anthony \nChavez, also known as the ``Red Hat Hero''. He helped five women escape \ngun fire during the deadly attack in Las Vegas, Nevada on October 1, \n2017.\n  Chavez was among thousands in the crowd at the Route 91 Harvest Music \nFestival when a gumnan fired at the crowd from the 32nd floor of the \nnearby Mandalay Bay Casino and Hotel. Chavez did not hesitate to help \nthe women who were standing near him.\n  He made a selfless and courageous decision to help his significant \nother and four strangers over the fence in front of them so they could \nretreat to safety. Without his help, it is likely that the women would \nnot have gotten out unharmed.\n  Chavez then stayed in the area for an additional hour, helping direct \npeople to ambulances and safe locations. He won't refer to himself as a \nhero, but it is undeniably clear that without his help many could have \nbeen injured or killed.\n  Chavez was dubbed the ``Red Hat Hero'' because one of the women he \nsaved recognized his unique, red Albuquerque Dukes hat in a photo on \nsocial media.\n  Chavez was one of many heroes during an otherwise tragic night in Las \nVegas. As such, he deserves our gratitude for his actions.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Ms. MICHELLE LUJAN GRISHAM of New Mexico", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 3}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "180", "extension": true, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "E1514", "wkday": "Monday", "day": "6", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "HONORING ANTHONY CHAVEZ", "id": "CREC-2017-11-06-pt1-PgE1514", "title": "HONORING ANTHONY CHAVEZ"}
