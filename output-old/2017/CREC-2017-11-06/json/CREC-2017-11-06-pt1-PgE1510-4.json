Res. 595--Rule providing for consideration of H.R. 2936--Resilient \nFederal Forests Act of 2017--I would have opposed this rule because it \nonly allowed debate of seven amendments, and blocked the consideration \nof 10 germane amendments. This rule does not maintain regular order I \nstrive for.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. POLIS", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 3}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "180", "extension": true, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "E1510", "wkday": "Monday", "day": "6", "month": "November"}, "related_bills": [{"type": "HRES", "context": "OTHER", "congress": "115", "number": "595"}, {"type": "HR", "context": "OTHER", "congress": "115", "number": "2521"}, {"type": "HR", "context": "OTHER", "congress": "115", "number": "2936"}], "doc_title": "PERSONAL EXPLANATION", "id": "CREC-2017-11-06-pt1-PgE1510-4"}
