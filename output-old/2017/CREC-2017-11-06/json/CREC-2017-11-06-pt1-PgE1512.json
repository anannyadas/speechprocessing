Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize All Saints' \nEpiscopal Church of Woodhaven, Queens on their 120th Anniversary. This \nlongstanding place of worship has a rich history as a congregation that \nembraces diversity and community service.\n  All Saints held its first service and Sunday school at a store-front \nin Richmond Hill, Queens on November 26, 1897. Initial offerings \ncollected by the service totaled $22.00, which became the initial \ncontribution towards the purchase of a permanent church. A few years \nlater, the church laid its first cornerstone on Lefferts Blvd., where \nit served for more than a century.\n  The Church has a long history of providing guidance and comfort to \nnew arrivals and families faced with hardship. For decades, All Saints \nenjoyed the leadership of Rectors dedicated to its parishioners and the \ngreater community. Later on, the former St. Matthew's Church, a \nbeautiful gothic revival building became its new home.\n  Today, All Saints is a bedrock of the Woodhaven community. The Church \ncontinues to provide spiritual and physical comfort by offering social \nand community services. Initiatives like the senior lunch program, \nyouth projects, the St. Hilda's Guild women's outreach program, and the \nCommunity Cemetery Project all promote fellowship.\n  Mr. Speaker, our churches, temples, and mosques are the cornerstones \nof our communities, the bedrock on which our faith, values, and sense \nof purpose rest. On this special occasion of its 120th year \nanniversary, I congratulate the All Saints Episcopal Church \ncongregation and wish them many more years of service.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Ms. VELAZQUEZ", "itemno": 3}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 4}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "180", "extension": true, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "E1512", "wkday": "Monday", "day": "6", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "RECOGNIZING ALL SAINTS' EPISCOPAL CHURCH OF WOODHAVEN, QUEENS ON THEIR 120TH ANNIVERSARY", "id": "CREC-2017-11-06-pt1-PgE1512", "title": null}
