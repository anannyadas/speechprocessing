Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the remarkable \ncareer of Justice Philip G. Minardo.\n  Justice Philip Minardo was born and raised in Brooklyn where he later \nattended St. Michael's Diocesan High School. In 1963, he graduated from \nManhattan College with a B.A. in Economics, and later received his J.D. \nfrom St. John's University of Law in 1967. In December 1968, John M. \nBraisted, Jr. appointed Philip as an Assistant District Attorney for \nRichmond County. He served in this position for over seven years and \nplayed a role in the successful prosecution of countless felony cases \nin Staten Island. After leaving the Richmond County District Attorney's \noffice, he started his own law firm in September 1976 focusing on civil \nand criminal cases.\n  After Philip's election to the Richmond County Bar Association's \n(RCBA) Board of Directors, he became President in 1987, and as such \nrepresented then-Supreme Court Justice Frank Ponterio on behalf of the \nRCBA in the U.S. Supreme Court case Board of Estimate of City of New \nYork v. Morris. In 1995, he was elected as a Justice of the Supreme \nCourt of the State of New York, 2nd Judicial District, which serves \nBrooklyn and Staten Island. After serving on the Supreme Court, Justice \nMinardo returned to Staten Island where he was appointed as the first \nAdministrative Judge of Richmond County and thereafter, the first \nAdministrative Judge of the newly created 13th Judicial District.\n  Justice Minardo has also been the recipient of prestigious honors \nthroughout his successful career. In 2010, he received the Rapallo \nAward by the Colombian Lawyers of the First Department. In addition, he \nwas a recipient of the Good Scout Award for outstanding service while \nserving on the Board of Directors of the Staten Island Council of the \nBoy Scouts of America. While his accomplishments are impressive, \nJustice Philip Minardo places an immense amount of pride and joy in his \nfamily.\n  Mr. Speaker, I want to congratulate Justice Philip G. Minardo on his \nretirement and on his exceptional career. He has been an outstanding \njurist, and I laud him for his lifetime of dedication and success.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. DONOVAN", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 3}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "180", "extension": true, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "E1516", "wkday": "Monday", "day": "6", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "RETIREMENT OF JUSTICE PHILIP G.
