Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Speaker, in just a few days, Americans will once again take time \nto remember and honor the sacrifices of the very few of our fellow \nAmericans who have sworn a solemn oath to defend this great Nation.\n  As an Army Medical Corps veteran myself, I am proud that, with the \nsupport of leadership and Members of both sides, we will pass a series \nof bills today and tomorrow that improve the delivery of healthcare and \nenhance the benefits available to America's veterans.\n  On our first bill, H.R. 1066, the VA Management Alignment Act, issues \nwith the organization and management of the Veterans Health \nAdministration and the Department of Veterans Affairs, in general, are \nnothing new. In 2015, the independent assessment found VA's \norganizational structure to be unnecessarily complex, rampant with \nmistrust and risk aversion, confused about priorities and strategic \ndirection, and hampered by a workforce that was losing motivation and a \nleadership team that was overwhelmed by crisis management. In 2016, the \nCommission on Care found VA to have one of the lowest organizational \nhealth scores in all of the Federal Government and lacking effective \nnational policies and a rational organizational structure.\n  Similar findings have been made by veterans, veterans service \norganizations, VA employees, the Government Accountability Office, the \nVA inspector general, and others in countless reports and testimony and \nstories over the last several years. They have also been common themes \nin the recent oversight hearings and site visits.\n  In order to improve the care, benefits, and services that VA provides \nto our Nation's veterans and increase accountability for poor-\nperforming employees, VA must first clarify and rationalize the \nDepartment's organizational structure and the roles, responsibilities, \nand lines of authority for supervisors, managers, and employees.\n  H.R. 1066 would jump-start that effort by requiring the VA to use the \nwork the independent assessment, the Commission on Care, and others \nhave already done to create a report on how the Department is to be \nstructured--to include clearly defined roles and responsibilities of \nkey leaders across all\n\n\nlevels--and submit it to Congress for review.\n  I am grateful to Representative Kilmer for sponsoring this \nlegislation. I urge all of my colleagues to support it.\n  Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R. \n1066, and I reserve the balance of my time.", "turn": 4, "speaker": "Mr. ROE of Tennessee", "itemno": 11}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "T000472", "text": "  Mr. TAKANO.

His advocacy and hard \nwork on behalf of veterans is commendable.\n  This bipartisan measure will require the VA Secretary to report to \nCongress on the roles, responsibilities, and accountability of \nemployees within VA.\n  This oversight is sorely needed. Last Congress, in testimony before \nthe Veterans' Affairs Committee, the bipartisan co-chairs of the \nCommission on Care both highlighted how little attention is paid to the \nVA's human resources to ensure the Department is functioning \nefficiently. Representative Kilmer's legislation will help lead to a VA \nthat more effectively meets veterans' needs.\n  I have enjoyed working with Representative Kilmer to advance this \nlegislation through committee and truly appreciate his work on this \nissue.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.", "turn": 5, "speaker": "Mr. TAKANO", "itemno": 12}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "R000582", "text": "  Mr. ROE of Tennessee.

Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  Mr. Speaker, I believe that we have a responsibility to ensure that \nmilitary veterans have access to the benefits and services that they \nhave earned. These men and women have had our backs, and we need to \nhave theirs.\n  We can't stand by as they endure challenges seeing doctors or getting \ntreatment because of management failures and unnecessary bureaucratic \nbarriers. Taxpayers have spent millions of dollars, tens of millions of \ndollars, to identify how the VA is broken and to identify opportunities \nto fix it.\n  The Government Accountability Office has raised specific suggestions \nrelated to management issues, but, unfortunately, the VA has \nimplemented few, if any, of these solutions, and that cannot stand.\n  How can our Nation's veterans expect to get what they have earned if \nthe leaders and components of the VA are not expected to cooperate with \none another? How can they expect to see medical providers if the VA \ncannot bring in or maintain talented medical professionals?\n  The VA Management Alignment Act is a bipartisan effort to address \nthese and other management problems that have real consequences on the \ndelivery of care to our friends, our neighbors, and to our loved ones.\n  Representative Newhouse and I drafted this bill with input from the \nGovernment Accountability Office to bring an end to this disjointed and \ninefficient system. The bill would require the Secretary to outline the \nroles, responsibilities, and accountability measures of senior leaders \nand branches of the VA and to provide Congress with a series of \nlegislative options to assist the Secretary in realizing positive \nchange.\n  The goal of this bill is to help Congress and the administration work \ntogether to fix these problems. The goal of this bill is to make sure \nveterans get the care and the benefits that they have earned.\n  I would like to thank Chairman Roe and Ranking Member Walz for their \nleadership and support in moving this bill forward. I would like to \nthank my colleague from California (Mr. Takano) for his help as well.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation to help us align the \nVA into a system that can deliver on our Nation's responsibilities to \nour military veterans.", "turn": 8, "speaker": "Mr. KILMER", "itemno": 15}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "T000472", "text": "  Mr. TAKANO.
