Mr. President, I am delighted to commend Fourteenth \nStreet School in Bangor, ME, on being named a 2017 National Blue Ribbon \nSchool of Excellence. Serving students from prekindergarten through the \nthird grade, this outstanding school in the city I am proud to live is \none of only 342 schools across the country to receive Blue Ribbon \nrecognition from the U.S. Department of Education.\n  Created in 1982, the Blue Ribbon Schools Program honors public and \nprivate schools that are either academically superior in their States \nor that demonstrate significant gains in student achievement. The \nschools singled out for this national recognition are models of high \neducational standards and accountability.\n  The success at Fourteenth Street School is the result of two guiding \nphilosophies. The first is ``meet the students where they are,'' with \ninstruction and support tailored to the strengths and needs of each \nindividual student. The second is ``all hands on deck,'' a call for all \nstaff members to engage with students and encourage them to achieve \ntheir full potential.\n  One of the unique features of Fourteenth Street School is the use of \nevery opportunity during the school day to support learning. Whether in \nthe classroom, preparing for recess, or standing in the lunchroom, \nstudents may be participating in a math game, reciting a rhyme, or \nsinging. The entire school eats lunch together daily, and a staff \nmember uses this time to read aloud to students. This focus on literacy \neven extends to physical education classes, where the PE teacher often \nreads articles from sports magazines to students.\n  The impact of this dedication to individual students is evident. Over \nthe last 5 years, average attendance exceeded 95 percent, and 100 \npercent of students participated in at least one afterschool activity.\n  Another important factor in the school's success is the emphasis on \nbuilding strong relationships with families. Through schoolwide and \nclassroom newsletters, parent meetings, parents and educators \naccelerating kids--PEAK--events, academic showcases, and, most \nimportant, direct communication with teachers, parents have the \nopportunity to play a significant role in their children's education.\n  I applaud the administrators, teachers, staff, parents, and students \nof Fourteenth Street School. Together, they are succeeding in their \nmission to generate confidence and momentum for learning. This \noutstanding school is making a difference in the lives of its students, \nhelping them to become independent, responsible learners and citizens. \nI am pleased that the U.S. Department of Education has selected \nFourteenth Street School for this well-deserved honor, and I \ncongratulate the entire school community for this outstanding \nachievement.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Ms. COLLINS", "itemno": 0}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 1}], "header": {"chamber": "Senate", "num": "180", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "S7013", "wkday": "Monday", "day": "6", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "RECOGNIZING FOURTEENTH STREET SCHOOL", "id": "CREC-2017-11-06-pt1-PgS7013", "title": "RECOGNIZING FOURTEENTH STREET SCHOOL"}
