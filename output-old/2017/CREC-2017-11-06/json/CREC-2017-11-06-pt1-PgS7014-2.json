Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the \nsignificance of Maine Veterans Cemetery-Caribou and the individual and \ncommunity spirit of generosity that sustains it as an honored and \nhallowed resting place for our Nation's veterans.\n  Conceived in 1998, the Maine Veterans Cemetery in Caribou was created \nbecause of a small but determined grassroots effort in Aroostook \nCounty, ME, that I was proud to support when I was Governor of Maine \nand am proud today to acknowledge as Senator for Maine. A diverse team \nof dedicated people came together to create the Northern Maine Veterans \nCemetery Corporation, NMVCC, comprised of members from various veteran \nservice organizations, community members, and veterans themselves who \nknew the significance of this undertaking. Since the first concept many \nhands have helped develop and beautify these 46 acres which provide \ninground burial for 12,000 and columbarium wall niches for over 1,000 \nmore of our honorably discharged veterans. But this cemetery represents \nso much more than a final resting place.\n  It is fitting to include in this statement the name of John T. Noble, \nthe distinguished veteran who epitomizes the efforts behind this \ncemetery. John would not want all the credit to go to him, and indeed \nthere were many who worked tirelessly to make their dream come to \nfruition; however, it was the late John T. Noble, along with his wife \nJoyce, who made the first significant and lasting donation of 33 acres \nof his family's land to honor veterans and their families for their \nservice and sacrifice. They went on to donate even more land and \nprovide countless donations to ensure this cemetery was one to be proud \nof. John lived by example as a person of great ethics, compassion, and \ngenerosity. He possessed these traits throughout his life as a member \nof the U.S. Armed Forces, a businessman, a husband, and a quiet \nphilanthropist who didn't seek recognition for his good works. His \nmotivations were never about himself but about how he could give back \nto others.\n  Our veterans risk their lives in the service to our great Nation. \nThey make countless personal sacrifices to protect freedom, and many go \non to continue to find ways to serve others--like the honorable efforts \nof a small community in northern Maine to turn what once was farmland \ninto a reverent final resting place for those who gave so much. It is \nmy honor to recognize the Maine Veterans Memorial Cemetery-Caribou and \nto pay tribute to John and Joyce Noble. Due to the generosity they \ndemonstrated, the northern region of Maine is able to provide a proper \nfinal resting place for our brave veterans.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. KING", "itemno": 0}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 1}], "header": {"chamber": "Senate", "num": "180", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "S7014", "wkday": "Monday", "day": "6", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "REMEMBERING JOHN T.
