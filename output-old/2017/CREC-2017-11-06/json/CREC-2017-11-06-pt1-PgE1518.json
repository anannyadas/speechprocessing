Mr. Speaker, I rise today \nto recognize Evan Clark, a student at Sandia Prep in Albuquerque, N.M., \nwho has made a name for himself as an advocate in the fight to \neliminate Type 1 Juvenile Diabetes. Evan was diagnosed as having \ndiabetes when he was 7 years old. Now, at age 15, Evan is bringing \nawareness to the disease at a national level.\n  Evan currently serves as New Mexico's delegate to JDRF 2017 \nChildren's Congress. He was one of 164 delegates chosen by JDRF, the \nleading global organization funding Type 1 Diabetes research. He \nrecently traveled to Washington, D.C., to participate in the Children's \nCongress, which included a Town Hall forum with delegates, professional \nathletes, actors and news anchors.\n  Evan also participated in a hearing before the U.S. Senate Special \nCommittee on Aging, where he and other delegates urged Congress to \ncontinue to fund diabetes research. They emphasized the organization's \nkey principles for healthcare reform, and the need for robust annual \nfunding for the National Institutes of Health and the U.S. Food and \nDrug Administration.\n  In New Mexico, Evan is a frequent speaker at JDRF events, such as the \nwalk, the gala, Type 1 Nation, and other events that raise awareness \nand money for diabetes research. In 2012, Evan's family was named the \n``Eternal Hope Honoree Family'' during that year's gala, where 400 \nguests raised more than $300,000 for JDRF. Evan was most proud of the \nfact that his own school and classmates donated money to fund a cure to \nhelp him.\n  When he's not advocating for JDRF, Evan enjoys the outdoors. He is an \navid fisherman, rifleman and marksman. He also enjoys flag football, \nbasketball and track.\n  Evan is an inspiration to his family, friends and the entire \ncommunity in New Mexico. He has taken on a major challenge in the \nbattle against Type 1 Juvenile Diabetes. I am confident we can find a \ncure as long as we invest in research. And I have no doubt Evan will \nensure that those investments continue.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Ms. MICHELLE LUJAN GRISHAM of New Mexico", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 3}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "180", "extension": true, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "E1518", "wkday": "Monday", "day": "6", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "HONORING EVAN CLARK", "id": "CREC-2017-11-06-pt1-PgE1518", "title": "HONORING EVAN CLARK"}
