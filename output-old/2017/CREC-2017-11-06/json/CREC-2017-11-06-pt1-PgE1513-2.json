Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Bob Williams and \nthe non-profit animal rescue and counseling center he founded as Ranch \nHands Rescue in Argyle, Texas.\n   Founded in 2008, Ranch Hands Rescue came to life as an outcome of a \nyear-long recovery from a debilitating stroke Bob had suffered. With \nhis background as a Motorola executive and a challenging recovery \nprocess, Bob was inspired with the recognition of the need for rescuing \nanimals that would otherwise be euthanized. Rescuing the worst-of-the \nworst farm animal abuse and neglect cases, Ranch Hands Rescue was \ninitially envisioned as a place that would provide a loving, caring and \nsafe sanctuary to the animals that cannot be adopted due to special \ncare needs.\n   Through his own experience with the rescued animals, Bob realized \nthe therapeutic impact they could also have on mental health. In 2010 \nhe started the Ranch Hands Rescue Equine and Animal Assisted Couseling \n(EEAC) program. Through the work of animal partners and Licensed \nProfessional Counselors, Ranch Hands Rescue provides hope and healing \nfor children, women, veterans and others suffering from painful mental \nhealth symptoms brought on by sexual assault, physical abuse, domestic \nviolence, and other traumatic life experiences. In relating with the \ntrauma experienced by the rescued animals at Ranch Hands Rescue, \nclients of the non-profit from across the entire Dallas/Ft Worth \nmetroplex benefit from the unique trauma-informed animal assisted \npsychotherapy provided by highly-trained Licensed Professional \nCounselors.\n   Thanks to the commitment and ongoing passion for rescuing abused and \nneglected farm animals that would otherwise be considered ``throw \naways,'' Ranch Hands Rescue is ``animals helping people and people \nhelping animals'' to provide a special sanctuary for healing in the \nheart of Texas 26th Congressional District.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. BURGESS", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 3}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "180", "extension": true, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "E1513", "wkday": "Monday", "day": "6", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "IN RECOGNITION OF BOB WILLIAMS AND RANCH HANDS RESCUE", "id": "CREC-2017-11-06-pt1-PgE1513-2", "title": "IN RECOGNITION OF BOB WILLIAMS AND RANCH HANDS RESCUE"}
