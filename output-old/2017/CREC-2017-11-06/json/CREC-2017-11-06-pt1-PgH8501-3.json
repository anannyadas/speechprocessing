Mr. Speaker, I first want to say, ladies and gentlemen \nwho are here, thank you for being here. I am from Dallas, Texas, and I \nstand in sorrow for my fellow Texans and the country, for those from \nSutherland Springs, Texas, outside of San Antonio, who suffered the \nmass shooting of this weekend.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today also to highlight an issue that is \nimpacting first-time home buyers in America. Over the past 8 years, the \nDepartment of Justice has penalized many mortgage lenders who \nparticipated in the Federal Housing Administration's mortgage insurance \nprogram, a program that provides access to mortgages for some of \nAmerica's first-time home buyers.\n  Unfortunately, the Department of Justice still continues, even today, \nto use the False Claims Act to impose penalties on mortgage lenders, \nmany of whom were guilty of only material deficiencies in the loan \napplications, minor issues that, years later, people came back and \ntried to find a mistake so that they could pin the tail, pin a fine on \nsome mortgage lender.\n  My colleagues and I have objected to these actions by the Department \nof Justice because many of the shortcomings in these loan applications \nwere never intended as efforts to defraud anyone, but merely technical \noversights, perhaps facts that might have not been completely known at \nthe time of the loan application.\n  Many long-time mortgage lenders have exited this program because they \ncannot risk opening themselves to the penalties that have been imposed, \nI think, unwisely, by the Department of Justice for mere technical \nshortcomings of these loans.\n  So I have been a part of Members who are asking the Department of \nJustice to impose a moratorium to review what they are doing on the use \nof the False Claims Act to pursue such violations until the FHA can \ncomplete its own taxonomy, which is a set of standards that would \nimpose penalties commensurate with the severity of the offense.\n  Mr. Speaker, I, once again, would ask the American people for their \nexpress blessings upon those who gave their life this weekend in Texas.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. SESSIONS", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "180", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H8501", "wkday": "Monday", "day": "6", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "PENALTIES IMPOSED ON MORTGAGE LENDERS", "id": "CREC-2017-11-06-pt1-PgH8501-3", "title": "PENALTIES IMPOSED ON MORTGAGE LENDERS"}
