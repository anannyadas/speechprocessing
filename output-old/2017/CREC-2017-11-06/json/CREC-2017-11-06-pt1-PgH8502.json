In accordance with this provision, I have \nsent to the Federal Register for publication the enclosed notice \nstating that the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13712 \nof November 22, 2015, with respect to the situation in Burundi, is to \ncontinue in effect beyond November 22, 2017.\n  The situation in Burundi, which has been marked by killing and other \nviolence against civilians, unrest, the incitement of violence, and \nsignificant political repression, and which threatens the peace, \nsecurity, and stability of Burundi and the region, continues to pose an \nunusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign \npolicy of the United States. For this reason, I have determined that it \nis necessary to continue the national emergency declared in Executive \nOrder 13712 with respect to the situation in Burundi.\n                                                     Donald J.
