Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a true community \nservant and long-time pillar of the Riverdale Community Center, Ms. \nKathleen Gilson. Kathleen has worked at RCC since 1982, rising through \nthe ranks from Administrative Assistant all the way up to Executive \nDirector. She has done it all at RCC and this year, after 35 years of \nservice to her community, she is celebrating her retirement.\n  In 1985, three years into her career at RCC, Kathleen became the \nFiscal Officer and the Director of Finance and Program Operations by \n1997. Then, in 2004, she became the Center's Executive Director. During \nher tenure as the Executive Director, RCC programs and budgets have \ntripled, serving over 1,000 people of all ages each year in their free \nyouth programs and Adult and Youth Education Center. Kathleen has \noverseen an RCC after school program that has become one of the most \nsuccessful free programs in New York City--receiving ``Excellent'' \nratings from all funders and identified as ``Exemplary.'' Kathleen was \nalso quite active outside her work life. She served on her local school \nboard for 13 years, eight as the president, and is currently president \nof her homeowners' association.\n  Of course, Kathleen's true passion is her family. She is happily \nmarried with three children, and two grandchildren. She currently lives \nin Orange County, though she is a former Bronxite herself.\n  Kathleen Gilson has been instrumental to the success of RCC, and its \namazing growth can be directly linked to her efforts, in addition to \nthe efforts of her team. I want to congratulate Kathleen on her decades \nof service and thank her for all the incredible work she has done for \nRiverdale residents. I hope she enjoys a well-earned retirement.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. ENGEL", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 3}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "180", "extension": true, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "E1510", "wkday": "Monday", "day": "6", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "HONORING KATHLEEN GILSON", "id": "CREC-2017-11-06-pt1-PgE1510-2", "title": "HONORING KATHLEEN GILSON"}
