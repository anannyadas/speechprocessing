Mr. Speaker, the lives of over 300,000 legal \nimmigrants are at stake. Central Americans and Haitians, many of whom \nare my constituents, could be facing deportation if their temporary \nprotected status, known as TPS, were to end. This vital program, signed \ninto law by President George Herbert Walker Bush, has allowed \nindividuals fleeing instability and chaos in their home countries to \nlegally live and work here in the United States.\n  Reports indicate that the administration is considering eliminating \nTPS for these populations, a decision that will have negative \nhumanitarian, economic, and national security concerns, and that could \nundermine U.S. investment in the region.\n  Mr. Speaker, as a longtime supporter of TPS, I urge the \nadministration to continue to extend this program and provide a safe \nhaven for Central Americans and Haitians unable to securely return to \ntheir home countries. My heart aches at the thought of massive \ndeportations of good, hardworking people from my hometown.\n  Mr. Speaker, TPS beneficiaries are important and integral members of \nour community, and it would be a mistake to turn our backs on them.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "180", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H8511", "wkday": "Monday", "day": "6", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "EXTENDING TEMPORARY PROTECTED STATUS FOR CENTRAL AMERICANS AND HAITIANS", "id": "CREC-2017-11-06-pt1-PgH8511-4", "title": null}
