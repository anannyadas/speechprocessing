Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Keiser University on \nthe commemoration of their 40th anniversary, which they will celebrate \non November 10, 2017.\n  Keiser University was founded in 1977 by Dr. Arthur Keiser and his \nmother Mrs. Evelyn Keiser, in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. By establishing \nKeiser University, Dr. Keiser and Evelyn sought to provide individuals \nthe necessary educational tools for successfully navigating their \nchosen careers.\n  Over the past 40 years, Keiser University has been a shining example \nof what one can achieve through hard work and dedication. It has grown \nto become the third largest not-for-profit university in Florida, \nbolstering 66,000 alumni, over 100 degree granting programs, and 18 \ncampuses across the state. Keiser University has even stretched beyond \nU.S. borders, establishing campuses abroad in Nicaragua, Moldova, and \nChina.\n  Throughout my tenure in Congress, I have watched Keiser University \ngrow and expand its reach. Today, it has an annual economic impact of \napproximately $3 billion in Florida, while benefiting our residents \nwith over 30,000 direct and indirect jobs each year.\n  Keiser University's philosophy of putting students first and treating \nthem as individuals is to be commended. Their diverse student body \nincludes veterans, first-generation students, parents, caregivers, and \nstudents who have already joined the workforce. Keiser University \nprovides the skills necessary for students to be successful within our \nglobal economy, while maintaining flexibility through an impressive \nonline curriculum, which allows non-traditional students the ability to \naccess the quality education they rightly deserve.\n  Mr. Speaker, I want to commend Keiser University's co-founders and \nfamily, Dr. Arthur Keiser, his mother Mrs. Evelyn Keiser, and Ms. \nBelinda Keiser, and the independent Keiser University Board of \nTrustees, for their enduring commitment to providing students with a \nsuperior education. Over the past 40 years, Keiser University has \nproven itself to be a home for quality higher education, and a source \nof great pride to the people of Florida. I am truly honored to \nrepresent Keiser University in my Congressional district, and wish them \nmany years of continued success.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. HASTINGS", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 3}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "180", "extension": true, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "E1511", "wkday": "Monday", "day": "6", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "CELEBRATING KEISER UNIVERSITY'S 40TH ANNIVERSARY", "id": "CREC-2017-11-06-pt1-PgE1511-5", "title": "CELEBRATING KEISER UNIVERSITY'S 40TH ANNIVERSARY"}
