Mr. Speaker, I rise today to discuss H.R. 3562 and ask \nmy colleagues to join me in supporting this bipartisan, commonsense \nlegislation to improve our services for those who have ``borne the \nbattle\": America's disabled veterans.\n  Currently, if a disabled veteran in VA's Vocational Rehabilitation \nand Employment program needs adaptations made to their home due to the \nlimitations of their disability, then it is their vocational \nrehabilitation counselor, someone who has no experience or training in \nhome construction, who makes such arrangements for these adaptations.\n  In addition to the lack of core competency in home adaptations, these \ncounselors have experienced a significant and steady rise in their job \ncounseling caseloads, so their focusing on this home construction takes \naway from their primary function as a vocational counselor. This has \nresulted in inefficiencies for disabled veterans who now have to wait \nin line, and it is costing taxpayers more money.\n  While these are master's degree-level counselors who provide great \nservices to our veterans every single day, they do not have the \nexpertise to understand how to build a wheelchair ramp, affix a grab \nbar to a wall, or implement other home adaptations. This bill would \nsimply transfer these responsibility's to VA's Specially Adapted \nHousing program, where they deal with these kinds of construction \nprojects every day.\n  This change is needed. It will save the taxpayers money, and, most \nimportantly, it will help our disabled veterans immensely by ensuring \nthat they have the right people on the job to address their service-\nconnected disabilities in a timely fashion.\n  Mr. Speaker, as we head into Veterans Day this upcoming weekend, I \njust want to take a moment of personal privilege and say what an honor \nit has been to serve on the VA Committee and chair the Subcommittee on \nEconomic Opportunity, and I want to thank, especially, the chairman for \nthat opportunity. It is humbling to know that in some small way I can \ndo my part on behalf of the people of west Texas to serve those who put \ntheir lives on the line for all of us.\n  Veterans represent the very best of what this country was built on: \nservice before self. I say this because, at a time when our country's \nculture and political environment seems so divided, the one thing that \ncontinues to bring us together as Americans is our servicemembers and \nveterans.\n  When they raised their right hand and swore an oath to defend their \nfellow citizens, they did not care if we were from a red State or a \nblue State, Republican or Democrat. They did it for love of country and \nto protect not only their family and friends, but also the stranger \nwhom they will never meet.\n  That is why I am also very proud that, when we consider veterans \nlegislation as we are doing today and tomorrow, we are doing the two \nmost important things expected by all Americans: working together to \nsolve problems, and delivering on our promise to the American people. I \nbelieve that the cumulative effect of commonsense measures such as the \nbill that we are considering today are helping to deliver on those \npromises.\n  I want to thank Chairman Roe, again, and also House leadership on \nboth sides for helping us bring this bill through our committee and to \nthe floor.\n  Mr. Speaker, as chairman of the Subcommittee on Economic Opportunity, \nI would be remiss if I didn't also thank the leadership of my ranking \nmember, friend, and fellow west Texan, Mr. Beto O'Rourke, in getting \nthis bill introduced and to where it is today.\n  I know that our fellow Americans would strongly agree with me that \nour veterans, especially our disabled veterans, deserve the very best \nservices their country can provide, and this bill is another step \ntowards doing just that.

Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, H.R. 3562 requires the Department of Veterans Affairs to \nprovide funding for home adaptations for severely disabled veterans \nwithin the Vocational, Rehabilitation, and Employment, or VR&E, \nprogram.\n  Currently, VA provides severely disabled veterans assistance to lead \na more independent life through the VR&E program, which can include \nhelp with adaptive housing. However, as their name suggests, VR&E \ncounselors are primarily trained to provide vocational and employment \nassistance, and they do not necessarily have the expertise to provide \nthe best guidance on adaptive housing.\n  The agents and contractors who are part of VA's Specially Adaptive \nHousing program, however, do have this expertise. The SAH program is \nspecifically geared towards helping severely disabled veterans with \nadapting their homes to be equipped for independent living.\n  Therefore, in order to better serve severely disabled veterans, this \nbill authorizes the SAH program to provide assistance to home \nadaptations for\n\n\nVR&E-eligible veterans. The amount of assistance would be capped at the \nsame level of funding that is currently provided to SAH-eligible \nveterans.\n\n  This is a solution that puts the right VA employee in charge of \nassisting a disabled veteran to adapt their home. This will also reduce \nthe workload on VR&E counselors, allowing them to spend more time \nhelping veterans with employment services.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge the passage of this bill, and I reserve the \nbalance of my time.", "turn": 3, "speaker": "Mr. TAKANO", "itemno": 11}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "R000582", "text": "  Mr. ROE of Tennessee.
