Mr. Speaker, after the near disaster we had in Butte \nCounty, near Oroville, with the breakage of the spillway at Oroville \nDam, I am very happy to congratulate the folks of Kiewit Construction, \nand so many others, on their reconstruction of the spillway, phase 1. \nWe will have a working, viable spillway for this upcoming rainy season, \nif needed, due to the intense and incredible efforts to rebuild that \nproject.\n  If you had seen the size of, basically, the canyon that was carved \nout where the old spillway stood from having to release water to keep \nthe lake level, in February, at a safe level, you would see how amazing \nit was, the work that was done in order to rebuild that spillway in its \ncurrent phase. It will be able to handle 100,000 CFS and be able to \nkeep the lake stable for the upcoming year.\n  However, we do need to have balance in the process and have that lake \nbe able to store enough water for California's needs this coming year, \nbecause we will still have those needs in 2018, and not drain the lake \nall the way because of an overcautious thought process.\n  So congratulations on a viable lake that works for all.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. LaMALFA", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "180", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H8513", "wkday": "Monday", "day": "6", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "RECONSTRUCTION OF THE SPILLWAY AT THE OROVILLE DAM", "id": "CREC-2017-11-06-pt1-PgH8513-2", "title": "RECONSTRUCTION OF THE SPILLWAY AT THE OROVILLE DAM"}
