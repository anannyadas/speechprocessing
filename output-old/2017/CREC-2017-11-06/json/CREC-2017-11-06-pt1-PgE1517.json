Mr. Speaker, I rise today \nto recognize the life of a woman who was dedicated to public service \nand advocacy. Susan Popovich focused on the needs of her community \nthroughout her life and was a source of hope for many in Santa Fe, New \nMexico.\n  Susan began her career as an educator in Pennsylvania and taught in \nArizona for 14 years. After teaching, she continued her career in \neducation by working for the National Education Association, where she \nworked for 23 years in several roles. She started out as an organizer \nand moved into the position of Regional Executive Director. She was \nalso a Negotiations and Organizational Development Specialist with the \nNEA. Eventually, political activism became an important part of her \nlife.\n  Susan participated in political campaigns and completed hundreds of \nhours canvassing. In doing so, she became a friend to many in Santa Fe \nand deeply understood hardships the community faced.\n  I also admire Susan for her work as a caregiver for her mother and \nbrother through the end of their lives. She was selfless and giving, \nproven by the work she dedicated herself to and her care for others.\n  Her life will continue to inspire educators, activists, and \npoliticians. A life led by such a devoted woman will be remembered and \nfelt in the community for many years to come.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Ms. MICHELLE LUJAN GRISHAM of New Mexico", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 3}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "180", "extension": true, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "E1517", "wkday": "Monday", "day": "6", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "HONORING SUSAN POPOVICH", "id": "CREC-2017-11-06-pt1-PgE1517", "title": "HONORING SUSAN POPOVICH"}
