Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor the life and \nlegacy of a dynamic political activist, Burnetta Sloss-Tanner, who \npassed away on October 23, 2017. She was my confidant, drill \ninstructor, surrogate, auntie, war time general and tireless \ncampaigner. She was a dear friend to me and my family and a friend to \nHoosiers everywhere, especially the powerless.\n  ``Ms. Burnetta'', known for her trademark sequined hat, was a pillar \nin Democratic politics throughout Indianapolis. She long served as the \n4th Ward Chair for the Marion County Democratic Party and had a deep \nlove for grassroots politics, holding monthly meetings in her home to \ntrain candidates, elected officials, and volunteers on strategy and \nmobilizing our community. Without Ms. Burnetta, neither me, nor my \ngrandmother, Congresswoman Julia Carson, would have been elected to \nCongress. I am certain many local and state elected officials can \ncredit her for their successes as well.\n  Not only was Ms. Burnetta a legend in political circles, she was also \nbeloved by the community. She worked with the Indiana Civil Rights \nCommission, the Center Township Trustee's office, and countless other \norganizations.\n  She was a woman of great faith with a passion for gospel music. She \nstudied under several notable gospel artists, mentored countless \nothers, and was a founding member and director of the award winning \nJordan-Aires Gospel Choir. She will always be remembered for her work \nas a gospel radio personality, hosting The Heartbeat of Good Gospel \nMusic on WTLC. Her passion for, and contributions to, gospel music \nearned her the title of ``The First Lady of Gospel Music'' of \nIndianapolis.\n  Ms. Burnetta served as a source of change, strength and faith for so \nmany, leaving a lasting impression on generations to come. I am blessed \nto have had the opportunity to know her.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in honoring our beloved Burnetta \nSloss-Tanner for her remarkable service to the City of Indianapolis, \nthe State of Indiana, and our nation.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. CARSON of Indiana", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 3}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "180", "extension": true, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "E1514", "wkday": "Monday", "day": "6", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "IN RECOGNITION OF BURNETTA SLOSS-TANNER", "id": "CREC-2017-11-06-pt1-PgE1514-3", "title": "IN RECOGNITION OF BURNETTA SLOSS-TANNER"}
