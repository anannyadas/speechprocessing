Mr. Speaker, I rise today to extend my congratulations to \nLois Herbst, Patrick and Paul Hladky, and Maury Brown on being inducted \ninto the Wyoming Business Hall of Fame.\n  The Wyoming Business Hall of Fame was founded in 2013 by the \nUniversity of Wyoming's College of Business, the Wyoming Business \nAlliance/Wyoming Heritage Foundation, and the Wyoming Business Council. \nIt recognizes those who go above and beyond for their businesses and \ntheir communities. Lois, Patrick, Paul, and Maury each have made an \nexcellent example for their families, friends, and residents across the \nstate through their hard work, leadership, and tenacity.\n  This year's inductees have been successful in their businesses and \nhave become integral parts of their communities:\n  Throughout her impressive career, Lois Herbst has helped run her \nfamily's ranch, the Herbst Lazy TY Ranch LLP, and has served on many \nstate agriculture boards. She was inducted into the Wyoming Agriculture \nHall of Fame in 1999, and has served as the president of the Wyoming \nStock Growers Association, the first and only woman to hold that post, \nas well as on the Wyoming State Grazing Board.\n  Since taking over operation of their father's business, Cyclone \nDrilling, Patrick and Paul Hladky have expanded it into a business that \nemploys more than 700 people, operating throughout the Rockies. They \nare active in their community and believe that economic development \ndepends on an educated workforce. This belief has driven their \ncommitment to supporting educational opportunities throughout Gillette \nand the state.\n  Maury Brown is the owner of two businesses in Wyoming: Town and \nCountry Supermarket Liquors, and Maurice Brown Exploration. He is \ndedicated to philanthropy, receiving multiple local awards, including \nthe 2013 Greater Cheyenne Chamber of Commerce's Person of the Year \naward. I would like to thank Lois, Patrick, Paul, and Maury for their \ncontinued dedication and significant contributions to Wyoming's economy \nand community.\n  Again, Mr. Speaker, I would like to extend my congratulations to the \n2017 inductees to the Wyoming Business Hall of Fame. Lois, Patrick, \nPaul, and Maury deserve to be extremely proud of this accomplishment.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Ms. CHENEY", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 3}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "180", "extension": true, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "E1517", "wkday": "Monday", "day": "6", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "IN HONOR OF THE 2017 INDUCTEES TO THE WYOMING BUSINESS HALL OF FAME", "id": "CREC-2017-11-06-pt1-PgE1517-2", "title": "IN HONOR OF THE 2017 INDUCTEES TO THE WYOMING BUSINESS HALL OF FAME"}
