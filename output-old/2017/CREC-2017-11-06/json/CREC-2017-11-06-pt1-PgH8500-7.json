Mr. Speaker, our thoughts and prayers \nare with all those who are grieving at the First Baptist Church in \nSutherland Springs, Texas.\n  This morning, I was grateful to join the Israeli-American Council at \ntheir fourth National Council Conference to celebrate our ally, Israel, \nand the special relationship we have formed over many years with the \npeople of Israel. It was meaningful to be greeted by National Chairman \nAdam Milstein, and to discuss issues with Dr. Miriam and Sheldon \nAdelson.\n  The Israeli-American Council is the fastest growing Jewish-American \norganization in the United States, and works every day to foster a \nstrong and positive relationship between the United States and the \nIsraeli people.\n  I am grateful for their many accomplishments, and I wish them \ncontinued success in strengthening the American-Israeli relationship in \nthe years to come through mutual economic success, creating jobs while \npromoting peace through strength with military cooperation.\n  South Carolina has always appreciated its Jewish heritage as home of \nthe largest Jewish population of any State at the time of the American \nRevolution.\n  In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget \nSeptember the 11th in the global war on terrorism.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. WILSON of South Carolina", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "180", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H8500", "wkday": "Monday", "day": "6", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "ISRAELI-AMERICAN COUNCIL", "id": "CREC-2017-11-06-pt1-PgH8500-7", "title": "ISRAELI-AMERICAN COUNCIL"}
