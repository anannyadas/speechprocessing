Mr. Speaker, five years ago, Colorado voters chose to \namend the State Constitution to legalize the cultivation, sale, and \npersonal use of marijuana for people 21 years of age or older. Today, \nColorado is home to a growing marijuana economy which has created \n23,000 jobs in the industry and in excess of $200 million in tax \nrevenue which helps to fund our schools.\n  States like Colorado, and now dozens of other states, have proven \nthat allowing responsible adults to legally purchase marijuana, gives \nmoney to classrooms, not cartels; creates jobs, not addicts; and boosts \nour economy, not our prison population.\n  Colorado ought to be an example for the nation, and it is past time \nwe lift the federal prohibition on marijuana. That's why I'm proud to \nsponsor the Regulate Marijuana Like Alcohol Act, which allows each \nstate to decide for itself whether to legalize marijuana. In addition, \nI will continue to attempt to restrict the Department of Justice from \nenforcing federal marijuana laws in states where it is legal.\n  Earlier in 2017, I launched the bipartisan Cannabis Caucus with Rep. \nEarl Blumenauer, Rep. Dana Rohrabacher, and Rep. Don Young. The caucus \nwill serve as an important working group to discuss marijuana policy \nand its future, moving Congress into the 21st century on drug policy.\n  I applaud the pioneers of the cannabis industry in Colorado and \nnationwide. The perseverance and hard work to create a new model of \nlegalization is commendable.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. POLIS", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 3}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "180", "extension": true, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "E1516", "wkday": "Monday", "day": "6", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "LEGALIZATION OF MARIJUANA", "id": "CREC-2017-11-06-pt1-PgE1516-2", "title": "LEGALIZATION OF MARIJUANA"}
