Mr. President, today I wish to pay tribute to an \nAlabamian who has spent more than two decades in public service, Peggi \nHanrahan.\n  Many people in Washington, DC, know Peggi as the executive assistant \nand gatekeeper to the former Alabama Senator, Jeff Sessions, who is now \nthe U.S. Attorney General. For more than 20 years, Jeff Sessions has \nbeen a strong leader on the issues of legal reform and immigration. In \norder to speak with Jeff Sessions on any issue, you had to go through \nPeggi.\n  Peggi has earned praise from the countless people she has worked \nalongside throughout the years. Here are a few statements from her \nformer colleagues.\n  Attorney General Sessions stated:\n\n       Peggi has been at the center of everything we have \n     accomplished in public service. She loves America and its \n     ideals, is smart, decisive, loyal, and a total professional. \n     She speaks up for the high principles she believes in, and \n     for two decades has been the key point of contact in our \n     office for thousands of Alabamians and Americans all over the \n     Country. She has provided invaluable service to me, the \n     Nation, and the so many who she trained and mentored. Though \n     we will miss her marvelous contributions, we wish her all the \n     best as she and Kevin embark on this next adventure.\n\n  Kate Hollis, then-Senator Sessions' former scheduler, said the \nfollowing:\n\n       For 14 years I had the pleasure of working side by side \n     with Peggi for Senator Jeff Sessions. We were a great team \n     and became great friends during that time. I can attest that \n     she was one of the hardest working people in the United \n     States Senate who always went the extra mile to assist \n     Senator Sessions and our staff, as well as our constituents \n     from the great State of Alabama.\n\n  Pete Landrum, former military legislative assistant under former \nSenator Sessions, stated:\n\n       Peggi Hanrahan is a great colleague and friend. She is a \n     person that can be depended on when things are good or when \n     things are bad--it doesn't matter.\n\n  Danielle Cutrona, counselor to the Attorney General, said:\n\n       Peggi is an institution in our office. Her loyalty and \n     dedication to then-Senator, now Attorney General Sessions and \n     to his staff has been unwavering. I am grateful to have had \n     the opportunity to work with Peggi all these years and will \n     miss her tremendously.\n\n  Michael Brumas, former press secretary for Senator Sessions, said:\n\n       The phrase `best in the business' certainly applies to \n     Peggi Hanrahan, who served for more than two decades as Jeff \n     Sessions' executive assistant, first in the Senate and then \n     at the Department of Justice. In many ways Peggi was the \n     backbone of the Senate office, with a knack for solving those \n     administrative dilemmas that always crop up in a busy Senate \n     office as well making sure the senator stuck to his active \n     schedule--not always an easy task.\n\n  Senator Sessions' first chief of staff in the Senate, Armand DeKyser, \nsaid the following:\n\n       From the earliest days of Senator Sessions' tenure when \n     Peggi began sitting just outside Jeff's transition office, \n     she never was more than 20 feet from his desk. She was THE \n     constant among all the many staff that worked for Senator and \n     now Attorney General Jeff Sessions. Her calm demeanor \n     combined with a wonderful work ethic are so very vital to the \n     successful operation of a complex staff operation. She was \n     composed, efficient and trustworthy on the most harried of \n     days--a presidential inauguration, a swearing-in, or even the \n     fateful 9/11 day. Even on a normal day--if there is ever one \n     of those--Peggi's demonstrated support both up and down the \n     ladder of responsibility was one of her best traits and one \n     most admired by all.\n\n  Alan Hanson, now Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General, said:\n\n       Peggi Hanrahan is a national treasure. She is both a \n     trusted confidante and an invaluable colleague. While she \n     will be sorely missed by all of us, her retirement is both \n     hard earned and well deserved.\n\n  Paige Hanson, a former Sessions staffer, said:\n\n       While I know the Attorney General will miss the benefit of \n     having Peggi around, we are truly happy for her and grateful \n     for her service and friendship.\n\n  Stephen Boyd, former communications director for Senator Sessions and \nnow Assistant Attorney General, said:\n\n       It is difficult to overstate the important role that Peggi \n     played for all those years in the Senate office. If things \n     got done, it was usually because Peggi made it happen. Her \n     service to then-Senator and now Attorney General Sessions, \n     the Senate, and to the people of Alabama has been tremendous. \n     She is one of many who asked not for recognition\n\n\n     or public appreciation, but only for the opportunity to serve \n     her country alongside a leader she respected. It was a \n     pleasure to work with her for many years, and I certainly \n     hope that she enjoys the retirement that she has clearly \n     earned.\n\n  Finally, Rick Dearborn, Senator Sessions' longtime chief of staff and \nnow White House Deputy Chief of Staff, said:\n\n       Peggi Hanrahan was an extraordinary member of Senator \n     Sessions' former Senate staff. She is part schoolmarm, part \n     drill sergeant, with a pinch of traffic cop and a spoonful of \n     soft marshmallows all rolled into one. Indispensable in the \n     Senator's office, Peggi made it all run. She organized the \n     Senator's office, our lives, his life, kept up with all our \n     constituents and friends back home, both with personal notes \n     she and the Senator would spend significant time on and \n     checkup calls. She'd place those calls with his good friends \n     back home, often early in the morning and after hours. She \n     was, along with Kate Hollis, the Senator's scheduler, the \n     glue that held us all together. It would have been impossible \n     to manage the Senator's office without her. She was my Senate \n     colleague, my teammate, and continues to be my very dear \n     friend. I wish her and her husband Kevin the absolute best as \n     they enter the next chapter of their lives, separate from the \n     two institutions they served so well, the Senate and the \n     House.\n\n  On behalf of the people of Alabama, I want to join all of those who \nare wishing Peggi and Kevin a very happy retirement.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. STRANGE", "itemno": 0}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 1}], "header": {"chamber": "Senate", "num": "180", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "S7013-S7014", "wkday": "Monday", "day": "6", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "TRIBUTE TO PEGGI HANRAHAN", "id": "CREC-2017-11-06-pt1-PgS7013-2", "title": "TRIBUTE TO PEGGI HANRAHAN"}
