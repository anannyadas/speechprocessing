Mr. Speaker, mass deportation of Temporary Protected \nStatus recipients today would disrupt our country and theirs.\n  More than 32,000 Salvadorans live in the District of Columbia metro \narea; and Salvadorans, at 200,000, are the largest group of TPS holders \nin the country today.\n  TPS designation requires the Attorney General to find ``extraordinary \nand temporary conditions preventing returning to the state in safety.''\n  The most recent influx of Salvadorans, one-third of them \nunaccompanied minors, shows that these conditions have been met for TPS \nholders and others. With the breakdown of civil society in Central \nAmerica today, forced return of anyone now would be inhumane.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Ms. NORTON", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "180", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H8500", "wkday": "Monday", "day": "6", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "MASS DEPORTATION WOULD DISRUPT OUR COUNTRY", "id": "CREC-2017-11-06-pt1-PgH8500-8", "title": "MASS DEPORTATION WOULD DISRUPT OUR COUNTRY"}
