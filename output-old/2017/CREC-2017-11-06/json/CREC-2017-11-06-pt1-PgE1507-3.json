Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the career of \nElaine Roberts, who is retiring from her service to the Ohio aviation \ncommunity this month.\n   Elaine has been a leader for Columbus, for Ohio, for the aviation \nindustry, and for women in leadership roles in the transportation \nindustry everywhere.\n   Fourteen years ago, Elaine was recruited to serve as the first ever \nCEO of a combined aviation authority--the passenger facility serving \nColumbus and Central Ohio, a dual-use freight/military facility outside \nColumbus, and a general aviation field.\n   Over the last decade and a half, she led all three with distinction \nand has been a catalyst for growth at Port Columbus, overseeing a major \nrenovation and life extension of the facility.\n   At Rickenbacker, our dual-use facility, she has worked with \ngovernment partners at the federal, state, and local levels, as well as \nthe private sector, to transform the area into one of the country's \nleading intermodal facilities.\n   International and domestic freight operations--served by rail, \nhighways, and international activation--help provide a livelihood to \n20,000 plus residents in our area.\n   Elaine has been an inspiration to her fellow executives in aviation \nand transportation, and the region as a whole. She was nominated and \nselected by the White House in 2015 as a ``Champion of Change'' for her \nwork at Rickenbacker.\n   Elaine will be missed in the region, but I join the entire Ohio \ncommunity in wishing her well.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. TIBERI", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 3}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "180", "extension": true, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "E1507", "wkday": "Monday", "day": "6", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "RECOGNIZING THE CAREER OF ELAINE ROBERTS", "id": "CREC-2017-11-06-pt1-PgE1507-3", "title": "RECOGNIZING THE CAREER OF ELAINE ROBERTS"}
