Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and \ncongratulate Pat Gregg of Council Bluffs, Iowa who recently retired \nfrom the Council Bluffs Fire Department after 25 years of service to \nhis community. Pat joined the Council Bluffs Fire Department on August \n31, 1992.\n  Council Bluffs Fire Chief Justin James said, ``Pat was one of the \nfirst firefighters I promoted to Captain when I became Chief, because \nhis patient care always went the extra mile.'' Pat served as a \nparamedic and firefighter during his career. Pat said he has seen many \nchanges in the Fire Department through the years but one thing that did \nnot change was that the men and women of the Fire Department are still \ndedicated to the community.\n  Mr. Speaker, Pat has made a difference by helping and serving others \nand it is with great pride that I recognize him today. I ask that my \ncolleagues in the United States House of Representatives join me in \ncongratulating him for this momentous occasion and in wishing him \nnothing but the best in his retirement.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. YOUNG of Iowa", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 3}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "180", "extension": true, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "E1513", "wkday": "Monday", "day": "6", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "TRIBUTE TO PAT GREGG", "id": "CREC-2017-11-06-pt1-PgE1513", "title": "TRIBUTE TO PAT GREGG"}
