Mr. Speaker, today I rise to recognize the 10 year \nanniversary of the Christian Life Center at First Baptist Church in \nFort Walton Beach, Florida. This 13,000 square foot center was built in \n2007 to serve as a community service outreach to residents in the Fort \nWalton Beach area. Any member of the community is welcomed to hold \nmembership at the Christian Life Center and take full advantage of the \nmultitude of resources they offer.\n  With approximately 200 members thus far, the center is able to host a \nwide array of sporting options and programs including Upwards Sporting \nProgram for children and the Special Olympics. In addition to sporting \nleagues the Christian Life Center offers over 15 exercise classes and \nprograms to members of the community.
