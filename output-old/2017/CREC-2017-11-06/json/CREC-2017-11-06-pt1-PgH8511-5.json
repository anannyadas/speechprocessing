Mr. Speaker, as Americans, we mourn for the lives lost in \nthe act of terrorism in New York last week. But New Yorkers are \nresilient. Violence will never break their spirit, and in the Northeast \ncorridor, business has continued as usual.\n  Sadly, there are folks who want to use last week's terrorist attack \nfor their cynical political reasons. They don't want to treat the root \ncauses of extremism, whether based on racial resentment, twisted \ninterpretations of religion, or political ideology. They do want to \nstoke fear in order to advance an anti-immigrant agenda, and they are \ntrying to blame the Diversity Visa program for the violence.\n  Americans are smarter than that.\n  The Diversity Visa program strengthens the Nation by allowing people \nfrom places like Africa and the Caribbean to lawfully immigrate to the \nUnited States, where they help fill major shortages in the workforce \nand drive positive changes in their communities. We need them, and they \nneed us.\n  Let's not sacrifice our national principles because of a trumped up \nfear of immigrants.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. PAYNE", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "180", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H8511-H8512", "wkday": "Monday", "day": "6", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "DIVERSITY VISAS", "id": "CREC-2017-11-06-pt1-PgH8511-5", "title": "DIVERSITY VISAS"}
