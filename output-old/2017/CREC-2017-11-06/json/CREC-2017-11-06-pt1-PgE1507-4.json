Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the memory of former \nShady Shores Mayor Olive Stephens. Mayor Stephens, who passed away on \nOctober 30 at the age of 101, was known for her commitment to her \nfamily, her neighbors, and the Shady Shores community. She was a \ndedicated public servant who helped Shady Shores grow from a small \nweekend fishing and camping spot to an incorporated city with a \npopulation of more than 2,800.\n   An East Texas native, Mayor Stephens and her late husband moved to \nShady Shores in 1956 and opened a general store. In 1963, Olive \nStephens began her public service career when she volunteered to serve \non the Town Council. After 10 years as a council member, she ran for \nhigher office, and in 1973 won a successful bid to serve as the first \nelected mayor of Shady Shores. Mayor Stephens served her community in \nthis capacity for almost 40 years until she retired from full time \npublic service at the age of 94.\n   A pioneer of local Texas politics, Olive Stephens left a legacy of \nlifelong commitment to public service. We will miss her leadership and \npassion for her Shady Shores community and all of Texas.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. BURGESS", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 3}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "180", "extension": true, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "E1507", "wkday": "Monday", "day": "6", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "IN MEMORY OF SHADY SHORES MAYOR OLIVE STEPHENS", "id": "CREC-2017-11-06-pt1-PgE1507-4", "title": "IN MEMORY OF SHADY SHORES MAYOR OLIVE STEPHENS"}
