Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentlewoman from the \nVirgin Islands (Ms. Plaskett) for leading this Special Order and for \nthe outstanding work that she has done as her island, the U.S. Virgin \nIslands, recovers from two devastating hurricanes.\n  Being from New Orleans, I understand what two twin hurricanes can do. \nHurricanes Katrina and Rita ravaged our city, our State, along with \nMississippi, Texas, and the Gulf Coast. To be very candid, the people \nof the Virgin Islands, unfortunately, are doing this too much on their \nown.\n  Part of what makes America exceptional, part of what makes us the \ngreatest country in the world is that when we find our citizens in a \nvulnerable position, through no fault of their own, we come in as a \ngovernment and we help. When you look at the Virgin Islands and the \nfact that the damage they have received is more than their capacity to \nrebuild, and it is through no fault of their own, it is Mother Nature. \nIt is an act of God.\n  Some would say it is global warming and climate change, but it \ndoesn't matter what caused it. What matters is the United States' \nresponse to how we fix it. So when we start talking about our response \nto the Virgin Islands, it is a great segue into Haiti and temporary \nprotective status.\n\n\n  It was that 2010 earthquake that rendered Haiti in a position where \nthey could no longer safely and adequately care for their citizens, and \nwe allowed them to have temporary protective status in the United \nStates. On May 24 of this year, the Department of Homeland Security \nredesignated Haiti for 6 months of temporary protective status rather \nthan 18 months that the Government of Haiti, Haiti experts from the \nUnited States, the Congressional Black Caucus, and others requested.\n  The fact is, the DHS designation didn't reflect any of the reality on \nthe ground. In fact, it ignored that there is great food scarcity, and \nit ignored the ongoing challenges posed by the unprecedented \nearthquake.\n  We sent a letter November 3 asking once again to fully extend Haiti's \nTPS designation for another 18 months. However, time and time again, \nunfortunately, it appears that this administration, through all of the \nrhetoric, has an inability to do right when right is needed, especially \nwhen we talk about vulnerable populations, especially when we talk \nabout immigrants. It is too easy for this administration to turn a \nblind eye and ignore real-life needs.\n  Now, there are some out there who could argue: Is this America's \nissue?\n  I would argue that it is absolutely America's issue.\n  First of all, not extending the TPS will have drastic consequences \nfor the United States' economy. That is why the U.S. Chamber of \nCommerce, national security experts, and the Catholic bishops have all \ncome out in support of extending this vital program, because they know \nthat these nations are in no condition to receive the 300,000 people \nthat will be returned to them.\n\n  They understand the public health crisis and the destabilization of \nthe new government. In El Salvador and Honduras, the return of 250,000 \npeople would strain government services and lead to job displacement in \ncountries besieged by violence, drug trafficking, and weak \ninstitutions.\n  So let me just clear it up for a lot of Americans sitting at home and \nasking: Well, why does this affect us?\n  Thirty percent of TPS recipients are homeowners in the United States. \nSo just think about the consequences of simultaneously dumping 60,000 \nmortgages on the U.S. housing market. Think about 13,000 mortgages in \nTexas, 5,000 mortgages in Florida, 4,100 in Virginia. The mass \ndeportation alone will cost the taxpayers of this country more than $3 \nbillion.\n  Oftentimes, we find ourselves in this place, in this body arguing \nabout the fiscal argument of things and talking about how it would \naffect our economy--which I just did--talking about how it would hurt \nthe U.S. market in foreclosures and mortgages, and we give all of these \nexamples of how this could bankrupt the United States.\n  The bigger concern we have, and that this administration should have, \nis that this country is on the fast track to moral bankruptcy because \nwe do not stand up when we are supposed to; we don't call out wrong \nwhen we see it; and, too often, we turn our backs to injustice. That is \nnot what this country is about. That is not what made this country \ngreat. So with that, I would just say that it is time for this country, \nthis Congress, this administration, to do what is right simply because \nit is the right thing to do.\n  It just so happens that the right thing to do this time has extreme \neconomic benefits that go along with it. Tonight, you are going to hear \nfrom a number of our remarkable Congressional Black Caucus members who \ndon't just advocate for Black people. We advocate for people all across \nthis country who are oftentimes voiceless, who can't afford lobbyists, \nwho don't influence government, but people who just wake up every day, \ngo to work, put food on their table, provide for their kids, and hope \nfor a better future for their families. They hope that their parents \ncan live out their lives with dignity and respect. They hope that their \nimmediate family--that they can provide for their kids, and their kids \ncan reach their wildest dreams.\n  That is the American Dream. That is what we fight for. It is such a \ngreat privilege to be the chair of that Caucus. You will see in the \nnext couple of seconds the talent and the passion of which this Caucus \nfights for, which is why I am so proud and humbled to lead this Caucus \nduring this Congress.", "turn": 6, "speaker": "Mr. RICHMOND", "itemno": 9}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "P000610", "text": "  Ms. PLASKETT.

Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentlewoman for yielding, \nand also for organizing us here tonight and every week on the issues \nthat are so important to this country. Her leadership, \nspecifically, for the Virgin Islands, is truly commendable, and just \nknow that we are doing everything we can do under her leadership to \nhelp her recover and rebuild.\n\n  Mr. Speaker, I just have to say to our chair of the Congressional \nBlack Caucus, Congressman Richmond, I have to thank him for his bold \nand his visionary leadership of the CBC.\n  First, let me just take a moment to offer my deepest condolences to \nthe family, friends, and community of those who lost loved ones in the \nsenseless act of gun violence in Texas, my home State. We mourn their \nloss, we pray for the recovery of those injured, and we say once again \nthat this House needs action on gun safety measures to save lives. Our \nthoughts and prayers are with them tonight.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise to discuss the urgent need to preserve temporary \nprotective status for immigrants fleeing famine, war, and violent \nconditions around the world, especially those countries from within the \nAfrican diaspora who account for 10 percent of all TPS beneficiaries.\n  Today, 440,000 individuals from 10 countries reside in the United \nStates under temporary protective status because, as a nation, we have \nkept our commitment to being a beacon of hope and security for those in \nneed.\n  The TPS program grants immigrants the right to lawfully remain in the \nUnited States for 6 to 18 months. This longstanding practice has been \nhonored for decades through Democratic and Republican administrations \nbecause, regardless of political affiliations as Americans, we have \nalways stood for protecting the value of human life.\n  Sadly, the Trump administration fails to grasp the lifesaving impact \nof this program.\n\n\n  Just last month, the administration announced that it would terminate \nthe TPS designation for Sudan, despite the ongoing humanitarian crisis \nin the region.\n  In the coming days and weeks, Mr. Speaker, the Trump administration, \nunfortunately, will decide the fate of TPS holders from vulnerable \ncountries including Honduras, Nicaragua, El Salvador, and Haiti. Let me \nbe clear: failure to renew TPS status would mean\n\n\ndeportation for over 300,000 individuals who are working and living in \nthe United States.\n  We also know that this issue disproportionately impacts immigrants \nfrom countries within the African diaspora. Take Haiti for example. \nAfter a devastating earthquake and horrific hurricane, there is an \nactive cholera outbreak and protracted food security crisis. Letting \nTPS expire for this country would send 50,000 people back to uncertain \nfates. An influx of people of this size would further destabilize a \nfragile recovery. That is why I joined my colleagues in sending a \nletter to the Department of Homeland Security calling for a full 18-\nmonth extension of Haiti's TPS designation.\n  In El Salvador and Honduras, the return of over 250,000 people would \nstrain government services and lead to job displacement in countries \nbesieged by violence, narcotics trafficking, and weak institutions.\n  Unfortunately, this week, Secretary Tillerson falsely claimed that \nconditions on the ground no longer warrant TPS designation for these \ncountries. How he came up with that, I have no idea. This is really a \nshame and a disgrace. That is why members of the Congressional Black \nCaucus are here tonight fighting for temporary protected status because \nwe cannot turn our backs on our brothers and sisters in their time of \nneed. TPS holders have families, they own businesses, and they \ncontribute to this country in countless ways.\n  At a time when devastating hurricanes and flooding ravages our \nneighbors in the Caribbean, the last thing that our government should \nbe doing is turning its back on TPS holders. It is not only TPS holders \nthat we are fighting for. We are also now recognizing, understanding, \nknowing, and making public--as everyone knows--that millions of \nundocumented youth are living in fear of deportation because this \nPresident and Republicans in Congress can't muster the courage to do \nwhat is right.\n  Our Nation has been and should continue to be a nation of immigrants. \nFrom TPS to DACA, deporting innocent young people who came to the \nUnited States to escape devastation and violence, or as a child, is not \nonly wrong, it is really cruel, and it is heartless. So that is why we \nwill continue to fight to protect undocumented youth as we work towards \ncomprehensive immigration reform once and for all.\n  Now we are going to say we are going to continue to fight to make \nsure temporary protective status is granted for the 300,000 immigrants. \nI want to thank Delegate Plaskett for helping us to, once again, raise \nour voices, educate the public, and stay woke.", "turn": 8, "speaker": "Ms. LEE", "itemno": 11}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "P000610", "text": "  Ms. PLASKETT.

Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from the \nU.S. Virgin Islands for her leadership on this matter, serving as co-\nchair for the Caribbean Caucus, and being an outspoken advocate and \nfighter on behalf of the people of the U.S. Virgin Islands who are \nstill reeling from the two hurricanes that wreaked havoc on the three \nislands of the U.S. Virgin Islands. I want to thank the gentlewoman for \norganizing us this evening and really moderating what we all have to \nsay here today.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my concern for the more than \n300,000 temporary protected status beneficiaries who are under attack \nfrom this administration.\n  Temporary protected status was signed into law with bipartisan \nsupport by President George H. W. Bush as part of the Immigration Act \nof 1990. Since then, it has been used in roughly equal numbers by \nDemocratic and Republican Presidents alike. This program is based on a \nsimple idea that we can all agree upon: the idea that it is immoral to \nsend someone back to a country suffering from famine, disease, war, or \ngovernmental collapse where they could reasonably expect to perish.\n  Today, instead, we, as a society, decided long ago as a humanitarian \ngesture to extend ourselves as a safe haven and to temporarily allow \nsuch people the ability to lawfully remain in the United States for up \nto 18 months at a time and seek gainful employment as conditions in \ntheir home countries would improve.\n\n  This is not citizenship, and this is not amnesty. Rather, it is a way \nof protecting human life while allowing eligible individuals from \nHaiti, Yemen, Honduras, Nicaragua, and numerous other countries across \nthe world to earn wages for themselves and their loved ones abroad. \nUnfortunately, this administration's antipathy toward immigrants--\nparticularly immigrants of color--has found its way to some of the most \nvulnerable amongst us and threatens the existence of this commonsense \nprogram rooted in human decency and respect for life.\n  This program of agreement is now being totally undermined with real \nlives hanging in the balance. For example, while it would seem obvious \nto extend Haiti's temporary protected status in light of the \ncatastrophic 2010 earthquake, subsequent cholera epidemic, food \ninsecurity crisis, and the damage inflicted by Hurricanes Matthew, \nIrma, and Maria, this administration only extended Haiti's status for 6 \nmonths in the month of May, while, at the same time, the administration \ninsinuated that Haitian TPS recipients were criminals.\n  The administration now appears ready to ignore the advice of Haiti \nexperts in the United States and the request of the Haitian Ambassador \nby forcing some 50,000 Haitians to subject themselves to life-\nthreatening conditions in Haiti. This would not just be tragic for \nthose forced to return, it would also be detrimental to Haiti's economy \nwhich benefits significantly from the hard-earned remittances that \nHaitian TPS beneficiaries send back to their loved ones. It is also no \nway to treat a neighbor that is located less than a 2-hour flight away \nfrom American soil, the most impoverished nation of the Western \nHemisphere. Indeed, such a decision would be cruel and unusual \npunishment.\n  For this reason, I have worked with Congressman Cedric Richmond, \nchair of the Congressional Black Caucus, and my colleagues of the \nCongressional Black Caucus in sending a letter to Acting DHS Secretary \nElaine Duke, signed by the entire Congressional Black Caucus, \nrequesting a full 18-month extension of Haiti's TPS status. I also \nasked that Acting Secretary Duke take the Haitian Ambassador up on his \ninvitation to visit Haiti and to see the conditions for herself.\n  However, Haiti is not the only country that clearly merits an \nextension. Nearly 60,000 Hondurans and Nicaraguans currently await news \nof their fate, as will thousands of other immigrants from Africa, Asia, \nand the Middle East.\n\n\n  While I hope that Acting Secretary Duke will do the right thing and \nmake an evidence-based decision in light of the human cost to her \nactions, our experience teaches us that we must also prepare for the \nworst.\n  Where this administration refuses to respect decades of bipartisan \nagreement, Congress must assert its constitutional powers and act to \nsafeguard human life and American interests. I, therefore, call upon my \ncongressional colleagues to come together and pass bipartisan \nlegislation that will protect the hundreds of thousands of TPS \nbeneficiaries from around the world--Black, brown, Asian and other--who \nare, at this moment, relying upon us for their very lives.\n  Although we live in times of great division, now is the moment to \ncome together and recommit to the basic values that unite us all. This \ncountry was founded upon the idea of human dignity, and TPS is yet \nanother test of whether we will be true to that idea or fall painfully \nshort. We must not fall short, but instead we must rise to the \noccasion.\n  Mr. Speaker, TPS is something that falls within our purview to \naddress. It is my sincere hope that we will address this impending \ncrisis.\n  When I think about Haitians who are living here, many who, at this \nstage, had children born in the United States, and many who are here \nduring the most productive time of their lives when they can work \nbecause of their strength, their ability, and their intellect, it would \nbe a travesty to begin separating families and to wrench from these \nindividuals the opportunity to add value to our civil society while \nundergirding the nation of their birth, the nation that many hope to \nreturn to at the appropriate time by summarily excusing them from our \ncivil society.\n  Having said that, I, too, stand with my colleagues to extend on \nbehalf of Chairman Richmond, the executive officers, and members of the \nCBC a heartfelt condolence in this season of bereavement to our dear \ncolleague, Congresswoman Eddie Bernice Johnson, on the loss of her \nsister.

Right now, her focus \nhas been on helping her country come to grips with the devastating \nhurricanes that have struck all the islands of the American Virgin \nIslands, and she has demonstrated great leadership in that endeavor.\n  Also, on the whole issue around TPS, Ms. Plaskett and Ms. Clarke have \nbeen our true leaders in the diaspora around these issues, whether it \nbe the Caribbean or back to the Continent of Africa. I just want to \nacknowledge their great work on all of these issues and also thank the \ngentlewoman for hosting tonight's Special Order hour on protecting TPS \nrecipients.\n  Before I start on the topic at hand, I would like to send my \ncondolences out to the loved ones of the 26 people tragically murdered \nand the 21 people injured in yesterday's mass shooting in Texas.\n  When will we realize that something must be done in this country?\n  I have to ask: How much blood must be shed before Congress acts on \ngun control?\n  It has been 10 years since Congress has passed a gun control law. \nSince then, more than 300,000 people have been killed by guns in this \ncountry. More than 100,000 of those deaths were homicides. The American \npeople deserve better--much better.\n  As the news cycle moves from one tragedy to another, we have not \nforgotten, and must not forget, that the citizens that Congresswoman \nStacey Plaskett and Congresswoman Jenniffer Gonzalez-Colon of Puerto \nRico represent are still recovering from this summer's hurricanes. \nThey, too, deserve swift action to help them recover from these \ndevastating storms.\n  That, Mr. Speaker, brings me to the topic of tonight's Special Order \nhour. I want to start by dispelling the myth that the temporary \nprotected status designation poses a threat to America's security. The \ntruth is that TPS holders are rigorously vetted before entering the \ncountry, and they go through stringent background checks before each \nTPS renewal.\n  Mr. Speaker, the TPS designation is a part of our national character, \nand it must be protected.\n  What do I mean by that?\n  We are a compassionate people, aren't we--a compassionate nation?\n  The Americans I know are proud to live in a country that is free and \nprosperous enough to extend a helping hand to those in need. The TPS \ndesignation does just that.\n  TPS is a helping hand that reaches out past our national borders to \nlift people out of the depths of despair brought on by natural \ndisaster, violence, or turmoil. Yet the administration is reportedly \nplanning to remove the TPS designation for nationals of several Latin \nAmerican and Caribbean countries. This is really bad news for the \nUnited States.\n  First, ending the TPS designation for nationals of Haiti, El \nSalvador, and Honduras will destabilize communities in the United \nStates proper. TPS holders own small businesses. They pay taxes. They \ntake out mortgages. They fill jobs that we rely on every day in \nconstruction; hospitality; restaurants; landscaping; and elder care, in \nparticular.\n  Ending TPS designations mean ripping people out of their communities \nand local economies. Businesses will shutter. Essential jobs, like \ndisaster cleanup, will go unfilled. The national economy will suffer a \n$164 billion loss in gross domestic product.\n  Without TPS holders from Haiti, El Salvador, and Honduras, New Jersey \nwill lose $864 million from its GDP. My State cannot handle that \nburden.\n  Second, ending TPS designations for Haiti, El Salvador, and Honduras \nwill tear apart families of color. Many TPS holders have lawfully lived \nin the United States for more than a decade. They have established \ntheir families here. They are parents to 270,000 U.S. citizens. In New \nJersey, 8,800 U.S. citizens were born to TPS holders from Haiti, El \nSalvador, and Honduras.\n  Forcing TPS holders to leave the country means forcing them to leave \ntheir families. Hundreds of thousands of U.S. citizens will have to say \ngood-bye to their parents and grandparents. People will be forced to \nreturn to countries that are still suffering from the problems that led \nthem to the TPS designation in the first place.\n  Third, removing the TPS designation for nationals from Haiti, El \nSalvador, and Honduras will threaten security throughout Latin America \nand the Caribbean. These small countries are still suffering from \ndisasters, public health crises, and political instability.\n  The sudden influx of 300,000 additional people has the potential to \ndestabilize national governments and threaten security throughout the \nregion.\n  Mr. Speaker, in 2015, 2016, and 2017, I led the effort to get the TPS \ndesignation for Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone. These countries were \nreeling from public health and infrastructure\n\n\nemergencies. They faced an existential threat from the Ebola virus, and \nthe American people lent a helping hand by giving them temporary \nprotected status. I have had no doubt that authorizing nationals from \nthose West African countries to enter the United States saved lives; no \ndoubt whatsoever.\n  Mr. Speaker, we must not abandon our national character to the \ncynical call of ``America first.'' The TPS designation does not weaken \nus. It strengthens us by showing the world that the United States is \nmorally worthy of its status as a superpower.\n  Rolling back the TPS program is bad policy, it is bad politics, and \nit is immoral.

I also worked with foster care \nchildren.\n  Mr. Speaker, you may know that I also spent over 20 years as a law \nenforcement officer. As such, the preservation of human life was my \nnumber one priority. Saving lives was first. But then we also wanted to \nimprove the quality of life for persons living and working in our \ncommunity.\n  Mr. Speaker, the quality of life matters also. That is what we are \nhere to talk about tonight as Members of Congress: improving the \nquality of life for families who desperately need our help.\n  Approximately 50,000 Haitians hold TPS status, and 32,500 of them \nlive in Florida. 18,800 U.S.-born children in Florida have Haitian \nparents who are TPS holders.\n  How did we get here, Mr. Speaker?\n  As you know, an earthquake--not planned, not expected--left thousands \ndead and resulted in the total collapse of Port-au-Prince's \ninfrastructure. A few years before the earthquake, I participated in a \nmission trip to Port-au-Prince, Haiti. We worked with children and \nfamilies from a local church in Port-au-Prince, Haiti. That church was \ntotally destroyed by the earthquake.\n  The earthquake displaced 1.5 million Haitians within their own \ncountry, destroyed more than 100,000 homes, and damaged nearly 200,000 \nmore. The number of schools that were destroyed in Port-au-Prince alone \nis unbelievable. Over 55,000 Haitians who lost their homes in the \nearthquake are still living in 31 camps for internally displaced \npersons, unable to leave.\n  We are here tonight to talk about improving the quality of life for \npersons, for families, who desperately need our help.\n\n\n  This crisis is not over. In April of this year, heavy rains caused \nflooding and landslides. According to the Haitian officials, an \nestimated 80 percent of spring harvest may have been destroyed.\n  This crisis is not over. Since September of 2016, damage from \nHurricane Matthew and recent rains have compounded food insecurity \nexperienced by an estimated 3.2 million people in Haiti, not to mention \nthe devastation caused by Irma and Hurricane Maria. Hurricane Matthew \nalso exacerbated the food insecurity crisis that already existed, \nplacing 2.4 million Haitians, 32 percent of the population, in the \ngrips of an acute food insecurity crisis.\n  Mr. Speaker, forcing the return of 50,000 people to Haiti would \ndisrupt any meaningful effort to recover. As you know, in May, the \nDepartment of Homeland Security redesignated Haiti for 6 months of \ntemporary protective status rather than the full 18 months requested by \nthe Government of Haiti. DHS' decision, obviously, did not reflect the \nreality on the ground.\n  Regardless of how you might feel about the policy, TPS holders are \nperhaps the most vetted, legally present, and work-authorized community \nin our country. They have submitted to numerous criminal background \nchecks every 18 months. Americans with temporary protective status are \nhardworking individuals who are contributing to our economy, our \ncommunities, and our industries. Just check the numbers.\n  Mr. Speaker, the only strategic and humane decision is to fully \nextend Haiti's TPS designation for 18 months by the November 23 \ndeadline.

Mr. Speaker, I thank Mrs. Demings so much for that \nheartfelt appeal to the better senses of us, to the better angels \nwithin us as Americans, but, also, just speaking practicably about what \nthis policy does not only for Haiti, but for us as Americans.\n  You know, you hear stories about most people, how this affects them. \nWe hear the larger numbers: 50,000 individuals from Haiti, 300,000 \nindividual groupings from all other countries. We found out, a report \njust came out, that Nicaragua will only have 12 additional months for \ntemporary protective status, while the conditions in Nicaragua have not \nchanged.\n  I heard a story about a woman, Joana Desir, one of the Haitians. On a \nrecent day in Manhattan, the 32-year-old home healthcare provider races \nin between patients. By midday, she has already helped transport one of \nher regular patients, a young girl with severe respiratory disease, to \nschool and visited two senior patients in their home. It is a hard job, \nbut she says it is rewarding.\n  ``Most of the immigrants that I know, they have a busy life like \nme,'' she says. ``I leave home like 5:45 a.m. and sometimes get home by \nlike 9 p.m.''\n  Joana came to the U.S. in 2018 and was still in the U.S. when a \npowerful\n\n\nearthquake struck Haiti in 2010. Hundreds of thousands were killed, and \nthe Obama administration granted Haitians temporary protective status. \nThey were shielded from deportation and given work permits.\n  Critics say the temporary program for Haiti and others where \ndisasters and wars took place decades ago has become permanent and \namounts to a backdoor immigration policy. However, what we need to \nunderstand is what is still going on in Haiti right now.\n  Why this also makes sense for us is that it is estimated by the think \ntank Inter-American Dialogue that all Haitians abroad this year--this \nyear alone, Mr. Speaker--will send home $2 billion in remittances to \nthat country. That is nearly equal to Haiti's annual operating budget, \nthat $2 billion. The money that the Haitians that are living in the \nUnited States and sending back home is keeping that economy afloat. \nWithout the money that the Haitians in the United States, in America, \nare providing, there would be a complete collapse in the country of \nHaiti, which would then create additional cataclysmic work that we, as \nAmericans, would need.\n  We talk about immigrants trying to come into this country. We talk \nabout the collapse of infrastructure, the collapse of an economy that \nwill happen if the Haitians who are still living here in the United \nStates under temporary protective status with jobs are caused to leave.\n  On May 24, the Department of Homeland Security redesignated Haiti for \n6 months of temporary protective status rather than the full 18 months. \nIt is important to understand that, because of that smaller amount of \ntime, Haitians still have to apply. It costs almost $2,000 to apply for \nan extension of a visa. These people are in flux as to whether or not \nthey should continue to apply.\n  In a letter sent on Friday, November 3, the Congressional Black \nCaucus urged the Department of Homeland Security once again to fully \nextend Haiti's TPS designation for 18 months by the November 23 \ndeadline in light of the aforementioned conditions in Haiti, as well as \nthe damage caused by Hurricanes Irma and Maria, which has exacerbated \nthese conditions.\n  Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record that letter from the \nCongressional Black Caucus for others to see.\n\n                                   Congressional Black Caucus,\n\n                                                 November 3, 2017.\n     Hon.

We write again to encourage \n     DHS to fully extend Haiti's TPS designation for 18 months by \n     the November 23 deadline in light of the clear conditions \n     that justify such continued treatment, including the damage \n     caused by Hurricanes Irma and Maria, which has exacerbated \n     these conditions.\n       As recently as October 4, 2017, the Haitian Ambassador to \n     the United States wrote to you to formally request a full 18-\n     month re-designation in light of the ongoing economic and \n     humanitarian conditions that Haiti's citizens face each day. \n     In that letter, the Ambassador explicitly stated that the \n     goal of this request was to allow Haiti to recover from the \n     effects of the earthquake, cholera epidemic, and Hurricanes \n     Matthew, Irma, and Maria so as to continue with Haiti's \n     recovery efforts and to become more independent of American \n     assistance in the long term. The Ambassador also graciously \n     invited you to visit Haiti and see such conditions for \n     yourself. A government does not undertake such action lightly \n     and this request should merit considerable weight.\n       A recent independent statutory analysis of Haiti's \n     qualification for TPS confirmed the validity of the \n     government's concerns, finding that the conditions that \n     justified Haiti's 2011 re-designation remain. The analysis \n     found that nearly 40,000 Haitians uprooted by the 2010 \n     earthquake are officially displaced and that many more likely \n     remain unofficially displaced in dangerously inadequate \n     shelters. The cholera epidemic that was tragically caused by \n     international efforts to aid Haiti in 2010 more than doubled \n     following Hurricane Matthew and is expected to directly \n     affect more than 30,000 people by the end of 2017. Hurricane \n     Matthew also exacerbated the food insecurity crisis in Haiti, \n     placing 2.4 million Haitians--22 percent of its population--\n     in the grips of an acute food insecurity crisis. Based on \n     these clear facts, the analysis rightfully concluded that it \n     is in the best interest of Haiti and the United States to re-\n     designate Haiti for another 18 months of TPS because it \n     continues to face extraordinary and temporary conditions \n     stemming from the 2010 earthquake and worsened by subsequent \n     events that justify such relief.\n       Despite these serious challenges, the Haitian government \n     has been working diligently for years to improve its economy, \n     public health conditions, and infrastructure in coordination \n     with the United States government and international \n     community. In order to accomplish this task, Haiti relies in \n     large part on remittances that its citizens receive from TPS \n     beneficiaries in the United States. Therefore, the negative \n     consequences of terminating Haiti's TPS designation would be \n     twofold. It would end essential remittances that \n     significantly contribute to Haiti's recovery while also \n     forcing the poorest republic in the Western Hemisphere to \n     absorb the cost of reintegrating thousands of citizens all at \n     once. Such actions could be catastrophic to Haiti's recovery \n     efforts and run counter to Congressional efforts to improve \n     American relations in the region through the recently-passed \n     United States-Caribbean Strategic Engagement Act (Public Law \n     114-291).\n       Finally, it is essential to note that Haitian TPS \n     beneficiaries directly contribute to the United States. They \n     pay taxes, spend money, contribute to Social Security and \n     Medicare, and help promote American prosperity in numerous \n     sectors, such as the restaurant and food service, \n     construction, and hospitality industries. About 30 percent of \n     TPS beneficiaries are homeowners, stimulating the real estate \n     industry and contributing to the local property tax base. \n     Also, one in nine TPS beneficiaries in the labor force is \n     self-employed, meaning they not only create jobs for \n     themselves, but likely create jobs for others. A recent \n     report found ``that the expiration of Haitian TPS would cost \n     America $2.8 billion over a decade in lost gross domestic \n     product.\n       For these reasons, we urge you in the strongest terms to \n     take advantage of the full amount of time granted by Congress \n     to study the conditions on the ground and reach the only \n     appropriate decision--a full 18-month re-designation of \n     Haiti's TPS designation.\n           Sincerely,\n         Cedric L.

Mr. Speaker, in that letter, which is signed by all of \nthe members of the Congressional Black Caucus, who are members in both \nthe Democratic as well as Republican caucus, Members in the House as \nwell as the Senate, we urge Secretary Duke that the Ambassador to Haiti \nhas explicitly stated that the goal of the request was to allow Haiti \nto recover from the effects of the earthquake, a cholera epidemic, and \nHurricanes Matthew, Irma, and Maria.\n  Matthew struck Haiti in 2016 of last year. Of course you are aware of \nIrma and Maria. We Americans, unbeknownst to ourselves and the work\n\n\nthat we have done, also exacerbated food insecurity in Haiti by placing \nindividuals, causing the cholera epidemic that is there. Unbeknownst to \nourselves, when we came there to give support to Haiti, we Americans \nbrought the cholera epidemic that is now ravaging Haiti and has taken \nabout 10,000 people.\n  Additionally, Hurricane Matthew exacerbated the food insecurity \ncrisis in Haiti, placing 2.4 million Haitians, 22 percent of the \npopulation, in the grips of an acute food security crisis.\n  I have many Haitians who are in my community in the U.S. Virgin \nIslands, and we count them as some of our hardest workers, and we \nrecognize the impact that sending so many of these people back would \nhave not only on the loss of jobs here and the work that those \nindividuals are doing in the United States, but on the economy of Haiti \nitself.\n  There is no infrastructure that will support the 50,000 people going \nback to Haiti at this time, and that economy will probably completely \ncollapse without the remittances that the Haitians who are living in \nthe United States would be able to bring to that country.\n  Therefore, the negative consequences of terminating Haiti's TPS \ndesignation would be twofold: such actions would be catastrophic to \nHaiti's recovery efforts and run counter to congressional efforts to \nimprove American relations in the region through the recently passed \nUnited States-Caribbean Strategic Engagement Act, Public Law 114-291.\n  So the 300,000 Honduran, Nicaraguan, Haitian, and Salvadoran \nimmigrants await a mass deportation decision on temporary protective \nstatus, and we are requesting--we are urging, Mr. Speaker--that this \nCongress would continue to urge the Department of Homeland Security, \nand use our own powers, to ensure the safety of those individuals, \nensure the safety of the stability of the economies of our near \nneighbors, of Honduras, Nicaragua, Haiti, and El Salvador, and urge the \nU.S. Department of Homeland Security for their protections not to \nexpire and not to put these people into difficult choices of returning \nto countries that still face many of the same extraordinary conditions \nthat led to the initial grant of TPS or remaining in the United States \nwithout lawful immigrant status.\n  We believe that this is the right thing to do, that this Congress \nwants to do the right thing, that the Trump administration's 2018 \nproposed budget cut, budget request to Congress, for example, proposes \nto reduce foreign aid to Latin America and the Caribbean to levels not \nseen since 2001. Because of that, the remittances of these individuals \nis even more important. Remittances from the United States to El \nSalvador equal $4 billion; Honduras, $3.3 billion; to Haiti, almost $2 \nbillion. Using GDP estimates from the World Bank, remittances make up \nmore than 15 percent of the GDP for El Salvador, Honduras, and Haiti.\n  Therefore, if we are going to reduce the budget in terms of foreign \naid to these countries, it is important that we do not allow the \ncollapse of these countries. It will not only bring economic collapse, \nbut we know it is very likely to bring political anarchy and political \ndisruption, as well, to countries that are instable as they are, \ncountries where we are looking to bring stable democratic governments. \nEnsuring that individuals are allowed to stay here in this country and \nprovide those remittances, provide the support that is necessary to \ngrow those economies, embed democratic ideals, will be most beneficial \nto us and to ensure the stability of the Western Hemisphere at this \ntime.\n  Mr. Speaker, this is an imperative that is important to this country, \nimperative to the United States, and we are grateful that we have had \nthis time to share this information with you, with the American people, \nwith this Congress. We are urging our colleagues, urging Members of \nthis Congress, to work with members of the Congressional Black Caucus, \nindividuals you have heard tonight, Mia Love, Cedric Richmond, Yvette \nClarke, Donald Payne, Val Demings, Barbara Lee, all the members of the \nCongressional Black Caucus and others who urge that this support be \nenacted not only by the Department of Homeland Security, but by this \nCongress.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.", "turn": 18, "speaker": "Ms. PLASKETT", "itemno": 22}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "J000032", "text": "  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, as a senior member of the House \nCommittees on the Judiciary and Homeland Security Committee, I rise \ntoday to express my strong objection to the announced intention by the \nTrump Administration not to extend Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for \nHaiti, Honduras, and El Salvador.\n  On May 24, 2017, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) re-\ndesignated Haiti for 6 months of Temporary Protected Status (TPS), \nrather than the full 18 months requested by the Government of Haiti, \nHaiti experts in the United States, and the Congressional Black Caucus, \namong others.\n  DHS' decision did not reflect the realities on the ground in Haiti, \nwhich include Haiti's food scarcity crisis, cholera epidemic, and the \nongoing challenges posed by the unprecedented 2010 earthquake.\n  In a letter sent this past Friday, November 3, 2017, the \nCongressional Black Caucus urged DHS, once again, to fully extend \nHaiti's TPS designation for 18 months by the November 23, 2017 deadline \nin light of the aforementioned conditions in Haiti, as well as the \nexarcerbated damage caused by Hurricanes Irma and Maria.\n  In a report published in October 2017, the highly regarded Global \nJustice Clinic concluded that conditions justifying Haiti's \nqualification for TPS in 2011 remain as acute today as they were then.\n  The study also found that 40,000 Haitians uprooted by the 2010 \nearthquake are officially displaced and that many more likely remain \nunofficially displaced in dangerously inadequate shelters.\n  The cholera epidemic that was tragically caused by international \nefforts to aid Haiti in 2010 more than doubled following Hurricane \nMatthew and is expected to directly affect more than 30,000 people by \nthe end of 2017.\n  Hurricane Matthew also exacerbated the food insecurity crisis in \nHaiti, placing 2.4 million Haitians--22 percent of its population--in \nthe grips of an acute food insecurity crisis.\n  The Haitian government has been working diligently for years to \nimprove its economy, public health conditions, and infrastructure in \ncoordination with the United States government and international \ncommunity.\n  In order to accomplish this task, Haiti relies in large part on \nremittances that its citizens receive from TPS beneficiaries in the \nUnited States.\n  Therefore, the negative consequences of terminating Haiti's TPS \ndesignation would be twofold.\n  It would end essential remittances that significantly contribute to \nHaiti's recovery while also forcing the poorest republic in the Western \nHemisphere to absorb the cost of reintegrating thousands of citizens \nall at once.\n  Such actions could be catastrophic to Haiti's recovery efforts and \nrun counter to Congressional efforts to improve American relations in \nthe region through the recently-passed United States-Caribbean \nStrategic Engagement Act (Public Law 114-291).\n  Finally, it is essential to note that Haitian TPS beneficiaries \ndirectly contribute to the United States.\n  They pay taxes, spend money, contribute to Social Security and \nMedicare, and help promote American prosperity in numerous sectors, \nsuch as the restaurant and food service, construction, and hospitality \nindustries.\n  About 30 percent of TPS beneficiaries are homeowners, stimulating the \nreal estate industry and contributing to the local property tax base.\n  Also, one in nine TPS beneficiaries in the labor force is self-\nemployed, meaning they not only create jobs for themselves, but also \ncreate jobs for others.\n  A recent report found that the expiration of Haitian TPS would cost \nthe United States economy more $2.8 billion over a decade in lost gross \ndomestic product.\n  Mr. Speaker, we need to be both smart and compassionate when it comes \nto extending TPS for Haiti.\n  The compassionate thing to do is extend TPS for Haiti.\n  But just as important, extending TPS for Haiti is the smart thing to \ndo because it strengthens the American economy and advances the \nnational interests of the United States.\n  Mr. Speaker, I also join my colleagues in the Congressional Black \nCaucus in drawing attention to the Republican Leadership's latest plan \nto hurt the American taxpayers, especially those who did not support \nthe President during the election.\n  The Republican tax cut would result in the biggest increase in the \ndeficit by any President in the history of the United States, likely \ngrowing it by the annual sum of $1 trillion from now on.\n  Some may wonder if the President would stoop to punishing people \nbecause they did not vote for him--I would point them to the Republican \nTax Proposal and say the answer is found in the 429 pages of H.R. 1, \nthe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017.\n\n\n  Americans who send their children to private school will be able to \ndo so--at the expense of taxpayers who send their children to public \nschools courtesy of the Republican tax cut plan.\n  The Republican Tax plan amends Title 26 of the United States Code \nSec.  529 that deals with Qualified tuition programs.\n  The Code was intended to encourage persons to attain higher education \nand provide incentives for persons who pursue doctorates.\n  Most people know that going back to school to obtain a degree is a \ndifficult choice to make with full time jobs and family obligations.\n  Having a degree can substantially increase income and provide choices \nthat would otherwise be unattainable to the recipient of advanced \ndegrees.\n  The benefit to the economy and our nation's leadership in the \nsciences rests with the number of people who attain undergraduate and \ngraduate degrees.\n  The Republicans have gone into this section 529 of the tax code and \nextended the tax write-offs to those sending their children to K-12 \nprivate schools.\n  Other ways the Republican Tax bill hurts taxpayers who pursue college \neducations for themselves or their children.\n  Repeal of Lifetime Learning Credit;\n  Repeal of the Student Loan Interest Deduction;\n  Repeal of the qualified tuition reduction;\n  Repeal of educational assistance program;\n  Termination of private activity bonds; and,\n  Creation of a new excise tax on endowments at private colleges and \nuniversities.\n  The Republican leadership of the House is also causing problems for \nprivate sector investments in Colleges and Universities.\n  The tax bill threatens tax write offs for donations to colleges and \nuniversities and will limit tax credits associated with university-\nindustry partnerships.\n  The Republicans claim that their Child Tax Credit proposal would help \nworking families, but it simply does not do enough.\n  The House tax plan proposes a nonrefundable $600 increase in the \nChild Tax Credit (CTC), and would make more families earning six \nfigures eligible to claim the CTC.\n  This proposal wouldn't help the women who need it most.\n  In addition, whatever benefits this CTC proposal would provide pales \nin comparison to those that would be received by the wealthy and \ncorporations under this tax plan.\n  The bill cuts taxes for major corporations who already pay far less \nthan their fair share.\n  Republicans claim that economic growth will more than pay for the \nlost revenue but we've tried this before.\n  When trickle-down economics fails again and this bill explodes the \nnation's deficit, Republicans will call for huge spending cuts to \ncritical programs that hardworking Americans depend on to make ends \nmeet.\n  The plan's negative impact on the Lone Star state would be \nparticularly hard.\n  Independent analyses show the Republican plan would actually raise \ntaxes on about 1.5 million Texas households, or 12.4 percent of \nhouseholds next year.\n  On average, families earning up to $86,000 annually would see a \n$794.00 increase in their tax liability, a significant burden on \nfamilies struggling to afford child care and balance their checkbook.\n  According to the IRS, 23 percent of tax filers, or 2.8 million Texas \nhouseholds, deduct their state and local taxes with an average \ndeduction of $7,823 in 2015.\n  The Ryan-McConnell plan eliminates this deduction, which would lower \nhome values and put pressure on states and towns to collect revenues \nthey depend on to fund schools, roads, and vital public resources.\n  Placing further strains on middle-class Texans is the elimination of \nthe personal exemption, which deducts $4,050 for each taxpayer and \ndependent on a return from taxable income.\n  In 2015, roughly 9.3 million dependent exemptions were claimed in the \nLone Star State.\n  The GOP's reckless and irresponsible tax plan is made all the more \nobscene by its disproportionate and immoral handouts to the wealthiest \nfew.\n  According to the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, \nmillionaires in Texas, 0.31 percent of filers in 2015 would receive \nalmost 57 percent of the benefits from the tax plan.\n  Texans deserve a tax plan that puts working and middle class families \nfirst, not more deficit-exploding tax cuts for millionaires and \nbillionaires.\n  We need bipartisan tax reform that creates jobs, fuels economic \ngrowth, and puts more money into the pockets of hard-working American \nfamilies.\n  A recent Pew Research Center report found little support for cutting \ntaxes for high-income households, which is defined as more than \n$250,000 or large businesses and corporations.\n  In fact, 43 percent favored raising taxes on high-income households \nand 52 percent said corporate taxes should be raised.\n  The Republicans persist with their scheme of raising taxes on hard-\nworking middle class families to pay for tax cuts for the rich.\n  It is reckless to explode our deficit which according to the Tax \nPolicy Center, would skyrocket by $2.4 trillion over the first decade.\n  The wealthy must pay their fair share, but the GOP tax scheme offers \nthem a free lunch at the expense of those who are most in need of a \nhelping hand.\n  The power of the purse rests with the House of Representatives and it \nis our job to make sure that the American People are treated fairly.\n", "turn": 19, "speaker": "Ms. JACKSON LEE", "itemno": 23}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide":
