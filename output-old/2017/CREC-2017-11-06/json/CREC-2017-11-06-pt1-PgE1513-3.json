Mr. Speaker, I rise today \nto recognize Landon Vranes, a 10-year-old Albuquerque student who \nrepresents the spirit of learning and innovation. As a 5th grade \nstudent, Landon has dedicated much of his time learning about, and \nbuilding robots.\n  Landon recently built a robot that is able to solve any combination \nof the popular Rubik's Cube puzzle. His creation was part of a class \nproject led by Albuquerque Public Schools teacher, Ms. Amy Nevitt. \nLandon's robot was featured during recent TV news broadcasts, which \nhighlighted his passion for technology and robotics.\n  During an interview with KOB-4, Landon explained, ``Any scramble out \nof the 43 quintillion can be solved in 20 moves or less and it's trying \nto find out the quickest possibility.''\n  As the home to three federal research laboratories and distinguished \nresearch universities, New Mexico has a reputation for fostering \ninnovation and exploration. It is my hope that students like Landon \nVranes continue to have opportunities to thrive and succeed in New \nMexico.\n  Mr. Speaker, I would like to congratulate Landon on this achievement \nand wish him all the best in his future scientific endeavors.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Ms. MICHELLE LUJAN GRISHAM of New Mexico", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 3}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "180", "extension": true, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "E1513", "wkday": "Monday", "day": "6", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "HONORING LANDON VRANES", "id": "CREC-2017-11-06-pt1-PgE1513-3", "title": "HONORING LANDON VRANES"}
