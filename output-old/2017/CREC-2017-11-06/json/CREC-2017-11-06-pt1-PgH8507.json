Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 3656, as amended.\n  Under current law, VA may provide a memorial headstone or marker for \na veteran's dependent child or surviving spouse if their remains are \nunavailable. But this law also contains an inconsistency. VA can \nprovide a memorial headstone or marker for a spouse who dies on or \nafter November 11, 1998, but can only provide one for a dependent child \nwho dies on or after December 22, 2006.\n  The disparity makes it difficult for VA to administer this law. More \nimportantly, it has led to some confusion among veterans and their \nfamilies as to whether a particular family member is eligible for this \nbenefit or not.\n  These families are not just mourning, but they are also coping with \nthe heartbreak of not being able to properly lay their loved one to \nrest because the remains have not been recovered. I am concerned that \nit is possible that these families may not request a memorial VA \nheadstone or marker because they aren't sure if they qualify. I hope \nthat this bill will bring these families some peace by allowing VA to \nprovide a permanent memorial marker to ensure their loved one will not \nbe forgotten.\n  H.R. 3656 would help avoid confusion by making the eligibility dates \nfor the memorial markers consistent for surviving spouses and dependent \nchildren. This may seem like a small change, but I know it will be very \nimportant to grieving families who want to ensure that their loved ones \nare properly memorialized.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to join me in supporting \nH.R. 3656, as amended, and I reserve the balance of my time.", "turn": 4, "speaker": "Mr. ROE of Tennessee", "itemno": 15}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "T000472", "text": "  Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3656, as amended, which \nresolves an inconsistency in the eligibility for nonveteran spouses and \nchildren receiving memorial headstones. The legislation ensures a \nconsistent applicability date for memorial headstones and markers for \neligible nonveteran individuals whose remains are not available.\n  Under current law, a surviving spouse who dies on or after November \n11, 1998, is eligible for a headstone or marker. But for dependent \nchildren who pass away, the date of eligibility for a headstone or \nmarker does not occur until December 22, 2006.\n  This arbitrary difference causes situations in which VA can provide a \nmarker for the parent, but not the dependent child. Clearly, this \nchange would make it easier for surviving family members to make \nfuneral and burial plans.\n  H.R. 3656, as amended, is supported by the major veteran service \norganizations and enjoys bipartisan support in the House Veterans' \nAffairs Committee.\n  Mr. Speaker, I support H.R. 3656, as amended, and I urge my \ncolleagues in the House to do the same.

I am very proud to serve on that committee under his \nleadership.\n  Mr. Speaker, because our veterans answered the call and served our \ncountry, we, in turn, must serve them and their families.\n  This commitment extends to assisting them in medical recovery, in \nsuccessfully transitioning to the civilian workforce, and, just as \nimportantly, in properly memorializing their lives when they are gone.\n  Current law provides memorial headstones for veterans and for their \nspouses and children when the remains of the deceased cannot be found. \nThis can occur in unfortunate cases, such as a boating or a plane \naccident.\n  Public Law 105-368 provides headstones for spouses, and it was \nenacted in 1998. Public Law 109-461 provides headstones for dependent \nchildren, and it was enacted in 2006. Both groups are eligible for this \nbenefit as of the date of enactment. However, as has already been said, \nit is unfortunate that these two laws did not go into effect at the \nsame time, potentially opening the door for a parent to receive this \nbenefit, but not a child.\n  Mr. Speaker, my bill, H.R. 3656, would amend title 38 of the United \nStates Code to provide for a consistent eligibility date for spouses \nand dependent children. The date for both would be set at the current \ndate for spouses: November 11, 1998.\n  This bill is especially necessary for the few tragic cases in which a \nspouse and a dependent child both passed away in the same accident \nduring a period when these two laws were not in sync. We need to \ncorrect this situation.\n  My legislation is a practical fix to take care of our veterans and \ntheir families, and to keep our commitment to them.
