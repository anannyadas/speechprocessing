Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and \ncongratulate Deloris Stenzel and her late husband Glen, of Hamburg, \nIowa, for receiving the 2017 Farm Family of the Year Award by the \nShenandoah Chamber and Industry Association.\n  Deloris and Glen were college sweethearts and they attended Northwest \nMissouri State University. They returned to the family farming \noperation where they managed their farms for decades and were blessed \nwith two children, Deb and Steven. Deloris and Glen were active in \ntheir community, and Glen served on numerous area boards and \ncommittees. Together, they were always eager to lend a helping hand to \nneighbors, whether it was pulling someone out of a ditch, delivering \nmeals, or helping combine a neighbor's field.\n  Mr. Speaker, I'm proud to represent community leaders like the \nStenzels in the United States Congress and it is with great pride that \nI recognize them today. I ask that my colleagues in the United States \nHouse of Representatives join me in congratulating the Stenzels for \nthis outstanding achievement and in wishing them nothing but the best.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. YOUNG of Iowa", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 3}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "180", "extension": true, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "E1516", "wkday": "Monday", "day": "6", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "TRIBUTE TO DELORIS STENZEL", "id": "CREC-2017-11-06-pt1-PgE1516", "title": "TRIBUTE TO DELORIS STENZEL"}
