A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to authorize \nthe expansion of activities related to Alzheimer's disease, cognitive \ndecline, and brain health under the Alzheimer's Disease and Healthy \nAging Program, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.", "turn": -1, "speaker": "The RECORDER", "itemno": 0}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "C001035", "text": "  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleague from \nNevada, Senator Cortez Masto, to introduce the Building Our Largest \nDementia Infrastructure for Alzheimer's--or BOLD--Act. I am pleased \nthat Senator Capito and Senator Kaine are also joining us as original \ncosponsors.\n  Our legislation would create a public health infrastructure aimed at \ncombating Alzheimer's disease and preserving brain health. Alzheimer's \ndisease is one of the greatest and most under-recognized public health \nthreats of our time. Former Surgeon General David Satcher has said that \nit is the most under-recognized public health threat of the 21st \ncentury. Five and a half million Americans are living with the disease, \nand that number will soar as our population continues to grow older and \nlives longer.\n  In addition to the human suffering it causes, Alzheimer's is our \nNation's most costly disease. The United States spends more than $259 \nbillion per year, including $175 billion in Medicare and Medicaid \ncosts. The financial impact of this dreadful disease will only continue \nto grow. In fact, it is estimated that by the year 2050, Alzheimer's \nwill cost our country $1 trillion and afflict 16 million Americans.\n  While Alzheimer's is the only one of our Nation's most deadly \ndiseases without an effective treatment or cure, tantalizing new \nresearch suggests that there are steps we can take to promote \nprevention and improve treatment.\n  The first step we should take is to recognize Alzheimer's as a public \nhealth crisis. It is because of public health advancements that we have \nsafe water to drink, vaccines to prevent deadly diseases, interventions \nto quit smoking, and emergency preparedness tools to save lives. The \neffort to combat Alzheimer's disease requires a similar unified, \nnational public health effort. That effort is gaining steam.\n  In 1999, when I founded the Bipartisan Congressional Task Force on \nAlzheimer's, there was virtually no focus in Washington on this \ndevastating disease. In fact, people were afraid to even refer to the \ndisease, just as years ago people did not talk about cancer.\n  Seven years ago, I coauthored with then-Senator Evan Bayh the \nbipartisan National Alzheimer's Project Act, which set the primary goal \nof preventing and effectively treating the disease by the year 2025. \nThat bill created an expert council, which has calculated that $2 \nbillion in Federal funding per year is needed to achieve that goal.\n  On the Appropriations Committee, I have worked hard with Senator \nBlunt and others to turn the words of that recommendation into action. \nThe funding bill for this year provides another $2 billion increase for \nthe National Institutes of Health, and that includes a $414 million \nincrease for Alzheimer's research--the largest in history. That brings \nthe total for Alzheimer's research to $1.8 billion--well within reach \nof the $2 billion goal, which the experts tell us is necessary for \nbreakthroughs.\n  While this research is moving forward, we must put into practice what \nwe know and enhance the quality of care and support for those living \nwith Alzheimer's and their families. In March, the Aging Committee, \nwhich I chair, held a hearing on the arc of Alzheimer's, from \npreventing cognitive decline to ensuring quality care for those living \nwith dementia. The hearing shed light on the fact that although we do \nnot yet know how to prevent Alzheimer's, we are advancing in our \nunderstanding of the disease. Its progression does not happen \novernight; it is preceded by years and perhaps decades of changes in \nthe brain and a continuum of changes in behavior, including cognitive \ndecline. A growing body of evidence suggests that lifestyle factors, \nsuch as regular physical activity and attention to heart health, may \nreduce the risk of cognitive decline. There is so much we have yet to \nknow.\n  Alzheimer's is a public issue for those living with the disease, for \nthose caring for their loved ones with the disease, for all of us as \ntaxpayers, and for those who know that our brain is our most precious \nresource. Alzheimer's exacts a tremendous personal and economic toll on \nfamilies and communities. More than 40 million Americans know all too \nwell the compassion, commitment, and endurance that it takes to be a \ncaregiver of a loved one facing a chronic disease like Alzheimer's.\n  The legislation we are introducing today would apply a new public \nhealth approach to Alzheimer's disease. It would establish Centers of \nExcellence in Public Health Practice dedicated to promoting effective \nAlzheimer's disease management and caregiving interventions, as well as \neducating the public on the disease, cognitive decline, and brain \nhealth.\n  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is already doing \ntremendous work to combat Alzheimer's within the Public Health Road Map \nof the Healthy Brain Initiative. This legislation would create centers \nof excellence across the country to implement the CDC's Public Health \nRoad Map. The centers would take a number of key steps against \nAlzheimer's. They would work to support early detection and diagnosis, \nlessen the risk of avoidable hospitalizations, reduce the risk of \ncognitive decline, enhance support to meet the needs of caregivers, \nreduce health disparities, and support care planning and management for \nthose with the disease. The Centers' activities would support health \nand social services professionals as well as families and communities.\n\n  In addition to establishing the Centers of Excellence in Public \nHealth Practice, this bill would spread the opportunity for communities \nacross America to create the necessary core capacity to combat \nAlzheimer's and to enhance existing efforts in this regard. The \nlegislation would establish and distribute cooperative agreements to \npublic health departments to support systems change, communications, \nand programmatic interventions. These agreements would also support the \nactions in the CDC Healthy Brain Initiative's Public Health Roadmap.\n  Finally, at the heart of public health is data. This legislation \nwould direct the CDC to collect data on cognitive decline, cognitive \nimpairment, caregiving, and health disparities within its current \nsystems. The bill would also create cooperative agreements for the \nanalysis and reporting of data to ensure that the results are \ndisseminated to the public and are used, ultimately, to improve brain \nhealth.\n  For far too long, we have viewed Alzheimer's disease as an aging \nissue that plagues our seniors today and threatens to affect many more \ntomorrow. In fact, the disease is far more than that.\n\n\nIt is a public health issue with a course that we can change. If we do \nnot take action, both in this new public health approach and by \ncontinuing to build on the research, this disease will bankrupt the \nMedicare and the Medicaid Programs. We cannot afford to spend over $1 \ntrillion in the year 2050 on just this one disease. We cannot afford to \nlose 16 million Americans by that year to this devastating disease. We \ncannot afford to allow the heartache and devastation of this disease to \naffect more and more American families.\n  There are steps that we can take today to prevent cognitive decline \nand to improve the lives of those who are living with Alzheimer's and \nthe lives of their caregivers. This public health approach is not only \nempowering, but it is key to avoiding the terrible impacts that I have \noutlined.\n  After decades of expanding much needed biomedical research in \nAlzheimer's, we are ready for the next step--to translate research into \npolicy. The BOLD bill would create a new, enlightened public policy out \nof promising research by creating the first ever national public health \ninfrastructure for Alzheimer's disease.\n  I am pleased to say that the bipartisan bill that the Senator from \nNevada and I have introduced, with our colleagues from Virginia and \nWest Virginia, is endorsed by the Alzheimer's Association, the \nAlzheimer's Impact Movement, the National Association of Chronic \nDisease Directors, and the National Association of Counties.\n  I ask unanimous consent that their letters of support be printed in \nthe Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this critical and bipartisan \nlegislation.", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Ms. COLLINS", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "recorder", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in ", "turn": -1, "speaker": "The RECORDER", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "recorder", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "the Record, as follows:\n\n                                  Alzheimer's Impact Movement,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, November 6, 2017.\n     Hon.

Tim Kaine,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Collins, Cortez Masto, Capito and Kaine: On \n     behalf of the Alzheimer's Association and the Alzheimer's \n     Impact Movement (AIM), including our nationwide networks of \n     advocates, thank you for your continued leadership on issues \n     and legislation important to Americans with Alzheimer's and \n     other dementias, and to their caregivers. The Alzheimer's \n     Association and AIM are pleased to support the bipartisan \n     Building Our Largest Dementia (BOLD) Infrastructure for \n     Alzheimer's Act, which would create an Alzheimer's public \n     health infrastructure across the country to implement \n     effective Alzheimer's interventions focused on public health \n     issues such as increasing early detection and diagnosis, \n     reducing risk and preventing avoidable hospitalizations.\n       More than 5 million Americans are living with Alzheimer's \n     and, without significant action, as many as 16 million \n     Americans will have Alzheimer's by 2050. Today, another \n     person develops the disease every 66 seconds; by 2050, \n     someone in the United States will develop the disease every \n     33 seconds. This explosive growth will cause Alzheimer's \n     costs to increase from an estimated $259 billion in 2017 to \n     $1.1 trillion in 2050 (in 2017 dollars). These mounting costs \n     threaten to bankrupt families, businesses and our health care \n     system. Unfortunately, our work is only growing more urgent.\n       As scientists continue to search for a way to prevent, \n     cure, or slow the progression of Alzheimer's through medical \n     research, public health plays an important role in promoting \n     cognitive function and reducing the risk of cognitive \n     decline. Investing in a nationwide Alzheimer's public health \n     response will help create population-level change, achieve a \n     higher quality of life for those living with the disease and \n     their caregivers, and reduce associated costs. The BOLD \n     Infrastructure for Alzheimer's Act would provide this crucial \n     investment by establishing Alzheimer's centers of excellence \n     across the country and funding state, local and tribal public \n     health departments to increase early detection and diagnosis, \n     reduce risk, prevent avoidable hospitalizations, reduce \n     health disparities, support the needs of caregivers and \n     support care planning for people living with the disease. \n     These important public health actions allow individuals with \n     Alzheimer's to live in their homes longer and delay costly \n     institutionalized care. These goals are consistent with the \n     National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease, which includes \n     a strategy to ``work with state, tribal, and local \n     governments to improve coordination and identify model \n     initiatives to advance Alzheimer's disease and related \n     dementias awareness and readiness across the government.''\n       The BOLD Infrastructure for Alzheimer's Act would also \n     increase the collection, analysis and timely reporting of \n     Alzheimer's data. This data is critical to identifying \n     opportunities for public health interventions, helping \n     stakeholders track progress in the public health response, \n     and enabling state and federal policymakers to make informed \n     decisions when developing plans and policies. Finally, the \n     bill would also strengthen implementation of the Center for \n     Disease Control and Prevention's Public Health Road Map, \n     which includes strategic action items for state and local \n     public health departments and their partners to promote \n     cognitive functioning, address cognitive impairment and help \n     meet the needs of care partners.\n       The Alzheimer's Association and AIM deeply appreciate your \n     continued leadership on behalf of all American's living with \n     Alzheimer's and other dementias. We look forward to working \n     with you to advance this important bipartisan bill.

Mr. President, I rise to thank my colleague from \nMaine, whose amazing work as chair of the Aging Committee continues to \ninspire me.\n  I also rise to share a story that is very personal to me. It is a \nstory about one of the smartest people whom I have known, my \ngrandmother Katherine, whom I was named after. She was the daughter of \nan Italian immigrant and his Italian-American wife. She was exactly the \nkind of person you think of when you think of an Italian grandmother. \nIf you have ever had one, you know that she loves to feed people and \ninvite the whole family--aunts, uncles, cousins, everyone--over to her \nhouse for dinner on Sunday nights. The other 6 days of the week, she \nworked on volunteer projects throughout Las Vegas with her sorority, \nBeta Sigma Phi.\n  She never graduated from college, but she was a leader in our \ncommunity, and she was always reading. If you walked into her house, it \nwas full of books. In fact, the first thing that you saw when you \nwalked into her house was, on one wall, floor to ceiling, a bookcase \nwith all of the books that she had read.\n  She was brilliant. She was one of my greatest inspirations. Her work \nin our community in Las Vegas is one of the reasons that I decided to \npursue a career in public service.\n  Unfortunately, in the 1990s, my grandmother was diagnosed with \nAlzheimer's disease. At first, you could barely notice a difference. \nThere were small things, things that could happen to anyone--lost keys, \nmismatched socks, books left in odd places. Then a woman who had spent \nher entire life loving to cook for her family and grandchildren had \nsuddenly stopped cooking.\n  Over the next 10 years, she got progressively worse. We could see the \nchanges in her every single day, but our lives changed too. My \ngrandfather became her caregiver. My mother became her caregiver. My \naunt became her caregiver. My cousins and I and my sister all became \ncaregivers. That is what happens when someone is diagnosed. It does not \naffect just one person; it affects an entire family.\n  There is a common misconception that people who are suffering from \nAlzheimer's are not aware of what they are losing, that their memories \nare gone but not missed. That was not the case for my grandmother. I do \nnot think it is the case for anyone who is struggling with this \ndisease. My grandmother frequently had these moments of clarity when it \nwas clear that the losses were just as painful for her as they were for \nall of us.\n  One thing that happens to many people with Alzheimer's is that they \ntend to wander. They wander away from home or they get lost. She had \nhad one of those moments of clarity after she had wandered away from \nhome one day, and the entire family had spent an afternoon looking for \nher in our neighborhood. My aunt and I had found her and had gone to \npick her up in a car. I will never forget it, as I sat in the back seat \nwhile my aunt drove.\n  My grandmother, who had been seated on the front passenger's side, \nasked my aunt: Why am I doing this? Why am I in my housecoat and \nslippers? Why am I doing this?\n  My aunt looked at her and she said: Mom, you are sick. You have \nsomething they call Alzheimer's, and that means that it is impacting \nyour brain and your memories, and you are forgetting.\n  We were so powerless. We couldn't do anything but make her \ncomfortable and bring her home.\n  For many, many families who are dealing with Alzheimer's, they have \ngone through those same moments--those moments when they are dealing \nwith their loved ones either trying to explain to them what is \nhappening or giving them comfort because they know their memories are \ngone, and they want to make sure they are giving them the comfort they \nneed and they deserve.\n  We know, unfortunately, that there is no cure for Alzheimer's. My \ngrandmother passed away, as many people with Alzheimer's do, when her \nillness got so bad that she lost the ability to eat or drink, but the \nexperience of caring for my grandmother opened my eyes to the true \nimpact of this disease. I saw that when one person is diagnosed, whole \nfamilies' lives are transformed too. I think about my grandmother every \nday. Every day, I return to some piece of wisdom or guidance that she \nshared with me. I am committed now to honoring her memory by fighting \nto prevent Alzheimer's and to provide caregivers with the support they \nneed and deserve.\n  When my grandmother was first diagnosed, we did not understand \nAlzheimer's like we do today. We did not have enough healthcare \nprograms for it or support for the caregivers. It was seen as an \nindividual disease that struck at random, with no cure and no hope. \nAlthough there is still no cure, we know now that there are things that \nwe can do to help to keep the brain healthy longer and possibly reduce \nthe risk of Alzheimer's and that there are things that we can do now to \npromote prevention.\n  For those who are already living with Alzheimer's and for their \ncaregivers, like my family was for my grandmother, there are things \nthat we can do to dramatically improve their experiences and to help \nlessen some of that burden. Today there are things we can do to invest \nin finding that cure for Alzheimer's. It is just a petri dish away, but \nwe have to believe that it is there and that we can continue and \nsupport that investment. I have visited the Lou Ruvo Center for Brain \nHealth in Las Vegas and met with its director, Dr. Jeffrey Cummings. I \nhave seen the incredible work they have done, including their methods \nfor the early detection of Alzheimer's, which simply did not exist only \na few years ago. Yet education in the community and the spreading of \nbest practices still lag behind.\n  There is no longer any doubt that this is a public health crisis. \nThat is why I am so grateful and proud to be sitting on a committee and \nworking with a chairwoman, my colleague from Maine, who has made an \neffort here in Congress to really bring attention to Alzheimer's \ndisease and to help to fight for funding and investment in a cure.\n  I am proud to join my colleagues from Maine, West Virginia, and \nVirginia in introducing legislation that is known as the BOLD \nInfrastructure for Alzheimer's Act. This bill will create Centers of \nExcellence that will be dedicated to promoting effective interventions \nand educating the public on Alzheimer's disease, cognitive decline, and \nbrain health. It will provide grants to State and local health \ndepartments to build the infrastructure that is necessary to address \nthis public health crisis, and it will collect the data that is \nnecessary to keep pushing the frontiers of what we know about this \ndisease.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this vital, bipartisan piece of \nlegislation that has the potential of having a positive impact on \nmillions of Americans across this country.\n", "turn": 3, "speaker": "Ms. CORTEZ MASTO", "itemno": 7}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 8}], "header": {"chamber": "Senate", "num": "180", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "S7017-S7019", "wkday": "Monday", "day": "6", "month": "November"}, "related_bills": [{"type": "S", "context": "FIRSTPARAGRAPH", "congress": "115", "number": "2076"}, {"type": "S", "context": "OTHER", "congress": "115", "number": "2076"}], "doc_title": "STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS", "id": "CREC-2017-11-06-pt1-PgS7017"}
