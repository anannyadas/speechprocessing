Mr. Speaker, another day, another tragedy here in \nAmerica. These are difficult times in this country, and it seems that \nwe have spent the last several months careening from one tragedy to the \nnext: from the congressional baseball shooting to Charlottesville, from \nCharlottesville to Las Vegas, from Las Vegas to the terrorist attack in \nNew York, from the terrorist attack in New York to a mass shooting at a \nBaptist Church in south Texas.\n  Something is wrong here in America, yet all we seem to do is to come \nto Congress, have a respectful moment of silence, and then move on as \nif everything is okay. It is not okay.\n  It is time for this ``do-nothing Congress'' to do something, do \nanything to help stop the carnage that is taking place in our great \ncountry.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. JEFFRIES", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "180", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H8501", "wkday": "Monday", "day": "6", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "ANOTHER DAY, ANOTHER TRAGEDY HERE IN AMERICA", "id": "CREC-2017-11-06-pt1-PgH8501-2", "title": "ANOTHER DAY, ANOTHER TRAGEDY HERE IN AMERICA"}
