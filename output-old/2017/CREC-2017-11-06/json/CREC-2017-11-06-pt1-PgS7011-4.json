Mr. President, Bernard Shaw devoted his life to \nsupporting Maine's family farms and to preserving our State's \nagricultural heritage. His recent passing at 88 years of\n\n\nage was a great loss, but he left behind a legacy that will be \ncherished for generations to come.\n  I rise today in tribute to this outstanding leader and to offer my \ndeepest condolences to his wife Norma, family, and friends.\n  Growing up in Aroostook County, the heart of Maine's potato industry, \nI saw every day the importance of family farms to our way of life and \nto our communities. Bernard was a leader in this iconic Aroostook \nindustry.\n  Born in Limestone, ME, near my hometown of Caribou, Bernard began \nfarming with Norma's father, Herman Ward. In addition to helping to \nbuild a strong and successful family business, he served the industry \nin numerous agricultural organizations at the local, State, and \nnational levels.\n  Bernard served as Maine's commissioner of agriculture from 1988 to \n1996 during Governor McKernan's administration. During my own service \nin State government, I had the pleasure of working alongside Bernard, a \nleader of uncommon energy, intelligence, and dedication.\n  During their 67 years of marriage, in both Aroostook County and our \nState capital of Augusta, Bernard and Norma were active volunteers in \ntheir community, serving youth programs, civic organizations, schools, \nand their church. Upon Bernard's retirement in 1996, the couple devoted \ncountless hours to the Augusta Food Bank, helping their neighbors in \nneed throughout the capital region.\n  In 2012, Bernard and Norma were honored with the Maine Agriculture \nCommissioner's Distinguished Service Award. The citation accompanying \nthat award described them as ``two of the most accomplished, yet \nhumble, contributors to Maine's agricultural community'' who \npersonified the traditional, hard-working Maine farm family.\n  Bernard Shaw was guided by the traditions that define Maine, and he \nstrengthened them for the future. His invaluable contributions to \nagriculture and to our State will be deeply missed, but he will long be \nremembered for his leadership and vision.", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Ms. COLLINS", "itemno": 0}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "K000383", "text": "  Mr. KING. Mr. President, today we remember the life of Bernard \n``Bernie'' Shaw, who passed away earlier this year at the age of 88. As \na lifelong resident of Maine, a wonderful husband and father to three, \nand a champion for agriculture, future generations will continue to \nremember Bernie by the lasting impact he has left on the State.\n  Originally from Limestone, Bernie attend the Limestone schools and \nlater the University of Maine. It was after this that he met his \nbeloved wife, Norma. In over 65 years of marriage, Bernie and Norma \nraised three children--Steve, Susan, and Sara--all while running a \nsuccessful family farm and giving back to their community in numerous \nways.\n  Bernie first began farming with Norma's father, Herman Ward, and \neventually took over the family business, before moving to Augusta in \n1987. From 1988 to 1994, Bernie served the State of Maine as the \ncommissioner of agriculture. Over the years, he served on local, State, \nand national level agriculture committees, drawing from his own \nexperience as a former Aroostook County potato farmer. Only a few out \nof the many groups he championed for, Bernie devoted his time to the \nMaine Potato Council, the Maine Potato Board, the Agricultural \nBargaining Council, and the Land For Maine's Future Board.\n  After retiring, Bernie devoted much of his time to volunteering at \nthe Augusta Food Bank, and the Windsor Fair. He was honored for this \ncommitment back in 2012, when he received the Agriculture \nCommissioner's Distinguished Service Award, along with his wife, Norma. \nBoth were lauded for their weekly efforts with the food bank and their \nsuccess in expanding the number of families able to be helped.\n  Bernie Shaw represented in so many ways the values we hold dear in \nMaine: family, faith, community, service, and tradition. We have much \nto be thankful for in Maine because of Bernie's dedication and service \nto the State, and he will be deeply missed by many.\n", "turn": 1, "speaker": "Mr. KING", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "Senate", "num": "180", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "S7011-S7012", "wkday": "Monday", "day": "6", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "REMEMBERING BERNARD SHAW", "id": "CREC-2017-11-06-pt1-PgS7011-4", "title": "REMEMBERING BERNARD SHAW"}
