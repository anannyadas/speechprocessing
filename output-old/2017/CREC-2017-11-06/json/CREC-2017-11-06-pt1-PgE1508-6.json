Mr. Speaker, I would like to call to your attention the \noutstanding achievements of the great City of Clifton as it celebrates \nits 100th Anniversary on November 4, 2017.\n  On April 26, 1917, the City of Clifton was carved out of Acquackanonk \nTownship and incorporated by an act of the New Jersey legislature. \nNamed after the towering cliffs of Garret Mountain, Clifton is composed \nof many endearing neighborhoods. They are Albion, Allwood, Athenia, \nBotany Village, Delawanna,\n\n\nDutch Hill, Lakeview, Main Mall, Montclair Heights, Richfield, \nRosemawr, Styertowne, West Clifton, and Yanticaw Pond. Just as \nClifton's geography is diverse, so too are are its citizens. Clifton's \n84,136 residents speak over seventy languages and trace their heritage \nto all parts of the world.\n  Today, we thank those who played a part in the founding of the city, \nand those leaders who guided the city in the years that followed. Since \n1934, Clifton has been governed by a City Manager and seven City \nCouncil members, one of whom is selected by his or her colleagues to be \nMayor. The residents of Clifton are some of the most involved citizens, \nand make their voices heard by electing all members of the City \nCouncil.\n  Mayor James Anzaldi has served in his current position for 27 years, \nmaking him the city's longest tenured mayor. His love for his hometown \nand dedication to public service set remarkable examples for all \nCliftonites to follow.\n  Students at Clifton High School boast their ``Mustang Pride'' in the \nclassroom and at competitions throughout the North Jersey area. Mustang \nvarsity sports teams have won multiple state championships throughout \nthe decades, and the Mustang Band has been dazzling crowds since the \n1930s. The band has earned such a reputation that it has been \nnicknamed, ``The Showband of the Northeast.''\n  The City of Clifton has been essential to the growth and development \nof Passaic County and the State of New Jersey overall. After the \nclosure of the Morris Canal in 1924, Clifton began a mission to rapidly \nmodernize. Over the next few decades, shopping centers, hotels, roads, \nand other vital infrastructure were built at a remarkable rate. By \n1952, Clifton was designated as New Jersey's fastest growing city. The \ncity continues to champion economic progress and development today.\n  It is my great honor to represent the residents of Clifton in the \nUnited States Congress. This is a city where people work hard to \nsupport their families, improve their community, and honor their \nhistory. When I visit my neighbors in Clifton, I never cease to be \ninspired by acts of ingenuity, compassion, and good will. I can always \ncount on Cliftonites to be some of the friendliest constituents in my \ndistrict, and the country as a whole.\n  The job of a United States Congressman involves much that is \nrewarding, yet little compares to recognizing and commemorating 100 \nyears of rich history in Clifton, New Jersey.\n  Mr. Speaker, I ask that you join our colleagues in celebrating 100 \nyears of service, dedication, and excellence from the residents of \nClifton.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. PASCRELL", "itemno": 3}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 4}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "180", "extension": true, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "E1508-E1509", "wkday": "Monday", "day": "6", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "100TH ANNIVERSARY OF CLIFTON", "id": "CREC-2017-11-06-pt1-PgE1508-6", "title": null}
