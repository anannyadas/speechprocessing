Mr. Speaker, I am joining the Congressional Black \nCaucus to ask for an extension of the temporary protective status for \nHaitians.\n  I am absolutely appalled that this government would deny this \nextension and only allow it for 6 months. Apparently, they are not \naware of the scarcity of food in Haiti and the cholera epidemic. All of \nthese challenges are continuing since 2011.\n  Along with the Haitians, I understand that they have now taken away \nTPS from 300,000 Hondurans, Nicaraguans, and Salvadorans as well. This \nis an outrageous act, and it is important for them to act immediately.\n  I also stand against the scam tax plan. The scam tax plan would, in \nfact, take away opportunities for Americans to have higher education, \nbuild the deficit way beyond one's recognition, would not create jobs, \nwould send jobs overseas, would allow for 80 percent of the benefits to \ngo to the top 1 percent, and, frankly, would provide no benefits for \nmiddle class, hardworking Americans.\n  This plan is not tax cuts and jobs; it is a tax scam with no jobs.\n  I ask my colleagues to vote against this tax bill, and I ask this \nadministration to do what is right and provide humanitarian relief and \nextend the TPS for Haitians and all others similarly situated for 18 \nmonths.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Ms. JACKSON LEE", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "180", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H8513", "wkday": "Monday", "day": "6", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "EXTEND TEMPORARY PROTECTIVE STATUS FOR HAITIANS AND CENTRAL AMERICANS", "id": "CREC-2017-11-06-pt1-PgH8513", "title": "EXTEND TEMPORARY PROTECTIVE STATUS FOR HAITIANS AND CENTRAL AMERICANS"}
