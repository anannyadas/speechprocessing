Mr. President, I am delighted to commend Connors-Emerson \nSchool in Bar Harbor, ME, on being named a 2017 National Blue Ribbon \nSchool of Excellence. Serving students from kindergarten through the \neighth grade, this outstanding school is one of only 342 schools across \nthe country to receive Blue Ribbon recognition from the U.S. Department \nof Education.\n  Created in 1982, the Blue Ribbon Schools Program honors public and \nprivate schools that are either academically superior in their States \nor that demonstrate significant gains in student achievement. The \nschools singled out for this national recognition are models of high \neducational standards and accountability.\n  The Blue Ribbon designation continues a tradition of quality \neducation at Connors-Emerson. Since first being named a Blue Ribbon \nSchool in 2004, educators and staff have deepened and expanded \nstandards-based teaching and learning. More than half of the faculty \nhave advanced degrees or certification as master level teachers. A \nstrong commitment to professional development ensures that teachers and \nstaff, as well as students, are lifelong learners.\n  Bar Harbor is the gateway to Acadia National Park, and the school has \na strong ethic of environmental responsibility. Currently, the seventh \ngrade students at Connors-Emerson are working on an expeditionary \nlearning unit which is exploring the effects of climate change on \nAcadia and all of Mount Desert Island.\n  Bar Harbor also is home to the MDI Biological Laboratory and to the \nJackson Laboratory, world-renowned research institutions. Connors-\nEmerson excels in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics \neducation. The math team and robotics team have received honors at both \nthe State and national levels, and the school has been awarded several \ngrants to advance STEM education.\n  Fully 98 percent of students in grades five through eight participate \nin afterschool activities. From the State champion jazz band and drama \nto Destination Imagination and the Outdoors Club, students are \nencouraged to pursue their interests.\n  As a school community, Connors-Emerson is dedicated to the values of \nfairness, compassion, honesty, responsibility, respect, and courtesy \nthat help to create a positive, diverse, safe, and caring learning \nenvironment.\n  This Blue Ribbon Award is a tribute not only to the students but also \nto the administrators, teachers, staff, and parents of Connors-Emerson \nSchool. Together, they are succeeding in their mission to generate \nexcitement and momentum for learning. They are making a difference in \nthe lives of their students, helping them reach their full potential as \nindependent, responsible learners and citizens. I congratulate the \nentire Bar Harbor community for this well-deserved recognition.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Ms. COLLINS", "itemno": 0}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 1}], "header": {"chamber": "Senate", "num": "180", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "S7012", "wkday": "Monday", "day": "6", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "RECOGNIZING CONNORS-EMERSON SCHOOL", "id": "CREC-2017-11-06-pt1-PgS7012", "title": "RECOGNIZING CONNORS-EMERSON SCHOOL"}
