Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate the centennial \nanniversary of the Balfour Declaration and the significance it played \nin the formation of the state of Israel.\n  This significant sixty seven word statement, that carne to be known \nas the Balfour Declaration, was the stepping stone in the reformation \nof a modern Jewish sovereign state. It was the first public recognition \naddressing the need to recognize the rebirth of a national home for the \nJewish people and their historical link to the land of Israel. This \nconcept was later reaffirmed by the international community at the \nTreaty of Sevres, San Remo, League of Nations and United Nations. This \ndeclaration represented the Jewish peoples' strong desire to return to \ntheir eternal homeland. This deep passion gave the Zionist movement \nwidespread international recognition that few movements have ever seen.\n  In 1922, the United States Congress passed a joint resolution, the \nLodge-Fish Resolution, which committed the United States' support of \nthe establishment of a Jewish State, by reproducing the exact text of \nthe Balfour Declaration.\n  Mr. Speaker, Israel has since become one of the United States' \ngreatest allies and hopefully the bond between our two great nations \nwill only continue to grow stronger.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. ZELDIN", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 3}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "180", "extension": true, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "E1512", "wkday": "Monday", "day": "6", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "BALFOUR DECLARATION", "id": "CREC-2017-11-06-pt1-PgE1512-4", "title": "BALFOUR DECLARATION"}
