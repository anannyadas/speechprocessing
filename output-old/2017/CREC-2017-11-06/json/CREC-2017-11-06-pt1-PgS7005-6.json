Mr. President, for most Americans, a church is a place \nof worship and love, a place where the faithful go to feel mercy and \ncompassion, which is why what happened in Texas yesterday is so \ndifficult for many to comprehend. Why would an individual do this? \nFamilies lost so much. Our hearts go out to them in this time of untold \ngrief. Our gratitude goes out to the civilians and first responders who \nanswer the call when others are in need.\n  As we continue to learn the details of yesterday's tragic events, I, \nalong with all Members of the Senate, will keep the victims of this \ntragedy and their families in my prayers.\n  Mr. President, on a completely different matter, last Monday I said \nthe Senate would confirm four excellent judicial nominees by the end of \nthe week. That is just what we did--Amy Barrett, confirmed; Joan \nLarsen, confirmed; Allison Eid, confirmed; Stephanos Bibas, confirmed.\n  After 8 years of a President who selected judges based upon an \nideological litmus test designed to find nominees who favor certain \ngroups or individuals over others, we now have a President who is \nsending over nominees who will ensure that the judiciary is actually \nliving up to the role we expect in our democracy: treating everyone \nequally, giving every litigant a fair shake, applying the law as it is \nactually written, not as the judge wishes it might be. The four circuit \ncourt nominees the Senate confirmed last week will do just that.\n  Democrats have put up a lot of procedural roadblocks to prevent the \nSenate from moving forward all year. We have moved ahead anyway. As a \nresult, despite all the obstacles from the other side, we are making \nsignificant progress.\n  Of course, none of this would be possible without the hard work and \nnotable leadership of Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, and \nI want to thank him again for everything he has done.\n  We are not finished yet. We are going to keep pressing forward on \njudicial nominees. We are going to keep confirming the other nominees \nbefore us as well.\n  This week the Senate will consider some of President Trump's other \nqualified nominees for various positions throughout the Federal \nGovernment. Each of these individuals will help lead their agencies to \nfulfill their particular mission in running the government.\n  First, we will advance the nomination of Steven Engel to serve as \nAssistant Attorney General for the Office of Legal Counsel. Mr. Engel \npreviously worked in the OLC, having done so under President Bush. He \nalso served as Deputy Assistant Attorney General\n\n\nand counsel to the Assistant Attorney General. He obviously has a lot \nof experience advising senior policymakers on a wide variety of legal \nissues facing the executive branch. That is good because the role he \nhas been nominated to has the responsibility for providing legal advice \nto the executive branch on all constitutional questions and reviewing \npending legislation for constitutionality.\n  I look forward to advancing Mr. Engel's nomination tomorrow so that \nhe can begin putting his experience to work for our country as soon as \npossible, and then we will turn to the various other nominees before us \nso they can begin doing the same. Confirming the President's nominees \nis an important part of the Senate's business, and I urge all of our \ncolleagues to work together so we can get this done.\n\n\n                               Tax Reform\n\n  Now on one final matter, Mr. President, today our colleagues on the \nHouse Ways and Means Committee began marking up the tax reform \nlegislation they unveiled last week. Under Chairman Brady's leadership, \nthe committee is continuing its work to get our economy reaching again \nfor its true potential. This is yet more momentum for our country's \nonce-in-a-generation opportunity to update the tax system, deliver \nrelief to hard-working American families, and get our economy creating \nmore opportunities and prosperity.\n  Under Chairman Hatch's leadership, the Senate Finance Committee is \ncontinuing to move forward on its own legislation to increase \nopportunity and to provide more take-home pay for American families. In \nan open process through regular order, members of the committee will \ncontinue to have input in the writing of this tax reform legislation.\n  Both Chambers are working with the President and his team to overhaul \nour country's complex and outdated tax system. We are united around a \ncommonsense set of goals to make taxes lower, simpler, and fairer; take \nmore money out of Washington's pockets and put more money in the \npockets of America's middle class; and level the playing field for \nAmerican workers and businesses so they can compete against foreign \ncompetitors on an equal footing and not only create more jobs in \nAmerica but keep them here too. These are goals shared by so many \nacross our country regardless of party.\n  It is time to deliver real tax relief for hard-working families, and \nwe are going to keep working together to do just that.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.", "turn": 4, "speaker": "Mr. McCONNELL", "itemno": 7}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise to speak about the mass \nshooting in Texas yesterday--the latest mass shooting in what seems \nlike never-ending gun violence in our country. My heart breaks for the \nvictims and their families and for the community of Sutherland Springs \nin Texas.\n  We are still gathering all the facts about this specific crime. We \nare still learning about what happened, how this murderer was able to \npurchase a gun, whatever his twisted rationale was for walking into a \nhouse of worship in a small town and slaughtering more than 20 people, \nincluding young children, with an assault weapon. Our incredible law \nenforcement officials are working hard to answer all of that, but the \nmost important fact of all is something we already know very well. This \nwas yet another case where someone on American soil who had absolutely \nno business getting his hands on a weapon of war was able to get one \nand use it to commit heinous mass murder.\n\n  Of the five worst mass shootings in our history, three of them have \noccurred in just the past 17 months. Think about that. In a small town \nin America, nearly 7 percent of the town's population was slaughtered \njust because they went to church that day. The weapon he used was based \non a military weapon designed for a war zone, but this was not a war \nzone. It was a church. People were singing and praying and savoring \nlife.\n  I reject the notion that it is too soon to act. If not now, then \nwhen? We should ban assault weapons and bump stocks today. People who \ndon't want to have an honest conversation say we need to wait. Well, \nfor how long? Because we wait, and we wait, and we will see evil rear \nits ugly head over and over again, and we are told to wait again.\n  We have enough information today for Congress to do its job and try \nto keep our constituents safe from gun violence. We had enough \ninformation before yesterday to act, but what Congress does not have is \nthe political will to act. My friends, this must change. Thoughts and \nprayers are not going to stop the next mass shooting. Merely talking \nabout doing something about the mentally ill obtaining guns isn't going \nto stop the next deranged person with hate in their soul from \ncommitting yet another mass murder. The Second Amendment does not mean \nthat Americans should have to risk getting shot because they walked \ndown the wrong street in a city or decided to go to a music festival in \nLas Vegas or a night club in Orlando or an elementary school in Newtown \nor a movie theater in Aurora or a church on Sunday in Texas.\n  After each of these horrific acts of violence, what happened here in \nCongress? Nothing. More than a month after Las Vegas, we still can't \neven tackle the most obvious fixes like banning bump stocks. Plain and \nsimple, Americans are being slaughtered and Congress is refusing to \nprotect them.\n  I hear my colleagues who rightly say we can't pass laws to stop every \ninstance of a deranged gunman who wants to kill innocent men, women, \nand children, just like our other criminal laws will not necessarily \nstop every instance of crime, but there is no excuse for not even \ntrying. Everyone in this Chamber knows that a shooting in a church is \nsomething that should never happen in this country. Mr. President, I \nthink you would agree with that. I think everyone who serves in this \nChamber would agree with that. So then why aren't we doing anything to \nstop this violence? Why aren't we making it harder for a crazed, evil \nperson to get their hands on a weapon of war?\n  It makes me wonder what our colleagues are waiting for. Are they \nwaiting for the NRA to come in and give them cover and tell them it is \nOK to act? Are they waiting for the NRA to give them permission to \nstand up and do something? If the NRA said today assault rifles or bump \nstocks should be banned, it would be done tomorrow. That is the sad \ntruth of this place, but we know the NRA will not say that because they \nwant to keep selling these weapons of war to anyone who is willing to \nbuy them, no matter how unsafe it makes it for the rest of us.\n  Congress has caved in over and over again to the enormous pressure by \nthe NRA and the gun industry--which just wants to protect their \nprofits--and has ignored the vast majority of Americans. Gun owners and \nnongun owners alike support commonsense measures to keep their fellow \nAmericans safe.\n  These mass slaughters continue, and Congress has done nothing--\nabsolutely nothing. To me, this is a monumental failure of leadership, \nand it is no wonder that gun violence and mass shootings happen here at \na higher rate than any other developed country in the world. This has \nto change. It is not enough to solve the individual crime after the \nfact. We have to take meaningful, real action to prevent the next one. \nThis is what has to happen. To those who doubt that Congress can \nactually get something done, we already know that, depending on the \nmotivation, depending on whom Congress is actually listening to, \nCongress is fully capable of moving quickly to enact change. Instead of \nacting like its hands are tied and refusing to do anything--which is \nwhat is happening right now--far more often than not, Congress listens \nto the special interests instead of the people who actually elect them \nto keep them safe.\n  Look at the shameful state of our gun laws now and tell me if you \nthink these laws came about because families in our States demanded \nthem or was it because the NRA demanded them? Congress has turned a \ncollective back on strengthening and expanding our national background \ncheck system. We should be fixing the holes in the system--whatever is \nnecessary--not just\n\n\nshrugging our shoulders and saying there is nothing that can be done. \nWho do you think demanded that we don't fix the background check \nsystem? Was it families in your State or was it the NRA? Congress \nrefuses to ban high-capacity magazines, which are literally made for \nwar, and let killers fire dozens of rounds without having to stop and \nreload. Who do you think demanded that, families or the NRA?\n  Congress still refuses to ban assault weapons, which are designed for \nwar--designed to kill as many people as possible as rapidly as possible \nbut are given different names so they can be sold in the civilian \nworld. Who do you think demanded that, our families or the NRA?\n  Congress is on the verge of passing legislation to make it easier \nright now for killers to buy suppressers, known by many of us as \nsilencers, to attach to their weapons and make it harder for the police \nto do their jobs and catch violent criminals. Who do you think demanded \nthat? Certainly not the police and not our families--the NRA.\n  Congress is dragging its feet on banning bump stocks, the inexpensive \npiece of equipment the killer in Las Vegas used to turn its already-\npowerful firearm into an automatic weapon capable of firing hundreds of \nrounds per minute. Who do you think demanded that, families or the NRA?\n  Just this February, Congress overturned a rule that had prevented \npeople who were so incapacitated that they could no longer handle their \nown finances from getting their hands on a gun. Who do you think \ndemanded that, families or the NRA?\n  Congress even went so far as to pass a law that blocked the Centers \nfor Disease Control from studying the issue of gun deaths the way they \nare allowed to study any other cause of death in this country. Why? \nBecause it is an attempt to hide the overwhelming data showing that \nkeeping guns out of the hands of dangerous people would decrease gun \ncrime. Who do you think demanded that? Who do you think demanded that \nCongress suppress the facts and the alarming data about gun violence? \nDo you think it was families or the NRA?\n  This really has to change. Congress needs to start protecting the \npeople we were elected to represent. Their voices matter, and it really \ndoes matter whom you are listening to. Their voices matter, and they \nmust be heard. We must listen and enact change that would actually help \nto keep our States safer from gun violence. We are the ones who need to \nact. We can't ignore our responsibility to keep our country safe from \nthis kind of violence.\n  To all the people who are watching us right now, I would say this: \nAfter all these massacres, pay attention to what your elected leaders \nare saying. Pay attention to what they are actually doing. Watch how \nthey react. Look closely at how they use their time here. Listen to \nwhat they say or don't say. After these mass shootings, did they tell \nyou we were going to bow our heads for a moment of silence and leave it \nthere or did they tell you we were going to fight with every bit of \nenergy to actually fix these broken gun laws and protect our American \ncitizens?\n  Democracy only works when regular people stand up and demand action. \nI urge everyone listening today to demand that action and to hold \nelected leaders accountable and to ask them to pass meaningful gun \nreform now.\n  I yield the floor.", "turn": 8, "speaker": "Mrs. GILLIBRAND", "itemno": 12}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, today we join the stunned community of \nSutherland Springs, TX--a small town near San Antonio--in mourning the \nloss of too many innocent lives. One innocent life is too many.\n  I listened to the impassioned comments of our colleague from New York \nasking us to do something, but I actually think it is important we \nunderstand exactly what did happen, and once the fog of this terrible \ntragic event lifts, after the law enforcement agencies can do the \nappropriate investigation, then I think it is appropriate for us to \nask: What can we do, consistent with the Constitution and laws of the \nUnited States--what can we do to make something like this less likely?\n  I wish I was optimistic there was some magic wand we could wave and \nthat we could prevent terrible tragedies like this, but in a free and \nopen society, unfortunately, we don't have that magic wand.\n  On the other hand, we have arrived at a consensus, I think, in this \ncountry, that background checks, for example, are appropriate for \npeople suffering from mental illness, people who committed previous \nfelonies. Those people are banned from possessing or purchasing \nfirearms, and there is a consensus that they should be banned.\n  There are some early reports--and, again, the fog of this terrible \ntragedy has not yet lifted. We need clarity in order to know what did \nand did not happen and where we might be able to act to make a \ndifference. There is some indication by some news reports that this \nindividual had committed domestic violence and had been convicted of \nthat by a court-martial. That, too, would likely have been a \ndisqualifying factor in his ability to possess or purchase firearms. So \nwe need to know exactly what the facts are.\n  I appreciate the passion of our colleague from New York. We are all \nstunned by what happened, but I think being rational people, we ought \nto want to know exactly what the facts are before we decide what the \nbest course of action might be. It may be that, like we saw a few years \nback at Virginia Tech, an individual who had previously been \nadjudicated mentally ill, that determination, that judgment was not \nentered into the National Instant Background Checks System run by the \nFBI, and because it wasn't--because of a failure of communication \nbetween the State and Federal authorities--he was able to purchase a \nfirearm when he was legally disqualified from being able to do so.\n  So those are the sorts of things I think we could work together on. I \nknow, for example, after the terrible shooting in Las Vegas, I was \nshocked, like so many others were, that somebody could essentially \nbypass the prohibition against making a semiautomatic weapon into an \nautomatic weapon by the use of the so-called bump stock. As somebody \nwho enjoys the outdoors and is a hunter and enjoys recreational \nshooting, I can tell you I know of no sportsman, no hunter, who uses a \nbump stock. It seems to me the sole purpose of this is to bypass the \nprohibition about turning semiautomatic weapons into automatic weapons. \nThat is something I hope the Senate Judiciary Committee will continue \nto look into and determine whether the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and \nFirearms ought to be extended the authority to regulate the so-called \nbump stocks.\n  Back when President Obama was President of the United States, the \nBureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms said they did not believe they \nhad the authority, but several of us have written to them and asked \nthem to clarify for us just where they think they do have authority and \nwhere they feel they need additional authority so we can work with \nthem, hopefully, to prevent terrible tragedies like that from occurring \nin the future.\n  Yesterday we all received the news that a gunman opened fire on \nparishioners at First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, TX, killing \nat least 26 people during the Sunday morning church service. I can't \nimagine a more vulnerable time. People were sitting in the pews with \ntheir heads bowed and their eyes closed and then were exposed to this \nmadman unleashing death in that house of worship. The victims included \nyoung children and a pregnant woman, among others. All 26 of them are \nnow gone, aged 18 months to 72 years old.\n  This small community and an entire Nation must now bind its wounds as \nwe mourn the dead and meet the face of evil with moral clarity and a \nnewfound determination to stem the violence that continues to plague \nthe United States of the America.\n  We saw in New York that somebody used a vehicle--a car--to mow down \npeople and to kill people as an act of terrorism.\n  We are vulnerable in so many ways because we are an open society. \nUnfortunately, these sorts of tragedies seem to come back to us time \nand again, and we in Texas are not immune.\n  We remember the knife attack at the University of Texas in Austin \nearlier this year. We remember the shooting of police officers in \ndowntown Dallas last year, where five police officers perished, and at \nFort Hood in 2009. Each of\n\n\nthese events has been shocking, inexplicable, and, certainly, \nreprehensible.\n  This tragedy may be the worst of all. That this event occurred in a \nhouse of worship makes it all the more grotesque and despicable. Hymns \nof praise were silenced, and those led to cries for help.\n  The shooting in Sutherland Springs has been called the deadliest mass \nshooting in Texas history. It is perhaps better understood by the words \nof one man whose mother and father were both killed yesterday. He was \nsitting on the curb, outside the emergency room, at Connally Memorial \nMedical Center in Floresville, a town nearby. Shaken to the core, he \ncalled the events of yesterday ``unimaginable.'' It is impossible to \ncomprehend what it must have felt like to wake up this morning in \nSutherland Springs--a small, tight-knit, rural community that is \nroughly 35 miles southeast of San Antonio--with so many neighbors lost \nand the sound of yesterday's gunfire and sirens still ringing in the \nair.\n  One of the people who lost her life was Crystal Holcombe, who died \nwith her unborn child and several relatives. Another was Annabelle \nPomeroy, a shy 14-year-old girl, whose uncle describes her as an \n``angel in the flesh.''\n  We know, thankfully, that two Good Samaritans turned on and pursued \nthe shooter and may have prevented this nightmare from lasting even \nlonger. We are grateful for the heroism and the quick decisive action \nof these two men. We know that about 20 injured remain in hospitals, \nincluding a 5-year-old, Ryland Ward, who was shot multiple times.\n  Yesterday I spoke with Texas Governor Greg Abbott and Wilson County \nSheriff Joe Tackitt, Jr., and offered not only my condolences but my \nunequivocal and complete support. Sheriff Tackitt said that the bloody \nscene inside First Baptist was horrific, but that the response to the \ntragedy was instantaneous. First responders from the surrounding area, \nas well as State and Federal officials, inundated Sutherland Springs \nwith logistical resources and personnel, offering their love and \ncompassion, as well--a proud display of what I often see, which is an \nattitude that being a Texan doesn't describe just where you are from. \nIt describes who your family is.\n  Today I join the sheriff, as well as Governor Abbott, and my friend \nRepresentative Henry Cuellar, in whose congressional district this \ntragedy occurred, my colleague in the Senate, Senator Cruz, and so many \nother Texans in asking God for healing and for understanding.\n  We know the investigation into exactly what happened and why is \nongoing, and it is important that we allow this investigation to be \ncompleted so we can know what happened and exactly what we might be \nable to do to prevent tragedies like this from occurring in the future.\n  I hope that Texans who call Sutherland Springs and First Baptist \nChurch home will soon have some answers. I send my thoughts and prayers \nto those who lost parents, children, friends, and relatives in this \noutrageous and inhuman act. I hope each of us will pledge to be a light \nin the darkness. To the families whose lives are forever changed by \nthis atrocity, let us provide a strong shoulder of support.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.", "turn": 10, "speaker": "Mr. CORNYN", "itemno": 14}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, today the U.S. House of Representatives \nbegins marking up H.R. 1, the Tax Cut and Jobs Act, and as the U.S. \nSenate continues to debate tax cuts, I am reminded of a speech that \nformer Democratic President John F. Kennedy delivered in New York City \nin 1962. In fact, it was in December of 1962, when he said:\n\n       In short, it is a paradoxical truth that tax rates are too \n     high today and tax revenues are too low and the soundest way \n     to raise the revenues in the long run is to cut the rates \n     now. The experience of a number of European countries and \n     Japan have borne this out. This country's own experience with \n     tax reduction in 1954 has borne this out. And the reason is \n     that only full employment can balance the budget, and tax \n     reduction can pave the way to that employment. The purpose of \n     cutting taxes now is not to incur a budget deficit, but to \n     achieve the more prosperous, expanding economy which can \n     bring a budget surplus.\n\n  President Kennedy went on to say:\n\n       I repeat: our practical choice is not between a tax-cut \n     deficit and a budgetary surplus. It is between two kinds of \n     deficits: a chronic deficit of inertia, as the unwanted \n     result of inadequate revenues and a restricted economy; or a \n     temporary deficit of transition, resulting from a tax cut \n     designed to boost the economy, increase tax revenues, and \n     achieve--and I believe this can be done--a budget surplus. \n     The first type of deficit is a sign of waste and weakness; \n     the second reflects an investment in the future.\n\n  If someone had just tuned in, they might think I was quoting, \nperhaps, President Reagan or perhaps some other Republican leader. This \nwas President John F. Kennedy in 1962.\n  We need to cut taxes once again and put money back into the pockets \nof the American people. I can state that Montanans need more jobs, but, \nimportantly, we need better paying jobs. Most importantly, they need \nbigger paychecks. The best way to give Montanans a pay raise--how about \ncutting their taxes? We need tax cuts.\n\n\n                       Texas Church Mass Shooting\n\n  Madam President, separately, I just want to express my sincere and \nheartfelt sympathies to the people of Sutherland Springs, TX.

Mr. President, I would like to talk about an issue in my \nState of West Virginia--really my region--that is becoming very \nimportant, I think, to this country's energy security and prosperity.\n  As we know, West Virginia has extensive natural gas liquid resources. \nNearly a century ago, when these resources were discovered, the rapid \ngrowth that followed turned Central West Virginia into a national hub \nfor the petrochemical industry. You know what, we have never looked \nback.\n  Today, chemistry remains our State's second largest industry and \ndirectly impacts other major sectors like energy, biomedical \nengineering, and manufacturing. West Virginia is home to 140 different \nchemical companies that employ nearly 13,000 workers. West Virginia's \nshare of GDP from the chemical industry is the sixth largest in the \ncountry, and these products are about one-quarter of our State's major \ninternational exports. We still have one of the highest concentrations \nof chemical, polymer, and resin manufacturers in the world.\n  The sector is sort of a microcosm of the challenges and opportunities \nfacing this important American industry during a time of fierce \ninternational competition. Estimates show, more than 100,000 workers in \nWest Virginia already have the industrial skills to fill jobs in this \nsector, and there are thousands more who could easily be retrained to \nfill these jobs in this important industry. With our region's abundance \nof natural gas from Marcellus\n\n\nand Utica shale, West Virginia is perfectly positioned for a massive \nincrease of economic growth and new jobs.\n\n  Natural gas liquids provide the building blocks for many of the \nproducts used by our consumers every single day--products ranging from \nthe dashboard in your car or the water bottle that many of us use. \nRight now, we don't have the right infrastructure in place to store and \ndistribute the building blocks that make up these products. As a \nresult, these valuable resources are being used to generate heat and \nelectricity, instead of being made into consumer products. As Energy \nSecretary Perry put it, that's like cooking your breakfast over a fire \nof hundred dollar bills. This represents a huge opportunity to act on \nthis administration's ``America First'' energy policy. It is an \nopportunity to grow an industry here at home with an American workforce \nand America's natural resources.\n  To elevate these issues in Congress, I am proud to serve as the \ncochair of the bipartisan Senate Chemistry Caucus. We host briefings \nabout the importance of this industry to America's economy and national \nsecurity. States that may not have robust petrochemical sectors, \nnonetheless, rely on its products for manufacturing, agriculture, and \nseveral other key industries.\n  For months--I would say more than months, years--I have been \nadvancing the development of an Appalachian natural gas liquids market \nto improve our storage and distribution capabilities. New drilling \ntechnologies have unlocked access to trillions upon trillions of cubic \nfeet of natural gas and their associated liquids in West Virginia, \nPennsylvania, Ohio, and Kentucky. Some of our most downtrodden economic \nareas have this valuable asset right there.\n  Unpredicted just a decade ago, this asset can create a renaissance in \nthe region's petrochemical industry, but this can only happen if \npolicymakers and the private sector seize this once-in-a-generation \nopportunity. To do that, we need to create a natural gas liquid storage \nhub in Central Appalachia. The concept of this new hub is simple. Right \nnow, because we don't have a way to store these liquids, we are unable \nto fully maximize this resource. That hurts producers, refiners, and \nour manufacturers in the State of West Virginia, and Ohio, and beyond.\n  A storage hub and the necessary pipeline infrastructure would create \na robust Appalachian market for natural gas liquids. This would have \nmajor national benefits, and here is why. Let's think about the \nhurricane that just occurred and devastated our friends in Texas. The \ngulf--and particularly Houston and the storage hub at Mont Belvieu, \nTX--dominate the domestic market there. Hurricane Harvey knocked out as \nmuch as 60 percent of that supply. It knocked it offline, and it took a \nmonth to get the hub back up and running. By establishing an \nAppalachian storage hub away from Hurricane Alley, we would add \nredundancy that protects our economy and our national security. Having \nall this storage capacity in only one region of the country only drives \nup production costs for American manufacturers. I would also add that \nthis resource is in Appalachia. Appalachia should have this storage hub \nto be able to capitalize and create the jobs right in our own \nneighborhood.\n  As Appalachia has become a robust producer of natural gas liquids, \npipelines that used to flow from the gulf to the Northeast have been \nreversed. They are now sent to the gulf for storage and refining. It is \nsent back as ethylene to the interior of the country--often Appalachia \nitself--and to the Midwest for manufacturing. This back-and-forth \nobviously drives up prices for the goods you buy every day, from \nfurniture to toys, to cars.\n  To be clear, development of an Appalachian hub would not come at the \nexpense of the gulf's market. It is a comparative advantage. The \nAppalachian hub can more efficiently serve many of the domestic \nmanufacturers, while the gulf can expand its export capacity. Besides \nmaking the national market more efficient and resilient, an Appalachian \nmarket will drive significant development in a region that desperately \nneeds a boost.\n  A recent study found that the Appalachian States of West Virginia, \nOhio, Pennsylvania, and Kentucky would see as much as $35.8 million in \nnew capital investment, creating more than 100,000 jobs by 2025 with \nthis new hub.\n  When Secretary Perry accepted my invitation and visited West Virginia \nin July, the development of an Appalachian natural gas liquid storage \nhub and market was a great topic of emphasis. The Secretary met with \nseveral business leaders as part of a roundtable discussion to discuss \npaths forward in developing a regional ethane market. Needless to say, \nthe Secretary saw the obvious benefits of such a project and that the \nhub could play a key role in the administration's related goals of \nrejuvenating the Appalachian economy and achieving an ``America First'' \nenergy policy.\n  The Secretary and I have discussed how best to bring this public-\nprivate partnership to life since his visit to West Virginia. I think \nall of my colleagues--particularly those representing Appalachia--\nshould be as excited about this concept as the Secretary and I are. \nSeveral private entities are undertaking that initial development work \nright now, with interest coming from both domestic and foreign \ninvestors.\n  I have been engaging frequently with Secretary Perry and with \nCommerce Secretary Ross about making this storage hub a reality. The \nTrump administration understands the importance of this project to the \neconomies of West Virginia and the region. I appreciate their efforts \nto help move our State forward beyond the economic disasters we have \nhad over the last several years. I will continue my advocacy for this \nenormous economic development opportunity and encourage my colleagues--\nnot just from the States I mentioned but all around the country--to \njoin as partners in this effort.\n  Thank you.\n  I yield the floor.", "turn": 22, "speaker": "Mrs. CAPITO", "itemno": 27}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, this morning I drove from Cleveland to \nYoungstown. I was in Youngstown, OH--Mahoning Valley--at Teamsters \nLocal 377 talking to workers. There were maybe 200 of them in the room, \nmostly retirees who are in danger of having their pensions cut--\npensions they earned over a lifetime of hard work.\n  To understand how that happens, when workers are at the bargaining \ntable, whether it is Teamsters, electricians, Steelworkers or SCIU, \nthey so often are willing to give up wages today in order to have a \nsecure retirement in 5 years, 10 years, 20 years, 30 years.\n  That is what these workers chose to do. They chose to give up wages. \nWhether they worked for Schwebel's in Youngstown, whether they worked \nfor Roadway, over the road, whether they were working for any number of \ncompanies, they were willing, at the bargaining table, to give up \nhigher wages today to have money to set aside that was then invested \noften in Wall Street. We will get to that in a minute. It is bad enough \nWall Street squandered those workers' money. It is worse that the \ngovernment that is supposed to look out for these workers simply isn't \ndoing it. One of the retired workers, Ed Barker, told us: We did our \npart. Now it is time for Members of Congress to cross party lines and \ndo theirs.\n  We talk a good game in this body about how we respect workers and \nrespect their work, but I am not sure we always live that. If we really \nvalue a hard day's work in this country, we start by keeping our \npromise to these hard-working Ohioans, Virginians, Montanans, and all \nover this country. We keep our promise to those hard-working people in \nour country, but we can't end there. That is just the beginning of what \nwe need to do to ensure that hard work pays off for ordinary Americans.\n  During his campaign, Candidate Trump made a lot of big promises to \nworkers in Ohio. He ran some of his big rallies across our State. He \nmade big promises to workers in Ohio and across the country. He told \nthem he would put American workers first. Well, the White House today \nlooks like a retreat for Wall Street executives, and many of the people \nthe President has put in charge have a record of doing the opposite of \nputting American workers first.\n  That is certainly true of Peter Robb, the nominee to serve as the \ngeneral\n\n\ncounsel of the National Labor Relations Board. Mr. Robb has spent his \ncareer working to strip workers of their rights, defend corporations \naccused of mistreating workers, and he has tried to undermine the \nwatchdog agency he is now seeking to join. He will be working at the \nNational Labor Relations Board, which is supposed to strike a balance \nand advocate only for American workers. The President's nominee is \nsomeone who received a very high salary building his career defending \ncorporations accused of mistreating workers, working to strip workers \nof their rights, and trying to undermine the NLRB's effort to get a \nfair shake and build a level playing field for workers.\n  Someone who views unions and collective bargaining as a threat to be \ndealt with was primarily the story of Mr. Robb's career, instead of \nhelping to protect the central rights for workers. A person like that \nhas no business serving as the top lawyer for the National Labor \nRelations Board.\n  His nomination is just the latest in a long line of evidence that \nwork simply isn't valued in this country the way it used to be. People \nin Ohio and around the country work harder. They work more days, more \nhours, longer hours, harder than ever before, and they have less to \nshow for it.\n  Over the past 40 years, GDP has gone up, corporate profits have gone \nup, and executive compensation has gone up--all because of the \nproductivity of the American worker, but, fundamentally, the workers \nhaven't shared in the wealth they have created. Again, GDP goes up, \nprofits go up, executive salaries go up, productivity goes up, but \nworkers' wages are stagnant or worse. We know that.\n  We also know people in this body rarely side with workers in that \nequation. One major reason the economic growth has not brought higher \nwages to workers is Americans are less likely to have a union card to \nprotect them. When Americans reminisce about the good jobs that \ndisappeared, I am willing to bet most of those jobs were union.\n  As manufacturing employment declined, the share of workforce \nrepresented by unions declined with it--only more rapidly. I can accept \nthat the workforce is changing, but what we can't accept is more and \nmore of our workers are paid less in wages, have fewer benefits, and \nhave little economic security.\n  It is no coincidence that over the same timeframe, economic growth in \nthis country has been shared among fewer and fewer Americans. Keep in \nmind, as the 1 percent gets richer, they take more and more of the \nprofits, they take more of the productivity gains, and workers are left \nfurther behind.\n  We know what will happen with this so-called tax reform that is being \nconsidered in the House. They are then going to negotiate it right down \nthe hall here in the majority leader's office the same way they did \nhealthcare. They will be right down the hall in the majority leader's \noffice with lots of lobbyists but no light shone, no public, and no \nmedia coverage.\n  We know what happens. We know what happens with tax reform like that. \nThe rich get richer and the middle class shrinks. That is the story of \nthose Teamsters in Youngstown today. As I walked with the crowd of \nTeamsters, I spoke with a number of them on the way in and the way out. \nI asked how long they had driven a truck. Most had driven 30, some 40, \nand a few 45 years. They worked that hard. They gave up wages today so \nthey would have a pension in the future. Yet, right now, because of \nWall Street misfeasance and malfeasance, in large part, and because \ngovernment, the people in this body don't have the guts to stand up for \nthese workers, we know what has happened to their pensions, and we know \nwhat will happen to their pensions if we don't step in and do the right \nthing come December this year.\n  We know what will happen with the tax reform bill, again, written \ndown the hall in the majority leader's office--the same thing. The \nwealthiest 1 percent get richer. The rich get richer and the powerful \nget more power and what happens is, the middle class shrinks. We know \nthat.\n  Last week, I was on the floor with many of my colleagues talking \nabout a case before the Supreme Court--Janus v. AFSCME. The case is \npart of a decades-long attempt to chip away at workers' power in the \nworkplace. Mr. Robb has been part of that effort. The nominee to be the \ntop lawyer at the National Labor Relations Board has been part of the \neffort to chip away at workers' rights, to continue the demeaning and \ndiminishing role of workers in this country, to suppress wages in this \ncountry. He is the person the President of the United States wants to \nserve as the top lawyer on the National Labor Relations Board.\n  What is wrong with that picture? He defended corporations accused of \ndiscrimination of not paying their workers the paychecks they earned. \nImagine, he represented the corporations that tried to keep these \nworkers from getting the paychecks they earned. He worked for an energy \ncompany that was working to defeat workers' organizing effort. His own \nlaw firm's website brags about how they delayed the election 2 more \nyears.\n  You know how it works. My colleagues know this. These workers signed \na petition. They signed a card, if you will, saying they would like to \nhave a union election. A majority of these workers--probably a majority \nof 60, 70 percent--signed a card saying they wanted to have a union \nelection. It is a right in this country. It is a right since the 1930s. \nWhen President Roosevelt pushed through the National Labor Relations \nAct, workers received the right to vote on a union. Mr. Robb's company \nwas bragging. They were bragging that they were able to delay the \nelection for 2 years. So maybe they couldn't defeat the workers, but do \nyou know what you do then? You delay the election because you have \nreally good, high-priced lawyers who know how to do this for \nmanagement, for the corporation.\n\n  If you delay the election for a week, for a month, for a quarter, for \nhalf a year, for a year, for 2 years, you know what happens. Many of \nthose workers who signed that petition who thought they might have a \nshot at the union, some of them got fired, some just left, some of them \nwere ready to retire, maybe some of them died. So by the time the \nelection is held, you have pretty much defeated the organizing effort. \nThat is why people like Mr. Robb don't belong at the National Labor \nRelations Board.\n  We need someone in this job who wakes up every day ready to defend \nAmerican workers, not oppress them, not shut them down, not depress \ntheir wages. You don't want somebody who has spent his career trying to \nbring these workers down.\n  What Mr. Robb doesn't seem to understand is, it is not corporations \nthat drive the economy, it is workers. We grow the economy from the \nmiddle class out.\n  I know you are going to hear a number of my colleagues who support \nthis huge tax break in this tax bill. It is all about cutting the \ncorporate tax so corporations make more money, have higher profits, \nhave higher executive salaries. It will not have anything to do with \nwages. It never does. No matter how profitable the companies are, they \nare not willingly giving higher wages to its workers. You are going to \nhear from these companies. You are going to hear the defenders of these \ncompanies come to this body, and they are going to talk about how \ncorporations are driving the economy; that if you give tax breaks to \nthe richest people in the country, it will trickle down and create jobs \nand increase wages. Well, it hasn't worked that way in the past.\n  In the 1990s, Bill Clinton grew the economy. He focused the tax \nbreaks in the tax bills on the middle-class workers and grew the \neconomy out from the middle. Twenty-two million net private sector jobs \nincreased during the Clinton years.\n  The next 8 years, under President Bush 2, the tax cuts all went to \nthe rich, two major tax cuts--not entirely to the rich but \noverwhelmingly to the rich. For trickle down, zero net increase of \nprivate sector jobs. There were 22 million during the Clinton years \nbecause he focused on the middle class. There was zero job growth \nduring the Bush years because it was trickle-down economics.\n  What is going on in the back room in the majority leader's, Senator \nMcConnell's, back office? It is another tax cut for the rich, trickle \ndown, see what happens. The rich get richer, and the middle class \nshrinks.\n\n\n  What Mr. Robb doesn't understand is, it is not corporations that \ndrive the economy, it is workers. When the workers are doing better, \nthey are buying more things, they are creating more demand, companies \nsell more products, the economy grows. If work isn't valued, if \ncorporations shortchange workers with the help of lawyers like Mr. \nRobb, then Americans can't earn their way to a better life for their \nfamilies no matter how hard they work.\n  We all know, workers are working harder than ever before. They are \nworking longer hours than ever before. They are more productive. \nProfits are up. Executive compensation is up. Wages have been flat. \nWhat is fair about that? What should we do about that? What we should \ndo about that is not to put people on the National Labor Relations \nBoard who want to do more of the same.\n  Whenever we face another attack on American workers and their freedom \nto organize, I think of the words of Pope Francis. He said: ``There is \nno good society without a good union, and there is no good union that \nis not reborn every day in the peripheries--that does not transform the \ndisregarded stones of the economy into cornerstones.'' We need laws \nthat reflect the dignity of every discarded stone, of every American \nworking too many hours for too little pay. The last thing we need is \nanother nominee who doesn't value work, another nominee who doesn't \nrespect the Americans who do it, another nominee who always lines up on \nthe side of the richest people in the country and always is working to \ntake rights away from workers, to take wages away from workers, and to \ntake benefits away from workers. That is the story of Mr. Robb's work \nhistory in the private sector.\n  Is that the kind of person you want representing workers and \nrepresenting the American economy at the National Labor Relations \nBoard? I think not.\n  I urge my colleagues to listen a little bit more. Go to the \nTeamsters' hall in Youngstown like I did today. Listen a little more to \nthe Americans we serve. Listen a little less at the country club, to \nthe big corporations trying to squeeze every last penny out of these \nworkers' hands, to squeeze every last penny out of these workers. \nReject Mr. Robb's nomination.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.", "turn": 24, "speaker": "Mr. BROWN", "itemno": 29}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
