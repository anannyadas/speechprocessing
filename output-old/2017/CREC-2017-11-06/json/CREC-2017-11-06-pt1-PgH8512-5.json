Mr. Speaker, I rise today to talk about \na cornerstone of a student school lunch: milk.\n  Milk is the number one source of nine essential nutrients in the diet \nof many young Americans, and it provides significant health benefits. \nBut over the past few years, milk consumption has been on the decline \nin school lunch programs. That is why, together with Representative Joe \nCourtney, I introduced the School Milk Nutrition Act of 2017.\n  Our bill would ease unnecessary regulations preventing milk \nconsumption\n\n\nin school lunch programs. The bipartisan bill recognizes the importance \nof milk to the health and well-being of school children. It also works \nto improve the variety and availability of milk offered in schools, \nwhich was supported by U.S. Department of Agriculture Secretary Sonny \nPurdue earlier this year. In May, Secretary Purdue directed USDA to \nbegin the process of allowing schools to serve 1 percent flavored milk \nthrough the school meals program.\n  When schoolchildren don't drink milk, they are missing out on \nessential nutrients. I urge my colleagues to support this bill so \nanother generation of children can fall in love with milk.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "180", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H8512-H8513", "wkday": "Monday", "day": "6", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "MILK IS A CORNERSTONE OF STUDENTS' SCHOOL LUNCH", "id": "CREC-2017-11-06-pt1-PgH8512-5", "title": "MILK IS A CORNERSTONE OF STUDENTS' SCHOOL LUNCH"}
