Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and \ncongratulate Janet Petersen, Iowa State Senator and Co-Founder of \nHealthy Birth Day, Inc. for being named a 2017 Women of Influence \nhonoree by the award-winning central Iowa Publication, Business Record.\n  For 18 years, the Business Record has undertaken an exhaustive annual \nreview to identify a standout group of women who have made a \nsignificant difference in business, civic, and philanthropic endeavors \nthroughout the Greater Des Moines Area.\n  Janet didn't always believe she was someone who wanted to be at the \nforefront of public policy. It was through her life experiences that \nshe was ultimately called to public service. During her time in the \nIowa State Legislature, she has been a formidable advocate on the \nissues she is passionate about. Janet is also the founder of a \nnonprofit organization called Healthy Birth Day, which teaches \nprospecting parents how to track the movements of their child in the \nthird trimester.\n  Mr. Speaker, it is an honor to represent Janet in the United States \nCongress and I ask that my colleagues in the United States House of \nRepresentatives join me in congratulating her for receiving this \nesteemed designation,\n\n\nthanking those at Business Record for their great work, and in wishing \nJanet nothing but the best.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. YOUNG of Iowa", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 3}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "180", "extension": true, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "E1516-E1517", "wkday": "Monday", "day": "6", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "TRIBUTE TO JANET PETERSEN", "id": "CREC-2017-11-06-pt1-PgE1516-5", "title": "TRIBUTE TO JANET PETERSEN"}
