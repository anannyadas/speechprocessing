Mr. President, today I wish to congratulate a dear \nfriend whom I have known for more than 30 years, Dr. John Logan III, of \nHenderson, KY. John was recently honored by his community for a \nlifetime of servant leadership. The city dedicated a plaque on the \nHenderson Riverwalk, which is one of the many landmarks that John had \nan indispensable hand in building and one I was proud to work with him \nto help secure. In a surprise ceremony--John thought he was simply \ngoing to lunch with a friend--they honored him for decades of \nphilanthropy and service to his community.\n  The plaque includes a quote from author Margaret Mead, which reads, \n``Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed citizens can \nchange the world; indeed, it's the only thing that ever has.'' These \nwords perfectly encapsulate the impact of my friend John.\n  John serves as the chief medical officer of the Methodist Hospital in \nHenderson, where he started working in 1962 specializing in family \nmedicine. A number of years ago, John embarked on a mission to \nhighlight the extraordinary history of the hospital. Because of his \ntireless work, the successes of this Henderson institution will \ncontinue to be remembered for years to come. In addition to his work \ncaring for patients and leading the administration of the hospital, \nJohn gives of himself to other aspects of the community.\n  In 1971, John joined the Family YMCA's capital campaign, working to \nhelp the group move from its old home downtown to a much larger \nfacility on 5 acres of land. He has continued to work with the YMCA, \nmaking sure that young people in Henderson have a well-equipped \nfacility to enjoy and grow. John also helped establish other community \ninitiatives, including Henderson's Depot Welcome Center and the \nMethodist Hospital's Neonatal Intensive Care Unit.\n  In 2012, the Henderson Community College board of directors presented \nJohn with an award recognizing his substantial service to the school. \nThrough the years, John has taken a keen interest in the students. He \nworked with State legislators and community leaders to raise $1 million \nto support scholarships to the college and to build a fine arts center. \nHis impact will be felt by students for years to come.\n  John has spent his life giving to others--his community, the \nMethodist Hospital, and his friends. So many of the projects in \nHenderson would not have been possible without John's dedicated \nleadership, and I am immensely proud to call him my friend. His decades \nof service have truly made Henderson and Kentucky a better place.\n  I ask all of my colleagues to join me in paying tribute to the \nselfless work of Dr. John Logan, a remarkable Kentuckian and a \nwonderful friend.\n  Mr. President, The Gleaner in Henderson recently published an article \non John's career of service. I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the \narticle be printed in the Record.", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. McCONNELL", "itemno": 0}, {"kind": "recorder", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in ", "turn": -1, "speaker": "The RECORDER", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "recorder", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "the Record, as follows:\n\n                   [From the Gleaner, Oct. 26, 2017]\n\n     Dr. John Logan Honored for Lifetime of Community Volunteerism\n\n                           (By Douglas White)\n\n       It's hard to name a community institution in Henderson that \n     Dr. John Logan hasn't helped or been part of creating.\n       So when it came time to honor his decades of organizing, \n     cheerleading and fundraising for the Henderson community as a \n     whole, city officials picked perhaps the most scenic spot \n     he's had a hand in bringing to reality.\n       ``Every day he wakes up and works to make this community \n     better,'' said Dr. Lee Newberry, one of Logan's colleagues at \n     Methodist Hospital, as a plaque was dedicated Tuesday \n     afternoon at the Seventh Street overlook on the Henderson \n     Riverwalk.\n       ``He's a true example of a servant leader.''\n       Newberry and other speakers at the event offered a long \n     list of community projects, programs and buildings that Logan \n     has helped make happen.\n       A few examples include the modern YMCA facilities, the fine \n     arts center on the campus of Henderson Community College, the \n     downtown Depot building, St. Anthony's Hospice, Colonels to \n     College, the Sandefur Center, and currently in the works, the \n     new 1-69 bridge over the Ohio River.\n       Attorney David Thomason noted, ``Many of those things \n     wouldn't have happened if it hadn't been for John.''\n       Thomason recalled how Logan pushed for, and got, money \n     inserted into the state budget for Henderson's fine arts \n     center. It came literally at the midnight hour, but with a \n     catch: Henderson would have to find a way to contribute \n     $200,000 to make the bonding a reality.\n       When asked, in the middle of the night, if Logan could make \n     it happen, he replied quickly: ``You're damned right!''\n       ``He never met a challenge he didn't embrace,'' said \n     Thomason. ``Once he's on board, the ship doesn't sink. In my \n     opinion, he has done more than any other volunteer in the \n     past 50 years.''\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "The RECORDER", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 3}], "header": {"chamber": "Senate", "num": "180", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "S7011", "wkday": "Monday", "day": "6", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "TRIBUTE TO DR.
