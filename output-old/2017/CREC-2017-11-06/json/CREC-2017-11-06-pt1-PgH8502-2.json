In accordance with this provision, I have \nsent to the Federal Register for publication the enclosed notice \nstating that the national emergency with respect to Iran that was \ndeclared in Executive Order 12170 of November 14, 1979, is to continue \nin effect beyond November 14, 2017.\n  Our relations with Iran have not yet normalized, and the process of \nimplementing the agreements with Iran, dated January 19, 1981, is \nongoing.
