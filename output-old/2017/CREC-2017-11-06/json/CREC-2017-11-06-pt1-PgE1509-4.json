Mr. Speaker, today I remember and honor the life \nof Sruthi Srinivasan who unexpectedly passed away on October 24th this \nyear at the young age of 34.\n  So many people knew Sruthi's passion for design and her amazing \nability to dance. Sruthi's laugh, smile and warm soul could light up a \nroom. She was easy to love and will be missed beyond measure, not only \nin the community of Downer's Grove, but across the nation.\n  Sruthi was known as an incredible designer at her work with Ted \nMoudis in New York and was successful in the variety of roles that she \nhad in the design industry. She was generous, kind, and her spirit was \ninfectious.\n  The Srinivasans and my family have known each other for decades, and \nthey are all cherished friends. Mr. Speaker, I hope we might all keep \nin our thoughts and prayers the Srinivasan family and friends as they \nmourn their loss. In that spirit, I celebrate Sruthi's life and think \nabout what an impact that life made on so many people.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 3}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "180", "extension": true, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "E1509", "wkday": "Monday", "day": "6", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "HONORING THE LIFE OF SRUTHI SRINIVASAN", "id": "CREC-2017-11-06-pt1-PgE1509-4", "title": "HONORING THE LIFE OF SRUTHI SRINIVASAN"}
