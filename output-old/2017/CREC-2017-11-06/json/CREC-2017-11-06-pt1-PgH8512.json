Mr. Speaker, the world's largest religion continues \nto be the world's most persecuted religion. Christians are assaulted, \nmurdered, harassed, and their homes and churches increasingly are \ndestroyed.\n  Recently, in Cairo, while Coptic Christian priest Father Rizkallah \nwas collecting humanitarian aid, he was stabbed to death because he was \na Christian.\n  Now persecution has taken a new twist. While Islamic extremism \ncontinues its genocide on Christians and other different sects of \nIslam, government-sponsored persecution is increasing worldwide. \nAccording to Open Doors, 9 of the top 10 countries where persecution \nexists have large Islam populations. But North Korea, the number one \noffender, is an atheist nation.\n  Ethnic nationalism is also a major driver of persecution. Weak and/or \ntotalitarian governments use Christians as scapegoats to keep a grip on \npower.\n  Religious freedom is mentioned first in our First Amendment because \nit is the most important of all freedoms. It is a God-given right for \nall people of all religions. Americans should lead the way in worldwide \nreligious freedom and in denouncing religious persecution of \nChristians.\n  And that is just the way it is.\n  Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record the Open Doors USA Persecution \nof Christians Watch List.\n\n        Open Doors USA Persecution of Christians Watch List 2017\n\n       1. North Korea\n       2. Somalia\n       3. Afghanistan\n       4. Pakistan\n       5. Sudan\n       6. Syria\n       7. Iraq\n       8. Iran\n       9. Yemen\n       10.
