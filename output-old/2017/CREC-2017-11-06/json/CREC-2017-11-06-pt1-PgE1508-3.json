Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a late member of the \nCo-op City community, Mrs. Ethel T. Winfield, who passed away this year \nat the amazing age of 94 years old. Though Ethel is no longer with us, \nthe legacy she has left with her family, friends, and the community \nwill last forever.\n  Ethel and her beloved husband, Claude, lived in Co-op City and were \nquite active. After moving to the area in the 1960's, Ethel, a devoted \nCatholic, was instrumental in establishing and building the new church, \nSt. Michael the Archangel Roman Catholic Church. While the church was \nbeing built, Ethel held services in her home at 920 Baychester Avenue.\n  Professionally, Ethel worked as a Sample Hand at Vanity Fair in New \nYork City. In 1971, she received certification at the prestigious Mayer \nSchool for Fashion Design. Amazed by her skill and talent, she rose \nfrom a Sample Hand to become an Assistant Designer at Vanity Fair; the \nfirst time anyone ever received this promotion. While at Vanity Fair, \nEthel was concerned with equal rights of all workers. She was a shop \nsteward, and as a union leader, she assisted fellow workers. Ethel \nenjoyed designing, draping and sewing dresses. She wanted her community \nresidents to experience wearing beautiful fabrics and well-fitted \nclothes. She was committed to providing designer quality fitted \nclothing and often said, ``The small amount I charged the bride did not \nyield a profit for me. However, I wanted my community to feel like they \nwere walking down a runway.''\n  Though Ethel's story is full of inspiration, there was tragedy. In \nJuly 1957, Claude and Ethel were driving to Virginia with their son, \nWillie. During the trip, the car over turned in a ditch. Willie lost \nhis life and Claude was injured badly. He had sustained internal \ninjuries and almost every bone in his body had been broken. Ethel \nvisited her husband for 2 years in the Veteran's Administration \nHospital and never doubted her husband would live. She encouraged him \nto complete his therapy which included learning to use his left hand \nand arm to shave and complete other tasks. It was her belief and \nencouragement in those terribly tragic moments that gave Claude the \nstrength to recover.\n  As you might imagine from hearing that story, Ethel's true passion \nwas her family, which includes sons, Claude L. Winfield, and Siddique \nAli Shahbaaz; daughter-in-laws Michelle Deal Winfield and Cynthia Ali \nShahbaaz; grand children Gary Winfield and wife Rasheed Winfield, Marie \nWinfield and spouse Konrad Pust, Michael C. Winfield, Nikkea Winfield, \nJason Winfield and Makeda Winfield; nieces Katherine Miles and Vida \nHinton with cousin Janett Baughaum; and great grandchildren Sophie and \nKoemi Winfield-Pust. She loved each of them dearly.\n  Ethel Winfield lived a long and blessed life. In later years, she \ntook art classes at the Baychester Visual Arts class on Tuesday \nevenings. Like many budding artist, Ethel gave away sketches and \ndrawings, making friends along the way. That was Ethel--an artist, \nalways thinking of others.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. ENGEL", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 3}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "180", "extension": true, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "E1508", "wkday": "Monday", "day": "6", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "HONORING ETHEL T.
