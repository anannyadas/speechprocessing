Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of the 20th \nAnniversary of the Duffy Health Center.\n  The Duffy Health Center has been serving as Barnstable County's \nprimary health care provider for homeless adults since 1997. What \nstarted as a small volunteer organization in 1988 has now turned into a \nmajor pillar of this community, working to serve the homeless men and \nwomen of Cape Cod.\n  This clinic is made up of an incredible group of people that are \nworking tirelessly to better the Ninth Congressional District. Over the \npast twenty years they have helped those suffering from addiction, \nmental health issues, and other serious medical problems find their way \nto applying for master's degrees, retaining full-time employment, and \nbuilding new lives. They have provided vital assistance to people \ntrying to apply for benefits, receive counseling, or find a support \ngroup.\n  By treating people with dignity and respect, the hope they have \nrestored in countless members of our community is unparalleled.\n  Mr. Speaker, I am proud to honor the 20th anniversary of the Duffy \nHealth Center for their dedication to bettering their community. I ask \nthat my colleagues join me in thanking them for their invaluable \nservice and wishing them all the best in the many years to come.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. KEATING", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 3}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "180", "extension": true, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "E1509", "wkday": "Monday", "day": "6", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "IN RECOGNITION OF THE DUFFY HEALTH CENTER", "id": "CREC-2017-11-06-pt1-PgE1509", "title": "IN RECOGNITION OF THE DUFFY HEALTH CENTER"}
