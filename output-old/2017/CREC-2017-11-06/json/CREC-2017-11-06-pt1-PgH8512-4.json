Mr. Speaker, today I had the wonderful opportunity to join \nwith a group of civic, business, and community leaders to introduce a \nnew program in the city of Philadelphia called Hub of Hope. The \nbrainchild of SEPTA and Project HOME, Hub of Hope is a new initiative \nto address homelessness in our city.\n  According to the Department of Housing and Urban Development, more \nthan 6,000 people are homeless in the city of Philadelphia, and 15,000 \nare homeless in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.\n  Ending homelessness requires a team effort on the city, State, and \nFederal level. I am committed to doing my part to ensure that people do \nnot have to sleep on the streets and that their personal, physical \nsecurity, and mental health needs are addressed in a comprehensive \nmanner. I look forward to working with the people of SEPTA and Project \nHOME on the new Hub of Hope program.\n  Hub of Hope is another tool in our toolbox to help move our middle \nneighborhoods forward. With tools like Hub of Hope in our toolbox, I \nknow that, together, we can continue to work to build a stronger \nPhiladelphia, block by block.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. EVANS", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "180", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H8512", "wkday": "Monday", "day": "6", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "HUB OF HOPE", "id": "CREC-2017-11-06-pt1-PgH8512-4", "title": "HUB OF HOPE"}
