Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak against the Republican tax \nproposal to raise taxes on the middle class. Moreover, congressional \nRepublicans claim to be pro-life, but this tax bill takes a very \ndifferent track.\n  Republicans eliminate the tax deduction for medical expenses, which \nwill crush millions of seniors and people with chronic illnesses. This \nis antilife, not pro-life.\n  Republicans eliminate credits for adoption of children, including \ndisabled children. This is antilife, not pro-life.\n  Republicans eliminate incentives for employers to provide childcare \nassistance to employees. This is antilife, not pro-life.\n  Oh, yes. Republicans also eliminate the student loan interest \ndeduction, making payments for college more expensive. They threw that \nin there, too. This is antifamily, antilife, not pro-life for the next \ngeneration.\n  Meanwhile, the six biggest Wall Street banks, as well as big \npharmaceutical companies, will have their taxes reduced by billions. \nExcess is rewarded again as taxes are raised on the middle class. The \nvast majority of benefits will go to big corporations, pushing more \njobs offshore.\n  Multimillionaires are happily adding up their winnings. Trump, his \nbillionaire buddies, and his heirs are laughing all the way to the \nbank.\n  The Republican tax plan is immoral, unfair, and antilife. I urge my \ncolleagues to scrap it. Life matters.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Ms. KAPTUR", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "180", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H8512", "wkday": "Monday", "day": "6", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "REPUBLICAN TAX PROPOSAL IS ANTI-LIFE", "id": "CREC-2017-11-06-pt1-PgH8512-2", "title": "REPUBLICAN TAX PROPOSAL IS ANTI-LIFE"}
