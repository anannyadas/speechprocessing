ELIOT L. ENGEL\n\n                              of new york\n\n                    in the house of representatives\n\n                        Monday, November 6, 2017\n\n   Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure to recognize a member of \nthe Riverdale Temple community, Dr. Rachel Levi Radna, who this year is \nbeing honored by the Temple at their annual Gala Dinner.\n  Rachel was born in Tel Aviv, Israel. She moved to the United States \nwith her family when she was 12 years old. Rachel attended George \nWashington High School and then Hunter College in the Bronx for her \nundergraduate degree. She went to CUNY for her doctoral degree in \nBiochemistry. While at Hunter, she met her husband, Dr. Richard Radna, \nwith whom she has three wonderful children, Rudolph, Rebeka, and \nRaphael. She recently became a grandmother to Rebeka's baby son, Julian \nAvi. Rather than pursuing a career in Biochemistry, Rachel managed her \nhusband's Neurosurgical Practice, as it allowed her to take care of her \nfamily. Rachel's family is the legacy that she has created, and they \nare her true pride and joy.\n  Rachel was not a regular worshiper until she started to go to \nservices at Riverdale Temple. There was something at Riverdale Temple \nthat sparked a light in her that continues to shine. She went from \ncongregant to member of the Board of Directors, and she has been the \nPresident of the Congregation for the past 10 years. With such \ncontinuity, Rachel is the glue that seems to keep the Temple held \ntogether. She has worked closely with Rabbi Lewis and, most recently, \nRabbi Gardner. When the clergy are on vacation in the summer, Rachel \ncoordinates and leads lay-led services, at which she often functions as \nboth Rabbi and Cantor.\n  Aside from her involvement in Riverdale Temple, Rachel loves to knit, \nbake, and cook. She enjoys opera, karaoke, Israeli music and dancing. \nHer favorite part of being President is being on the Bimah during these \npast 10 years and watching our religious school children grow to become \nB'nai Mitzvah. She is also the co-President of the Riverdale Temple, a \nwonderful honor in and of itself.\n  Rachel has done so much for our community and is most deserving of \nthis recognition. Congratulations to her on receiving this great honor.\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "180", "extension": true, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "E1511", "wkday": "Monday", "day": "6", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "HONORING RACHEL RADNA", "id": "CREC-2017-11-06-pt1-PgE1511-2", "title": "HONORING RACHEL RADNA"}
