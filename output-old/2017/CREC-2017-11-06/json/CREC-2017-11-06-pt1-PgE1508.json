Mr. Speaker, I was unavoidably absent in the House \nchamber for votes on Friday, November 3, 2017. Had I been present, I \nwould have voted Yea on Roll Call vote 605 and Nay on Roll Call vote \n606.\n  I was absent in the House Chamber due to travelling to the devastated \nisland of Puerto Rico in the wake of Hurricane Maria. A vote was called \non the floor for H.R. 3922 to reauthorize the Children's Health \nInsurance Program and other public health initiatives under the \nAffordable Care Act. I would have voted Nay on this legislation because \nthis bill would raise premiums for seniors, limit benefits for Medicaid \nrecipients and slash grace periods from 90 days to 30 days, which would \nresult in thousands of Americans losing their healthcare. Furthermore, \nthis bill funds a mere $1 billion dollars to Puerto Rico in the midst \nof a dire crisis on the island.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. GUTIERREZ", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 3}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "180", "extension": true, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "E1508", "wkday": "Monday", "day": "6", "month": "November"}, "related_bills": [{"type": "HR", "context": "OTHER", "congress": "115", "number": "3922"}], "doc_title": "PERSONAL EXPLANATION", "id": "CREC-2017-11-06-pt1-PgE1508"}
