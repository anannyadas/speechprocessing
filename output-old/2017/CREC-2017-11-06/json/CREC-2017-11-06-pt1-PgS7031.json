{"content": [{"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "D000563", "text": "  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, on September 5, 2 months ago, Attorney \nGeneral Jeff Sessions announced the Trump administration's repeal of \nthe Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals Program, better known as \nDACA.\n  DACA provides temporary legal status to immigrant students if they \nregister with the government, pay a fee, and pass criminal and national \nsecurity background checks. It was renewable on a 2-year basis.\n  The young people protected by DACA are also known as Dreamers. They \ncame to the United States as children. They grew up knowing only this \ncountry, believing this was their home and their future. Many of them \nin their teenaged years were told quietly by a parent that their legal \nstatus was not the status of an American citizen. These kids, who grew \nup singing the Star Spangled Banner and pledging allegiance to the \nAmerican flag, have no country.\n  It was 7 years ago that I sent a letter to President Obama, joined by \nSenator Dick Lugar, a Republican from Indiana. On a bipartisan basis, \nwe asked President Obama to establish a program like the DACA Program. \nThe President responded, and DACA has been a success. Almost 800,000 \nDreamers have come forward. They have surrendered to their government \nthe information that many of their families kept secret for years. They \ntrusted us. They gave this information to the government and said: We \nwant to become part of America's future, and we are willing to sign up, \nsubmit ourselves to the background check, pay our taxes, pay our filing \nfee, and do whatever is necessary. They trusted us. These young people \nwho came forward and received DACA have then gone on to contribute more \nfully to their country. They are teachers, nurses, engineers, first \nresponders, and servicemembers in our military.\n  Now, because of President Trump's announcement, the deportation clock \nis ticking on these young people. Beginning on March 5, 2018, not that \nlong from now, every workday for the following 2 years approximately \n1,400 Dreamers will lose their work permits and be subject to \ndeportation. These young people who trusted our government will now, \nwith the decision to end DACA, find themselves in an extremely \nvulnerable position.\n  When they lose their DACA protection, if they are teachers, they are \nforced to leave their students. If they are nurses, they are forced to \nleave their patients. If they are first responders, they leave their \npost. If they are soldiers willing to die for our country, they are \nforced to leave our military service.\n  This isn't just a looming humanitarian crisis. It is also an economic \ncrisis. The nonpartisan Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy \nreports that DACA-eligible individuals contribute an estimated $2 \nbillion a year in State and local taxes. The Cato Institute, a \nconservative operation, estimates that ending DACA and deporting DACA \nrecipients will cost $60 billion and result in a $280 billion reduction \nin economic growth over the next 10 years.\n  Poll after poll shows overwhelming bipartisan support for these \nDreamers. Even FOX News--no liberal media outlet--recently found that \n79 percent of Americans support a path to citizenship for Dreamers, \nincluding 63 percent of those who voted for President Trump. Sixty-\nthree percent, or almost two out of three Trump supporters, supports a \nlegal status for Dreamers.\n  The answer is clear. Congress needs to pass the Dream Act, and we \nneed to\n\n\ndo it before we leave Washington, DC, for the holidays.\n  It was 16 years ago that I first introduced this bipartisan \nlegislation to give a path of citizenship to these young people. In \nJuly I introduced the most recent version with my friend, Lindsey \nGraham, a Republican Senator from South Carolina.\n  Over the years I have come to the floor almost 100 times to tell \nindividual stories of the Dreamers. These stories tell us what is at \nstake when we consider the fate of DACA and the Dream Act. Today, I \nwant to tell you about Ha Eun Lee.\n  When she was 6 years old, her family came to the United States from \nKorea. She grew up in Bloomfield Hills, MI. Here is what Ha Eun says \nabout her childhood in the United States: ``I was fortunate enough to \ngrow up learning that diversity is encouraged and differences are not \njust tolerated but welcomed.''\n  Ha Eun was a good student and committed to public service. In high \nschool she was a member of the National Honor Society, received the \nPrincipal's Academic Achievement Award, and was an Oakland Activities \nAssociation Scholar Athlete. She was a member of the track and field \nteam during all 4 years of high school.\n  Ha Eun is now a senior at the University of Michigan, majoring in \nEnglish. She volunteers with the Red Cross, and she is copresident of \nan organization called The Supply, which raises money to help students \nin Nairobi, Kenya, obtain an education. As copresident, Ha Eun has \nexpanded this organization's efforts, and they are now volunteering \nlocally near Detroit.\n  Ha Eun was also a policy and programs intern for the Asian Americans \nAdvancing Justice Center.\n  As Ha Eun completes her last year of college, her dream is to become \na lawyer. She wrote me a letter, and here is what she said:\n\n       Although I'm legally labeled as an ``alien'' in this \n     country I call home, I believe I am an American. And I \n     believe this not solely because I live, study, work and \n     contribute to this country, but because I believe in the core \n     values all Americans share as a nation: liberty, justice, and \n     prosperity.\n\n  Ha Eun and other Dreamers have so much to contribute to our country, \nbut without DACA or the Dream Act, they will be deported back to \ncountries where they haven't lived since they were children. Will \nAmerica be stronger if we deport people like Ha Eun? I think the answer \nis obvious.\n  When we introduced the Dream Act, Senator Graham said: ``The moment \nof reckoning is coming.'' That moment has arrived. Congress has a \nresponsibility to do our job and make the Dream Act the law of the land \nbefore the end of the year, before we go home for the holidays; \notherwise, we will bear the responsibility for forcing hundreds of \nthousands of talented young immigrants out of the workforce and putting \nthem at risk of immediate deportation.\n  Many of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle are interested in \nfinding a path to get this done. I salute all of them who in good faith \nhave offered their help. We have to focus now. We have to come together \nand focus.\n  Many of my Republican colleagues have said that we need to put in \nborder security elements. Count me in. Let's sit down and have an \nhonest discussion about making our borders safer and stronger. I will \ngladly join that conversation. I think there are many things we can \nagree on that will lessen the likelihood that there will be those \ncoming across the border in the years to come.\n  I recently met with the head of border security, and we talked about \nthings that might be done. There is something called a Z Portal. I \ndidn't know about it. It is a virtual x ray machine, a low-level \nradiation x ray machine that can x ray vehicles and determine whether \nthey are secreting individuals or contraband that shouldn't be allowed \nin this country. He talked about one particular border crossing and \nsaid: We have a Z Portal there, but it can be used on only about one \nout of every five vehicles. He said: I would like to have more of them.\n  I think he should. Why wouldn't we make that part of border security? \nI said: What about other things coming into this country, other than \npeople?\n  He said: One thing we are concerned about is fentanyl.\n  Fentanyl is a chemical that is used to enhance the addiction of \nheroin, and, sadly, it is deadly. Many heroin addicts die when they \nlace the heroin with fentanyl and inject it, so we try at the borders \nto stop the importation of this fentanyl from China and other countries \ninto the United States. I asked him about it.\n  He said: Sadly, we don't have enough new spectrometers, which are \nused to test these chemicals. We need them to stop the flow of this \ndeadly drug into our country and to protect the men and women who are \ndoing the actual surveillance.\n  Isn't that something we can agree on, on a bipartisan basis, to make \nour borders safer, to lessen the likelihood of people dying from the \nopioid heroin crisis? These are things we can do together.\n  Somehow we haven't been able to come up with a list of particulars \nfrom the other side of what they would like to move forward on, but I \nam ready, willing, and determined to get this done.\n  We have to do this this year. There is no excuse. There are too many \nlives at stake, not just the 780,000 DACA individuals but all of the \npeople whom they are helping in their lives today. They are depending \non us.\n  We are running out of time. I urge my colleagues on both sides of the \naisle to join me in this constructive and bipartisan effort.\n  I yield the floor.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. DURBIN", "itemno": 0}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 1}], "header": {"chamber": "Senate", "num": "180", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "S7031-S7032", "wkday": "Monday", "day": "6", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "DACA", "id": "CREC-2017-11-06-pt1-PgS7031", "title": "DACA"}
