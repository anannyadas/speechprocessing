Mr. Speaker, it has been just about 100 hours since the \nHouse Republican leadership released their tax plan finally, not only \nto the American people, but also to their own rank and file Members.\n  I represent a great district, it is eastern Connecticut, it is about \nhalf the State geographically, and it is home to the University of \nConnecticut, Electric Boat shipyard, Groton Navy base, Coast Guard \nAcademy. I am very proud of the fact that these are really sharp folks, \nand in that less than 100-hour period, I have had about 700 emails and \ncalls into my office from people who have looked at this plan, have run \nthe numbers, have looked at what the existing Tax Code provides, and \nlooked at what the net impact will be if this plan were ever to become \nlaw.\n  Louis from Norwich, Connecticut, who is a tax preparer, describes a \nneighbor of his who is 68 years old, she lives by herself, she earns \n$33,000 in pension and Social Security income, only of which $21,000 is \ntaxable, and she has a small mortgage.\n  She looked at the Republican tax plan, which includes a standard \ndeduction of $12,500, and that is it. Her new tax will be $1,014 if \nthat plan were to go into effect.\n  Under existing law, the itemized deductions that she can claim today \nare roughly about $12,500, the same amount as the standard deduction, \nbut she is also able to claim a personal exemption, which every \nAmerican is entitled to under the existing Tax Code. With that existing \nplan, her net taxes are $445. So this tax plan will more than double \nher taxes.\n  Now, $33,000 a year for a 68-year-old, I would say that is barely \nmiddle class, but certainly it is middle class under a lot of \ndefinitions as a homeowner, yet this tax plan is increasing her taxes \nby over 100 percent.\n  Mark from Clinton contacted me about the fact that this tax plan is \ngoing to eliminate the deduction for qualified medical expenses above \n10 percent of your adjusted gross income. What does that mean? If you \nhave got medical expenses for eyeglasses, hearing aids, or you have \nsomeone in a nursing home that you are paying out-of-pocket expenses \nfor, or you have a home healthcare aide coming into your home that is \nnot covered under your insurance, you can deduct that off of your taxes \nto the extent that it exceeds 10 percent of your adjusted gross income.\n  Mark from Clinton is one of those people. Clinton, Connecticut, is a \nvery middle class community. His taxes are going up.\n  That qualified medical deduction, again, is something that was \nrepeated over and over from individuals who contacted my office, who \ncan't believe that, again, they are doing the right thing, they are \npaying their bills for their healthcare--for themselves or for their \nkids or for their aunt or their parent--and they are losing that \ndeduction. I am sorry. The standard deduction that is being offered as \na compensation doesn't come close to helping an individual in that \nsituation.\n  In addition, the State tax deduction, which the present Tax Code \nallows, is gone under this proposal. In the State of Connecticut, they \nhave calculated that families that earn between $50,000 and $200,000 a \nyear will see their taxes increase by 14 percent under this proposal.\n  So, Mr. Speaker, we are talking about a plan which was sold to the \ncountry as a tax cut for the middle class. Again, there are lots of \nother economic incentives that they put in there supposedly for \ncorporations to cut their corporate tax rate and cut the rates for \npeople in the top 1 percent. Again, it is totally imbalanced, but I am \ngoing to set that aside for the moment, because what was also \nguaranteed and promised was that middle class Americans would see their \ntaxes going down, people like Louis from Norwich; Mark from Clinton; \nand Jason from Niantic, who is going to lose his college student loan \ninterest rate deduction.\n  They eliminate the college student loan interest rate reduction. \nAgain, we are living in a time right now where student loan debt is \n$1.3 trillion. One of\n\n\nthe few ways that you can manage that debt is being able to deduct it \noff of your taxes. That is being eliminated under the House Republican \nplan.\n  Now, if I sound a little worked up, it is because, literally, within \nminutes, the House Ways and Means Committee is going to start marking \nup this bill. Not one hearing is being held for outside voices to sort \nof at least crunch through the numbers of this proposal. The plan is \nfor Speaker Ryan to force a vote next week. We are talking less than 10 \ndays for rewriting the U.S. Tax Code, which has not been rewritten \nsince 1986.\n  When it was done under President Reagan, it took a year for the \nprocess to unfold, and that was the right way to do it, to allow the \nsubcommittees to take a look at their provisions of the Tax Code on the \nWays and Means Committee, to hold hearings, to actually have an \nintelligent, thoughtful exchange of ideas before you mark it up, rather \nthan jamming it to the floor, when you are taking away people's \nqualified medical expenses. Again, this is just the tip of the iceberg.\n\n  The deduction that people get for dependent care assistance \nprograms--if you have a kid who is developmentally disabled and needs a \npersonal care attendant in your home right now, you can deduct that--\nthat is being taken away.\n  This is a bad plan. We need to slow down; we need to give the \nAmerican people a chance to understand this better. Again, I call on \nthe Ways and Means Committee to, again, slow down and cancel the \nmarkups that are scheduled this week.\n", "turn": 1, "speaker": "Mr. COURTNEY", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "180", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H8499-H8500", "wkday": "Monday", "day": "6", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "THE REPUBLICAN TAX PLAN", "id": "CREC-2017-11-06-pt1-PgH8499-4", "title": "THE REPUBLICAN TAX PLAN"}
