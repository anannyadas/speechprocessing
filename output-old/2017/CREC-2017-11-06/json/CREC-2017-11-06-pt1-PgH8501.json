Mr. Speaker, slashing the corporate tax rate from 35 \npercent to 20 percent means one thing: a massive windfall for \ninvestors. While the champagne flows at the Trump Hotel after-party, \nmiddle class Americans would get nothing from this plan other than \ntheir deductions taken away for medical expenses, housing, and college \nloan interest payments. People won't even be able to deduct for most \nState and local income taxes paid, while large corporations would \ncontinue to do so.\n  Here is the real shocker: fully 35 percent of the windfall, between \n$500 billion and $700 billion this decade, will go to foreign investors \nwho own 35 percent of American stock. That money will be lost to us \nforever. It won't be there for Medicare or Medicaid or anything else.\n  Blowing up our deficit by $1.5 trillion while transferring that much \nwealth to big corporations is a terrible idea. It is atrocious when you \nrealize that we won't just be spoiling superrich Americans with \nbillions of dollars, we will be spoiling superrich foreigners, too.\n  Let's stop this speeding train and come up with a bipartisan tax plan \nthat works for all Americans.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. RASKIN", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "180", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H8501", "wkday": "Monday", "day": "6", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "A MASSIVE WINDFALL FOR INVESTORS", "id": "CREC-2017-11-06-pt1-PgH8501", "title": "A MASSIVE WINDFALL FOR INVESTORS"}
