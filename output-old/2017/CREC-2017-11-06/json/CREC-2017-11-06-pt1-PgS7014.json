Mr. President, today I wish to honor an Iowan who \nserved bravely during the Vietnam war as an Active-Duty nurse and spent \nnearly three decades in the Army Reserves.\n  LTC Marta Ford grew up in the small town of Killduff in Iowa's Jasper \nCounty. Her father was a World War II veteran who served as a \nbombardier, flying missions over Europe. She decided to join the Army \nNurse Corps at the age of 19, while still in nursing school. Ford \nunderwent basic training in 1966 at Fort Sam Houston in Texas. Then, \nshe was stationed at Fort Lee in Virginia. Ford served as an Active \nDuty member of the Army Nurse Corps until 1969 and remained in the Army \nReserves until 1975. She rejoined the Reserves in 1980 and served until \nretirement in 2004.\n  Currently, Ford serves her local community as chair of the Jasper \nCounty Commission of Veterans Affairs. In 2013, Ford became the first \nfemale commander at the American Legion Post 111 in Newton, IA.\n  She is just one of the many women and Iowans who served our Nation \nduring the Vietnam war era. All those who honorably served deserve our \nthanks for their service to our country. I ask my colleagues to join me \nas I proudly recognize LTC Marta Ford, an Iowan who dedicated her life \nto service and sacrifice on behalf of this great Nation.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mrs. ERNST", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 3}], "header": {"chamber": "Senate", "num": "180", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "S7014", "wkday": "Monday", "day": "6", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS", "id": "CREC-2017-11-06-pt1-PgS7014", "title": "ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS"}
