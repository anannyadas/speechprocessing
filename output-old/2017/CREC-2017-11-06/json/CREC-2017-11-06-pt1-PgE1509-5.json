Mr. Speaker, on November 13, William M. Fly will \ncelebrate his 100th birthday in a newly refurbished home thanks to the \nselfless efforts of volunteers from across the country, responding to \nthe damages caused by Hurricane Harvey.\n  Over the course of a century, Bill, as his friends and family know \nhim, has traveled the country and the world, but his home has always \nbeen in the State of Texas.\n  Following his graduation from the University of Texas in 1940, Bill \njoined the U.S. Army Air Force, where he served honorably as a First \nLieutenant in the European Theater of the Second World War.\n  Upon completing his time in the service, Bill and his wife, Mary \nBeth, moved to Houston, TX, where he began a thirty-seven year career \nin the oil and gas industry. Despite moving to\n\n\nNew York City, Chicago, and St. Louis during his career, Bill and his \nwife of sixty-nine years returned to Texas in 1972, to settle in Harris \nCounty.\n  Blessed with four loving daughters, eleven grandchildren, twenty-five \ngreat-grandchildren, and two great-great-grandchildren, Bill and his \nloving wife lived together for another forty-five years, until Mary \nBeth passed away on May 13th, 2017.\n  In August of 2017, the flooding brought by Hurricane Harvey left over \nthree feet of water in Bill's family home of over forty years, severely \ndamaging his house and ruining irreplaceable mementos of his and Mary \nBeth's family.\n  In response to this tragedy, volunteers led by former Navy SEAL, \nMarkus Luttrell and his wife, Melanie, rallied around Bill and made it \ntheir mission to rebuild his home by his 100th birthday.\n  Just two months after the effort began, people from across the \ncountry raised almost $90,000, $15,000 more than their original goal, \nto fund the recovery. Thanks to the tireless efforts of these \nvolunteers, Bill will be able to return to his home by his birthday.\n  As he settles into his newly refurbished home to celebrate his 100th \nbirthday, I join Bill's family, his friends, and his community to thank \nthe volunteers who quickly returned him to his home and wish him a \nhappy birthday as he begins his second century of life.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. BRADY of Texas", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 3}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "180", "extension": true, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "E1509-E1510", "wkday": "Monday", "day": "6", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "IN HONOR OF WILLIAM M.
