Mr. Speaker, I rise to thank and pay tribute \nto Denise Forte, who is my staff director on the Committee on Education \nand the Workforce. After a remarkable 20 plus year career in federal \nservice, today is Denise's last day with us.\n  Denise first came to Capitol Hill as a Women's Research and Education \nInstitute fellow in my personal office in 1994. While she received her \ndegree in computer science from Duke University, Denise's fellowship on \nCapitol Hill made her realize her true professional calling--helping \nensure America's children have equality access to a quality education. \nI recognized her talent and; at the conclusion of her fellowship, hired \nher as a full-time employee where she excelled at several positions, \nincluding as my legislative director.\n  Her passion and talent eventually caught the attention of Congressman \nGeorge Miller, the former Ranking Member and Chairman of the Education \nand the Workforce Committee. Denise seized an opportunity to join the \nCommittee in 2001, where she served in successively senior roles, \neventually becoming Congressman Miller's director of education policy. \nDuring her initial service with the Committee, Denise played integral \nroles in major reforms, including the No Child Left Behind Act, the \nCollege Cost Reduction Act, Child Nutrition Reauthorization, \nreauthorization of the Juvenile Justice Delinquency and Prevention Act, \nand the Student Aid and Responsibility Act, amongst others.\n  Denise left the Committee in early 2011 to join the Obama \nAdministration at the Department of Education's Office of Planning, \nEvaluation, and Policy Development as a deputy assistant secretary. In \nthat capacity, she provided strategic advice and counsel to Secretary \nof Education Arne Duncan. Denise also directed and managed several \npolicy portfolios, including overseeing budget, higher education, and \nearly education policy development.\n  In late 2014, my colleagues in the House Democratic Caucus elected me \nto succeed George Miller as Ranking Member of the Committee on \nEducation and the Workforce. I immediately knew who I wanted to help me \nassemble a staff and lead my team--Denise Forte. As my colleagues know, \nDenise is well-regarded and respected by Members and staff on both \nsides of the aisle. She is known to care deeply and fight vigorously \nfor what she believes in, but Denise always remains focused on \nachieving what's possible. She understands the importance of building \nbridges and working to identify policy areas on which Committee \nDemocrats and Republicans can agree.\n  The best example of that is the most recent reauthorization of our \nnation's landmark education law, the Elementary and Secondary Education \nAct. Despite an increasingly polarized environment, Denise believed in \nthe possible and led my team to realize a full rewrite of the law in \nthe Every Student Succeeds Act, which was enacted last Congress with \noverwhelming bipartisan support. Denise led our\n\n\nteam's effort and helped us accomplish something that hadn't been done \nin nearly 15 years.\n  Denise Forte built her career in public service on getting results, \nmaking meaningful progress for America's students and working families, \nand helping this institution function effectively. She cares deeply \nabout Congress and our Committee's mission, and she will be greatly \nmissed. I wish her well as she gets to spend a little extra time with \nher husband, Kyo, and her beloved sons, Gabe and Johnny, before she \nstarts her next adventure at the Century Foundation.\n  Mr. Speaker, I speak for my staff, Chairwoman Virginia Foxx, and all \nthe members of the Committee on Education and the Workforce in thanking \nDenise Forte for her more than two decades of honorable service to this \ninstitution and the American people.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. SCOTT of Virginia", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 3}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "180", "extension": true, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "E1515-E1516", "wkday": "Monday", "day": "6", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "HONORING DENISE M.
