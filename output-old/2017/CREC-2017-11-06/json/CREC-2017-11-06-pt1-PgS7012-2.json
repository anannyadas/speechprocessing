Mr. President, I am delighted to commend Falmouth \nElementary School in Falmouth, ME, on being named a 2017 National Blue \nRibbon School of Excellence. Serving students from kindergarten through \nthe fifth grade, this outstanding school is one of only 342 schools \nacross the country to receive Blue Ribbon recognition from the U.S. \nDepartment of Education.\n  Created in 1982, the Blue Ribbon Schools Program honors public and \nprivate schools that are either academically superior in their States \nor that demonstrate significant gains in student achievement. The \nschools singled out for this national recognition are models of high \neducational standards and accountability.\n  The Blue Ribbon designation continues a tradition of quality \neducation in Falmouth. Established just 6 years ago, the elementary \nschool is relatively young; however, it has a rich history steeped in \ntradition. The union of two schools in 2011 created the largest \nelementary school in Maine. One of those schools, Plummer-Motz, \nreceived a Blue Ribbon Award in 2005, and the dedication to quality \neducation was expanded through a transition that was guided by a team \nof representatives from each of the two schools.\n  Faculty and staff at Falmouth are committed to both academic \nexcellence and each child's social, emotional, and physical health. \nThey work to ensure a\n\n\nsafe and secure learning environment and to develop strong and \ncollaborative relationships with parents and community members.\n  Students have rich and diverse learning opportunities in art and \nmusic, and library skills are part of every child's learning. World \nlanguage instruction starts in the first grade, and computer science \nclasses start in grade 3. Students benefit from interdisciplinary \nlearning through the garden-greenhouse and through celebrations such as \nArts Nights, Coder Express, and Engineering Night.\n  This award recognizes that Falmouth Elementary School students \nachieve at the highest level. The school involves all students in \nextracurricular activities, which helps forge a strong school community \nwhere students are connected and encouraged to pursue their interests.\n  I applaud the administrators, teachers, staff, and parents of \nFalmouth Elementary School. Together, they are succeeding in their \nmission to generate confidence and momentum for learning. They are \nmaking a difference in the lives of their students, helping them reach \ntheir full potential as independent, responsible learners and citizens. \nI am pleased that the U.S. Department of Education has selected \nFalmouth Elementary School for this well-deserved honor, and I \ncongratulate the entire school community for this outstanding \nachievement.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Ms. COLLINS", "itemno": 0}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 1}], "header": {"chamber": "Senate", "num": "180", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "S7012-S7013", "wkday": "Monday", "day": "6", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "RECOGNIZING FALMOUTH ELEMENTARY SCHOOL", "id": "CREC-2017-11-06-pt1-PgS7012-2", "title": "RECOGNIZING FALMOUTH ELEMENTARY SCHOOL"}
