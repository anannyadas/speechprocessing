Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 3122, as amended, the \nVeterans Care Financial Protection Act.\n  Mr. Speaker, VA offers an additional pension benefit called Aid and \nAttendance, or A&A, to some disabled or elderly veterans who need help \nwith activities of daily living such as dressing or bathing.\n  It may come as a shock to many Americans, but there are people out \nthere who actually take advantage of elderly and disabled veterans by \ncharging them money to help them apply for A&A benefits when the \napplication process is free. If veterans need help\n\n\nfilling out the application, veterans service organizations like The \nAmerican Legion, Disabled American Veterans, VFW, and others will help, \nat no charge, even if the veteran is not a member of the organization.\n  Unfortunately, there are many veterans who don't know that the free \nhelp is available and, more importantly, that it is illegal to charge \nthem a dime to file a claim. So some veterans may end up falling prey \nto these dishonest individuals.\n  H.R. 3122 would help educate veterans and their families by requiring \nVA to post warnings on its website about scammers who actually take \nmoney from our Nation's most vulnerable veterans for a service that \nshould be free.\n  The bill would also require GAO to conduct a study and submit a \nreport to Congress on how to better protect vulnerable veterans from \nbeing taken advantage of.\n  With that, Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to join me in \nsupporting H.R. 3122, as amended, and I reserve the balance of my time.", "turn": 4, "speaker": "Mr. ROE of Tennessee", "itemno": 14}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "T000472", "text": "  Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 3122, as amended, \nthe Veterans Care Financial Protection Act of 2017, and thank the \nbill's sponsor, the congressman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Cartwright), for \nintroducing it.\n  Veterans who served during wartime, and their spouses, may be \neligible to receive pension benefits if they meet certain income and \nother eligibility requirements. Such veterans and survivors may also be \neligible for additional financial benefits, known as Aid and \nAttendance, if the applicant needs assistance performing personal \nfunctions required in everyday living such as bathing, feeding, and \ndressing.\n  Now, VA does not charge veterans and their families to apply for Aid \nand Attendance benefits. In addition, veterans service organizations, \nsuch as The American Legion and VFW, offer free assistance to veterans \nand their families who wish to apply for this benefit.\n  Yet, in all parts of the country, some individuals attempt to charge \nfees for helping veterans apply for Aid and Attendance benefits. \nAccording to organizations, such as AARP and the Federal Trade \nCommission, senior veterans have increasingly become subject to scams \ninvolving insurance agents and financial planners trying to convince \nveterans to make quick decisions about pursuing Aid and Attendance in \naddition to their pension incomes. Some scammers use false \nrepresentations such as suggesting automatic entitlement to benefits.\n  Of greater concern, though, are those who help the veteran \nrestructure financial assets in order to qualify for pension and/or Aid \nand Attendance. For example, moving financial assets into a pooled-\nasset irrevocable trust might render a veteran eligible for pension and \nAid and Attendance, despite having assets in excess of the qualifying \nincome thresholds.\n  While it appears that this would benefit the veteran, what these \nsalesmen do not tell them is that this type of restructuring might \npreclude them from Medicaid eligibility because of rules such as a 5-\nyear look-back period, which considers whether one has moved \nsubstantial assets at less than market value.\n  H.R. 3122, as amended, would require that VA post warnings on its \nwebsite about dishonest individuals who would charge fees to this very \nvulnerable group of veterans and their families to help beneficiaries \napply for pension with Aid and Attendance benefits.\n  Now, this bill would also require GAO to submit a report to Congress \non the types of standards used by Federal and State agencies intended \nto protect vulnerable populations from financial exploitation, an \nanalysis of the types of financial exploitation facing veterans who are \neligible for Aid and Attendance benefits, and any other gaps and \nefforts to address these issues.\n  H.R. 3122, the Veterans Care Financial Protection Act, enjoys broad \nbipartisan support in the House of Representatives as well as from our \nveterans service organizations.

Mr. Speaker, with Veterans Day approaching rapidly, I \nfind it particularly fitting that we raise this important issue today, \nan issue affecting our veterans that should concern all of us here in \nthe Congress.\n  As Americans, we enter into a moral covenant with our armed services, \nwith the men and women warfighters that we send into harm's way. It is \na covenant that says: you do this for us, and we will take care of you \nwhen the time comes, when you need us. It is a covenant that our \nhonoring is of paramount importance, and there is no one here in the \npeople's House who wants to turn his or her back on that covenant.\n\n  As part of this enduring covenant and commitment to those who have \nserved our Nation, the VA provides, as has been mentioned, a modest Aid \nand Attendance benefit to low-income veterans in need of our support. \nIt is a benefit that helps pay for assisted living and in-home personal \ncare for veterans who qualify for VA pension and are homebound or \nrequire the aid and assistance of another person.\n  Unfortunately, as Dr. Roe mentioned, a number of unscrupulous scam \nartists are out there taking advantage of this commitment and this \nbenefit provided to our veterans. They abuse the VA system by \ndeliberately misleading our veterans into thinking they have to pay \napplication fees, into creating damaging irrevocable trusts, into \npaying extra fees for so-called expediting these applications when no \nsuch expediting is available, and for paying any fees at all when, as \nhas been mentioned, the veterans service organizations do it for free.\n  Practices such as these leave vulnerable, elderly veterans with few \nchoices outside of draining their own remaining assets. My bill, the \nVeterans Care Financial Protection Act of 2017, is a bipartisan, \ncommonsense approach that will direct Federal agencies to work with the \nStates and outside experts to establish standards that will prevent \nthis kind of exploitation of our veterans and protect them from \ndishonest, predatory, or otherwise unlawful practices relating to the \nA&A benefit, and it will require a report from the Government \nAccountability Office to conduct a study and report to Congress on how \nbetter to protect veterans from these scam artists.\n  Mr. Speaker, we owe our veterans, who have made great sacrifices for \nall of us, the protection and benefits that they deserve, and, as such, \nI urge a ``yes'' vote on this bill.\n  I want to thank the chairman of the VA committee, Dr. Roe from \nTennessee; its ranking member, Mr. Walz from Minnesota; and the entire \nVeterans' Affairs Committee for taking up this bill.
