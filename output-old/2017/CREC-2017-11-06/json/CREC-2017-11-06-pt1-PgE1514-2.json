Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate and \nrecognize Tiffany Menke, president of the Urbandale Iowa Chamber of \nCommerce, for being named a 2017 Women of Influence honoree by the \naward-winning central Iowa publication, Business Record.\n  For 18 years, the Business Record has undertaken an exhaustive annual \nreview to identify a standout group of women who have made a \nsignificant difference in business, civic and philanthropic endeavours \nthroughout the Greater Des Moines Area.\n  Tiffany has spent her life dedicating her time and talents to serving \nothers. It all began during her time in customer service and as vice \npresident of marketing and tourism for the Newton Chamber of Commerce. \nShe oversaw a number of areas and projects while in Newton, helping \nlead them down a path of sustained success. After Tiffany's time in \nNewton she moved on to serve as president of the Urbandale Chamber of \nCommerce for the past 13 years. Her talents and abilities have been \ninstrumental in tripling the chamber's membership, making it one of the \nbest in the region.\n  Mr. Speaker, it is an honor to represent leaders like Tiffany in the \nUnited States Congress and it is with great pride that I recognize and \napplaud her for utilizing her talents to better both her community, and \nthe great state of Iowa. I ask that my colleagues in the United States \nHouse of Representatives join me in congratulating Tiffany on receiving \nthis esteemed designation, thanking those at Business Record for their \ngreat work, and in wishing Tiffany nothing but continued success.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. YOUNG of Iowa", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 3}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "180", "extension": true, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "E1514", "wkday": "Monday", "day": "6", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "TRIBUTE TO TIFFANY MENKE", "id": "CREC-2017-11-06-pt1-PgE1514-2", "title": "TRIBUTE TO TIFFANY MENKE"}
