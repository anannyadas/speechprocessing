Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and \ncongratulate Nishna Valley Credit Union of Atlantic, Iowa, for \ncelebrating 60 years in business.\n  Tim Marcsisak, CEO of the Credit Union said, ``they literally started \nout raising capital by asking folks to join the Credit Union and put \ndeposits in there, and when they had enough deposits, they turned \naround, and started loaning it back out.'' Today, 26 counties in Iowa \nand Missouri are eligible to join the credit union. Fourteen employees \nwork in their two locations, and there are 5,000 members who have \njoined the Credit Union. New technology has been the greatest change in \nthe operation of their business and that has allowed them to \ncontinually grow.\n  Mr. Speaker, I'm proud to represent businesses like Nishna Valley \nCredit Union in the United States Congress and it is with great pride \nthat I recognize them today. I ask that my colleagues in the United \nStates House of Representatives join me in congratulating them for this \noutstanding achievement and in wishing them all nothing but the best.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. YOUNG of Iowa", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 3}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "180", "extension": true, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "E1518", "wkday": "Monday", "day": "6", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "TRIBUTE TO NISHNA VALLEY CREDIT UNION", "id": "CREC-2017-11-06-pt1-PgE1518-2", "title": "TRIBUTE TO NISHNA VALLEY CREDIT UNION"}
