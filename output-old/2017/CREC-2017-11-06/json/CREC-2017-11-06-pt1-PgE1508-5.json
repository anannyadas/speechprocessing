As a youth, Lynn was active in the \nGirl Scouts, church groups, and the Fairfield High School Scarlet \nBrigade Band before graduating from California State University, \nSacramento with honors. After marrying Jeff Jewell, her service member \nhusband, Lynn became active in supporting multiple local Veteran's \nGroups.\n   Mrs. Jewell served as President of the Vacaville American Legion \nAuxiliary, Secretary of the Veterans of Foreign Wars Auxiliary, and \nserved at the Vacaville Veterans' Memorial Hall as secretary, \ntreasurer, Bingo volunteer, and co-chair of the Annual Holiday Dinners \nfor over 20 years.\n   In 2006, Lynn became involved in the North Bay Homeless Veterans \nStanddown writing grants, raising funds, and serving as volunteer \ncoordinator. Her passionate commitment to this program grew and she now \nserves alongside her husband on the Standdown Board of Directors. Lynn \nis the driving force of the North Bay Standdown and most everyone would \nsay that without Lynn, the years of providing supportive services to \nour homeless veterans in the form of a ``hand-up, not a hand-out'' \nwould not have happened.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. GARAMENDI", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 3}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "180", "extension": true, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "E1508", "wkday": "Monday", "day": "6", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "RECOGNIZING MRS.
