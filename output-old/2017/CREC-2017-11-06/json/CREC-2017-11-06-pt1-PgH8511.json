Mr. Speaker, it is with a heavy heart that we rise today \nto address the American people.\n  Yesterday morning, a gunman stormed into a church in Sutherland \nSprings, Texas, a small town of about 400 or 500 individuals, and \nbrutally murdered 26 innocent lives, including at least 12 children, \nmarking the worst shooting in Texas history.\n  Today we grieve the horrific loss of dozens of innocent people. We \npray for the victims' families, who are grasping for answers with \nbroken hearts.\n  I have spoken personally with Wilson County Sheriff Joe Tackitt, \nCounty Commissioner Albert Gamez, and other citizens of that area to \nassist in any way that we can.\n  In the coming hours and days, we will learn more about the victims of \nthis tragedy, their names, their faces, their stories, the joy they \nbrought their families and their friends.\n  We are fully committed to helping Sutherland Springs recover from \nthis senseless tragedy, and we ask every Member of Congress to join us \nto support this recovery.\n  To the people of Sutherland Springs, I stand with you, we stand with \nyou, the House of Representatives stands with you, and the people of \nthe United States of America stand with you.
