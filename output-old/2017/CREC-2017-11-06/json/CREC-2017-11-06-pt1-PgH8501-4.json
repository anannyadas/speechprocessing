Mr. Speaker, I rise today because I think education is \nthe number one equalizer. It is the door to opportunity, yet the GOP \ntax plan will make it harder to afford to be able to go to college.\n  When I was a kid, my parents--both immigrants from Mexico, where mom \nonly had a third grade education--told me that I had to become a doctor \nor a lawyer. That was the only way to get out of the poverty that we \nlived in.\n  As a result, I went to college. I was saddled in student loan debt \nwhen I came out. As a matter of fact, I still have over $50,000 of \nstudent loan debt. It shouldn't be this way.\n  Congress should be working to make it easier to go to college so that \nthere is debt-free college, or at least make it more affordable. \nUnfortunately, that is not the case.\n  Instead, Congress is considering a terrible GOP tax plan that \nproposes to eliminate the student loan interest deduction and lifetime \nlearning credits. Under current rules, borrowers paying off education \nloans can deduct up to $2,500 of interest paid on student loans.\n  Deductions lower your taxable income. About 12.4 million people \nclaimed it for the year 2015. You can claim the student loan break for \nseveral years after college while paying off the loans.\n  The GOP tax plan would destroy this key deduction for young graduates \nand workers getting the job training they need to succeed in the 21st \ncentury economy.\n  Millenials and young workers, if you disagree, rise and have your \nvoice heard today. Just say no to the GOP tax plan that only makes it \nharder to afford college.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Ms. BARRAGAN", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "180", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H8501", "wkday": "Monday", "day": "6", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "EDUCATION IS THE NUMBER ONE EQUALIZER", "id": "CREC-2017-11-06-pt1-PgH8501-4", "title": "EDUCATION IS THE NUMBER ONE EQUALIZER"}
