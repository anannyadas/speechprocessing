Mr. Speaker, I rise today \nto recognize Mr. David Seely who is retiring as the President and CEO \nof Kirtland Federal Credit Union (KFCU). Throughout his 27 years at the \nhead of the lending institution, Seely oversaw tremendous success as \nthe credit union grew from $80 million in assets to nearly $800 \nmillion. KFCU now serves more than 48,000 clients, including many men \nand women in uniform.\n  Seely also earned a reputation for combatting predatory lending \npractices and promoting financial education. When the federal \ngovernment shut down for several days in 2013, Seely ensured his \nmembers had access to services such as extended loan due dates and fee \nwaivers while they were furloughed.\n  In addition to his work with the credit union, Seely volunteered his \ntime to help promote economic growth, as well as support military \npersonnel serving at Kirtland Air Force Base. He served on the Kirtland \nPartnership Committee, the Greater Albuquerque Chamber of Commerce and \nthe New Mexico Association of Commerce & Industry. Recently, Seely \nreceived a Humanitarian award from the Jewish Community Center of \nGreater Albuquerque for his service to non-profit organizations and \nleadership at Kirtland Federal Credit Union.\n  His work at the credit union and support for Kirtland Air Force Base \nwas also recognized by Col. Michael Duvall, 377th Air Base Wing \nCommander, who singled out KFCU as the ``Best in the Air Force'' for \nits commitment to improving the quality of life of Kirtland personnel.\n  Mr. Speaker, I wish to commend Mr. David Seely for all of his success \nand his contributions. We wish him well in his retirement. I thank \nDavid. He is an inspiration to us all.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Ms. MICHELLE LUJAN GRISHAM of New Mexico", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 3}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "180", "extension": true, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "E1515", "wkday": "Monday", "day": "6", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "HONORING DAVID SEELY", "id": "CREC-2017-11-06-pt1-PgE1515-3", "title": "HONORING DAVID SEELY"}
