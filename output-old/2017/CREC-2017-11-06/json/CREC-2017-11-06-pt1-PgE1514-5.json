Mr. Speaker, I rise today \nto recognize Albuquerque's Alex Bregman for his stand-out performance \nin the 2017 World Series. Bregman's heroics on the baseball diamond \nhelped the Houston Astros win its first World Series in franchise \nhistory. Alex also made his hometown and the state of New Mexico proud \nas he fulfilled his childhood dream and showed the entire world the \nvalue of hard work.\n  Bregman's baseball talent was the stuff of legend in Albuquerque, \nwhere he played for Albuquerque Academy. During his sophomore year at \nthe Academy, Bregman was named USA Baseball Player of the Year.\n  Bregman took his talent to Louisiana State University, where he \nplayed baseball with the Tigers from 2013 to 2015.\n  The Astros drafted Bregman as the 2nd Overall pick in the 2015 Major \nLeague Baseball Draft. He quickly rose through the Astros system and \nduring his first full year in the Major Leagues, Bregman hit .284 with \n19 home runs and 71 RBI.\n  In the World Series, Bregman produced 5 runs, 7 hits, 2 home runs, 5 \nRBI and a stolen base. He produced his biggest moment in what may be \nthe most exciting game in the history of the World Series. With the \nscore tied in the bottom of the 10th inning, Bregman hit a walk-off, \nRBI single that gave the Astros a pivotal, 13-12 win and the momentum \nthey rode to the championship.\n  While his offensive prowess contributed to the team's record-breaking \nstatistical performance, Bregman's brilliant defense helped give\n\n\nthe Astros an edge throughout the playoffs. He made several critical \nplays at third base, including an aggressive catch and throw to home \nplate in Game 4 to prevent a run.\n  Following the end of the World Series, the Baseball Hall of Fame \nannounced that Bregman's glove is one of three artifacts from the \nSeries that will be enshrined in Cooperstown.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Ms. MICHELLE LUJAN GRISHAM of New Mexico", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 3}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "180", "extension": true, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "E1514-E1515", "wkday": "Monday", "day": "6", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "HONORING ALEX BREGMAN", "id": "CREC-2017-11-06-pt1-PgE1514-5", "title": "HONORING ALEX BREGMAN"}
