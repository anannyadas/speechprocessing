[[Page E1513]]

California, who has dedicated many years to the public education 
system, continuing to volunteer after her retirement. Ms. Zetah retired 
as a school principal from Travis Unified School District, having 
worked as a classroom teacher, reading specialist, program manager, and 
vice principal. During her time as a teacher, Ms. Zetah went above and 
beyond what was required of her. She served as a mentor to many new 
teachers and provided professional development workshops for others 
throughout the district and state. She served as President and board 
member of the Solano County Reading Association and to this day 
volunteers giving reading tests at Center Elementary School.
   Ms. Zetah currently serves as President of the local chapter of the 
Delta Kappa Gamma Honor Society for Women Educators, where she 
organizes charitable programs to benefit children's education. For the 
past seven years she has worked with St. Mary's Church and Vacaville 
Unified School District to put on Education Forums where participating 
children receive free books. Ms. Zetah is so devoted to this project 
that she has donated hundreds of her own books.
   Through both her career and her volunteer work, Patricia Zetah has 
demonstrated her dedication to children's education.
