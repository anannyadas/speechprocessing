  Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Michalle Shown-
Rodriguez of Fairfield, California, who has dedicated her career to 
community service and is a pillar of the community. Michalle currently 
serves as the Development Director for Child Haven, where she brings 30 
years of experience in development, grant writing, and executive 
leadership.
   Michalle's work with non-profits began with the birth of her son and 
subsequent involvement in co-founding a support organization in Idaho 
that served families with medically fragile children. She has been 
involved with the National Foster Parents Association, the Sierra 
Association of Foster Families and Ronald McDonald House Charities. 
Being an adoptive parent of four elementary school-age children, she 
had a passion to serve in an education-focused environment where she 
can have a direct impact on children and their parents.
   Michalle's previous experience includes working for the Crisis 
Support Services of Alameda County where she was responsible for 
developing programs to support suicide prevention, crisis intervention 
and public education. Ms. Shown-Rodriguez holds a degree in social 
psychology and earned the Non-Profit Certificate at Stanford Graduate 
School of Business' Center for Social Innovation among other 
professional credentials.
