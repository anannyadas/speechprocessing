                       TRIBUTE TO DELORIS STENZEL

                                 ______
                                 

                            HON. DAVID YOUNG

                                of iowa

                    in the house of representatives

                        Monday, November 6, 2017

  Mr. YOUNG of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and 
congratulate Deloris Stenzel and her late husband Glen, of Hamburg, 
Iowa, for receiving the 2017 Farm Family of the Year Award by the 
Shenandoah Chamber and Industry Association.
  Deloris and Glen were college sweethearts and they attended Northwest 
Missouri State University. They returned to the family farming 
operation where they managed their farms for decades and were blessed 
with two children, Deb and Steven. Deloris and Glen were active in 
their community, and Glen served on numerous area boards and 
committees. Together, they were always eager to lend a helping hand to 
neighbors, whether it was pulling someone out of a ditch, delivering 
meals, or helping combine a neighbor's field.
  Mr. Speaker, I'm proud to represent community leaders like the 
Stenzels in the United States Congress and it is with great pride that 
I recognize them today. I ask that my colleagues in the United States 
House of Representatives join me in congratulating the Stenzels for 
this outstanding achievement and in wishing them nothing but the best.

                          ____________________
