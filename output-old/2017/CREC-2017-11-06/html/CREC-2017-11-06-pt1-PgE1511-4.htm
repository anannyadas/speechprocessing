                    in the house of representatives

                        Monday, November 6, 2017

  Mr. WALKER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize an outstanding 
constituent, Reva Ingram Fortune from Guilford County. I am honored to 
acknowledge constituents who selflessly answered the call to serve and 
defend our freedom. A United States Air Force veteran of World War II 
and member of the Greatest Generation, Mrs. Fortune served her country 
with honor. Self-sacrifice, personal responsibility, and humility are 
traits this generation embodied. The tremendous strides our country has 
made since World War II are a direct result of these great Americans. 
North Carolina is truly fortunate to have Mrs. Fortune, an outstanding 
representative of our community and country.
   I join with her family, friends, and the Sixth District in thanking 
Reva Ingram Fortune for her dedicated service to the United States of 
America.
