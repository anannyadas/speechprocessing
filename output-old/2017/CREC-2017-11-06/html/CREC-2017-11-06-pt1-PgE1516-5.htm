                       TRIBUTE TO JANET PETERSEN

                                 ______
                                 

                            HON. DAVID YOUNG

                                of iowa

                    in the house of representatives

                        Monday, November 6, 2017

  Mr. YOUNG of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and 
congratulate Janet Petersen, Iowa State Senator and Co-Founder of 
Healthy Birth Day, Inc. for being named a 2017 Women of Influence 
honoree by the award-winning central Iowa Publication, Business Record.
  For 18 years, the Business Record has undertaken an exhaustive annual 
review to identify a standout group of women who have made a 
significant difference in business, civic, and philanthropic endeavors 
throughout the Greater Des Moines Area.
  Janet didn't always believe she was someone who wanted to be at the 
forefront of public policy. It was through her life experiences that 
she was ultimately called to public service. During her time in the 
Iowa State Legislature, she has been a formidable advocate on the 
issues she is passionate about. Janet is also the founder of a 
nonprofit organization called Healthy Birth Day, which teaches 
prospecting parents how to track the movements of their child in the 
third trimester.
  Mr. Speaker, it is an honor to represent Janet in the United States 
Congress and I ask that my colleagues in the United States House of 
Representatives join me in congratulating her for receiving this 
esteemed designation,

thanking those at Business Record for their great work, and in wishing 
Janet nothing but the best.
