     HONORING DENISE M. FORTE ON HER RETIREMENT FROM THE HOUSE OF 
                            REPRESENTATIVES

                                 ______
                                 

                     HON. ROBERT C. ``BOBBY'' SCOTT

                              of virginia

                    in the house of representatives

                        Monday, November 6, 2017

  Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I rise to thank and pay tribute 
to Denise Forte, who is my staff director on the Committee on Education 
and the Workforce. After a remarkable 20 plus year career in federal 
service, today is Denise's last day with us.
  Denise first came to Capitol Hill as a Women's Research and Education 
Institute fellow in my personal office in 1994. While she received her 
degree in computer science from Duke University, Denise's fellowship on 
Capitol Hill made her realize her true professional calling--helping 
ensure America's children have equality access to a quality education. 
I recognized her talent and; at the conclusion of her fellowship, hired 
her as a full-time employee where she excelled at several positions, 
including as my legislative director.
  Her passion and talent eventually caught the attention of Congressman 
George Miller, the former Ranking Member and Chairman of the Education 
and the Workforce Committee. Denise seized an opportunity to join the 
Committee in 2001, where she served in successively senior roles, 
eventually becoming Congressman Miller's director of education policy. 
During her initial service with the Committee, Denise played integral 
roles in major reforms, including the No Child Left Behind Act, the 
College Cost Reduction Act, Child Nutrition Reauthorization, 
reauthorization of the Juvenile Justice Delinquency and Prevention Act, 
and the Student Aid and Responsibility Act, amongst others.
  Denise left the Committee in early 2011 to join the Obama 
Administration at the Department of Education's Office of Planning, 
Evaluation, and Policy Development as a deputy assistant secretary. In 
that capacity, she provided strategic advice and counsel to Secretary 
of Education Arne Duncan. Denise also directed and managed several 
policy portfolios, including overseeing budget, higher education, and 
early education policy development.
  In late 2014, my colleagues in the House Democratic Caucus elected me 
to succeed George Miller as Ranking Member of the Committee on 
Education and the Workforce. I immediately knew who I wanted to help me 
assemble a staff and lead my team--Denise Forte. As my colleagues know, 
Denise is well-regarded and respected by Members and staff on both 
sides of the aisle. She is known to care deeply and fight vigorously 
for what she believes in, but Denise always remains focused on 
achieving what's possible. She understands the importance of building 
bridges and working to identify policy areas on which Committee 
Democrats and Republicans can agree.
  The best example of that is the most recent reauthorization of our 
nation's landmark education law, the Elementary and Secondary Education 
Act. Despite an increasingly polarized environment, Denise believed in 
the possible and led my team to realize a full rewrite of the law in 
the Every Student Succeeds Act, which was enacted last Congress with 
overwhelming bipartisan support. Denise led our

team's effort and helped us accomplish something that hadn't been done 
in nearly 15 years.
  Denise Forte built her career in public service on getting results, 
making meaningful progress for America's students and working families, 
and helping this institution function effectively. She cares deeply 
about Congress and our Committee's mission, and she will be greatly 
missed. I wish her well as she gets to spend a little extra time with 
her husband, Kyo, and her beloved sons, Gabe and Johnny, before she 
starts her next adventure at the Century Foundation.
  Mr. Speaker, I speak for my staff, Chairwoman Virginia Foxx, and all 
the members of the Committee on Education and the Workforce in thanking 
Denise Forte for her more than two decades of honorable service to this 
institution and the American people.
