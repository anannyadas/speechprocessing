                        Monday, November 6, 2017

  Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Mrs. Renee 
Tadlock of Fairfield, California, who is the Operations Director of The 
Leaven, a faith-based afterschool tutoring and mentorship program 
focused on serving the underserved youth in our high-risk communities 
with educational assistance, physical play, nutrition, and character 
development. Before becoming the Operations Director, Renee was a 
Leaven Site Director and served to help grow the Leaven Organization 
from one center in 2009 to sixteen different locations throughout 
Solano and Napa Counties and three sites in Southern California with 
more scheduled to open soon.
   Mrs. Tadlock's role at the Leaven has been vital to the 
organization's success and secondary positive impact of raising the 
quality of life within each neighbor served by a Leaven Center. 
Recognized by community leaders and law enforcement officials, Leaven 
Centers through their development of community relationships have 
proven over and over to positively impact crime rates, drive out 
negative influences, and empower residents to participate in 
neighborhood watch and re-vitalization programs.
   Renee developed her passion for education and serving our youth 
during her prior service as a pre-school teacher in Fairfield and a 
substitute para-teacher for Solano County Office of Education. Renee 
and her husband, Mike, serve as Pastors at Real Life Church in 
Fairfield where she also serves as an inspiring role-model to the 
church, youth group, and community members.
