                                of iowa

                    in the house of representatives

                        Monday, November 6, 2017

  Mr. YOUNG of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and 
congratulate Toni Urban, for being named a 2017 Women of Influence 
honoree by the award-winning central Iowa Publication, Business Record.
  For 18 years, the Business Record has undertaken an exhaustive annual 
review to identify a standout group of women who have made a 
significant difference in business, civic, and philanthropic endeavors 
throughout the Greater Des Moines Area.
  Almost 50 years ago, Toni and her husband Tim decided to plant their 
roots in Des Moines. During that time Toni has been a leader in the 
greater Des Moines area, volunteering her time and talents to 
organizations she believes in. Her most recent volunteer work has been 
on the board of the Food Bank of Iowa, a nonprofit organization 
dedicated to combatting food insecurity across the entire state of 
Iowa. They are currently working to expand their operations, and Toni 
has taken a lead role in raising the $8 million dollars necessary to 
upgrade their facilities.
  Mr. Speaker, it is an honor to represent Iowans like Toni in the 
United States Congress and I ask that my colleagues in the United 
States House of Representatives join me in congratulating her for 
receiving this esteemed designation, thank those at Business Record for 
their great work, and in wishing Toni nothing but the best.

                          ____________________
