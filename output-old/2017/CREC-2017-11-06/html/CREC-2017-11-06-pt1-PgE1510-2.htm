                        HONORING KATHLEEN GILSON

                                 ______
                                 

                          HON. ELIOT L. ENGEL

                              of new york

                    in the house of representatives

                        Monday, November 6, 2017

  Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a true community 
servant and long-time pillar of the Riverdale Community Center, Ms. 
Kathleen Gilson. Kathleen has worked at RCC since 1982, rising through 
the ranks from Administrative Assistant all the way up to Executive 
Director. She has done it all at RCC and this year, after 35 years of 
service to her community, she is celebrating her retirement.
  In 1985, three years into her career at RCC, Kathleen became the 
Fiscal Officer and the Director of Finance and Program Operations by 
1997. Then, in 2004, she became the Center's Executive Director. During 
her tenure as the Executive Director, RCC programs and budgets have 
tripled, serving over 1,000 people of all ages each year in their free 
youth programs and Adult and Youth Education Center. Kathleen has 
overseen an RCC after school program that has become one of the most 
successful free programs in New York City--receiving ``Excellent'' 
ratings from all funders and identified as ``Exemplary.'' Kathleen was 
also quite active outside her work life. She served on her local school 
board for 13 years, eight as the president, and is currently president 
of her homeowners' association.
  Of course, Kathleen's true passion is her family. She is happily 
married with three children, and two grandchildren. She currently lives 
in Orange County, though she is a former Bronxite herself.
  Kathleen Gilson has been instrumental to the success of RCC, and its 
amazing growth can be directly linked to her efforts, in addition to 
the efforts of her team. I want to congratulate Kathleen on her decades 
of service and thank her for all the incredible work she has done for 
Riverdale residents. I hope she enjoys a well-earned retirement.
