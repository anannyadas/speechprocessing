             IN MEMORY OF SHADY SHORES MAYOR OLIVE STEPHENS

                                 ______
                                 

                        HON. MICHAEL C. BURGESS

                                of texas

                    in the house of representatives

                        Monday, November 6, 2017

  Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the memory of former 
Shady Shores Mayor Olive Stephens. Mayor Stephens, who passed away on 
October 30 at the age of 101, was known for her commitment to her 
family, her neighbors, and the Shady Shores community. She was a 
dedicated public servant who helped Shady Shores grow from a small 
weekend fishing and camping spot to an incorporated city with a 
population of more than 2,800.
   An East Texas native, Mayor Stephens and her late husband moved to 
Shady Shores in 1956 and opened a general store. In 1963, Olive 
Stephens began her public service career when she volunteered to serve 
on the Town Council. After 10 years as a council member, she ran for 
higher office, and in 1973 won a successful bid to serve as the first 
elected mayor of Shady Shores. Mayor Stephens served her community in 
this capacity for almost 40 years until she retired from full time 
public service at the age of 94.
   A pioneer of local Texas politics, Olive Stephens left a legacy of 
lifelong commitment to public service. We will miss her leadership and 
passion for her Shady Shores community and all of Texas.
