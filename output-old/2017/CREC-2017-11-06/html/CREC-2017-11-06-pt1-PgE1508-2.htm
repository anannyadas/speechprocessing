                     RECOGNIZING DR. LAURIE GOODMAN

                                 ______
                                 

                          HON. JOHN GARAMENDI

                             of california

                    in the house of representatives

                        Monday, November 6, 2017

  Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Dr. Laurie 
Goodman of Meridian, California, who has dedicated herself to the 
education, health, and safety of children. As Superintendent and 
Principal of the Winship-Robbins Elementary School District, Dr. 
Goodman has worked to implement many programs designed to serve 
children in need. In partnership with Sutter County Public Health, she 
has implemented a nutrition education and obesity prevention program 
which aims to promote healthy eating and exercise habits in youth.
   Dr. Goodman was also an instrumental partner in the effort to 
establish the ``Food For Thought'' pilot project which works to 
minimize child hunger by providing families with healthy foods to take 
home over the weekend. Her efforts on behalf of these programs make a 
clear positive impact in the lives of children in her community.
   Dr. Goodman's passion and commitment to the students and families of 
Winship-Robbins Elementary School goes beyond academic success. Dr. 
Goodman is truly dedicated to the complete health and well-being of 
each and every one of her students, and never passes up an opportunity 
to provide them with any help they may need.
