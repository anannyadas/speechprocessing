                         HONORING RACHEL RADNA

                                 ______
                                 

                          HON. ELIOT L. ENGEL

                              of new york

                    in the house of representatives

                        Monday, November 6, 2017

   Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure to recognize a member of 
the Riverdale Temple community, Dr. Rachel Levi Radna, who this year is 
being honored by the Temple at their annual Gala Dinner.
  Rachel was born in Tel Aviv, Israel. She moved to the United States 
with her family when she was 12 years old. Rachel attended George 
Washington High School and then Hunter College in the Bronx for her 
undergraduate degree. She went to CUNY for her doctoral degree in 
Biochemistry. While at Hunter, she met her husband, Dr. Richard Radna, 
with whom she has three wonderful children, Rudolph, Rebeka, and 
Raphael. She recently became a grandmother to Rebeka's baby son, Julian 
Avi. Rather than pursuing a career in Biochemistry, Rachel managed her 
husband's Neurosurgical Practice, as it allowed her to take care of her 
family. Rachel's family is the legacy that she has created, and they 
are her true pride and joy.
  Rachel was not a regular worshiper until she started to go to 
services at Riverdale Temple. There was something at Riverdale Temple 
that sparked a light in her that continues to shine. She went from 
congregant to member of the Board of Directors, and she has been the 
President of the Congregation for the past 10 years. With such 
continuity, Rachel is the glue that seems to keep the Temple held 
together. She has worked closely with Rabbi Lewis and, most recently, 
Rabbi Gardner. When the clergy are on vacation in the summer, Rachel 
coordinates and leads lay-led services, at which she often functions as 
both Rabbi and Cantor.
  Aside from her involvement in Riverdale Temple, Rachel loves to knit, 
bake, and cook. She enjoys opera, karaoke, Israeli music and dancing. 
Her favorite part of being President is being on the Bimah during these 
past 10 years and watching our religious school children grow to become 
B'nai Mitzvah. She is also the co-President of the Riverdale Temple, a 
wonderful honor in and of itself.
  Rachel has done so much for our community and is most deserving of 
this recognition. Congratulations to her on receiving this great honor.
