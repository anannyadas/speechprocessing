                                 ______
                                 

                      HON. MICHELLE LUJAN GRISHAM

                             of new mexico

                    in the house of representatives

                        Monday, November 6, 2017

  Ms. MICHELLE LUJAN GRISHAM of New Mexico. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize Albuquerque's Alex Bregman for his stand-out performance 
in the 2017 World Series. Bregman's heroics on the baseball diamond 
helped the Houston Astros win its first World Series in franchise 
history. Alex also made his hometown and the state of New Mexico proud 
as he fulfilled his childhood dream and showed the entire world the 
value of hard work.
  Bregman's baseball talent was the stuff of legend in Albuquerque, 
where he played for Albuquerque Academy. During his sophomore year at 
the Academy, Bregman was named USA Baseball Player of the Year.
  Bregman took his talent to Louisiana State University, where he 
played baseball with the Tigers from 2013 to 2015.
  The Astros drafted Bregman as the 2nd Overall pick in the 2015 Major 
League Baseball Draft. He quickly rose through the Astros system and 
during his first full year in the Major Leagues, Bregman hit .284 with 
19 home runs and 71 RBI.
  In the World Series, Bregman produced 5 runs, 7 hits, 2 home runs, 5 
RBI and a stolen base. He produced his biggest moment in what may be 
the most exciting game in the history of the World Series. With the 
score tied in the bottom of the 10th inning, Bregman hit a walk-off, 
RBI single that gave the Astros a pivotal, 13-12 win and the momentum 
they rode to the championship.
  While his offensive prowess contributed to the team's record-breaking 
statistical performance, Bregman's brilliant defense helped give

the Astros an edge throughout the playoffs. He made several critical 
plays at third base, including an aggressive catch and throw to home 
plate in Game 4 to prevent a run.
  Following the end of the World Series, the Baseball Hall of Fame 
announced that Bregman's glove is one of three artifacts from the 
Series that will be enshrined in Cooperstown.
