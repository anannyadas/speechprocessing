                            HON. TOM MARINO

                            of pennsylvania

                    in the house of representatives

                        Monday, November 6, 2017

  Mr. MARINO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize former Congressman 
Joseph McDade, who passed away on September 24, 2017, at the age of 85.
   Mr. McDade, a Republican, represented Pennsylvania's 10th district 
from January 3, 1963 to January 3, 1999, the same district that I have 
the honor of representing.
   Mr. McDade served on the House Appropriations Committee, where he 
served as the vice chairman of the full committee, and chairman of the 
Energy and Water Development Subcommittee.
   He was born in Scranton, Pennsylvania and went on to graduate from 
the University of Notre Dame and received his LLB from the University 
of Pennsylvania. He founded his own law practice in 1957 and was 
elected Scranton City Solicitor in 1962.
   Mr. McDade worked tirelessly to bring federal resources to northeast 
Pennsylvania, create jobs, improve the environment, and to improve 
education. Most notably, Mr. McDade was pivotal in establishing the 
Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area as well as the creation of 
the Steamtown National Historic Site.
   Mr. McDade was a tremendous public servant and advocate who had a 
positive impact on thousands of people. He dedicated 36

years of his life to represent Pennsylvanians in this chamber and I ask 
my colleagues to join me in honoring our former colleague, Joseph 
McDade, for his service and accomplishments. He will be missed.
