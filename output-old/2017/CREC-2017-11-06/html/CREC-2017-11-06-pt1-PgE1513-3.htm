                                 ______
                                 

                      HON. MICHELLE LUJAN GRISHAM

                             of new mexico

                    in the house of representatives

                        Monday, November 6, 2017

  Ms. MICHELLE LUJAN GRISHAM of New Mexico. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize Landon Vranes, a 10-year-old Albuquerque student who 
represents the spirit of learning and innovation. As a 5th grade 
student, Landon has dedicated much of his time learning about, and 
building robots.
  Landon recently built a robot that is able to solve any combination 
of the popular Rubik's Cube puzzle. His creation was part of a class 
project led by Albuquerque Public Schools teacher, Ms. Amy Nevitt. 
Landon's robot was featured during recent TV news broadcasts, which 
highlighted his passion for technology and robotics.
  During an interview with KOB-4, Landon explained, ``Any scramble out 
of the 43 quintillion can be solved in 20 moves or less and it's trying 
to find out the quickest possibility.''
  As the home to three federal research laboratories and distinguished 
research universities, New Mexico has a reputation for fostering 
innovation and exploration. It is my hope that students like Landon 
Vranes continue to have opportunities to thrive and succeed in New 
Mexico.
  Mr. Speaker, I would like to congratulate Landon on this achievement 
and wish him all the best in his future scientific endeavors.
