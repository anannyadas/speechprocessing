                          HONORING DAVID SEELY

                                 ______
                                 

                      HON. MICHELLE LUJAN GRISHAM

                             of new mexico

                    in the house of representatives

                        Monday, November 6, 2017

  Ms. MICHELLE LUJAN GRISHAM of New Mexico. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize Mr. David Seely who is retiring as the President and CEO 
of Kirtland Federal Credit Union (KFCU). Throughout his 27 years at the 
head of the lending institution, Seely oversaw tremendous success as 
the credit union grew from $80 million in assets to nearly $800 
million. KFCU now serves more than 48,000 clients, including many men 
and women in uniform.
  Seely also earned a reputation for combatting predatory lending 
practices and promoting financial education. When the federal 
government shut down for several days in 2013, Seely ensured his 
members had access to services such as extended loan due dates and fee 
waivers while they were furloughed.
  In addition to his work with the credit union, Seely volunteered his 
time to help promote economic growth, as well as support military 
personnel serving at Kirtland Air Force Base. He served on the Kirtland 
Partnership Committee, the Greater Albuquerque Chamber of Commerce and 
the New Mexico Association of Commerce & Industry. Recently, Seely 
received a Humanitarian award from the Jewish Community Center of 
Greater Albuquerque for his service to non-profit organizations and 
leadership at Kirtland Federal Credit Union.
  His work at the credit union and support for Kirtland Air Force Base 
was also recognized by Col. Michael Duvall, 377th Air Base Wing 
Commander, who singled out KFCU as the ``Best in the Air Force'' for 
its commitment to improving the quality of life of Kirtland personnel.
  Mr. Speaker, I wish to commend Mr. David Seely for all of his success 
and his contributions. We wish him well in his retirement. I thank 
David. He is an inspiration to us all.
