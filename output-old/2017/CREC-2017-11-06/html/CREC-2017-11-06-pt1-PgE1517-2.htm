  IN HONOR OF THE 2017 INDUCTEES TO THE WYOMING BUSINESS HALL OF FAME

                                 ______
                                 

                            HON. LIZ CHENEY

                               of wyoming

                    in the house of representatives

                        Monday, November 6, 2017

  Ms. CHENEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to extend my congratulations to 
Lois Herbst, Patrick and Paul Hladky, and Maury Brown on being inducted 
into the Wyoming Business Hall of Fame.
  The Wyoming Business Hall of Fame was founded in 2013 by the 
University of Wyoming's College of Business, the Wyoming Business 
Alliance/Wyoming Heritage Foundation, and the Wyoming Business Council. 
It recognizes those who go above and beyond for their businesses and 
their communities. Lois, Patrick, Paul, and Maury each have made an 
excellent example for their families, friends, and residents across the 
state through their hard work, leadership, and tenacity.
  This year's inductees have been successful in their businesses and 
have become integral parts of their communities:
  Throughout her impressive career, Lois Herbst has helped run her 
family's ranch, the Herbst Lazy TY Ranch LLP, and has served on many 
state agriculture boards. She was inducted into the Wyoming Agriculture 
Hall of Fame in 1999, and has served as the president of the Wyoming 
Stock Growers Association, the first and only woman to hold that post, 
as well as on the Wyoming State Grazing Board.
  Since taking over operation of their father's business, Cyclone 
Drilling, Patrick and Paul Hladky have expanded it into a business that 
employs more than 700 people, operating throughout the Rockies. They 
are active in their community and believe that economic development 
depends on an educated workforce. This belief has driven their 
commitment to supporting educational opportunities throughout Gillette 
and the state.
  Maury Brown is the owner of two businesses in Wyoming: Town and 
Country Supermarket Liquors, and Maurice Brown Exploration. He is 
dedicated to philanthropy, receiving multiple local awards, including 
the 2013 Greater Cheyenne Chamber of Commerce's Person of the Year 
award. I would like to thank Lois, Patrick, Paul, and Maury for their 
continued dedication and significant contributions to Wyoming's economy 
and community.
  Again, Mr. Speaker, I would like to extend my congratulations to the 
2017 inductees to the Wyoming Business Hall of Fame. Lois, Patrick, 
Paul, and Maury deserve to be extremely proud of this accomplishment.
