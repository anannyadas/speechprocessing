                        Monday, November 6, 2017

  Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Kathleen Ramos, 
who has been a vibrant leader in the community since arriving in 
Vacaville, California with her young family in 1986. She quickly fell 
in love with the charm, generosity and spirit of Vacaville and 
immediately decided she would devote her time and talent to making 
Vacaville a great place to raise a family.
   Kathleen's passion to help others is evident through her community 
and public service. Throughout her two decades as a top realtor for 
Solano County, she's helped countless families find the home of their 
dreams. Her desire to help the community didn't stop there; Kathleen 
has held leadership roles in thirteen boards and commissions, including 
serving five consecutive terms as president and past vice-chair on the 
Community Services Commission for the City of Vacaville. She also 
volunteers in student education programs, was past president for the 
Solano Community Symphony League and is a Charter Member for 100 Women 
Who Care About Solano County and the Vacaville Soroptimists Twilight 
Club.
   Kathleen is married to her husband Steve; together they have three 
adult children and six granddaughters. She enjoys an active lifestyle 
and when she's not helping in the community, you can find her on the 
bike trails or racquetball courts.
