  RECOGNIZING FALLING SPRING ELEMENTARY SCHOOL FOR BEING HONORED AS A 
                    2017 NATIONAL BLUE RIBBON SCHOOL

                                 ______
                                 

                           HON. BILL SHUSTER

                            of pennsylvania

                    in the house of representatives

                        Monday, November 6, 2017

  Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Falling Spring 
Elementary School on being honored as a 2017 National Blue Ribbon 
School. The outstanding nomination from the Pennsylvania Department of 
Education comes after a vast amount of activities and efforts which 
were implemented at the Falling Spring School for the betterment of 
their students.
  Falling Spring Elementary School has shown outstanding academic 
achievements through continual improvements of resources and materials 
provided to the students, the application of strategies that engage 
students in their learning, maximizing instructional time with 
students, and presenting a model of expected outcomes for students to 
follow. The integration of SMART boards and iPads in each classroom 
allows for teachers to better incorporate realistic examples of 
materials, motivate students with fun activities, and provide more 
direct communication.
  Not only is Falling Spring Elementary laser focused on student 
learning, but it also offers additional opportunities for students to 
grow. The school garden allows students in grades K-5 to come together 
as one through planning, planting, and maintaining garden beds, and 
provides them the chance to have fresh produce tastings in the fall and 
spring. In addition to the school run garden, they also have a 
recycling and composting program where students assist with composting 
and recycling of materials from within the school cafeteria.
  Falling Spring Elementary School offers a wide variety of clubs that 
appeal to the interests of all students. These clubs range from the 
STEM club with activities focused on science, technology, engineering 
and math, to the Compassion in Action club which has raised awareness 
for kindness in the school and the community. One exemplary program 
offered at Falling Springs is the SOAR or Student Leadership club. Over 
the years, SOAR has developed the school pledge, addressed bullying 
issues, and organized a positive incentive program. The school has also 
incorporated a Parent Teacher Association which consists of parents who 
are deeply committed to supporting students and contributing to the 
success of the children within their community.
  Mr. Speaker, I am privileged to congratulate the students, staff, and 
parents of Falling Spring Elementary School for this outstanding 
nomination. The level of care and dedication to the success of the 
students necessary for an award such as a Blue Ribbon School is clearly 
shown in Falling Spring Elementary School, and it is an honor to 
recognize them for this wonderful achievement.
