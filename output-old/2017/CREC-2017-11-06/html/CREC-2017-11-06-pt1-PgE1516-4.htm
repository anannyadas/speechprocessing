                                 ______
                                 

                      HON. DANIEL M. DONOVAN, JR.

                              of new york

                    in the house of representatives

                        Monday, November 6, 2017

  Mr. DONOVAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the remarkable 
career of Justice Philip G. Minardo.
  Justice Philip Minardo was born and raised in Brooklyn where he later 
attended St. Michael's Diocesan High School. In 1963, he graduated from 
Manhattan College with a B.A. in Economics, and later received his J.D. 
from St. John's University of Law in 1967. In December 1968, John M. 
Braisted, Jr. appointed Philip as an Assistant District Attorney for 
Richmond County. He served in this position for over seven years and 
played a role in the successful prosecution of countless felony cases 
in Staten Island. After leaving the Richmond County District Attorney's 
office, he started his own law firm in September 1976 focusing on civil 
and criminal cases.
  After Philip's election to the Richmond County Bar Association's 
(RCBA) Board of Directors, he became President in 1987, and as such 
represented then-Supreme Court Justice Frank Ponterio on behalf of the 
RCBA in the U.S. Supreme Court case Board of Estimate of City of New 
York v. Morris. In 1995, he was elected as a Justice of the Supreme 
Court of the State of New York, 2nd Judicial District, which serves 
Brooklyn and Staten Island. After serving on the Supreme Court, Justice 
Minardo returned to Staten Island where he was appointed as the first 
Administrative Judge of Richmond County and thereafter, the first 
Administrative Judge of the newly created 13th Judicial District.
  Justice Minardo has also been the recipient of prestigious honors 
throughout his successful career. In 2010, he received the Rapallo 
Award by the Colombian Lawyers of the First Department. In addition, he 
was a recipient of the Good Scout Award for outstanding service while 
serving on the Board of Directors of the Staten Island Council of the 
Boy Scouts of America. While his accomplishments are impressive, 
Justice Philip Minardo places an immense amount of pride and joy in his 
family.
  Mr. Speaker, I want to congratulate Justice Philip G. Minardo on his 
retirement and on his exceptional career. He has been an outstanding 
jurist, and I laud him for his lifetime of dedication and success.
