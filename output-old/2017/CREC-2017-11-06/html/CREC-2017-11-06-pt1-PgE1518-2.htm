                 TRIBUTE TO NISHNA VALLEY CREDIT UNION

                                 ______
                                 

                            HON. DAVID YOUNG

                                of iowa

                    in the house of representatives

                        Monday, November 6, 2017

  Mr. YOUNG of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and 
congratulate Nishna Valley Credit Union of Atlantic, Iowa, for 
celebrating 60 years in business.
  Tim Marcsisak, CEO of the Credit Union said, ``they literally started 
out raising capital by asking folks to join the Credit Union and put 
deposits in there, and when they had enough deposits, they turned 
around, and started loaning it back out.'' Today, 26 counties in Iowa 
and Missouri are eligible to join the credit union. Fourteen employees 
work in their two locations, and there are 5,000 members who have 
joined the Credit Union. New technology has been the greatest change in 
the operation of their business and that has allowed them to 
continually grow.
  Mr. Speaker, I'm proud to represent businesses like Nishna Valley 
Credit Union in the United States Congress and it is with great pride 
that I recognize them today. I ask that my colleagues in the United 
States House of Representatives join me in congratulating them for this 
outstanding achievement and in wishing them all nothing but the best.
