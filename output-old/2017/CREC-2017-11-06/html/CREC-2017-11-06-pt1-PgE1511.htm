                        Monday, November 6, 2017

  Mr. LOEBSACK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a group of Vietnam 
veterans from my district. I stand to thank the Jasper County Vietnam 
Veterans for their honorable service to our great nation.
  While serving, these patriots fought for, protected, and renewed the 
liberties and values upon which our great country was founded; 
fundamental values and freedoms that make our country the greatest 
nation on earth. The Jasper County Vietnam Veterans group works to 
honor all of those that have served.
  It is a privilege and honor to represent the fine Jasper County 
Vietnam Veterans, along with all the veterans in Iowa's second 
district.

                          ____________________
