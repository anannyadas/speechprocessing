                RECOGNIZING THE CAREER OF ELAINE ROBERTS

                                 ______
                                 

                         HON. PATRICK J. TIBERI

                                of ohio

                    in the house of representatives

                        Monday, November 6, 2017

  Mr. TIBERI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the career of 
Elaine Roberts, who is retiring from her service to the Ohio aviation 
community this month.
   Elaine has been a leader for Columbus, for Ohio, for the aviation 
industry, and for women in leadership roles in the transportation 
industry everywhere.
   Fourteen years ago, Elaine was recruited to serve as the first ever 
CEO of a combined aviation authority--the passenger facility serving 
Columbus and Central Ohio, a dual-use freight/military facility outside 
Columbus, and a general aviation field.
   Over the last decade and a half, she led all three with distinction 
and has been a catalyst for growth at Port Columbus, overseeing a major 
renovation and life extension of the facility.
   At Rickenbacker, our dual-use facility, she has worked with 
government partners at the federal, state, and local levels, as well as 
the private sector, to transform the area into one of the country's 
leading intermodal facilities.
   International and domestic freight operations--served by rail, 
highways, and international activation--help provide a livelihood to 
20,000 plus residents in our area.
   Elaine has been an inspiration to her fellow executives in aviation 
and transportation, and the region as a whole. She was nominated and 
selected by the White House in 2015 as a ``Champion of Change'' for her 
work at Rickenbacker.
   Elaine will be missed in the region, but I join the entire Ohio 
community in wishing her well.
