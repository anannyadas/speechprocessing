                    in the house of representatives

                        Monday, November 6, 2017

  Mr. GAETZ. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to recognize the 10 year 
anniversary of the Christian Life Center at First Baptist Church in 
Fort Walton Beach, Florida. This 13,000 square foot center was built in 
2007 to serve as a community service outreach to residents in the Fort 
Walton Beach area. Any member of the community is welcomed to hold 
membership at the Christian Life Center and take full advantage of the 
multitude of resources they offer.
  With approximately 200 members thus far, the center is able to host a 
wide array of sporting options and programs including Upwards Sporting 
Program for children and the Special Olympics. In addition to sporting 
leagues the Christian Life Center offers over 15 exercise classes and 
programs to members of the community. CLC also offers physical training 
equipment to assist less mobile individuals with health and wellness. 
The community has access to the CLC as it serves as the meeting place 
for the Fort Walton Beach Chamber of Commerce in addition to holding 
various seminars, drives and job fairs.
  I would like to personally extend my gratitude to the Christian Life 
Center and the congregation at First Baptist Church of Fort Walton 
Beach for their sincere love for the community and the resources they 
offer to provide a higher quality of life.
  Mr. Speaker, on behalf of the United States Congress, I am privileged 
to congratulate the Christian Life Center on their 10th Anniversary.

                          ____________________
