                      RECOGNIZING MRS. LYNN JEWELL

                                 ______
                                 

                          HON. JOHN GARAMENDI

                             of california

                    in the house of representatives

                        Monday, November 6, 2017

  Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Mrs. Lynn 
Jewell of Vacaville, California, who has been a vibrant servant of our 
community since coming from San Antonio, Texas as one of three young 
daughters of an Air Force Veteran. As a youth, Lynn was active in the 
Girl Scouts, church groups, and the Fairfield High School Scarlet 
Brigade Band before graduating from California State University, 
Sacramento with honors. After marrying Jeff Jewell, her service member 
husband, Lynn became active in supporting multiple local Veteran's 
Groups.
   Mrs. Jewell served as President of the Vacaville American Legion 
Auxiliary, Secretary of the Veterans of Foreign Wars Auxiliary, and 
served at the Vacaville Veterans' Memorial Hall as secretary, 
treasurer, Bingo volunteer, and co-chair of the Annual Holiday Dinners 
for over 20 years.
   In 2006, Lynn became involved in the North Bay Homeless Veterans 
Standdown writing grants, raising funds, and serving as volunteer 
coordinator. Her passionate commitment to this program grew and she now 
serves alongside her husband on the Standdown Board of Directors. Lynn 
is the driving force of the North Bay Standdown and most everyone would 
say that without Lynn, the years of providing supportive services to 
our homeless veterans in the form of a ``hand-up, not a hand-out'' 
would not have happened.
