                          PERSONAL EXPLANATION

                                 ______
                                 

                            HON. JARED POLIS

                              of colorado

                    in the house of representatives

                        Monday, November 6, 2017

  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I was unavoidably absent on October 31 and 
November 1, 2017. Had I been present for the following roll call votes:
  H.R. 2521--South Carolina Peanut Parity Act of 2017--I would have 
voted Yea on to allow South Carolina the ability to appoint members to 
the Peanut Standards Board.
  Motion on Ordering the Previous Question on the Rule providing for 
consideration of H.R. 2936--I would have voted no because this motion 
prevented proceeding to debate a problematic forestry bill, and allowed 
Congress to debate and vote on the Dream Act to protect DREAMers.
  H. Res. 595--Rule providing for consideration of H.R. 2936--Resilient 
Federal Forests Act of 2017--I would have opposed this rule because it 
only allowed debate of seven amendments, and blocked the consideration 
of 10 germane amendments. This rule does not maintain regular order I 
strive for.

                          ____________________
