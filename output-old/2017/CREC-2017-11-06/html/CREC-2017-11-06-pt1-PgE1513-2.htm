         IN RECOGNITION OF BOB WILLIAMS AND RANCH HANDS RESCUE

                                 ______
                                 

                        HON. MICHAEL C. BURGESS

                                of texas

                    in the house of representatives

                        Monday, November 6, 2017

  Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Bob Williams and 
the non-profit animal rescue and counseling center he founded as Ranch 
Hands Rescue in Argyle, Texas.
   Founded in 2008, Ranch Hands Rescue came to life as an outcome of a 
year-long recovery from a debilitating stroke Bob had suffered. With 
his background as a Motorola executive and a challenging recovery 
process, Bob was inspired with the recognition of the need for rescuing 
animals that would otherwise be euthanized. Rescuing the worst-of-the 
worst farm animal abuse and neglect cases, Ranch Hands Rescue was 
initially envisioned as a place that would provide a loving, caring and 
safe sanctuary to the animals that cannot be adopted due to special 
care needs.
   Through his own experience with the rescued animals, Bob realized 
the therapeutic impact they could also have on mental health. In 2010 
he started the Ranch Hands Rescue Equine and Animal Assisted Couseling 
(EEAC) program. Through the work of animal partners and Licensed 
Professional Counselors, Ranch Hands Rescue provides hope and healing 
for children, women, veterans and others suffering from painful mental 
health symptoms brought on by sexual assault, physical abuse, domestic 
violence, and other traumatic life experiences. In relating with the 
trauma experienced by the rescued animals at Ranch Hands Rescue, 
clients of the non-profit from across the entire Dallas/Ft Worth 
metroplex benefit from the unique trauma-informed animal assisted 
psychotherapy provided by highly-trained Licensed Professional 
Counselors.
   Thanks to the commitment and ongoing passion for rescuing abused and 
neglected farm animals that would otherwise be considered ``throw 
aways,'' Ranch Hands Rescue is ``animals helping people and people 
helping animals'' to provide a special sanctuary for healing in the 
heart of Texas 26th Congressional District.
