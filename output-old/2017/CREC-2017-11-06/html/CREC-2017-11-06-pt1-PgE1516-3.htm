                        TRIBUTE TO MALVERN BANK

                                 ______
                                 

                            HON. DAVID YOUNG

                                of iowa

                    in the house of representatives

                        Monday, November 6, 2017

  Mr. YOUNG of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and 
congratulate Malvern Bank of Malvern, Iowa, for celebrating 125 years 
in business. The bank was founded in 1892.
  Kate McGann, Executive Vice President said, ``after 125 years, we're 
hitting the refresh button with a new name and logo.'' Throughout its 
existence, Malvern Bank has gone through a number of name changes 
beginning in 1906 when it became Malvern National Bank, and in 1929, 
when Iowa banking laws changed to permit expanded trust offerings, the 
bank became the Malvern Trust & Savings Bank. Finally, it was in 1946 
that Eugene W. Burdic became president of the bank, and since then his 
family has retained ownership. They have remained at their original 
location on 404 Main Street, continuing to providing the same type of 
customer service and community leadership the bank was founded on.
  Mr. Speaker, I'm proud to represent Malvern Bank in the United States 
Congress and it is with great pride that I recognize them today. I ask 
that my colleagues in the United States House of Representatives join 
me in congratulating them for this outstanding achievement and in 
wishing everyone at the Malvern Bank nothing but continued success.

                          ____________________
