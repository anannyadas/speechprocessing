                          TRIBUTE TO PAT GREGG

                                 ______
                                 

                            HON. DAVID YOUNG

                                of iowa

                    in the house of representatives

                        Monday, November 6, 2017

  Mr. YOUNG of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and 
congratulate Pat Gregg of Council Bluffs, Iowa who recently retired 
from the Council Bluffs Fire Department after 25 years of service to 
his community. Pat joined the Council Bluffs Fire Department on August 
31, 1992.
  Council Bluffs Fire Chief Justin James said, ``Pat was one of the 
first firefighters I promoted to Captain when I became Chief, because 
his patient care always went the extra mile.'' Pat served as a 
paramedic and firefighter during his career. Pat said he has seen many 
changes in the Fire Department through the years but one thing that did 
not change was that the men and women of the Fire Department are still 
dedicated to the community.
  Mr. Speaker, Pat has made a difference by helping and serving others 
and it is with great pride that I recognize him today. I ask that my 
colleagues in the United States House of Representatives join me in 
congratulating him for this momentous occasion and in wishing him 
nothing but the best in his retirement.

                          ____________________
