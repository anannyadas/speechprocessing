                          PERSONAL EXPLANATION

                                 ______
                                 

                         HON. LUIS V. GUTIERREZ

                              of illinois

                    in the house of representatives

                        Monday, November 6, 2017

  Mr. GUTIERREZ. Mr. Speaker, I was unavoidably absent in the House 
chamber for votes on Friday, November 3, 2017. Had I been present, I 
would have voted Yea on Roll Call vote 605 and Nay on Roll Call vote 
606.
  I was absent in the House Chamber due to travelling to the devastated 
island of Puerto Rico in the wake of Hurricane Maria. A vote was called 
on the floor for H.R. 3922 to reauthorize the Children's Health 
Insurance Program and other public health initiatives under the 
Affordable Care Act. I would have voted Nay on this legislation because 
this bill would raise premiums for seniors, limit benefits for Medicaid 
recipients and slash grace periods from 90 days to 30 days, which would 
result in thousands of Americans losing their healthcare. Furthermore, 
this bill funds a mere $1 billion dollars to Puerto Rico in the midst 
of a dire crisis on the island.

                          ____________________
