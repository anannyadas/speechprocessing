                    in the house of representatives

                        Monday, November 6, 2017

  Ms. MICHELLE LUJAN GRISHAM of New Mexico. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize the life of a woman who was dedicated to public service 
and advocacy. Susan Popovich focused on the needs of her community 
throughout her life and was a source of hope for many in Santa Fe, New 
Mexico.
  Susan began her career as an educator in Pennsylvania and taught in 
Arizona for 14 years. After teaching, she continued her career in 
education by working for the National Education Association, where she 
worked for 23 years in several roles. She started out as an organizer 
and moved into the position of Regional Executive Director. She was 
also a Negotiations and Organizational Development Specialist with the 
NEA. Eventually, political activism became an important part of her 
life.
  Susan participated in political campaigns and completed hundreds of 
hours canvassing. In doing so, she became a friend to many in Santa Fe 
and deeply understood hardships the community faced.
  I also admire Susan for her work as a caregiver for her mother and 
brother through the end of their lives. She was selfless and giving, 
proven by the work she dedicated herself to and her care for others.
  Her life will continue to inspire educators, activists, and 
politicians. A life led by such a devoted woman will be remembered and 
felt in the community for many years to come.
