                        HONORING ANTHONY CHAVEZ

                                 ______
                                 

                      HON. MICHELLE LUJAN GRISHAM

                             of new mexico

                    in the house of representatives

                        Monday, November 6, 2017

  Ms. MICHELLE LUJAN GRISHAM of New Mexico. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize the heroism and bravery of Albuquerque native, Anthony 
Chavez, also known as the ``Red Hat Hero''. He helped five women escape 
gun fire during the deadly attack in Las Vegas, Nevada on October 1, 
2017.
  Chavez was among thousands in the crowd at the Route 91 Harvest Music 
Festival when a gumnan fired at the crowd from the 32nd floor of the 
nearby Mandalay Bay Casino and Hotel. Chavez did not hesitate to help 
the women who were standing near him.
  He made a selfless and courageous decision to help his significant 
other and four strangers over the fence in front of them so they could 
retreat to safety. Without his help, it is likely that the women would 
not have gotten out unharmed.
  Chavez then stayed in the area for an additional hour, helping direct 
people to ambulances and safe locations. He won't refer to himself as a 
hero, but it is undeniably clear that without his help many could have 
been injured or killed.
  Chavez was dubbed the ``Red Hat Hero'' because one of the women he 
saved recognized his unique, red Albuquerque Dukes hat in a photo on 
social media.
  Chavez was one of many heroes during an otherwise tragic night in Las 
Vegas. As such, he deserves our gratitude for his actions.
