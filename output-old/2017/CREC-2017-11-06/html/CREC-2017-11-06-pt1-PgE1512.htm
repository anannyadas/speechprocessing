RECOGNIZING ALL SAINTS' EPISCOPAL CHURCH OF WOODHAVEN, QUEENS ON THEIR

                                 ______
                                 

                        HON. NYDIA M. VELAZQUEZ

                              of new york

                    in the house of representatives

                        Monday, November 6, 2017

  Ms. VELAZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize All Saints' 
Episcopal Church of Woodhaven, Queens on their 120th Anniversary. This 
longstanding place of worship has a rich history as a congregation that 
embraces diversity and community service.
  All Saints held its first service and Sunday school at a store-front 
in Richmond Hill, Queens on November 26, 1897. Initial offerings 
collected by the service totaled $22.00, which became the initial 
contribution towards the purchase of a permanent church. A few years 
later, the church laid its first cornerstone on Lefferts Blvd., where 
it served for more than a century.
  The Church has a long history of providing guidance and comfort to 
new arrivals and families faced with hardship. For decades, All Saints 
enjoyed the leadership of Rectors dedicated to its parishioners and the 
greater community. Later on, the former St. Matthew's Church, a 
beautiful gothic revival building became its new home.
  Today, All Saints is a bedrock of the Woodhaven community. The Church 
continues to provide spiritual and physical comfort by offering social 
and community services. Initiatives like the senior lunch program, 
youth projects, the St. Hilda's Guild women's outreach program, and the 
Community Cemetery Project all promote fellowship.
  Mr. Speaker, our churches, temples, and mosques are the cornerstones 
of our communities, the bedrock on which our faith, values, and sense 
of purpose rest. On this special occasion of its 120th year 
anniversary, I congratulate the All Saints Episcopal Church 
congregation and wish them many more years of service.

                          ____________________
