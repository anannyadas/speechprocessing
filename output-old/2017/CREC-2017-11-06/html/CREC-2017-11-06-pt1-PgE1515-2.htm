                TRIBUTE TO MERLIN AND SYLVIA McALLISTER

                                 ______
                                 

                            HON. DAVID YOUNG

                                of iowa

                    in the house of representatives

                        Monday, November 6, 2017

  Mr. YOUNG of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and 
congratulate Merlin and Sylvia McAllister of Shenandoah, Iowa, on the 
very special occasion of their 70th wedding anniversary. They were 
married on April 7, 1946.
  Merlin and Sylvia have enjoyed many adventures together throughout 
their 70 years of marriage. Merlin said, ``We've been here, there, and 
everywhere, and just have a good time and enjoy life. We work together 
and we make a good team.'' They have visited all 50 states and have 
ventured overseas to Europe. Merlin said throughout his career he has 
been a jack of all trades and master of none.
  Merlin and Sylvia's lifelong commitment to each other, their two 
children, three grandchildren, five great-grandchildren, and three 
great-great-grandchildren truly embodies Iowa values. As they reflect 
on their 70th anniversary, may their commitment grow even stronger, as 
they continue to love, cherish, and honor one another for many years to 
come.
  Mr. Speaker, I commend this great couple on their 70th year together 
and I wish them many more. I ask that my colleagues in the United 
States House of Representatives join me in congratulating them on this 
momentous occasion and in wishing them both nothing but the best.

                          ____________________
