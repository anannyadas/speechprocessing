                      100TH ANNIVERSARY OF CLIFTON

                                 ______
                                 

                        HON. BILL PASCRELL, JR.

                             of new jersey

                    in the house of representatives

                        Monday, November 6, 2017

  Mr. PASCRELL. Mr. Speaker, I would like to call to your attention the 
outstanding achievements of the great City of Clifton as it celebrates 
its 100th Anniversary on November 4, 2017.
  On April 26, 1917, the City of Clifton was carved out of Acquackanonk 
Township and incorporated by an act of the New Jersey legislature. 
Named after the towering cliffs of Garret Mountain, Clifton is composed 
of many endearing neighborhoods. They are Albion, Allwood, Athenia, 
Botany Village, Delawanna,

Dutch Hill, Lakeview, Main Mall, Montclair Heights, Richfield, 
Rosemawr, Styertowne, West Clifton, and Yanticaw Pond. Just as 
Clifton's geography is diverse, so too are are its citizens. Clifton's 
84,136 residents speak over seventy languages and trace their heritage 
to all parts of the world.
  Today, we thank those who played a part in the founding of the city, 
and those leaders who guided the city in the years that followed. Since 
1934, Clifton has been governed by a City Manager and seven City 
Council members, one of whom is selected by his or her colleagues to be 
Mayor. The residents of Clifton are some of the most involved citizens, 
and make their voices heard by electing all members of the City 
Council.
  Mayor James Anzaldi has served in his current position for 27 years, 
making him the city's longest tenured mayor. His love for his hometown 
and dedication to public service set remarkable examples for all 
Cliftonites to follow.
  Students at Clifton High School boast their ``Mustang Pride'' in the 
classroom and at competitions throughout the North Jersey area. Mustang 
varsity sports teams have won multiple state championships throughout 
the decades, and the Mustang Band has been dazzling crowds since the 
1930s. The band has earned such a reputation that it has been 
nicknamed, ``The Showband of the Northeast.''
  The City of Clifton has been essential to the growth and development 
of Passaic County and the State of New Jersey overall. After the 
closure of the Morris Canal in 1924, Clifton began a mission to rapidly 
modernize. Over the next few decades, shopping centers, hotels, roads, 
and other vital infrastructure were built at a remarkable rate. By 
1952, Clifton was designated as New Jersey's fastest growing city. The 
city continues to champion economic progress and development today.
  It is my great honor to represent the residents of Clifton in the 
United States Congress. This is a city where people work hard to 
support their families, improve their community, and honor their 
history. When I visit my neighbors in Clifton, I never cease to be 
inspired by acts of ingenuity, compassion, and good will. I can always 
count on Cliftonites to be some of the friendliest constituents in my 
district, and the country as a whole.
  The job of a United States Congressman involves much that is 
rewarding, yet little compares to recognizing and commemorating 100 
years of rich history in Clifton, New Jersey.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask that you join our colleagues in celebrating 100 
years of service, dedication, and excellence from the residents of 
Clifton.
