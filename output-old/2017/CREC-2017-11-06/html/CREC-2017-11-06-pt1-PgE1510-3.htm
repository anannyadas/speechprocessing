                    in the house of representatives

                        Monday, November 6, 2017

  Mr. WALKER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize an outstanding 
constituent, Jerry Duncan from Guilford County. I am honored to 
acknowledge constituents who selflessly answered the call to serve and 
defend our freedom. A United States Army veteran of World War II and 
member of the Greatest Generation, Mr. Duncan served his country with 
honor. Self-sacrifice, personal responsibility, and humility are traits 
this generation embodied. The tremendous strides our country has made 
since World War II are a direct result of these great Americans. North 
Carolina is truly fortunate to have Mr. Duncan, an outstanding 
representative of our community and country.
   I join with his family, friends, and the Sixth District in thanking 
Jerry Duncan for his dedicated service to the United States of America.
