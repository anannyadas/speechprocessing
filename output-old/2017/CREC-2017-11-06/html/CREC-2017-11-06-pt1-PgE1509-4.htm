                 HONORING THE LIFE OF SRUTHI SRINIVASAN

                                 ______
                                 

                        HON. RAJA KRISHNAMOORTHI

                              of illinois

                    in the house of representatives

                        Monday, November 6, 2017

  Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI. Mr. Speaker, today I remember and honor the life 
of Sruthi Srinivasan who unexpectedly passed away on October 24th this 
year at the young age of 34.
  So many people knew Sruthi's passion for design and her amazing 
ability to dance. Sruthi's laugh, smile and warm soul could light up a 
room. She was easy to love and will be missed beyond measure, not only 
in the community of Downer's Grove, but across the nation.
  Sruthi was known as an incredible designer at her work with Ted 
Moudis in New York and was successful in the variety of roles that she 
had in the design industry. She was generous, kind, and her spirit was 
infectious.
  The Srinivasans and my family have known each other for decades, and 
they are all cherished friends. Mr. Speaker, I hope we might all keep 
in our thoughts and prayers the Srinivasan family and friends as they 
mourn their loss. In that spirit, I celebrate Sruthi's life and think 
about what an impact that life made on so many people.
