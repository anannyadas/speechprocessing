            CELEBRATING KEISER UNIVERSITY'S 40TH ANNIVERSARY

                                 ______
                                 

                         HON. ALCEE L. HASTINGS

                               of florida

                    in the house of representatives

                        Monday, November 6, 2017

  Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Keiser University on 
the commemoration of their 40th anniversary, which they will celebrate 
on November 10, 2017.
  Keiser University was founded in 1977 by Dr. Arthur Keiser and his 
mother Mrs. Evelyn Keiser, in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. By establishing 
Keiser University, Dr. Keiser and Evelyn sought to provide individuals 
the necessary educational tools for successfully navigating their 
chosen careers.
  Over the past 40 years, Keiser University has been a shining example 
of what one can achieve through hard work and dedication. It has grown 
to become the third largest not-for-profit university in Florida, 
bolstering 66,000 alumni, over 100 degree granting programs, and 18 
campuses across the state. Keiser University has even stretched beyond 
U.S. borders, establishing campuses abroad in Nicaragua, Moldova, and 
China.
  Throughout my tenure in Congress, I have watched Keiser University 
grow and expand its reach. Today, it has an annual economic impact of 
approximately $3 billion in Florida, while benefiting our residents 
with over 30,000 direct and indirect jobs each year.
  Keiser University's philosophy of putting students first and treating 
them as individuals is to be commended. Their diverse student body 
includes veterans, first-generation students, parents, caregivers, and 
students who have already joined the workforce. Keiser University 
provides the skills necessary for students to be successful within our 
global economy, while maintaining flexibility through an impressive 
online curriculum, which allows non-traditional students the ability to 
access the quality education they rightly deserve.
  Mr. Speaker, I want to commend Keiser University's co-founders and 
family, Dr. Arthur Keiser, his mother Mrs. Evelyn Keiser, and Ms. 
Belinda Keiser, and the independent Keiser University Board of 
Trustees, for their enduring commitment to providing students with a 
superior education. Over the past 40 years, Keiser University has 
proven itself to be a home for quality higher education, and a source 
of great pride to the people of Florida. I am truly honored to 
represent Keiser University in my Congressional district, and wish them 
many years of continued success.
