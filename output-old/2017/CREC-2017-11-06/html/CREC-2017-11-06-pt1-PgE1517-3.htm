                        Monday, November 6, 2017

  Mr. YOUNG of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and 
congratulate Susan Hatten for being named the 2017 Emerging Woman of 
Influence by the award-winning central Iowa Publication, Business 
Record. Susan has shared her talents and abilities through decades of 
service to organizations including, Variety, WineFest Des Moines, and 
The United Way of Central Iowa.
  For 18 years, the Business Record has undertaken an exhaustive annual 
review to identify a standout group of women who have made a 
significant difference in business, civic, and philanthropic endeavors 
throughout the Greater Des Moines Area.
  Susan began her career in marketing and public relations with the 
Sigler Company and later joined Holmes Murphy and Association in 2014 
as a senior consultant. According to Susan, both organizations have 
been nothing but supportive of volunteer efforts in the community 
allowing her to make the necessary time commitment to have a real, 
lasting impact on her community.
  Mr. Speaker, it is an honor to represent community leaders like Susan 
in the United States Congress and it is with great pride that I 
recognize and applaud her for utilizing her talents to better both her 
community and the great state of Iowa. I invite my colleagues in the 
United States House of Representatives to join me in congratulating 
Susan Hatten on receiving this esteemed designation, thanking those at 
Business Record for their great work, and wishing Susan nothing but the 
best.
