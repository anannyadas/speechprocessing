  Mr. YOUNG of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and 
congratulate Jeff Nolan, of Winterset, Iowa for being named the Madison 
County Chamber of Commerce's Business Person of the Year at this year's 
Madison County Chamber Banquet.
  The Business Person of the Year award is given out annually to a 
member of the community who has demonstrated a commitment to improving 
the economy and the business climate of Madison County. Jeff 
exemplifies that commitment and has worked tirelessly to improving the 
lives of all residents of Madison County, whether it was his work as 
President of Union State Bank or his service to the community. He also 
volunteers his time to the local hospital board, the Chamber 
Ambassadors and the Greater Madison County Community Foundation.
  Mr. Speaker, Jeff's efforts embody the Iowa spirit and I am proud to 
represent him, and Iowans like him, in the United States Congress. I 
ask that my colleagues in the United States House of Representatives 
join me in congratulating Jeff for this outstanding achievement and in 
wishing him nothing but continued success.
