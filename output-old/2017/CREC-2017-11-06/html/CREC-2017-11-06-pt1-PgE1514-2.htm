                                 ______
                                 

                            HON. DAVID YOUNG

                                of iowa

                    in the house of representatives

                        Monday, November 6, 2017

  Mr. YOUNG of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate and 
recognize Tiffany Menke, president of the Urbandale Iowa Chamber of 
Commerce, for being named a 2017 Women of Influence honoree by the 
award-winning central Iowa publication, Business Record.
  For 18 years, the Business Record has undertaken an exhaustive annual 
review to identify a standout group of women who have made a 
significant difference in business, civic and philanthropic endeavours 
throughout the Greater Des Moines Area.
  Tiffany has spent her life dedicating her time and talents to serving 
others. It all began during her time in customer service and as vice 
president of marketing and tourism for the Newton Chamber of Commerce. 
She oversaw a number of areas and projects while in Newton, helping 
lead them down a path of sustained success. After Tiffany's time in 
Newton she moved on to serve as president of the Urbandale Chamber of 
Commerce for the past 13 years. Her talents and abilities have been 
instrumental in tripling the chamber's membership, making it one of the 
best in the region.
  Mr. Speaker, it is an honor to represent leaders like Tiffany in the 
United States Congress and it is with great pride that I recognize and 
applaud her for utilizing her talents to better both her community, and 
the great state of Iowa. I ask that my colleagues in the United States 
House of Representatives join me in congratulating Tiffany on receiving 
this esteemed designation, thanking those at Business Record for their 
great work, and in wishing Tiffany nothing but continued success.

                          ____________________
