                     RECOGNIZING MS. MIRIAM MILLER

                                 ______
                                 

                          HON. JOHN GARAMENDI

                             of california

                    in the house of representatives

                        Monday, November 6, 2017

  Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Ms. Miriam 
Miller of Woodland, California, who has spent many years serving her 
community and truly loves volunteering. In years past, Ms. Miller has 
worked to revitalize the Woodland Downtown area through a program 
called ``Main Street'' and helped facilitate renovations to the 
Woodland Opera House State Historic Park. While working to bring 
Woodland's facilities into the future, she also worked to ensure her 
community never lost sight of its history. Ms. Miller was instrumental 
in the running of the Yolo County Historical Museum, worked as a docent 
at the museum and historical Opera House, helped others research their 
own history, and to this day still helps put out the Woodland 
Historical Society newsletter. If there was an opportunity to serve the 
Woodland community, Miriam Miller seized it.
   Ms. Miller's service and volunteerism was not limited to her 
community of Woodland. She traveled the world with her husband as he 
served in the U.S. Navy and State Department, supporting him and caring 
for her family. During World War II, Ms. Miller became very aware of 
the injustice of Japanese internment camps, leading her to live a life 
in support of immigrants and social justice. Ms. Miller has housed 
refugees in her home and made them a part of her family. She continues 
to fight for immigrant and refugee rights. Ms. Miller is dedicated to 
the betterment of her community, locally, nationally, and 
internationally.
