                       HONORING ETHEL T. WINFIELD

                                 ______
                                 

                          HON. ELIOT L. ENGEL

                              of new york

                    in the house of representatives

                        Monday, November 6, 2017

  Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a late member of the 
Co-op City community, Mrs. Ethel T. Winfield, who passed away this year 
at the amazing age of 94 years old. Though Ethel is no longer with us, 
the legacy she has left with her family, friends, and the community 
will last forever.
  Ethel and her beloved husband, Claude, lived in Co-op City and were 
quite active. After moving to the area in the 1960's, Ethel, a devoted 
Catholic, was instrumental in establishing and building the new church, 
St. Michael the Archangel Roman Catholic Church. While the church was 
being built, Ethel held services in her home at 920 Baychester Avenue.
  Professionally, Ethel worked as a Sample Hand at Vanity Fair in New 
York City. In 1971, she received certification at the prestigious Mayer 
School for Fashion Design. Amazed by her skill and talent, she rose 
from a Sample Hand to become an Assistant Designer at Vanity Fair; the 
first time anyone ever received this promotion. While at Vanity Fair, 
Ethel was concerned with equal rights of all workers. She was a shop 
steward, and as a union leader, she assisted fellow workers. Ethel 
enjoyed designing, draping and sewing dresses. She wanted her community 
residents to experience wearing beautiful fabrics and well-fitted 
clothes. She was committed to providing designer quality fitted 
clothing and often said, ``The small amount I charged the bride did not 
yield a profit for me. However, I wanted my community to feel like they 
were walking down a runway.''
  Though Ethel's story is full of inspiration, there was tragedy. In 
July 1957, Claude and Ethel were driving to Virginia with their son, 
Willie. During the trip, the car over turned in a ditch. Willie lost 
his life and Claude was injured badly. He had sustained internal 
injuries and almost every bone in his body had been broken. Ethel 
visited her husband for 2 years in the Veteran's Administration 
Hospital and never doubted her husband would live. She encouraged him 
to complete his therapy which included learning to use his left hand 
and arm to shave and complete other tasks. It was her belief and 
encouragement in those terribly tragic moments that gave Claude the 
strength to recover.
  As you might imagine from hearing that story, Ethel's true passion 
was her family, which includes sons, Claude L. Winfield, and Siddique 
Ali Shahbaaz; daughter-in-laws Michelle Deal Winfield and Cynthia Ali 
Shahbaaz; grand children Gary Winfield and wife Rasheed Winfield, Marie 
Winfield and spouse Konrad Pust, Michael C. Winfield, Nikkea Winfield, 
Jason Winfield and Makeda Winfield; nieces Katherine Miles and Vida 
Hinton with cousin Janett Baughaum; and great grandchildren Sophie and 
Koemi Winfield-Pust. She loved each of them dearly.
  Ethel Winfield lived a long and blessed life. In later years, she 
took art classes at the Baychester Visual Arts class on Tuesday 
evenings. Like many budding artist, Ethel gave away sketches and 
drawings, making friends along the way. That was Ethel--an artist, 
always thinking of others.
