                IN RECOGNITION OF BURNETTA SLOSS-TANNER

                                 ______
                                 

                           HON. ANDRE CARSON

                               of indiana

                    in the house of representatives

                        Monday, November 6, 2017

  Mr. CARSON of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor the life and 
legacy of a dynamic political activist, Burnetta Sloss-Tanner, who 
passed away on October 23, 2017. She was my confidant, drill 
instructor, surrogate, auntie, war time general and tireless 
campaigner. She was a dear friend to me and my family and a friend to 
Hoosiers everywhere, especially the powerless.
  ``Ms. Burnetta'', known for her trademark sequined hat, was a pillar 
in Democratic politics throughout Indianapolis. She long served as the 
4th Ward Chair for the Marion County Democratic Party and had a deep 
love for grassroots politics, holding monthly meetings in her home to 
train candidates, elected officials, and volunteers on strategy and 
mobilizing our community. Without Ms. Burnetta, neither me, nor my 
grandmother, Congresswoman Julia Carson, would have been elected to 
Congress. I am certain many local and state elected officials can 
credit her for their successes as well.
  Not only was Ms. Burnetta a legend in political circles, she was also 
beloved by the community. She worked with the Indiana Civil Rights 
Commission, the Center Township Trustee's office, and countless other 
organizations.
  She was a woman of great faith with a passion for gospel music. She 
studied under several notable gospel artists, mentored countless 
others, and was a founding member and director of the award winning 
Jordan-Aires Gospel Choir. She will always be remembered for her work 
as a gospel radio personality, hosting The Heartbeat of Good Gospel 
Music on WTLC. Her passion for, and contributions to, gospel music 
earned her the title of ``The First Lady of Gospel Music'' of 
Indianapolis.
  Ms. Burnetta served as a source of change, strength and faith for so 
many, leaving a lasting impression on generations to come. I am blessed 
to have had the opportunity to know her.
  I urge my colleagues to join me in honoring our beloved Burnetta 
Sloss-Tanner for her remarkable service to the City of Indianapolis, 
the State of Indiana, and our nation.
