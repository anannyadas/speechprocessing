                    in the house of representatives

                        Monday, November 6, 2017

  Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Nancy Wells of 
Davis, California, who has dedicated her twenty-year career to 
education and exemplifies the true meaning of public servant, volunteer 
and advocate for school aged children, adults and senior citizens in 
the community.
   Nancy was instrumental in implementing many innovative programs 
during her professional career. She instituted ``Just for Kids,'' a 
program that matched at risk elementary students with adult volunteers, 
who would spend time helping students having difficulties with school 
subjects. She also started the ``Latch Key Program'' an afterschool 
program that provided a place for students to do their homework in a 
safe environment while their parents were at work. As director of 
Special Education, she was able to provide outstanding programs for 
children with special needs offering them academic training at a level 
in which they would be successful.
   Nancy is also involved in various community organizations. She was a 
founding member of the Dixon Family Services agency, where she started 
a Grief Intervention Program for children. She's also a member of the 
Dixon Advocates for Seniors as well as a member of Dixon's Community 
Care Home Auxiliary.
   Nancy is considered a kind, compassionate and devoted person who is 
always willing to volunteer wherever she is needed. Nancy serves on the 
St. Peter's parish leadership team and is a long-time community 
servant.
