                       LEGALIZATION OF MARIJUANA

                                 ______
                                 

                            HON. JARED POLIS

                              of colorado

                    in the house of representatives

                        Monday, November 6, 2017

  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, five years ago, Colorado voters chose to 
amend the State Constitution to legalize the cultivation, sale, and 
personal use of marijuana for people 21 years of age or older. Today, 
Colorado is home to a growing marijuana economy which has created 
23,000 jobs in the industry and in excess of $200 million in tax 
revenue which helps to fund our schools.
  States like Colorado, and now dozens of other states, have proven 
that allowing responsible adults to legally purchase marijuana, gives 
money to classrooms, not cartels; creates jobs, not addicts; and boosts 
our economy, not our prison population.
  Colorado ought to be an example for the nation, and it is past time 
we lift the federal prohibition on marijuana. That's why I'm proud to 
sponsor the Regulate Marijuana Like Alcohol Act, which allows each 
state to decide for itself whether to legalize marijuana. In addition, 
I will continue to attempt to restrict the Department of Justice from 
enforcing federal marijuana laws in states where it is legal.
  Earlier in 2017, I launched the bipartisan Cannabis Caucus with Rep. 
Earl Blumenauer, Rep. Dana Rohrabacher, and Rep. Don Young. The caucus 
will serve as an important working group to discuss marijuana policy 
and its future, moving Congress into the 21st century on drug policy.
  I applaud the pioneers of the cannabis industry in Colorado and 
nationwide. The perseverance and hard work to create a new model of 
legalization is commendable.
