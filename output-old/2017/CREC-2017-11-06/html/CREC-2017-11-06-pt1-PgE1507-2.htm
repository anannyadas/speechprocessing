             HONORING DEPUTY FIRE CHIEF CHRISTOPHER PEPLER

                                 ______
                                 

                         HON. ELIZABETH H. ESTY

                             of connecticut

                    in the house of representatives

                        Monday, November 6, 2017

  Ms. ESTY of Connecticut. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the 
service and life of the late Deputy Chief Christopher Pepler, who 
passed away on November 1, 2017 after a long battle with cancer. Pepler 
was a member of the Torrington Fire Department since 1999 and had 
served as Deputy Fire Chief. He was a beloved member of the Torrington 
community and a model public servant.
  Deputy Chief Pepler was a Torrington native, and he dreamed of 
becoming a firefighter from a young age. He began volunteering with 
Torringford Fire Department when he was only 15, and he was hired by 
the Torrington Fire Department in 1999. The Department recognized his 
leadership and commitment to keeping the community safe, and Pepler was 
appointed Deputy Fire Chief in 2013.
  He was an active member of the department and worked hard to support 
his fellow firefighters. He served as the Assistant Director of 
Training for the Wolcott Regional Fire School, sharing his expertise 
with young and aspiring firefighters. Pepler also worked on behalf of 
his fellow firefighters as the president of the IAFF Local 1567 prior 
to his appointment as Deputy Chief.
  Mr. Speaker, Deputy Chief Christopher Pepler brought a passion for 
serving his community and helping others to the Torrington Fire 
Department, and his work leaves a legacy of service that will inspire 
future generations of firefighters in our community. Therefore, it is 
fitting and proper that we honor his life here today. I extend my 
deepest condolences to his wife, Lori, and all those who knew and loved 
Christopher.
