               IN RECOGNITION OF THE DUFFY HEALTH CENTER

                                 ______
                                 

                        HON. WILLIAM R. KEATING

                            of massachusetts

                    in the house of representatives

                        Monday, November 6, 2017

  Mr. KEATING. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of the 20th 
Anniversary of the Duffy Health Center.
  The Duffy Health Center has been serving as Barnstable County's 
primary health care provider for homeless adults since 1997. What 
started as a small volunteer organization in 1988 has now turned into a 
major pillar of this community, working to serve the homeless men and 
women of Cape Cod.
  This clinic is made up of an incredible group of people that are 
working tirelessly to better the Ninth Congressional District. Over the 
past twenty years they have helped those suffering from addiction, 
mental health issues, and other serious medical problems find their way 
to applying for master's degrees, retaining full-time employment, and 
building new lives. They have provided vital assistance to people 
trying to apply for benefits, receive counseling, or find a support 
group.
  By treating people with dignity and respect, the hope they have 
restored in countless members of our community is unparalleled.
  Mr. Speaker, I am proud to honor the 20th anniversary of the Duffy 
Health Center for their dedication to bettering their community. I ask 
that my colleagues join me in thanking them for their invaluable 
service and wishing them all the best in the many years to come.

                          ____________________
