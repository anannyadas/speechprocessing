       SECURING ELECTRONIC RECORDS FOR VETERANS' EASE ACT OF 2017

                                 ______
                                 

                               speech of

                  HON. HENRY C. ``HANK'' JOHNSON, JR.

                               of georgia

                    in the house of representatives

                       Tuesday, November 7, 2017

  Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise to support H.R. 3634, the 
Securing Electronic Records for Veterans' Ease (SERVE) Act of 2017. 
This is an important piece of legislation and I am proud to support it.
  The Post-9/11 GI Bill is an educational benefit program for veterans 
who have courageously served our country since the terrorist attacks on 
September 11, 2001. Through this bill, tuition and fee payments, as 
well as a monthly housing allowance, are paid to schools on behalf of 
veterans based on the length of their period of active duty. H.R. 3634 
directs the Secretary of the Department of Veterans Affairs to provide 
these veterans with verification of the amount of their monthly housing 
stipend. This verification would also be available online in the same 
way that the VA provides information about other benefits it offers.
  This bill is the simplest way to clarify a living expense for those 
who have sacrificed for their country. Since 2009, this program has 
provided benefits to over 773,000 veterans and their family members, 
providing over $20 billion in benefits. As a representative from 
Georgia, a state that hosts a number of military bases, supporting this 
bill is the least I can do to make life easier for veterans and their 
family members who are transitioning to life after active duty.
