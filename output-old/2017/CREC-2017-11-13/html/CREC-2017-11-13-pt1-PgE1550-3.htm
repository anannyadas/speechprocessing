                  HON. HENRY C. ``HANK'' JOHNSON, JR.

                               of georgia

                    in the house of representatives

                       Tuesday, November 7, 2017

  Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise to support H.R. 2123, the 
Veterans E-Health and Telemedicine Support Act of 2017. This 
legislation would allow the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) 
health professionals to practice telemedicine across state borders if 
they are qualified and practice within the scope of their authorized 
federal duties. Under current law, VA doctors can only provide 
telehealth treatment across state lines if the veteran and the doctor 
are located in federal facilities. The VETS Act of 2017 removes these 
barriers and allows VA physicians to provide treatment without a 
location restriction. Veterans will no longer be required to travel to 
a VA facility, but rather can receive telemedicine treatment from 
anywhere, including their home or a community center.
  In this technologically advanced age, there is no excuse for us to 
withhold support from veterans. Telemedicine allows qualified 
practitioners to reach veterans even in the most remote areas. 
Currently, location requirements make it difficult for veterans--
especially those struggling with mental health issues--to get the help 
they need and deserve. H.R. 2123 will ensure that our veterans can 
obtain the best care possible regardless of where they are in the 
United States. I fully support H.R. 2123 to make lifesaving resources 
easily accessible for the veterans who have dutifully served our 
country
