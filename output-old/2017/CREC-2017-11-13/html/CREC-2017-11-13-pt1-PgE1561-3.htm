                       Monday, November 13, 2017

  Mr. McCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of Celia 
McAdam and her upcoming retirement after decades of service in the 4th 
Congressional District of California.
  Celia McAdam has devoted herself and her career to helping her 
community through transportation planning. She first began her career 
in transportation in the early 1990s when she served as Senior Planner 
for the Placer County Transportation Planning Agency (PCTPA). In 1998, 
she was chosen to serve as the Executive Director of the PCTPA, a 
position she still holds today. Additionally, Celia has served as the 
Executive Director of the South Placer Regional Transportation 
Authority since its creation in 2001.
  A leader in the field of transportation funding, Celia has been 
hailed as ``[one] of the most important transportation officials in 
Northern California'' by the Sacramento Bee for her ability to navigate 
the bureaucratic and technical obstacles associated with infrastructure 
planning. Her creativity in planning enabled her to design and fund 
vital infrastructure projects such as the I-80 Bottleneck Widening, 
Lincoln Bypass, I-80/Sierra College Boulevard Interchange, I-80/Douglas 
Boulevard Interchange and numerous other transit and rail projects.
  Celia McAdam's successful career has not gone unnoticed by the 
transportation community and her talents have earned her numerous 
accolades in recognition of her contributions to California's 
infrastructure. In 2012, Celia was named Woman of the Year by the 
Women's Transportation Seminar and she received the planning 
profession's highest honor by being inducted as a Fellow of the College 
of American Institute of Certified Planners in 2016.
  Placer County Transportation Planning Agency has received numerous 
awards under her leadership, including Organization of the Year by the 
California Transportation Foundation and Agency of the Year by the 
Sacramento Area Council of Governments.
  Mr. Speaker, I am proud to honor and congratulate Celia McAdam for 
her commitment to transportation planning and public service.
