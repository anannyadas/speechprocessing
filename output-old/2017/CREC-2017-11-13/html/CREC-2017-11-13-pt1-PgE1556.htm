                            HON. KEN CALVERT

                             of california

                    in the house of representatives

                       Monday, November 13, 2017

  Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in proud recognition of the 
Operation Recognition Class of 2017. Operation Recognition is a program 
organized by the Riverside County Office of Education, with assistance 
from the Riverside County Department of Veteran's Services, that 
presents diplomas to residents of Riverside County who missed 
completing high school due to military service in World War II, the 
Korean War, or the Vietnam War, or due to internment in WWII Japanese-
American relocation camps.
  Riverside County's Operation Recognition is modeled after programs 
implemented in other states. Numerous county offices of education and 
school districts throughout California operate similar programs. The 
programs are yet another way to express our appreciation and gratitude 
for the significant contributions and sacrifices made by our veterans.
  The Operation Recognition Class of 2017 includes: Timothy Lewis 
Basquez, San Jacinto, U.S, Marine Corps, Vietnam War; Manuel Blunt, 
Riverside, U.S. Army, Vietnam War; Edward J. Clark, Norco, U.S. Marine 
Corps, Korean War, Joseph J. Harrison, Perris, U.S. Army, Vietnam War, 
Bradford Hotchkiss, Riverside, U.S. Navy, Vietnam War, James Andrew 
Morrison, Canyon Lake, U.S. Navy, Korean War; and Mack Donald Salesky 
San Jacinto, U.S. Army, Vietnam War.
  On behalf of all Riverside County residents and a grateful nation, I 
want to thank these veterans for their service to our country and 
congratulate them on being part of the Operation Recognition Class of 
2017.
