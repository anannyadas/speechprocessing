                         HON. VICENTE GONZALEZ

                                of texas

                    in the house of representatives

                       Monday, November 13, 2017

  Mr. GONZALEZ of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize an 
outstanding community member and upstanding citizen, Mr. Ron Dominguez 
of Rockport, Texas.
   A proud U.S. Army veteran, Mr. Dominguez has continued to honorably 
serve his community as a Ride Captain with the Patriot Guard Riders; a 
Little League Volunteer; a Volunteer Rescue Worker at Ground Zero and 
post-Hurricane Katrina New Orleans; and as a Mentor at the Robert 
Barnes Regional Juvenile Facility Boot Camp. Mr. Dominguez was also a 
member of the Aransas County Class Leadership Class XVIII. He achieved 
all of this while being a loving husband and father.
   As you can see, Mr. Dominguez has accomplished many amazing feats, 
and I have no doubt that he will go on to accomplish more. And even 
after countless successes, he has remained humble, owing his 
achievements to Tellisah, his wife, who has always offered her 
unwavering and steadfast support.
   Mr. Speaker, I again offer my congratulations to Mr. Dominguez, his 
wife, Tellisah, and their 6 beloved daughters. His empathy, goodwill, 
and perseverance have not gone unnoticed. Mr. Dominguez and his family 
have made the state of Texas and the United States a better place, and 
it is my honor to acknowledge him today.
