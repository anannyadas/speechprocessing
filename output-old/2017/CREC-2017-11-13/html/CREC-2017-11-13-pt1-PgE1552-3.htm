  Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Mr. Speaker, I proudly pause to recognize 
Matthew John Lewis. Matthew is a very special young man who has 
exemplified the finest qualities of citizenship and leadership by 
taking an active part in the Boy Scouts of America, Troop 251, and 
earning the most prestigious award of Eagle Scout.
   Matthew has been very active with his troop, participating in many 
scout activities. Over the many years Matthew has been involved with 
scouting, he has not only earned numerous merit badges, but also the 
respect of his family, peers, and community. Most notably, Matthew has 
served his troop as the Historian and Senior Patrol Leader, earned the 
rank of Warrior in the Tribe of Mic-O-Say, and become a Brotherhood 
member in Order of Arrow. Matthew has also contributed to his community 
through his Eagle Scout project. Matthew leveled the area with paving 
stones and constructed 40 feet of fence for Beautiful Savior Lutheran 
Church in Lee's Summit, Missouri.
   Mr. Speaker, I proudly ask you to join me in commending Matthew John 
Lewis for his accomplishments with the Boy Scouts of America and for 
his efforts put forth in achieving the highest distinction of Eagle 
Scout.
