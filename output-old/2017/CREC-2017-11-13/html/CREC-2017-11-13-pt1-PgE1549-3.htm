             COMMEMORATING THE RETIREMENT OF MR. RAY SHOOK

                                 ______
                                 

                         HON. MARIO DIAZ-BALART

                               of florida

                    in the house of representatives

                       Monday, November 13, 2017

  Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate the 
retirement of Mr. Ray Shook. Mr. Shook is an outstanding individual who 
has served as the Executive Director of the American Welding Society 
since 2002.
   Mr. Shook's retirement closes the chapter of a forty-four year 
association with the welding industry. Prior to his tenure with the 
American Welding Society, Mr. Shook served on the Board of Directors 
and as Vice President of the International Institute of Welding for 
five years. He spent twenty five years working his way up at Hobart 
Brothers Company and reached the position of President at the Hobart 
Institute of Welding Technology, which is the world's largest welding 
training organization.
   Under his leadership, the American Welding Society experienced 
significant changes. With membership reaching over 73,000, revenues 
steadily increased from $15 million to more than $40 million annually. 
He was instrumental in establishing North America's largest annual 
metalwork exhibition by forging an alliance with FABTECH. The Society 
also expanded globally, achieving its first acquisition in its ninety-
five year history through its purchase of Weldmex in 2007. Throughout 
his tenure, the American Welding Society continued to grow and acquire 
additional global holdings.
   Having known Mr. Shook for a number of years, I know that he has 
consistently demonstrated the highest degree of integrity. He has been 
dedicated to his profession and has worked tirelessly to advance the 
Society's mission of globally advancing the science and technology of 
welding. His work ethic, loyalty, and service to the welding industry 
cannot be understated.
   Mr. Speaker, I am honored to pay tribute to my friend, Mr. Ray 
Shook, for his impressive career in the welding industry, and I ask my 
colleagues to join me in recognizing this remarkable individual.
