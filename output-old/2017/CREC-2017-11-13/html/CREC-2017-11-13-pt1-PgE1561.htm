                                 ______
                                 

                            HON. ANDY BIGGS

                               of arizona

                    in the house of representatives

                       Monday, November 13, 2017

  Mr. BIGGS. Mr. Speaker, today I honor my constituent Grant R. Ward. 
Grant is a resident of Gilbert, Arizona. He is receiving the Lifetime 
Achievement Award by the National Water Resources Association (NWRA).
  This lifetime achievement award was established in 1948. According to 
the NWRA, this award ``recognizes members and individuals who have 
actively served in the leadership of the Association for many years and 
who, by their activities and service to the goals and objective of the 
Association, merit Life Member status.'' Grant embodies the spirit of 
this distinguished award.
  Grant has an impressive resume of service. He graduated from Brigham 
Young University in 1967 and received his law degree in 1969 from the 
University of Idaho. From there, he commenced his professional career, 
serving as an assistant branch manager at the Valley National Bank for 
a few years. He then took a job as General Manager of the Roosevelt 
Water Conservation District for over a decade. Following this 
occupation, he progressed through several jobs, starting with Executive 
Vice President of the Agri-Business Council of Arizona, Assistant 
General Manager of the Central Arizona Water Conservation District, and 
General Manager of the Maricopa-Stanfield Irrigation & Drainage 
District. He currently is an independent water and power consultant.
  Grant is married to Judy. They have seven children and 36 
grandchildren.
  Mr. Speaker, Grant has a remarkable track record of service and 
perseverance in employment. He showed his children the value of hard 
work and the necessity of pushing through each day to pay the bills. 
His children now have his example to lean on as they demonstrate 
similar work ethics to their own children.
  However, Grant's service didn't simply stop with his paycheck. He was 
extremely involved with his community--and still is today. Grant has 
sat on several boards and presided over several clubs and committees in 
Arizona. Grant looks for any possible way to give back to his 
community.
  I applaud Grant for his award, and I look forward to his continued 
service.
