honored to acknowledge constituents who selflessly answered the call to 
serve and defend our freedom. A United States Navy veteran of World War 
II and member of the Greatest Generation, Mr. Padula served his country 
with honor. Self-sacrifice, personal responsibility, and humility are 
traits this generation embodied. The tremendous strides our country has 
made since World War II are a direct result of these great Americans. 
North. Carolina is truly fortunate to have Mr. Padula, an outstanding 
representative of our community and country. I join with his family, 
friends, and the Sixth District in thanking Anthony W. Padula for his 
dedicated service to the United States of America.
