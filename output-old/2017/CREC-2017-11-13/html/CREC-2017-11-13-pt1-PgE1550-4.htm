                   IN RECOGNITION OF WILLIAM J. GAUL

                                 ______

                            of pennsylvania

                    in the house of representatives

                       Monday, November 13, 2017

  Mr. MEEHAN. Mr. Speaker, today I recognize Mr. William J. Gaul, Jr. 
of Delaware County, Pennsylvania. Mr. Gaul served his country during 
the Vietnam War and continued his selfless work upon arriving home to 
Upper Darby, Pennsylvania.
  While in Vietnam, Mr. Gaul went above and beyond his duties through 
his volunteer work. In his free time he taught English in a local 
school and brought food, clothing, and medical supplies to an 
orphanage. Mr. Gaul exemplified the true mission of America in Vietnam 
by working to improve the lives of the local community.
  Upon returning to Upper Darby, Mr. Gaul remained active in his own 
community. He has served as Emergency Management Coordinator since 
1980, is a member of the Upper Darby School Board, and also serves on 
the Upper Darby Township Square Club. Mr. Gaul even led a fundraiser to 
provide bullet-proof vests for his local police department.
  As seen during his time in Vietnam, Mr. Gaul's good works go further 
than his local community. In 2005, he spent 8 weeks in New Orleans, 
providing help in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina.
  Mr. William J. Gaul has shown throughout his life that he is willing 
to go above and beyond the call of duty to provide for others. I thank 
him for honorably serving our country and the public with passion and 
commitment
