                     HONORING ALICIA JAYNE ENDICOTT

                                 ______
                                 

                            HON. SAM GRAVES

                              of missouri

                    in the house of representatives

                       Monday, November 13, 2017

  Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Mr. Speaker, I proudly pause to recognize a 
special member of my staff. After almost seventeen years of service, 
Alicia Jayne Endicott will be leaving her post in my Kansas City 
District Office.
   Alicia was one of the first members of my staff, joining the team 
soon after I took office in 2001. She has been an integral member of my 
constituent services team that entire time. Alicia was tireless in 
making sure the people of the Sixth Congressional District were treated 
fairly by federal agencies and that their concerns were heard and 
justly resolved. Whether helping families with last-minute passport 
needs, protecting my constituents from overbearing agencies or making 
sure our veterans received the care and recognitions they earned, her 
outstanding work and immense knowledge of the issues was incomparable 
and I am honored to have had her on my staff and my constituents were 
incredibly served by her efforts.
   I have received many kind words from constituents praising the 
outstanding service Alicia has provided. Her professionalism and 
dedication to this office and my constituents was a great example of 
how government should work. She would often work nights and weekends, 
all without complaint. While I am losing a valuable member of my team, 
I am excited for Alicia to begin the next chapter of her life.
   Mr. Speaker, I proudly ask you to join me in thanking Alicia Jayne 
Endicott for her many years of service to the people of the Sixth 
Congressional District. I know Alicia's colleagues, family and friends 
join with me in thanking her for her commitment to others and wishing 
her the best of luck in all her endeavors and many years of success to 
come.
