  RECOGNIZING THE WORK OF FOUNTAIN BROTHERS AMERICAN LEGION POST 1619

                                 ______
                                 

                         HON. ELISE M. STEFANIK

                              of new york

                    in the house of representatives

                       Monday, November 13, 2017

  Ms. STEFANIK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize dedicated 
individuals of the Fountain Brothers American Legion Post 1619 who are 
working to reduce the prevalence of hepatitis C among Vietnam Era 
veterans.
  Vietnam Era veterans are at a significantly higher risk for hepatitis 
C infection than the general population due to dangerous health 
practices applied to service members before the virus was discovered. 
Consequently, many veterans continue to die as a result of 
complications from hepatitis C.
  Due to scientific breakthroughs, hepatitis C is now easily diagnosed 
and largely curable. To ensure that all Vietnam Era veterans receive 
proper testing and follow up care, the Fountain Brothers American 
Legion Post 1619 in my district has been holding regular outreach 
testing events with the local VA. Post 1619 has tested over 1,200 
veterans in the past year, providing the first step for diagnosis and 
potential life-saving treatment.
  On behalf of New York's 21st District, I want to recognize the work 
that the members of

Post 1619 have accomplished and thank them for their dedication to our 
veterans. Those who serve deserve the respect of a grateful nation, and 
the hard work of Post 1619 represents an important step in the right 
direction.
