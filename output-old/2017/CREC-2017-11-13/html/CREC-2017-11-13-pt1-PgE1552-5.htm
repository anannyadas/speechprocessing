                    in the house of representatives

                       Monday, November 13, 2017

  Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI. Mr. Speaker, today I honor the lives of Dr. Zia 
Hassan and Mr. Abdul Hameed Dogar who passed away on October 29 this 
year of natural causes.
  Dr. Hassan and Mr. Dogar were widely known for their work in both 
their home and Muslim-American communities.
  Abdul, affectionately known as Dogar Hasib, immigrated to the United 
States in March of 1962. As a civil engineer, he worked for the 
Illinois Department of Transportation designing roads that link our 
communities and move millions of people in the Chicagoland area every 
day. In addition, he served as a Director of the Islamic Foundation of 
Illinois for over 40 years.
  Dr. Hassan, a widely published engineer and businessman, immigrated 
to the United States in 1956. He was the Dean Emeritus of The Illinois 
Institute of Technology's Stuart School of Business, Chairman Emeritus 
of the Islamic Foundation of Illinois, a Fellow of the American Society 
for Quality, and served as an examiner for the Malcolm Baldrige 
National Quality Award.
  Together, their passion for community work drove them to found the 
Islamic Foundation of Illinois, now one of the largest Islamic Centers 
for religious practice and education in America. Their dedication to 
their communities helped Muslim-Americans in the Chicago area pursue 
educational and professional achievements to further the development of 
our community.
  I want to recognize Dr. Hassan and Dogar Hasib for their 
accomplishments and hard work on behalf of their friends, family and 
the

Muslim-American community at large. They will be dearly missed and 
remembered.
  Mr. Speaker, I hope we all keep in our thoughts and prayers the 
friends and family of Dr. Hassan and Dogar Hasib. I celebrate the 
happiness and joy they brought so many people and reflect on the 
significant impacts they had on their friends, their families, and 
their communities.
