               NATIONAL VETERANS MEMORIAL AND MUSEUM ACT

                                 ______
                                 

                               speech of

                  HON. HENRY C. ``HANK'' JOHNSON, JR.

                               of georgia

                    in the house of representatives

                       Tuesday, November 7, 2017

  Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1900, 
the National Veterans Memorial and Museum Act.
  H.R. 1900 seeks to name the Veterans Memorial and Museum in Columbus, 
Ohio, the National Veterans Memorial and Museum.
  The Veterans Memorial and Museum is a landmark that has been under 
construction in Columbus, Ohio, since December 2015. The Veterans 
Memorial and Museum will soon be open to the public and aims to display 
the combined experiences of American veterans from all armed encounters 
and branches of the military. The National Veterans Memorial and Museum 
is just one way we can honor veterans and their families, and guarantee 
that future generations know the many sacrifices that were made for us.
  Ohio is an appropriate setting for the new museum, considering that 
the state is home to the sixth largest veteran population in the United 
States. As we approach Veterans Day, the passage of the National 
Veterans Memorial and Museum Act is tremendous news for not only Ohio's 
veteran community but to all veterans nationwide. I recognize the value 
of having a national site to reflect on the experiences of veterans 
throughout American history, and I am pleased to support this 
legislation.
