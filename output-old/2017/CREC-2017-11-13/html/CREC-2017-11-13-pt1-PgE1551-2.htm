                   IN RECOGNITION OF STEPHANIE FARMER

                                 ______
                                 

                          HON. PATRICK MEEHAN

                            of pennsylvania

                    in the house of representatives

                       Monday, November 13, 2017

  Mr. MEEHAN. Mr. Speaker, today I recognize Stephanie Farmer of 
Delaware County, Pennsylvania, for her service to the United States and 
her local community.
  Ms. Farmer honorably served our country in the U.S. Air Force. 
Following her service, she returned home to Delaware County to teach. 
She brought enthusiasm to the classroom that had a tremendous impact on 
the students she taught. After years of teaching Ms. Farmer was asked 
to accept the Assistant Principal position at Tinicum School in 
Essington. In this capacity, she has become known as a devoted, caring 
educator who pushes her students to be their best.
  One particular area in which Ms. Farmer challenges her students is 
reading. She intensified the focus on her school's Summer Reading 
Program--which challenges grade schools to read the most books over 
their summer break. Thanks to her devotion, her students consistently 
lead other elementary schools in this competition.
  Her passion for learning and the energy she brings to school has 
proven infectious. Her efforts have helped her students gain more from 
their education than what they otherwise would have.
  I commend Ms. Stephanie Farmer for her life of service to her 
students, community, and country. I wish her and her students much 
continued success
