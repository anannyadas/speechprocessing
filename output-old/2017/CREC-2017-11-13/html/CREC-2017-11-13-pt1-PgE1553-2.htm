                            of pennsylvania

                    in the house of representatives

                       Monday, November 13, 2017

  Mr. MEEHAN. Mr. Speaker, today I recognize Mr. George M. Roach of 
Delaware County, Pennsylvania, for his service in the U.S. Air Force. 
After he was honorably discharged, he became a career member of 
Pennsylvania's Air National Guard and has since been deployed to Kuwait 
and Qatar.
  In his capacity with the National Guard, Mr. Roach has also served 
many humanitarian missions. He supported Pennsylvania's National Guard 
activation for the response to Hurricane Katrina's devastation, and was 
deployed again to provide recovery assistance to areas affected by 
Hurricanes Gustav and Ike in 2008.
  In 2011, Mr. Roach was deployed to Afghanistan as a Public Affairs/
Military Liaison for Armed Forces Entertainment. Mr. Roach also 
participated in a NATO mission to support Hungarian forces and 
voluntarily deployed himself to Houston this year to assist victims of 
Hurricane Harvey. He currently has a civilian career in TV 
photojournalism, and helped found FOX's annual ``Military Appreciation 
Day.'' He has also produced recruitment content for the Philadelphia 
Police Department that the force uses to help bring in qualified 
applicants.
  Mr. Roach's career speaks for itself. He's a proven humanitarian, 
public servant, and role model for others who wish to dedicate their 
own lives to public service. I commend Mr. Roach for all his work over 
the years and thank him for his service.
