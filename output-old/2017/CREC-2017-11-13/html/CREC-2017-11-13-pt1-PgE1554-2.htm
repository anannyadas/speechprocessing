             VETERAN URGENT ACCESS TO MENTAL HEALTHCARE ACT

                                 ______
                                 

                               speech of

                  HON. HENRY C. ``HANK'' JOHNSON, JR.

                               of georgia

                    in the house of representatives

                       Tuesday, November 7, 2017

  Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 918, 
the Veteran Urgent Access to Mental Healthcare Act. H.R. 918 directs 
the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to provide mental health care 
services to former members of the Armed Forces.
  Mental health services would be administered to veterans immediately 
after their discharge, release, or deployment, and would continue as 
long as necessary. These services would be excluded from those who 
received a dishonorable or bad conduct discharge from the Armed 
Services. H.R. 918 would also permit the VA to provide mental health 
services at a non-VA facility if necessary, eliminating the barrier to 
treatment for so many rural veterans who are geographically isolated 
from VA facilities.
  It is imperative that the VA helps the men and women who served our 
country when they return home. Not all injuries received by our 
veterans are visible but that does not mean they do not exist. Many 
veterans return home with mental health conditions and we need to 
accommodate them so they can get the treatment they need. This is why I 
support this legislation and encourage my colleagues to do so as well.
