                         IN RECOGNITION OF UTSA

                                 ______
                                 

                           HON. HENRY CUELLAR

                                of texas

                    in the house of representatives

                       Monday, November 13, 2017

  Mr. CUELLAR. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate the 20th 
anniversary of the opening of the University of Texas at San Antonio's 
Downtown Campus, which has since empowered its many students and alumni 
to pursue excellence both in academics and their careers.
  In September of 1991, the UTSA Strategic Plan established UTSA 
Downtown. In 1993, with the support of the Texas State Government, the 
South Texas Border Initiative was launched, allotting $20 million 
dollars for the UTSA Downtown Campus. With the acquisition of the 
Fiesta Plaza site gifted by Bill Miller Bar-B-Q Enterprises, and the 
groundbreaking of Frio Street Building in 1995, UTSA's Downtown Campus 
location was realized.
  Following the subsequent groundbreakings of additional buildings, in 
2000, UTSA opened its doors to its first college based in the Downtown 
Campus: the College of Urban Programs, now the College of Public 
Policy. In 2002, The College of Architecture would become the second 
college based in the Downtown Campus.
  In the spring of 2004, UTSA expanded its campus from 11 acres to 18 
acres with the acquisition of the Cattleman Square parking lot and 
nearby land later used for additional buildings. Since its inception, 
the campus has expanded to include two colleges, four academic 
buildings, and two departments in a third college.
  With a current enrollment of 4,000 students at the downtown campus, 
The University of Texas at San Antonio continues to be an exemplary 
institution serving the needs of those pursuing a high quality 
education and successful careers in the downtown San Antonio area.
  As a former chairman of the Subcommittee on Education for the Texas 
Legislature's Appropriations Committee, who worked to secure tuition 
revenue funding and other state funding for this university, it has 
been good to see it grow and develop. In addition, as the author of 
House Bill 713, that created Texas' grant program, it is good to see 
students at UTSA take advantage of this program. It is clear that this 
university will continue to thrive and I look forward to many more 
years of continued success.
  Mr. Speaker, I am honored to have the opportunity to recognize the 
20th anniversary of the University of Texas at San Antonio.
