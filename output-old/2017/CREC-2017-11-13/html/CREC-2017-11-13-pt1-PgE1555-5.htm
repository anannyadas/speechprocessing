                                 ______
                                 

                        HON. JOHN J. DUNCAN, JR.

                              of tennessee

                    in the house of representatives

                       Monday, November 13, 2017

  Mr. DUNCAN of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, a distinguished business owner 
and close friend of mine from my district, Larry G. Cox, will be 
honored by the North Knoxville Business and Professional Association at 
an event that benefits the Boys and Girls Clubs of Tennessee Valley on 
November 14th 2017.
  Larry has one of the biggest hearts of all the people I have known in 
my lifetime. Larry has served the people of Knoxville for many years by 
giving his time and effort to the Emerald Youth Foundation, Kiwanis 
Club, and his church. He also helped make our city a better place 
through his tenure as a Knoxville city councilman for two decades.
  Father of Shane and Brooke, Grandfather of Brielle and Kingston, and 
Husband of Brenda, Larry Cox has created a legacy that few can

match, and he has touched thousands of people's lives in good and 
positive ways.
  His passion for promoting a connected community focused on the 
success of our youth has helped many young people who are faced with 
challenging life situations with little hope in their lives.
  His dedication to fundraising for the Boys and Girls Clubs has helped 
to provide resources to make the lives of many young people better 
through their renewed sense of self, ability to participate in sports, 
and boost in self-confidence.
  Mr. Speaker, I hope my colleagues will join me in recognizing the 
impact Larry Cox has made on so many lives through his selflessness and 
devotion to others. This Nation is a much better place because of the 
life he has led.
