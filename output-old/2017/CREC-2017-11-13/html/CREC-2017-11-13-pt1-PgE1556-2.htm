  Mr. MEEHAN. Mr. Speaker, today I recognize Mr. Paul J. Wechsler III, 
of Delaware County, Pennsylvania, for his service to the U.S. Army in 
the Vietnam War and his continued leadership at home in Springfield, 
PA.
  Mr. Wechsler voluntarily left Temple University to join the U.S. Army 
and serve his country in Vietnam. Here he fought in the 4th Infantry 
Division and courageously defended our nation for four years. Since 
returning home, he has involved himself with a number of organizations 
such as the Springfield Youth Club, the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society, 
and his local church's parish all while raising three daughters with 
his wife Patricia.
  Mr. Wechsler continues to give back to his community through his 
service as a member of the Board of Commissioners for Springfield 
Township.
  I thank Mr. Wechsler for his dedication to the United States through 
his service in the Army and his commitment to improving his community. 
I wish him the best as he continues to play a vital leadership role in 
Delaware County.

                          ____________________
