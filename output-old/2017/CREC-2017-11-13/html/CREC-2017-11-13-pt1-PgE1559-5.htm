                    in the house of representatives

                       Monday, November 13, 2017

  Mr. MEEHAN. Mr. Speaker, today I recognize Mr. Frederick M. Lynch of 
Montgomery County, Pennsylvania for his military service in the U.S. 
Air Force, and continued service in his community, particularly his 
efforts to improve his community's relationship with their law 
enforcement.
  While in the Air Force, Mr. Lynch served in the Honor Guard and as a 
Security Specialist. Following his service he returned home to North 
Wales, Pennsylvania with a commitment to continue serving the public.
  After his decision to dedicate his life to public service, Mr. Lynch 
enrolled in and graduated from Upper Gwynedd Township's Police Academy. 
After entering the force, Mr. Lynch realized he had found his calling. 
He particularly enjoyed his work to help bring closer his community and 
their law enforcement.
  This effort took many forms. He became a leader at the Upper Gwynedd 
Junior Police Academy where he trained young officers for twenty-one 
years. He also taught the Drug Abuse Resistance Education, or DARE, 
program in local schools, expanding the program's positive impact on 
youth throughout Southeastern Pennsylvania. Today, Mr. Lynch continues 
to be active in the Police Academy, as well as the area's Boy Scouts 
troop, where he serves as a mentor to young scouts so they may 
contribute to their community just as he has throughout his career and 
beyond.
  I thank Frederick M. Lynch for his service to the United States. 
Through his time in the military, to his many contributions in his 
local community, his commitment to be a positive influence for others 
has been unwavering and invaluable
