                               speech of

                  HON. HENRY C. ``HANK'' JOHNSON, JR.

                               of georgia

                    in the house of representatives

                       Tuesday, November 7, 2017

  Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise to support H.R. 1133, the 
Veterans Transplant Coverage Act. This legislation enables the 
Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to provide organ transplants for 
veterans, even if the live donor is a non-veteran, at the facility of 
their choice. Current law restricts coverage for veterans receiving an 
organ donation from a non-veteran. This policy means that children, 
siblings, and other non-veteran family members that are matches and 
willing to donate are not eligible to receive VA care for the 
operation.
  The Veterans Transplant Coverage Act was inspired by the Nelson 
family from Texas. When veteran Charles Nelson needed a kidney 
transplant, his son, Austin, was a match. When it came time for the 
operation, the VA healthcare system denied the Nelsons coverage because 
Austin was a non-veteran. The VA's decision forced the Nelsons to 
solicit donations to ensure that Charles could still have this 
lifesaving transplant surgery. The Veterans Transplant Coverage Act 
will ensure that no other American hero is denied transplant coverage 
ever again.
  The restrictions set forth by our current law have life or death 
consequences for the men and women that have bravely served our nation. 
I fully support H.R. 1133 to allow the VA to provide organ transplants 
for veterans when the living donor is a non-veteran.
