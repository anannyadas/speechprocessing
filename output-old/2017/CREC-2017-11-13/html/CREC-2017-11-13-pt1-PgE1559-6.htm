  Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise to support H.R. 3949, the 
Veterans Apprenticeship and Labor Opportunity Reform (VALOR) Act. H.R. 
3949 aims to increase access to apprenticeship training programs for 
veterans.
  Currently, apprenticeship programs are registered state-by-state, 
creating a cumbersome paper trail and bureaucratic barriers to opening 
new programs. This legislation aims to streamline this registration 
process to ensure that veterans have access to as many apprenticeship 
training programs as possible.
  It is crucial that returning veterans have the skills to join the 
workforce, and apprenticeship programs are a great way to ensure that

heroic men and women are prepared to rejoin civilian life. H.R. 3949 
will strengthen accessibility to these programs, which is why I am 
pleased to support this legislation.
