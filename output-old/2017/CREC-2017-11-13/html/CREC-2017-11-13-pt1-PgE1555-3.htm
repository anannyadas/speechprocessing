              HONORING THE LIFE AND CAREER OF ART DOUCETTE

                                 ______

                       Monday, November 13, 2017

  Mr. COSTA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and career of 
Art Doucette. Art is a science teacher at Sequoia High School, a 
community day school in Merced that provides second chances to at-risk 
students. Art's passion for teaching and the enthusiasm with which he 
relates scientific concepts to even his most challenging students has 
made him a classroom favorite at Sequoia and a model for teachers 
throughout Merced County.
  Born in Arkansas to a military family, Art moved over seventy times 
across the United States and abroad as a child. One ofhis childhood 
homes was in Merced County, a community that would greatly benefit from 
Art's work in the years to come. As a young adult, Art worked as a 
finish carpenter until a serious injury prompted him to attend Cuesta 
College in pursuit of a new career. It was there that Art met the love 
of his life, Holly, whom he married in 2000. After studying chemistry 
and biology at Stanislaus State, Art began his teaching career. He 
eventually found himself back in Merced County, where he has now taught 
and inspired countless students for over a decade.
  Teaching at Sequoia High School offers a unique set of challenges not 
found at most high schools. Sequoia students often come from adverse 
backgrounds and struggle with a wide range of behavioral problems. It 
is in this environment that Art has flourished as an engaging and 
dedicated educator, characterized by a genuine passion for his subject 
and unwavering faith in his students.
  Not long ago, Art was diagnosed with cancer and has since had to 
spend much of his time outside the classroom, seeking medical care. It 
has not been an easy road, and the pain and heartache associated with 
such a diagnosis is only made more acute by the absence felt by Art's 
students and colleagues. However, with his wife, Holly, and son, James, 
by his side, Art is courageously undergoing treatment and hopes to be 
back at Sequoia soon. In his honor, Sequoia High School and its 
affiliated network of schools are celebrating Art's devotion and 
lasting contributions to his community with an Art Doucette Honor 
Square Dedication Day. I stand with the students and staff of Sequoia 
High School in my support and encouragement for Art and his family 
during this difficult time, and in our shared gratitude for the 
difference he has made in Merced.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in honoring the life and 
career of Art Doucette. Art's relentless positivity and eagerness to 
resume teaching--even in the face of immense personal hardship--is both 
humbling and inspiring. Though the impact Art has made on the community 
has not waned, his presence at Sequoia High School is greatly missed. 
His colleagues, his students, and I all look forward to his return to 
the classroom.
