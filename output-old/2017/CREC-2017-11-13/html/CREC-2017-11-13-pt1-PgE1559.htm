                    in the house of representatives

                       Monday, November 13, 2017

  Mr. MEEHAN. Mr. Speaker, today I recognize Mr. James Harrell, Jr. of 
Delaware County, Pennsylvania, for his service in the United States 
Navy and his continued service at home with the Veterans of Foreign War 
post in Norwood, Pennsylvania.
  Mr. Harrell served in the U.S. Navy during the Vietnam War. Upon 
returning home, he committed to selflessly serve his community and 
fellow veterans. He joined VFW Post 7213 of Norwood and eventually 
became Commander of the Post after holding several leadership positions 
with the organization.
  In 2011, Mr. Harrell helped create the Interboro School District 
Memorial Day Contest to better connect students and veterans. 
Additionally, he helped implement the annual Flag-In Ceremony, where 
students place flags on the graves of over 5,000 veterans at Holy Cross 
Cemetery in our district. Mr. Harrell continues to dedicate his life to 
the service of our nation and even manages to help young people 
recognize the sacrifice that so many Americans have made for our 
country.
  I commend Mr. James Harrell, Jr. for his honorable service to our 
country and I thank him for his continued effort to bring together his 
community to honor our country's veterans
