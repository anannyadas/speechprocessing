                       Monday, November 13, 2017

  Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Mr. Speaker, I proudly pause to recognize 
Troop 412 of the Heart of America Council of the Boy Scouts of America 
as they celebrate their 85th anniversary.
   Founded in 1932, Troop 412 is chartered through the First Christian 
Church of Smithville, Missouri. Over their 85 years of service, the 
Troop has had 181 scouts join the ranks of the Eagle Scouts and 
conducted immeasurable hours of community service. Aside from their 
Eagle Scouts, the Troop has also enriched the lives of a countless 
Scouts, training the boys in the ways of the Scout Oath--Duty to God 
and Country, Duty to Other People, and Duty to Self--and molding these 
young men in the Smithville area to become productive leaders in their 
community.
   Mr. Speaker, I proudly ask you to join me in commending Troop 412 
for their accomplishments and for their 85 years of service to the 
Smithville community.
