                 RECOGNIZING THE SERVICE OF VERA SOUZA

                                 ______
                                 

                             HON. JIM COSTA

                             of california

                    in the house of representatives

                       Monday, November 13, 2017

  Mr. COSTA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Vera Souza as she 
celebrates 40 years of dedicated service to the Cabrillo Civics Club of 
California. It is both fitting and appropriate to honor Vera, who has 
dedicated much of her time preserving and advancing the Portuguese 
culture in the Central Valley and California.
  LaVera Teixeira was born and raised in the Central Valley. Vera spent 
her career working for the Central Union School District in Kings 
County, California, as an administrator. She worked there from July 1, 
1961 to June 30, 1999. Vera retired and then worked part time for the 
district until 2007, culminating a 46-year career.
  Vera and her husband Bob Souza first joined the Kings County Cabrillo 
Civic Club No. 9 in 1960. The Cabrillo Civics Club of California is a 
service organization dedicated to the progress of Californians of 
Portuguese descent. The club is named after John

[[Page E1557]]

Rodrigues Cabrillo, a Portuguese navigator and explorer, best known as 
the first European to navigate the coast of present-day California. 
Today there are nine clubs statewide with over 1,975 members. The club 
members work tirelessly to ensure the preservation of the Portuguese 
culture, while engaging in service activities to benefit their local 
communities.
  From the beginning, Vera's dedication to the club was evident. In 
1978 Vera became Kings County local club secretary and for one period 
served as both secretary and president. During the 1990s Vera held 
double duty again, serving as local secretary and Cabrillo Club State 
secretary from 1991 to 1994. Even after 40 years, Vera will stay on to 
serve as an active board member for the state and local Kings County 
Cabrillo Club No. 9.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing the 
achievements of Vera Souza. I congratulate Vera for her dedicated 
service to the Cabrillo Club and ask that you join me in wishing her 
continued success and happiness.
