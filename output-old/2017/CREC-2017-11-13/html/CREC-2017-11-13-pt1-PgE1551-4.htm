 COMMEMORATING CENTRAL INTERMEDIATE SCHOOL FOR RECEIVING THE NATIONAL 
                              BLUE RIBBON

                                 ______
                                 

                           HON. DARIN LaHOOD

                              of illinois

                    in the house of representatives

                       Monday, November 13, 2017

  Mr. LaHOOD. Mr. Speaker, I would like to honor Central Intermediate 
School in Washington, Illinois for receiving the U.S. Department of 
Education National Blue Ribbon.
  Since 1982, the U.S. Department of Education has awarded the Blue 
Ribbon to schools across the country based on their overall academic 
excellence. This year, 342 schools across the nation were awarded the 
National Blue Ribbon, including Central Intermediate School. Central 
Intermediate School prides itself on helping students recognize their 
full potential. What started as a one-room, rural school building in 
the 1830s has turned into one of the premier schools not only in 
Central Illinois, but in the United States.
  Central Intermediate School has a long history of academic 
excellence, earning numerous awards over the past decade. Led by 
Principal Brian Hoelscher, the faculty has developed an effective 
curriculum to meet the academic needs of all students and encourage 
community involvement.
  It is an honor to represent the students, faculty, and administrators 
at Central Intermediate School. Their dedication to education, and 
their students, makes them a deserving recipient of the National Blue 
Ribbon, and more importantly, an example for schools all across the 
nation.
