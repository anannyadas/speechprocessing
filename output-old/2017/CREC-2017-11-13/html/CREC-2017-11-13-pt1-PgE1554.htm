          ESSAY IN HONOR OF VETERANS DAY BY ANASTASIA TSAKONAS

                                 ______
                                 

                          HON. JOSEPH CROWLEY

                              of new york

                    in the house of representatives

                       Monday, November 13, 2017

  Mr. CROWLEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to include in the Record the 
words of my young constituent, Anastasia Tsakonas.
  Her thanks and words of praise for our brave men and women in service 
ring loud and true.

       Veterans Day is courage, sacrifice, and patriotism all 
     rolled up into the uniform that an individual wore when they 
     decided to protect this wonderful country.
       Veterans Day is our reminder that we need to honor and 
     celebrate all the men and women who have served or are 
     currently serving in our military. Veterans are volunteers 
     who offer their lives to protect and die for this country. It 
     takes a lot of courage and strength to enter the military and 
     purposely leave behind everything you love. Many Veterans 
     leave behind their homes, families, and careers knowing that 
     it will be a long time before they see them again. 
     Unfortunately, with this type of sacrifice, many Veterans 
     also know that they may never return to see any of them 
     again.
       Through a Veteran's selfless sacrifice, we as citizens 
     receive freedom, a freedom that many people in this world 
     would like to have but are not allowed. This freedom lets us 
     enjoy peace, prosperity, the right of speech and religion, 
     the right to education and most important-opportunity; all 
     values and beliefs that this country was originally founded 
     and built on and which continue to exist to this day because 
     of our Veterans.
       Let us take time to reflect on these men and women who 
     receive nothing in return for protecting our country and be 
     grateful to them that we still have our values and beliefs 
     intact. President Coolidge said: ``The nation which forgets 
     it defenders will itself be forgotten.''
       Thank you Veterans, without you, I could not be me!
