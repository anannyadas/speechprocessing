        REMEMBERING THE LIFE OF STAFF SERGEANT EMIL RIVERA-LOPEZ

                                 ______

                       Monday, November 13, 2017

  Ms. McSALLY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remember the life of Staff 
Sergeant Emil Rivera-Lopez, 31, from Tucson, Arizona. He was tragically 
killed on August 25 when his helicopter crashed during a training 
mission off the coast of Yemen.
  SSgt Rivera-Lopez was born in San Juan, Puerto Rico. He enlisted in 
the Army in 2006 as a helicopter maintainer, quickly distinguishing 
himself. He was selected for service in the prestigious 160th Special 
Operations Aviation Regiment in 2013. He was decorated many times for 
his service in Afghanistan and several other locations in the Global 
War on Terror.
  SSgt Rivera-Lopez leaves behind his wife Amanda Rivera, a 13 year-old 
stepson, Master William Sanderson, Jr., his mother Carlita Lopez, and 
his father Eduvigis Rivera. It is my sad duty to include in the Record 
the name of Emil Rivera-Lopez for his faithful service to this country.
