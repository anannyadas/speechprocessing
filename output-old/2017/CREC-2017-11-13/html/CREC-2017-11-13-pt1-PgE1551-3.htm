  Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Mr. Speaker, I proudly pause to recognize 
Christian Leech. Christian is a very special young man who has 
exemplified the finest qualities of citizenship and leadership by 
taking an active part in the Boy Scouts of America, Troop 247, and 
earning the most prestigious award of Eagle Scout.
   Christian has been very active with his troop, participating in many 
scout activities. Over the many years Christian has been involved with 
scouting, he has not only earned numerous merit badges, but also the 
respect of his family, peers, and community. Most notably, Christian 
has contributed to his community through his Eagle Scout project.
   Mr. Speaker, I proudly ask you to join me in commending Christian 
Leech for his accomplishments with the Boy Scouts of America and for 
his efforts put forth in achieving the highest distinction of Eagle 
Scout.
