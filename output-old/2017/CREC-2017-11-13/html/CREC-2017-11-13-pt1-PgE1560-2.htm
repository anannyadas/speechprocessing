    IN RECOGNITION OF THE FAIRFAX COUNTY HISTORY COMMISSION AND THE 
               RECIPIENTS OF THE 2017 ACHIEVEMENT AWARDS

                                 ______
                                 

                        HON. GERALD E. CONNOLLY

                              of virginia

                    in the house of representatives

                       Monday, November 13, 2017

  Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I rise to commend the Fairfax County 
History Commission and to congratulate the recipients of the 2017 
Achievement Awards.
  The Fairfax County History Commission was established in 1969 to help 
identify, document, record, and preserve the county's rich historic 
past. Fairfax County was founded in 1742 by Lord Thomas Fairfax and his 
cousin, William Fairfax and is celebrating its 275th anniversary. 
Earlier this year, the current Lord and Lady Fairfax traveled from the 
United Kingdom to participate in the celebration of this milestone. 
Each year the Commission bestows awards to local residents or 
organizations that have contributed to the preservation of our history. 
It is my honor to include in the Record the names of the following 2017 
award recipients:
  The 2017 Distinguished Service Award is being presented to Melanie 
Manikas and Mary Ellen Zavaleta in recognition of their efforts in 
preserving, researching and maintaining the history of Burke, Virginia 
by involving the Cherry Run Elementary School fourth grade classes of 
2015 in creating, composing and executing a video on this topic. The 
documentation and preservation of this information in an enlightening 
and entertaining video will be helpful for historians, students and the 
general citizenry of Fairfax County for generations to come.
  The Nan Netherton Achievement Award is being presented to Nathaniel 
Lee for his research, documentation, authoring and chronicling of the 
history of the Richmond, Fredericksburg and Potomac Railroad in his 
book, ``The Iron Road of Franconia''. This railroad connected the area 
of Franconia, Virginia to the remainder of Virginia and Washington. Its 
existence encouraged connections to multiple areas outside Northern 
Virginia--allowing the growth of commerce, dissemination of 
communication and passenger travel to points beyond Fairfax County.
  The Mary Fehringer Award is being presented to the Bull Run Civil War 
Round Table (BRCWRT) for their 25th Silver Anniversary Commemorative 
Publication. This fine catalogue documents their twenty-five years of 
educational contributions to Fairfax County and beyond via their 
monthly, well-attended (100+ guests) meetings. In addition, the Bull 
Run Civil War Round Table has been host to over 293 lectures and 128 
tours, and has assisted in the placement of over 70 historical marker/
kiosk panels, which were supported by BRCWRT or authored by its 
membership.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask that my colleagues join me in commending the 
Fairfax County History Commission for their extraordinary efforts to 
preserve and protect the history of Fairfax County and in 
congratulating the recipients of the 2017 achievement awards. Their 
dedication will ensure that the history of Fairfax County is available 
for generations to come.
