                       HONORING MILES DAVID MOORE

                                 ______
                                 

                       HON. DONALD S. BEYER, JR.

                              of virginia

                    in the house of representatives

                       Monday, November 13, 2017

  Mr. BEYER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to officially recognize the 
outstanding public achievement of my constituent Miles David Moore. Mr. 
Moore is a reporter for Crain Communications Inc., the author of three 
books of poetry and the Film Critic for Scene4.
   I take this time to recognize Mr. Moore for his outstanding 
leadership and commitment to the IOTA Poetry Series. Begun in March 
1994, sadly, September 10 was the last poetry performance at IOTA. In 
total, 275 readings covering countless themes occurred in the IOTA 
Poetry Series. Missing only two readings in all that time--one because 
of an ice storm, and another because of a water-main break--the 
performances were a critical part of the Arlington fabric of 
humanities, and Mr. Moore was a critical tie that bound the series to 
the community.
   Along with Mr. Moore, IOTA owners Stephen Negrey and Jane Negrey-
Inge deserve tremendous credit for their commitment to the series which 
brought so much emotional and intellectual pleasure to so many in 
Arlington.
