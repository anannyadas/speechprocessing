                               speech of

                  HON. HENRY C. ``HANK'' JOHNSON, JR.

                               of georgia

                    in the house of representatives

                       Tuesday, November 7, 2017

  Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2148, 
the Clarifying Commercial Real Estate Loans Act. This legislation helps 
to clarify which loans must comply with the high-volatility commercial 
real estate (HVCRE) regulations made in 2015.
  Two years ago, the Federal Reserve and Office of the Comptroller of 
the Currency created new lending regulations. In the wake of the new 
rules and the complexity of the definition of high-volatility 
commercial real estate loans they created, many banks drew back on 
commercial real estate lending. This adversely affected acquisition, 
development, and construction lending by driving up borrowing costs and 
reducing credit availability. H.R. 2148 seeks to make clarifications on 
the new regulations to ease the lending process and solve the issues 
that were unintentionally created with the new regulations.
  H.R. 2148 will help lenders understand regulations, reduce borrowing 
costs, and make more loans available. This bipartisan measure will 
strengthen our real estate market and make sure Americans have the 
opportunity to continue constructing our cities, states, and nation. I 
support H.R. 2148, and I urge my fellow members to as well.
