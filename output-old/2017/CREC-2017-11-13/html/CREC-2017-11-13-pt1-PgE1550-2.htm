           IN RECOGNITION OF COLONEL GEORGE C. CRESSMAN, JR.

                                 ______

                            of pennsylvania

                    in the house of representatives

                       Monday, November 13, 2017

  Mr. MEEHAN. Mr. Speaker, today I recognize Colonel George C. 
Cressman, Jr., of Montgomery County, Pennsylvania. Colonel Cressman 
served the United States honorably for 33 years as an Army Reservist. 
In that time, the Colonel deployed to Haiti, Iraq, and Kuwait. Though 
he recently retired from the Army Reserves, Colonel Cressman remains an 
active former president of the Society of American Military Engineers, 
and continues to serve his community of North Wales, Pennsylvania.
  The Colonel devotes much of his free time to helping others. Often, 
his efforts focus on the community's youth. He's organized scholarship 
fundraisers for students in the Reserve Officer Training Corps, mentors 
military college cadets, and even lectures at local universities. This 
guidance and philanthropy has helped open the door to opportunities for 
many.
  But Colonel Cressman devotion to his community goes beyond helping 
students. He regularly participates in fundraisers to raise money in 
the fight against Multiple Sclerosis and to help his fellow 
Pennsylvania veterans.
  Colonel Cressman's actions speak louder than any letter. He is a 
proven servant to his community and country. Both are much better off 
having Colonel George C. Cressman, Jr. be a part of them. I thank him 
for all his service.
