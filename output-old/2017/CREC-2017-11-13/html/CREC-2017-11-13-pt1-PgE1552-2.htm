                    in the house of representatives

                       Monday, November 13, 2017

  Mr. MEEHAN. Mr. Speaker, today I recognize Sergeant Edward Daniel 
Maginn of Delaware County, Pennsylvania, for his service in the United 
States Marine Corps and for his work as a federal law enforcement 
official.
  Sgt. Maginn served in Vietnam from 1968 to 1969. After his service 
abroad, the Sergeant served as Paratrooper with the 82nd Airborne 
Division for two years. During his time in the military, Sgt. Maginn 
received numerous awards. These honors included the National Defense 
Ribbon, Parachute Wings, and the Vietnam Service Ribbon.
  After his time in the military, Sgt. Maginn wished to continue his 
career of service. In 1988, he began working as a federal police 
officer. On September 11th, 2001, after witnessing the World Trade 
Center Towers collapse, his commanding officer asked for volunteers to 
rescue victims of the tragedy. Sgt. Maginn volunteered without 
hesitation. His humanitarian spirit also took him to New Orleans in 
2005 to help in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina.
  After the Department of Homeland Security was created in the wake of 
the September 11th attacks, Sgt. Maginn joined the Department as a 
Hazmat Tech Officer, an integral part of the Special Response Team.
  Sgt. Maginn's selfless acts prove his lifelong devotion to serving 
others. I thank Sergeant Edward Maginn for his continued service and I 
commend his tireless dedication to community and country
