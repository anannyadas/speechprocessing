                    in the house of representatives

                       Monday, November 13, 2017

  Mr. MEEHAN. Mr. Speaker, today I recognize Lieutenant Colonel Dale 
Glenn Derr of Berks County, Pennsylvania. Lt. Col. Derr served our 
country in the U.S. Air Force for two decades during which he received 
many honors and awards.
  Lt. Col. Derr decided to commission into the Air Force after 
receiving his teaching certificate. His mentor, Samuel Gundy--World War 
II bomber pilot, POW, and esteemed naturalist, was a major influence in 
the future Lt. Col.'s life and his decision to join the military. This 
decision began an illustrious 20 year career of service to our nation.
  Lt. Col. Derr quickly became known for his keen operational and 
scientific talents during his tours of duty in Europe. Here he received 
Distinguished Graduate honors at the prestigious NATO School in 
Oberammergau, Germany. Upon returning home, the Lt. Col. was selected 
to be an instructor on weapons of mass destruction at the Interservice 
Nuclear Weapons School. He would go on to again be awarded the 
Distinguished Graduate Honors while at the Technical Instructor School. 
Eventually, he was named top instructor for the Technical Training 
Group in 1990.
  Since retiring from the Air Force, Lt. Col. Derr has continued his 
dedication to our country and those who have served it by directing the 
Department of Veteran Affairs for Berks County. In this capacity he 
works to ensure the county's 27,000 veterans have access to the 
department's many services and benefits.
  I commend Lt. Col. Derr for his dedication to our country and 
community through his teaching and service. He is a leader in his 
community and continues to do his most to help those around him.

                          ____________________
