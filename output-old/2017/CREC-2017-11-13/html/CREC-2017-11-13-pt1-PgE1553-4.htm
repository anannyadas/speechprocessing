           HONORING THE LIFE OF DR. NAPOLEAN WASHINGTON, JR.

                             HON. JIM COSTA

                    in the house of representatives

                       Monday, November 13, 2017

  Mr. COSTA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate the life of Dr. 
Napoleon Washington, Jr., a local business owner, advocate, minister 
and community organizer in Merced County who passed away after a battle 
with cancer. Dr. Washington's boisterous laughter, leadership, 
humility, and genuine compassion for the people of Merced were 
qualities that will be deeply missed by our community.
  Born on April 12, 1948 in Fort Baker, California, Dr. Washington 
moved to Merced California with his family in 1961. He graduated from 
Merced High School in 1966, and then went on to earn an Associate of 
Arts degree from Merced College and a Bachelor of Arts in Social 
Science at Chapman University. He received two doctoral degrees, one in 
Business Administration from Trinity Southern University and one in 
Theology from Anderson Theological Seminary.
  In his youth, Dr. Washington also served in the U.S. Army before he 
began his 47-year career in the insurance industry in 1970, starting 
with Metropolitan Life Insurance and Farmers Insurance. He then 
established Napoleon Washington Jr. Insurance Agency as Owner and 
Insurance Broker.
  An active member of the Merced community, Dr. Washington was the 
former President of the Merced/Mariposa Life Underwriters Association, 
Former Director of North Merced Rotary Club, member of the American 
Legion Post 83, member of Merced County Jail Ministries, member of the 
Merced City Parks and Recreation Commission, and 18th President and 
Executive Board Member of the NAACP Branch 1047.
  While community engagement was a principle of Dr. Washington's, his 
faith and ministry were his most focused passions. He served in various 
ministerial capacities throughout the state of California, including as 
a member of Christian Life Center in Merced, bible teacher for the 
Merced County Rescue Mission and chief organizer of the ``Feet Changing 
Lives'' walks in Merced.
  Dr. Washington is survived by his wife of 49 years, Nadine Reed 
Washington, and his children Gregory D. Washington, Kimberlee Taylor 
and Geoffrey Napoleon Washington, Sr.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in celebrating the life 
of Dr. Napoleon Washington, Jr. As a leader, minister, advocate, and 
friend, his unique approach to life and faith have impacted countless 
lives in our community. He will be deeply missed by all of those 
fortunate enough to have crossed his path.
