                      IN RECOGNITION OF WALLY NUNN

                                 ______
                                 

                          HON. PATRICK MEEHAN

                            of pennsylvania

                    in the house of representatives

                       Monday, November 13, 2017

  Mr. MEEHAN. Mr. Speaker, today I recognize Mr. Wally Nunn of Newtown 
Square, Pennsylvania, for his honorable service in the U.S. Army, his 
continued service to his community, and his work to honor fallen 
soldiers.
  Mr. Nunn served as an Army door gunner in the Vietnam War, attached 
to the 17th Assault Helicopter Company with both the First and Third 
Platoons.
  After serving eight years in the service, Mr. Nunn returned to 
Pennsylvania to pursue a successful career in the private sector. But 
Mr. Nunn also wanted to continue serving the public. He became Chairman 
of the Board of the Freedoms Foundation at Valley Forge. In 1964, 
ground at Valley Forge was dedicated to Medal of Honor recipients. Over 
the years this grove was ignored and became dilapidated. Mr. Nunn took 
the initiative to create and lead the nonprofit, ``The Friends of the 
Grove,'' who restored this land and care for it today. Thanks to Mr. 
Nunn's efforts, 3,500 Medal of Honor recipients are recognized again 
for their courageous acts in support of our nation.
  Mr. Nunn continued his service to his community, serving as a member 
of Delaware County Council and eventually becoming its Chairman.
  I thank Mr. Wally Nunn for his dedication to our nation and 
community. He has shown a selfless devotion to helping others and 
honoring our nation's heroes. His invaluable impression he made on his 
community to restore Medal of Honor Grove will be felt for decades.
