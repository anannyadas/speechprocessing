                  HON. HENRY C. ``HANK'' JOHNSON, JR.

                               of georgia

                    in the house of representatives

                       Tuesday, November 7, 2017

  Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4173, 
the Veterans Crisis Line Study Act of 2017. This legislation would 
create a five year study in the Department of Veteran Affairs (VA) on 
the Veteran Crisis Line.
  A troubling 2016 study published by the VA reported that in 2014, 20 
veterans died by suicide each day. These numbers are heartbreaking and 
unacceptable, and we must do more to support veterans' access to mental 
health services.
  Launched in 2007, the Veterans Crisis Line is a subsection of the 
suicide prevention lifeline, and is a resource created to connect 
veterans with professionals trained to address their specific needs and 
prevent suicide. Men and women who have served and their families can 
reach out for help on this toll free hotline, online chat, or text. 
H.R. 4173 aims to study the efficacy and outcomes of this resource, 
pinpointing how the hotline is helping our veterans, and how we can 
improve it to better address the troubling suicide rates among our 
nation's heroes.
  Veterans are owed the best care and upmost respect when they return 
from duty and I am deeply troubled by their increased likelihood of 
suicide. H.R. 4173 will help build our arsenal to combat mental illness 
and develop resources for the men and women who have selflessly served 
our nation. I support H.R. 4173 and I urge my fellow members to lend 
their support as well.
