                          PERSONAL EXPLANATION

                                 ______
                                 

                       HON. LUCILLE ROYBAL-ALLARD

                             of california

                    in the house of representatives

                       Monday, November 13, 2017

  Ms. ROYBAL-ALLARD. Mr. Speaker, on November 6th, 7th, 8th, and 9th, I 
was ill, so I was not present for the Roll Call votes held on those 
days. Had I been present, I would have voted:
  ``Aye'' on Roll Call 607, on the motion to suspend the rules and pass 
H.R. 3562, to amend title 38, United States Code, to authorize the 
Secretary of Veterans Affairs to furnish assistance for adaptations of 
residences of veterans in rehabilitation programs under chapter 31 of 
such title, and for other purposes.
  ``Aye'' on Roll Call 608, on the motion to suspend the rules and pass 
H.R. 1066, the VA Management Alignment Act.
  ``No'' on Roll Call 609, on approving the journal.
  ``No'' on Roll Call 610, on ordering the previous question on H. Res. 
607, providing for consideration of the bill (H.R. 3043) Hydropower 
Policy Modernization Act and providing for consideration of the bill 
(H.R. 3441) Save Local Business Act.
  ``No'' on Roll Call 611, on agreeing to H. Res. 607.
  ``No'' on Roll Call 612, on approving the journal.
  ``Yea'' on Roll Call 613, on the motion to recommit H.R. 3441, the 
Save Local Business Act.
  ``No'' on Roll Call 614, on passage of H.R. 3441. This bill would 
effectively eliminate joint employment from the National Labor 
Relations Act and Fair Labor Standards Act, blocking workers from 
holding a joint employer accountable for wage theft, equal pay 
violations, and other unfair labor practices. Today, many employers 
seek to avoid their legal obligations to ensure that workers receive 
the wages they are due and bargain in good faith, and H.R. 3441 would 
make it more difficult for workers to hold the joint employers who set 
many of the conditions of their work accountable.
  ``No'' on Roll Call 615, on the motion to suspend the rules and pass 
H.R. 3911, the Risk-Based Credit Examination Act. H.R. 3911 would 
weaken oversight of major credit rating agencies such as S&P and 
Moody's, which were at the center of the 2008 financial crisis, and 
create the possibility of credit rating agencies challenging the SEC in 
court if they felt the examinations were not ``appropriate''.
  ``No'' on Roll Call 616, on ordering the Previous Question on H. Res. 
609, providing for consideration of H.R. 2201, the Micro Offering Safe 
Harbor Act.
  ``No'' on Roll Call 617, on passage of H. Res. 609.
  ``Yea'' on Roll Call 618, on the motion to suspend the rules and pass 
H.R. 4173, the Veterans Crisis Line Study Act.
  ``Yea'' on Roll Call 619, the Rush Amendment to H.R. 3043.
  ``No'' on Roll Call 620, on passage of H.R. 3043, the Hydropower 
Policy Modernization Act. I recognize the need and importance of 
modernizing the licensing process for hydropower projects to both power 
companies and the workers who build, operate, and maintain them. 
However, I have concerns that H.R.

3043 ignores constructive suggestions that would improve the licensing 
process while still maintaining environmental protections and will 
usurp the authorities of states, tribes, and federal natural resource 
agencies.
  ``Yea'' on Roll Call 621, on the motion to suspend the rules and pass 
H.R. 3705, the Veterans Fair Debt Notice Act.
  ``No'' on Roll Call 622, the Micro Offering Safe Harbor Act.
