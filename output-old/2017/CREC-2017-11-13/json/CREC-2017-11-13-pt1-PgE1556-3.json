Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2148, \nthe Clarifying Commercial Real Estate Loans Act. This legislation helps \nto clarify which loans must comply with the high-volatility commercial \nreal estate (HVCRE) regulations made in 2015.\n  Two years ago, the Federal Reserve and Office of the Comptroller of \nthe Currency created new lending regulations. In the wake of the new \nrules and the complexity of the definition of high-volatility \ncommercial real estate loans they created, many banks drew back on \ncommercial real estate lending. This adversely affected acquisition, \ndevelopment, and construction lending by driving up borrowing costs and \nreducing credit availability. H.R. 2148 seeks to make clarifications on \nthe new regulations to ease the lending process and solve the issues \nthat were unintentionally created with the new regulations.\n  H.R. 2148 will help lenders understand regulations, reduce borrowing \ncosts, and make more loans available. This bipartisan measure will \nstrengthen our real estate market and make sure Americans have the \nopportunity to continue constructing our cities, states, and nation. I \nsupport H.R. 2148, and I urge my fellow members to as well.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 3}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "185", "extension": true, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "E1556", "wkday": "Monday", "day": "13", "month": "November"}, "related_bills": [{"type": "HR", "context": "OTHER", "congress": "115", "number": "2148"}], "doc_title": "CLARIFYING COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE LOANS", "id": "CREC-2017-11-13-pt1-PgE1556-3"}
