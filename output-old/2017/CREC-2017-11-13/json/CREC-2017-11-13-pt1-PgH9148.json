strategic partnership with \n     the member states of the Gulf Cooperation Council, including \n     Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates;\n       Whereas in 2014, after years of violence and insurgency, \n     Iranian-supported Houthi rebels seized the Yemeni capital \n     city of Sana'a, deposing the legitimate, internationally \n     recognized Government of Yemen and further destabilizing \n     Yemen and the region;\n       Whereas the Saudi-led Arab Coalition launched a military \n     intervention in 2015 against the Houthi-Saleh alliance in \n     response to the deposition of the legitimate Government of \n     Yemen and Houthi-Saleh territorial gains in and around the \n     port of Aden;\n       Whereas the United States has longstanding strategic \n     interests in Yemen, including ensuring freedom of navigation \n     at the Bab al Mandab strait and countering the threats from \n     Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) and Al-Qaeda \n     franchises, and the Yemen affiliate of the Islamic State of \n     Iraq and al-Sham (ISIS);\n       Whereas al-Qaeda was responsible for the bombing of the USS \n     Cole in Aden, Yemen, in October 2000, which killed 17 United \n     States sailors, and for multiple successful and unsuccessful \n     terrorist attacks internationally;\n       Whereas in April 2015, the United Nations Security Council \n     adopted United Nations Security Council Resolution 2216 by 14 \n     affirmative votes to none against, with one abstention (by \n     the Russian Federation), imposing sanctions on

civilian casualties, and convened a Joint Incident \n     Assessment Team to investigate the coalition's adherence to \n     the laws of armed conflict;\n       Whereas the war in Yemen has contributed to a humanitarian \n     crisis in Yemen, leading to an April 2017 announcement by the \n     World Food Program that Yemen is on the brink of ``full-scale \n     famine'', with approximately 7,000,000 Yemenis, including \n     2,200,000 children, being classified as ``severely food \n     insecure'';\n       Whereas over 500,000 new cholera cases have been detected \n     in

Whereas parties to the conflict continue to obstruct access \n     by journalists and humanitarian organizations seeking to \n     provide assistance;\n       Whereas according to the Department of State's Country \n     Reports on Terrorism 2016, the conflict between Saudi-led \n     Arab Coalition and the Houthi-Saleh alliance is \n     counterproductive to ongoing efforts by the United States

Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I \nmay consume.\n  I want to thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, including \nthe gentleman from California (Mr. Khanna), for working in good faith \ntoward achieving a resolution that productively addresses a very \ncomplex issue and a very serious issue, namely, the strategic and \nhumanitarian implications of the ongoing conflict being fought in \nYemen. I should also recognize the good work of our Foreign Affairs \nCommittee ranking member, Mr. Eliot Engel of New York.\n  This resolution will send a strong and needed message to all involved \nin this conflict that is causing so much human suffering. According to \nthe U.N., more than 20 million people in Yemen--that is 76 percent of \nthe population--are in need of humanitarian assistance. More than 2 \nmillion people are affected by either moderate or by severe \nmalnutrition.\n  Mr. Speaker, H. Res. 599 is a bipartisan alternative to H. Con. Res. \n81. That initial proposal had claimed procedural privileges by invoking \nsection 5(c) of the War Powers Resolution, which applies only when U.S. \nforces are\n\n\nengaged in hostilities abroad without authorization. Though we provide \nlogistics to our Saudi partners in the region, United States forces are \nnot conducting hostilities against Houthi forces in Yemen.\n  The initial resolution also neglected a key facet of the Yemen \ncrisis, and that is Iran, which has been providing increasing support--\nvery nefarious support--to the Houthi rebels. We must not forget that \nin April of 2015, the U.N. Security Council, acting under Chapter 7 of \nthe U.N. Charter, condemned the violent Houthi government overthrow \n``in the strongest terms'' and obligated all U.N. member states to \ncomply with and enforce an embargo on arms and military assistance ``of \nall types'' to the Houthi forces. This makes Iran's acts to fuel this \ndeadly conflict a gross violation of international law, as our \nambassador has pointed out.\n  I am glad that the new H. Res. 599 addresses these shortcomings, and \nI rise to support it today.\n  Even before this latest conflict, Yemen was the poorest country in \nthe region. It was wracked by violence and unrest. For years, the \ncountries of North and South Yemen were in conflict before they became \na single state. That was in 1990. After an uprising in 2011, Yemen \nembarked on a path of attempted national dialogue, of unification, and \nof constitutional reform; but hopes for stability and progress were \ndashed in 2014. That is the time when an Iranian-backed Houthi rebel \ngroup in alliance with former Yemeni strongman, Ali Abdullah Saleh, \nforcibly deposed the internationally recognized government of President \nHadi.\n  In response, the United States Security Council adopted Resolution \n2216, which sanctioned individuals involved in destabilizing Yemen and \ndemanded that the Houthis unconditionally end their use of violence, \nwithdraw their forces, relinquish their seized weapons, and refrain \nfrom threats to neighboring states.\n  Unfortunately, the Houthi-Saleh rejection of this U.N. Security \nCouncil resolution, with Iran's backing, has sabotaged the prospects \nfor peace.\n  Mr. Speaker, the United States has longstanding, critical national \nsecurity interests in this region. Members will recall that the deadly \nbombing of the USS Cole occurred there in Yemen. Other terrorist plots \nagainst Americans originated in Yemen, including the unsuccessful 2009 \nunderwear bomber attack on a Northwest Airlines flight that was going \nto Detroit.\n  We and our partners continue to conduct operations against al-Qaida \ninside Yemen, and that is pursuant to the 2001 Authorization for Use of \nMilitary Force with the permission of the internationally recognized \nGovernment of Yemen.\n  Although al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula may not grab a lot of \ninternational headlines, it still continues to threaten Western \nnations, and it still maintains a significant network in South Yemen, \nwhich we are working to disrupt.\n  Making matters worse, Yemen has become another front in Iran's quest \nfor regional dominance, which has accelerated in the wake of the \nprevious administration's nuclear deal.\n\n\n  Consider that Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps has transferred \nincreasingly sophisticated weapons systems to the Houthis and \nspecialists to train and advise their units.\n  Also consider that Iran's top terror proxy, Hezbollah, is helping the \nHouthis, who have launched numerous missiles and raids into Saudi \nArabia, killing innocent civilians. Just last week, a ballistic missile \nwas intercepted over the Saudi capital of Riyadh.\n  This Iranian meddling in Yemen thwarts peace by empowering the \nHouthis to resist a return to political negotiations. The Iranian \nregime could not care less about the human suffering it is responsible \nfor.\n  Of course, beyond our national security, the region is also vital to \nthe U.S. and the global economy. The southwest coast of Yemen \nconstitutes one side of the Bab al-Mandab Strait, a narrow, strategic \nchokepoint in the flow of international goods headed to and from \nEurope, Asia, and the United States.\n  At times, Iranian-supported Houthis have attacked international \nshipping, including an American vessel. Disruptions to shipping along \nthe waterway mean disruptions to employment and wages.\n  So it is no wonder that, in response to these threats, a Saudi-led \ncoalition of 10 nations began military operations against Houthi-Saleh \nforces in March of 2015. Its mission was to reinstate the \ninternationally recognized government.\n  However, 2\\1/2\\ years later, military progress remains elusive and \nbattle lines are hardened. The Saudi-led coalition controls the port \ncity of Aden and the lowland areas in the south, while the Houthis \ncontinue to hold the capital and the highlands of northern Yemen. \nCivilian casualties have been distressingly high, including from Saudi \nairstrikes in the early months of the campaign.\n  Today, Yemen is in shambles. It is simultaneously experiencing the \nworld's largest food insecurity crisis and largest cholera outbreak, \nwith more than 900,000 suspected cases. Last week's moves by the Saudis \nto further close ground, air, and seaports only threaten to make things \nworse.\n  The United States remains committed to providing much-needed relief \nto innocent men, women, and children affected by this crisis. In fact, \nwe remain the single largest donor of humanitarian aid to Yemen, by \nfar.\n  USAID and U.N. aid to agencies report that all parties to the \nconflict, including the Saudi-led coalition, have been responsible for \nbureaucratic impediments and disruptions to humanitarian operations, \ncomplicating our ability to effectively deliver lifesaving assistance. \nOur resolution says this must stop, by all sides.\n  Mr. Speaker, this all provides for a very complex policy challenge. \nSome say the United States should distance itself from longstanding \nmilitary cooperation with Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and other Gulf \nCooperation Council partners. But this would only strengthen Iran's \nmalign influence in the region and would not solve the humanitarian \ncrisis. Indeed, it would likely worsen it.\n  At the same time, others say our only focus should be neutralizing \nIran and terrorist threats. But we cannot ignore the moral and \nstrategic costs of civilian casualties and deteriorating humanitarian \nconditions.\n  To this end, I believe that H. Res. 599 appropriately balances the \nshared, bipartisan concerns of this body:\n  The urgent need for a political solution in Yemen consistent with \nSecurity Council Resolution 2216;\n  A call for all parties to prevent civilian casualties;\n  Support for the Saudi-led coalition's commitments to improve \ntargeting and abide by their no-strike list; and,\n  Condemnation and sanctions for Iran's destabilizing activities in \nYemen in violation of Security Council Resolution 2216.\n  Here, we should note that this body has taken strong, bipartisan \naction in recent months to challenge Iran's aggression, including by \nsanctioning its ICBM program and its support for the terrorist group \nHezbollah.\n  Make no mistake about it: Iran is an avowed enemy and our biggest \nsecurity threat in the region; on the other hand, the Saudis are our \npartners.\n  The resolution calls for all parties to allow unobstructed access for \nhumanitarian organizations, human rights investigations, medical \npersonnel, and journalists. In general, it brings attention to a Yemeni \nconflict that deserves more international notice.\n  As we debate this measure, I suspect we may hear different views of \nWar Powers and authorizations for use of military force as they relate \nto Yemen.\n  As I said, I don't believe our security cooperation with the Saudis \ntriggers War Powers. This is the type of support we provide to many \nother governments. But just because it does not arise under that \nparticular statute does not make it immune from our scrutiny.\n  I share Members' concerns that Congress must be as attentive as \npossible to the roles and missions of our Armed Forces overseas and \nmonitor the ways in which our security assistance is being used. In \nthis sense, Yemen does warrant closer watching. That is what I believe \nthis resolution does.\n  I again want to thank the gentleman from California (Mr. Khanna), the \nmajority leader and minority whip of the\n\n\nHouse, and my good friend Ranking Member Eliot Engel for the good work \nthat went into this text, which I support.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.", "turn": 4, "speaker": "Mr. ROYCE of California", "itemno": 9}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "K000389", "text": "  Mr. KHANNA. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Royce for his work on this resolution, \nRanking Member Engel, and leadership on both sides: Majority Leader \nMcCarthy and the Speaker, and Minority Whip Hoyer and Leader Pelosi.\n  I think one thing we can all agree on, as Chairman Royce mentioned, \nis the humanitarian crisis in Yemen. It is, arguably, the largest \nhumanitarian crisis currently in the world. There are almost a million \npeople suffering from cholera. This is a manmade crisis because of the \nbombing of civilian targets that has made the treatment of water \nimpossible. Almost 7 million people face famine.\n\n  One hope out of this debate, the first one on the House floor on \nYemen, is that we will collectively demand humanitarian access to \npeople in Yemen. There is no justification for the ports to be closed. \nThere is no justification for the Sanaa Airport to be closed.\n  In The New York Times just this morning, there was an article stating \nthat chlorine medicine tablets are not being allowed in for people \nsuffering from cholera. That is not a Republican or Democratic issue. \nThat is an American issue. This Nation stands for human rights. We \nstand for compassion and decency.\n  We should demand, collectively, that there is humanitarian access to \npeople who are suffering and that the ports and airports be opened. \nThis resolution calls for that, as has our U.N. Ambassador, Nikki \nHaley, who made that clear.\n  The second part of this resolution, which I think goes a long way, is \nthe acknowledgment of our own role in the refueling of Saudi planes and \nin the assistance of Saudi targeting.\n  The resolution explicitly acknowledges that the United States has \nbeen engaged in the assistance of Saudi refueling and assisting the \nSaudis in targeting. It explicitly also recognizes that the 2001 \nauthorization of force that the United States Congress passed does not \napply to the Yemeni civil war.\n  Chairman Royce was absolutely correct that there is an al-Qaida \nthreat in Yemen to the United States. Our military, under the 2001 \nauthorization of force, has the full authority to take counterterrorism \nmeasures to deal with al-Qaida; but what our military is not authorized \nto do is assist the Saudi Arabian regime in fighting the Houthis. In \nmany cases, the Saudis have aligned with al-Qaida to fight the Houthis, \nundermining our very counterterrorism operations.\n  This resolution makes abundantly clear that we cannot be assisting \nthe Saudi regime in any of its fight with the Houthi regime. We have to \nlimit our involvement in Yemen to take on al-Qaida and to take on the \nterrorists that threaten the United States.\n  The chairman and I have a disagreement about the War Powers \nResolution, but I will say that the negotiations were in good faith. As \nI told some of the groups that were upset about the resolution, this is \na body of 435 Members. Every Member has their perspective. Ultimately, \nwe have to come to a consensus that moves the debate forward. In our \nview, the War Powers Resolution does apply.\n  If I can quote from a plain reading of section 8(c), it says that, \nfor purposes of the War Powers Act: ``the term `introduction of the \nUnited States Armed Forces' includes the assignment of members of such \nArmed Forces to command, coordinate, participate in the movement of, or \naccompany the regular or irregular military forces of any foreign \ncountry or government. . . .''\n  I believe a plain reading of that statute suggests that refueling \nSaudi planes constitutes coordination with a foreign government in a \nforeign conflict. Frankly, it is precisely what the drafters of the \nstatute wanted to prevent after Vietnam. They wanted to prevent us from \ngetting entangled in foreign conflicts where our national security was \nnot at stake without a debate on the floor of Congress.\n  We currently have troops in harm's way in 13 countries around the \nworld. In many of those countries, we have not debated in the United \nStates what the mission is or whether we should be there or whether it \nis making us any safer. That is certainly the case in Yemen.\n  We know that, to the extent Iran is involved with the Houthis, that \nhas been exacerbated because of the Saudi actions. It is debatable how \nmuch Iran was involved in the first place, but what we do know is that \ntheir minimal involvement--or, perhaps, now, greater involvement--was \ntriggered because of the Saudi escalation in bombing Yemen.\n  What is the United States' stake in a proxy war in Yemen? How is that \nmaking us any safer?\n  If anything, it is creating another generation of Yemeni who will \nview the United States with suspicion.\n  Nicholas Kristof wrote, in The New York Times: ``We Americans have \nsometimes wondered how Russia can possibly be so Machiavellian as to \nsupport its Syrian Government allies as they bomb and starve civilians. \nYet we're doing the same thing with Saudi Arabia, and it's just as \nunconscionable when we're the ones complicit. . . .''\n  Our military has the highest standards. We take such great care in \nminimizing civilian casualties. Why would we want to aid Saudi Arabia, \nwhich doesn't share American values, which doesn't have the regard for \nhuman life that we in the United States do? We are bearing the brunt of \ntheir horrible actions.\n  So it is time, I believe, not just to stand up for humanitarian \naccess in Yemen, but to question whether the aid that we are providing \nSaudi Arabia is making our country any safer and whether it is \nconsistent with American values.\n\n\n  Finally, I will say to those who argue that we need to support the \nSaudis as a counter to Iran, there is no question that Iran has taken \nactions that are not in the United States' interest, but I suggest that \nwe learn from our own history.\n  I remember, from history, the time when so many in our country said: \nLet us arm Saddam Hussein to be a counter to Iran.\n  That didn't work out so well for the United States. It was our arms \nthat fueled Saddam Hussein's rise that led to two costly wars for the \nUnited States.\n  My belief is the balance-of-power framework that has dictated our \nforeign policy and the interventionism has not made us any safer. I \nwish we would exercise more restraint in our foreign policy and return \nto the traditions of John Quincy Adams who said:\n\n       We should not go overseas for monsters to destroy. These \n     are not conflicts where we can judge who is on the right \n     side; rather, we should be restrained, offer our hopes and \n     prayers to those fighting for freedom, offer our humanitarian \n     good will but not engage in interventionism abroad.\n\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.", "turn": 5, "speaker": "Mr. KHANNA", "itemno": 10}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "R000487", "text": "  Mr. ROYCE of California.

International aid agencies consider Yemen \nto be one of the four current famine countries alongside South Sudan, \nSomalia, and Nigeria. We must ensure that access and safe passage is \nbeing given to reach the people of Yemen who desperately need this \nassistance.\n  Saudi Arabia and the UAE have security and terror concerns in Yemen, \nand they have to mitigate those, but there\n\n\nshould not be any obstacles to prevent the delivery of vital \nhumanitarian assistance to Yemen.\n  It is positive news that this morning Saudi Arabia announced that it \nwill begin reopening airports and seaports in Yemen; so, hopefully, \nthat aid will come quickly for those starving people.\n  Since this campaign began in 2015, the United States has been the \nlargest contributor of humanitarian aid to Yemen. We must ensure that \nthe aid is not being diverted and is actually reaching the right people \nwho need it the most.\n  A political solution is needed in Yemen where all parties can sit \ndown and negotiate a path forward, but that becomes increasingly more \ndifficult when we have to deal with the negative influence of Iran and \nthe Houthis.\n  Here are some examples. In February 2017, General Soleimani, \ncommander of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, the Quds Force, \nreportedly pledged to increase Iran's assistance to Houthi-Saleh \nforces.\n  According to press reports, two incidents occurred in October 2016, \noff the coast of Yemen, where missiles were fired targeting our Navy \ndestroyers.\n  After Houthi forces targeted U.S. warships near Yemen, the vice \nadmiral, who heads U.S. Naval Forces Central Command, said: ``We \nbelieve that Iran is connected to this.''\n  Since April 2015, U.S. warships have intercepted at least five \nIranian shipments of weapons to Houthi forces. Just last week, the U.S. \nForces' central commander said that a missile fired by the Houthis at \nRiyadh was manufactured by Iran.\n  In Yemen, we cannot forget that we need to undermine Iran's influence \nover the Houthis. Last month, the White House released a new strategy \nwhen it comes to Iran, and it stated: ``The Iranian regime has taken \nadvantage of regional conflicts and instability to aggressively expand \nits regional influence and threaten its neighbors with little domestic \nor international cost for its actions.''\n  I believe that targeted sanctions are needed against Iran for \nproviding weapons to the Houthis, weapons that are being used to \ndirectly target U.S. soldiers in the region.\n  Lastly, Mr. Speaker, we cannot forget about the threats emanating \nfrom a U.S.-designated foreign terrorist organization, al-Qaida, in the \nArabian Peninsula, also known as AQAP. The United States must continue \nto operate and conduct operations in Yemen to counter the threats from \nAQAP, but we cannot do it alone.\n  A few months ago, the UAE and the U.S. teamed up with local Yemeni \nforces to target AQAP militants. This is another positive sign in the \nregion where we can partner with our Gulf partners to fight extremist \nelements jointly. These operations are essential to protecting our \nnational security interests and to help bring regional stability in the \nregion.\n  While a lot of the focus is traditionally put on Hezbollah and Hamas \nin the region, we cannot forget about the dangerous malign and illicit \nactivities that Iran is undertaking through its proxy in Yemen, the \nHouthis.", "turn": 7, "speaker": "Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN", "itemno": 12}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "K000389", "text": "  Mr. KHANNA.

At the same time, Yemen \nfaces the world's biggest food emergency.\n  Saudi Arabia has blocked Yemen's ports and airports. Just last week, \nit sealed the country's borders. As a result, the people of Yemen have \nbeen cut off from nearly all humanitarian aid during this horrific \nfamine and cholera epidemic, and the ability of humanitarian agencies \nto provide relief has been significantly impeded.\n  The U.N. has called the Saudi closure of Yemen's borders to aid \ndeliveries catastrophic. Even the International Committee of the Red \nCross was forbidden to cross the northern border with a delivery of \nchlorine tablets to prevent cholera.\n  We learned today from the Saudis that two smaller southern ports and \none Red Sea port will be open soon, although we don't know what that \nmeans, but the main port, where over 80 percent of Yemen's food \nsupplies enter, will remain blockaded and closed.\n  Mr. Speaker, it is well documented that the Saudi-led coalition and \nSaudi forces, in particular, have carried out a ruthless, brutal \nbombing campaign that deliberately targets hospitals, schools, food \nmarkets, and civilian population, including children. The World Food \nProgramme has warned that hundreds of thousands of children will be on \nthe brink of starvation if the blockade lasts for even 2 weeks.\n  That deadline of death and starvation will arrive next Tuesday, just \n2 days before we, here in the United States, sit down to enjoy our \nThanksgiving with our family, friends, and loved ones.\n  Will the Members of this House spare a thought for the children, \nmothers, and fathers of Yemen as we sit down and feast in the warmth \nand comfort of our own homes? Or will this Congress finally, after more \nthan 2\\1/2\\ years of sheer horror, send a clear message to Saudi Arabia \nthat its actions are intolerable?\n  Mr. Speaker, Saudi Arabia's actions, thus far, and the coalition it \nleads in the Yemen civil war may very well rise to the level of war \ncrimes and crimes against humanity, according to the United Nations.\n  It is past time for this House to clearly and unambiguously declare \nthat the United States will no longer provide or sell military aid, \nequipment, and munitions to potential war criminals; that the United \nStates will no longer supply midair refueling to Saudi and coalition \nbombers headed to Yemen to wreak havoc on the suffering Yemeni people; \nthat the U.S. will no longer share intelligence with the Saudi \ncoalition; and that we will no longer remain a complicit and passive \npartner in carrying out one of the world's greatest humanitarian \ncrises.\n  Mr. Speaker, I know the Houthi rebels attempting to take power in \nYemen are also guilty of war crimes. Last November, the Tom Lantos \nHuman Rights Commission held a hearing on the human rights situation \nand humanitarian crisis in Yemen, so I know full well the atrocities \ncommitted by all parties in this war.\n  Mr. Speaker, Yemen is just one more proxy in the region of religious \nand political struggle for dominance between Sunnis, Saudi Arabia, and \nShiite Iran. For some in Congress, that power struggle trumps every \nother consideration.\n  For me, it is yet another reason to act with extreme caution and \nexamine whether and how we allow ourselves to support potential war \ncriminals in pursuit of consolidating their own regional agenda and \npower.\n  I am concerned that this power struggle is escalating further \nthroughout the region. Rather than the U.S. policy working to cool \nthings down, we seem to be encouraging it to heat up.\n  I, for one, Mr. Speaker, do not want the United States to be \ncomplicit in supporting the killing and maiming of children. I do not \nwant the United States to be complicit in the deliberate targeting and \nattacks against schools, hospitals, markets, and homes. I do not want \nthe United States to be complicit in bombing water treatment plants at \nany time, let alone in the middle of the worst cholera epidemic in the \nworld. I do not want the United States to be complicit in supporting a \nblockade that condemns tens of thousands of children to famine and \ndeath by starvation.\n  Once again, I thank Congressman Ro Khanna and my other colleagues who \nhave supported this effort to have this\n\n\ndebate. I want to thank them for their leadership on this important \nissue, but this is serious.\n  Mr. Speaker, I include in the record a Washington Post, November 9, \n2017, editorial, and an article from The Guardian.\n\n          [From the Washington Post--Editorial, Nov. 9, 2017]\n\n                          The Crisis in Yemen\n\n       Saudi Arabia's blockade could trigger a full-blown famine.\n       Saudi Arabia has charged that a missile launched from Yemen \n     toward Riyadh's international airport on Saturday was \n     supplied by Iran and assembled by Tehran's Lebanese client, \n     Hezbollah. It says this could be considered ``an act of war'' \n     and claims the right to ``respond to Iran in the appropriate \n     time and manner.'' Yet the only action taken so far by the de \n     facto Saudi ruler, Mohammed bin Salman, has been to besiege \n     some of the world's most desperate people--the cholera-\n     stricken and literally famished civilian population of Yemen.\n       The press of multiple international crises and President \n     Trump's monopolization of media attention have helped obscure \n     the severity of the humanitarian emergency in Yemen, a poor \n     country of 28 million that has been devastated by civil war \n     and a Saudi-led military intervention. According to the \n     United Nations, it is suffering the fastest-growing cholera \n     epidemic ever recorded, with about 895,000 cases and nearly \n     2,200 deaths since April. At the same time, it is facing the \n     world's biggest food emergency, with 7 million people \n     requiring urgent assistance.\n       Children have been disproportionately afflicted. According \n     to U.N. figures, 27 percent of the cholera victims are under \n     the age of 5. Officials estimate that Juvenile cholera cases \n     will reach 600,000 by the end of the year. Meanwhile, hunger \n     has left half of children under 5 stunted, and 2.2 million \n     are affected by either moderate or severe malnutrition.\n       Saudi Arabia bears heavy responsibility for this suffering. \n     For 2\\1/2\\ years, it has pursued a ruthless but unwinnable \n     war against ethnic Houthis who have captured much of the \n     country, including the capital, Sanaa, and the largest port, \n     Hodeida. Bombing raids have repeatedly struck hospitals and \n     food markets. Worse, in the name of preventing Iran from \n     delivering weapons to the Houthis, the Saudis and their \n     allies have blockaded the country by sea and air, closing \n     Sanaa's airport to commercial traffic and slowing food \n     imports at Hodeida.\n       Now, in reaction to the missile firing, the Saudis have \n     announced a more thorough closure of ``all Yemeni ground, air \n     and sea ports.'' Though a government statement said it would \n     take ``into consideration the continuation of the entry and \n     exit'' of humanitarian supplies and aid workers, UN. \n     officials say that aid flights have been blocked. The World \n     Food Program warned that hundreds of thousands of children \n     would be ``on the brink of starvation'' if the blockade \n     lasted even for two weeks.\n       Saudi officials say the siege is meant to prevent what they \n     claim was the smuggling of missile parts into Yemen from \n     Iran. It has offered no proof of the rocket's origin, and \n     experts point out that Yemen is known to have imported Scud \n     missiles from North Korea before the war. In any case, the \n     blockade will not deter either Iran or the Houthis, but it \n     could trigger a full-blown famine among innocent children. \n     The Trump administration, which has blithely backed Crown \n     Prince Salman in his reckless adventures, should consider the \n     cost.", "turn": 9, "speaker": "Mr. McGOVERN", "itemno": 14}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                                  ____\n\n\n                   [From the Guardian, Nov. 7, 2017]\n\n  Closure of Yemen's Borders To Aid Deliveries is `Catastrophic', UN \n                                 Warns\n\n                           (By Karen McVeigh)\n\n       After Saudi-led coalition seals stricken country's borders, \n     aid agencies caution that deliveries of food and medicine are \n     critical for population's survival.\n       Humanitarian groups and the UN have urged the Saudi-led \n     coalition to reopen aid channels into Yemen, after a decision \n     to seal the stricken country's air, sea and land borders.\n       The UN described the closure of aid channels as \n     ``catastrophic''.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of this resolution, \nexpressing the urgent need for a political solution in Yemen.\n  As the civil war in Yemen continues well into its third year, the \nsituation on the ground becomes more dire by the day. Despite multiple \ninternational attempts to broker a political agreement to end the human \nsuffering, peace remains elusive.\n\n\n\n\n\n  Meanwhile, al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula, also known as AQAP, has \ntaken advantage of this power vacuum created by the conflict. This has \nallowed them to expand into the southern and eastern ports of Yemen, \nwhere they continue to plot external operations against the United \nStates.\n  Simultaneously--much like in Lebanon, Syria, and Iraq--Iran continues \nits campaign of influence in Yemen, where its actions have prolonged \nthe conflict and exacerbated the political and humanitarian nightmare.\n  As highlighted by Secretary Mattis, ``everywhere you look, if there \nis trouble in the region, you find Iran.'' This is not by coincidence. \nAs Prime Minister Netanyahu emphasized to our congressional delegation \non a recent trip to Israel, Iran has been working around the clock to \nsolidify its presence across the region through the establishment of a \nland bridge from Iraq to Lebanon, commonly referred to as the ``Shiite \nCrescent.''\n  Despite a United Nations authorized arms embargo against the Houthi \nforces, Iran, on multiple occasions, has been caught attempting to \nsmuggle weapons and munitions into the region. They have also provided \ntechnical assistance to the Houthis--and Saudi Arabia is often their \nmain target.\n  In order to protect the security interests of the Saudi people, the \ngovernment in Riyadh has taken defense actions to both limit Iranian \nsupport to the Houthis, such as blockades, as well as offensive \nmeasures to stem attacks on the kingdom, such as the unsuccessful \nballistic missile attack on the capital earlier this month. However, \nwhile Saudi Arabia has the right to prioritize its security, we cannot \ndismiss the effects of its actions on the grave humanitarian suffering \non the ground, where more than 27 million face an unprecedented \nhumanitarian crisis.\n  As such, this resolution rightly highlights the need for a political \nsolution to this conflict and condemns Iranian activities that \nundermine peace efforts. Furthermore, it calls on all parties of the \nconflict to take additional measures to prevent civilian casualties and \nincrease much-needed humanitarian access.\n  Lastly, this resolution encourages the international community to \njoin in providing the resources necessary to address this crisis.\n  I commend all those involved.

Congress never approved a declaration of war in Yemen. \nNothing could be more clear in the Constitution of the United States as \nto who has responsibility for declaring wars.

On Saturday, November 4, Iranian-backed Houthi \nrebels in Yemen fired an Iranian-made ballistic missile at Saudi \nArabia's capital. By Monday, Riyadh, in the midst of a massive palace \nshakeup, described the attack as an ``act of war'' by Iran and ordered \nall Yemen's land, sea, and air ports of entry closed.\n  Saudi Arabia said the port closures were necessary to prevent Iran \nfrom continuing to arm the Houthis, but the move also spelled dire \nconsequences for Yemen's civilian population, suffering under its third \nyear of punishing wartime conditions. In a country where nearly 70 \npercent of the population needs some form of humanitarian or protection \nassistance, port closures have the distinct look of collective \npunishment.\n  Although Saudi Arabia, this morning, announced it would begin lifting \nthe restrictions, this dramatic sequence of events underscores the \npotential this war has on any given hour or day to explode into a \nregional confrontation and even greater humanitarian catastrophe.\n  From the regional perspective, Yemen remains a critical foothold for \nIranian influence on the southern flank of the Middle East. The \nconflict there allows the Iranian regime to cynically sow instability \nthat redounds to its own benefit and that of other avowed enemies of \nthe United States and our allies. Gaps in governance around the region \nhave served as an entryway for Iranian influence, most notably in Syria \nand Iraq, where Iran and Hezbollah leveraged the emergence of ISIS and \nal-Qaida to extend their influence.\n  Tehran is playing in a similar game in Yemen, where its campaign to \nundermine the country's government has benefited Iran-aligned Houthi \nmilitias; al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula, or AQAP; and Yemen's ISIS \naffiliate.\n  From the humanitarian perspective, Mr. Speaker, the ongoing costs of \nthe war are absolutely catastrophic.

According to Matthew Nims, the acting director of USAID's Food \nfor Peace Program, who testified before Congress, famine is on the \nagenda now because the Saudi-led military campaign in Yemen is ``using \nhunger as a weapon of war.''\n  Using hunger as a weapon of war, as a way to assault and destroy the \ncivilian population, is completely in disregard of the laws of war. \nThat weapon is proving to be brutally effective. More than 7 million \nYemenis are food insecure tonight, which is a polite way of saying that \nthey are on the brink of starving to death. As we speak, more than two \nout of three Yemenis have no idea where their next meal will come from.\n  Meanwhile, the Saudi-imposed military blockade against Yemen and the \ndeliberate targeting in Yemen of water and sewage systems, along with \nhospitals and schools, have engendered, in that country, the largest \ncivilian cholera crisis in recorded human history. More than 900,000 \npeople are suffering from a massive outbreak of cholera, a bacterial \ndisease that causes severe and painful diarrhea and dehydration, and \nwhich has already killed more than 2,000 women, men, and children.\n  The U.S. must act to save the people of Yemen.

They \ncontinue to export weapons to Yemen, including rockets and ballistic \nmissiles. Some of these things involve antiship weapons and sea mines, \nwhich could threaten our own U.S. Navy.\n  Houthi rebels have directly attacked Saudi Arabia's property, further \nescalating the tensions and bringing us to the brink of a broader \nconflict in the area.\n  Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for bringing this important \nresolution to the floor.", "turn": 19, "speaker": "Mr. FRANCIS ROONEY of Florida", "itemno": 25}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "K000389", "text": "  Mr. KHANNA.

Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  Mr. Speaker, I commend Mr. Khanna for his leadership. I think it is \nimportant that our new Members come here and really make a difference \nfor these important events all around the world, so I thank him.\n\n\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this measure that shines a light on \nthe carnage and suffering that has defined the conflict in Yemen.\n  Mr. Speaker, I want to again thank Mr. Khanna, who has shown real \nleadership on this issue. He understands the critical role Congress has \nto play in our foreign policy and why it is so important that this body \ntake the time to talk about the civil war in Yemen and America's \ninvolvement. The United States wields tremendous power, diplomatic, \nmilitary, and developmental, and we have an obligation to debate how \nthose tools are used.\n  We have heard about Saudi and Iranian involvement in the civil war in \nYemen. Sadly, Yemenis are caught in the crossfire. The devastation of \nYemen's infrastructure has led to 900,000 cholera cases. At least one \nYemeni child dies every 10 minutes, on average, from malnutrition, \ndiarrhea, or respiratory tract infections.\n  Last week, the Saudis intercepted a missile targeting Riyadh. In \nresponse, the Saudi-led coalition closed all Yemeni ports of entry. \nSince last week, no humanitarian assistance has been allowed to enter \nYemen. Fuel shortages are limiting access for USAID partners at a time \nwhen more than 75 percent of Yemenis require some level of assistance, \nincluding 6.8 million people entirely reliant on food aid. The people \nof Yemen are facing a very dire situation.\n  Let's be clear, neither military action nor food aid will solve the \nconflict in Yemen. A political solution is essential for moving Yemen \ntowards stability. That will require some compromise, an exit strategy \nfor the Yemeni Government's Gulf partners, and a real commitment by the \ninternational community to prevent Iranian weapons from getting into \nYemen.\n  So what does all this mean for America's role?\n  As this resolution notes, the United States provides midair refueling \nfor the Saudi-led coalition and participates in intelligence \ncooperation.\n  Today's debate reminds us that the United States is engaged with \npartners around the world under a range of authorities. Some of these \nactivities are covered by a current Authorization for Use of Military \nForce--AUMF--some are not.\n  In my view, we should have more clarity about the way we use American \nmilitary might not just in Yemen, but around the world. After all, it \nis Congress' responsibility to declare war or to limit a President's \nauthority to wage war when necessary.\n  I have said for years that we should sunset the 2001 AUMF. We voted \nthen to give the President authorization to go after the people and \ngroups that attacked on 9/11. We never intended it to be a blank check. \nToday, we face new threats, threats unrelated to the terrorists who \nattacked my hometown, New York City, on September 11.\n  We owe it to our men and women in uniform to have a thorough and \nhonest debate before we send them into harm's way, to stand in this \nbody and say ``yes'' or ``no'' before we ask them to put their lives on \nthe line.\n  This measure helps to move that debate forward. I am glad to support \nit, and I urge all Members to do the same.\n  Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Khanna for his leadership.", "turn": 21, "speaker": "Mr. ENGEL", "itemno": 27}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "R000487", "text": "  Mr. ROYCE of California.

Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of \nmy time.\n  Mr. Speaker, part of the complexity here in this tragedy is that Iran \ndoes want to turn the Houthis into a Yemeni version of Hezbollah, \nthereby turning Yemen into a second Lebanon, where a militia is \nconstantly holding the government hostage.\n  We do face a challenge here in the sense that they are firing Iranian \nmissiles on a regular basis into Saudi Arabia, at cities across Saudi \nArabia, including firing on Riyadh, the capital.\n\n  Now, we have not committed American forces to fight against the \nHouthi rebels in Yemen, and I do not believe the American people want \nus to. We should not. Our main involvement has been in the form of \nhumanitarian assistance and our longstanding preexisting security \nrelationships with regional partners, including Saudi Arabia, UAE, and \nGulf Cooperation Council.\n  I don't disagree that we must push them to improve their operations \nto better avoid civilian casualties and humanitarian harm, but it is a \ndangerous delusion to think that distancing ourselves from those \nsecurity relationships would serve the cause of peace and security in \nYemen and the region. It would do the opposite.\n  House Resolution 599, in my opinion, is a very responsible reaction \nto the ongoing crisis, but it expresses the urgent need for a political \nsolution in Yemen, calls on all parties to prevent civilian casualties \nand promote humanitarian access, and condemns Iran for its continuing \ndestabilizing activities in Yemen in violation of the U.N.
