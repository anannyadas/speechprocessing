Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4173, \nthe Veterans Crisis Line Study Act of 2017. This legislation would \ncreate a five year study in the Department of Veteran Affairs (VA) on \nthe Veteran Crisis Line.\n  A troubling 2016 study published by the VA reported that in 2014, 20 \nveterans died by suicide each day. These numbers are heartbreaking and \nunacceptable, and we must do more to support veterans' access to mental \nhealth services.\n  Launched in 2007, the Veterans Crisis Line is a subsection of the \nsuicide prevention lifeline, and is a resource created to connect \nveterans with professionals trained to address their specific needs and \nprevent suicide. Men and women who have served and their families can \nreach out for help on this toll free hotline, online chat, or text. \nH.R. 4173 aims to study the efficacy and outcomes of this resource, \npinpointing how the hotline is helping our veterans, and how we can \nimprove it to better address the troubling suicide rates among our \nnation's heroes.\n  Veterans are owed the best care and upmost respect when they return \nfrom duty and I am deeply troubled by their increased likelihood of \nsuicide. H.R. 4173 will help build our arsenal to combat mental illness \nand develop resources for the men and women who have selflessly served \nour nation. I support H.R. 4173 and I urge my fellow members to lend \ntheir support as well.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 3}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "185", "extension": true, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "E1558", "wkday": "Monday", "day": "13", "month": "November"}, "related_bills": [{"type": "HR", "context": "OTHER", "congress": "115", "number": "4173"}], "doc_title": "VETERANS CRISIS LINE STUDY ACT OF 2017", "id": "CREC-2017-11-13-pt1-PgE1558-3"}
