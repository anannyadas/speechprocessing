Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize \nDr. Takashi Kitamura, assistant professor in the Department of \nPsychiatry at the University of Texas Southwestern. On November 12, \n2017, Dr. Kitamura received the Peter and Patricia Gruber International \nResearch Award, from the Society for Neuroscience. Supported by The \nGruber Foundation, the award recognizes young neuroscientists for \noutstanding research and educational pursuit in an international \nsetting.\n  Dr. Kitamura has made three major contributions in his career to \ndate. First, he demonstrated that there are two types of excitatory \nneurons in layer II of the entorhinal cortex, ``island cells'' and \n``ocean cells,'' both of which he named, and that pyramidal island \nneurons cluster in a series of bulblike structures while stellate ocean \ncells surround the structures. Second, in collaboration with another \ngraduate student, he determined the function of each cell type, \nrevealing island cells to control timing and navigation and ocean cells \nto encode static location. Third, he identified engrams and circuits \ncrucial for systems consolidation of memory, which leads to the \nformation of long-term memories in the neocortex.\n  Dr. Takashi Kitamura earned his doctorate in biology at Kyushu \nUniversity in Japan. His thesis, ``Molecular Mechanisms of Adult \nHippocampal Neurogenesis,'' sought to identify the role of entorhinal \nhippocampal neuronal circuits in the formation of episodic memory and \nrevealed important insight that formed the basis for his postdoctoral \nresearch at the Mitsubishi-Kaguku Institute as well as further research \nat the Picower Institute for Learning and Memory at the Massachusetts \nInstitute of Technology.\n  Dr. Kitamura's work is significant because it contributes \nsignificantly to the federally-funded research investment in my \ncongressional district.\n  Mr. Speaker, I know my colleagues will join me in congratulating Dr. \nKitamura. With distinguished academicians work like Dr. Kitamura, we \nwill have better understanding of cognitive impairments and Alzheimer's \ndisease.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 3}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "185", "extension": true, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "E1559", "wkday": "Monday", "day": "13", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "TRIBUTE TO DR.
