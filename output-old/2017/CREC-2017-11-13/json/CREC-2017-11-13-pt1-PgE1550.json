Mr. Speaker, I proudly pause to recognize a \nspecial member of my staff. After almost seventeen years of service, \nAlicia Jayne Endicott will be leaving her post in my Kansas City \nDistrict Office.\n   Alicia was one of the first members of my staff, joining the team \nsoon after I took office in 2001. She has been an integral member of my \nconstituent services team that entire time. Alicia was tireless in \nmaking sure the people of the Sixth Congressional District were treated \nfairly by federal agencies and that their concerns were heard and \njustly resolved. Whether helping families with last-minute passport \nneeds, protecting my constituents from overbearing agencies or making \nsure our veterans received the care and recognitions they earned, her \noutstanding work and immense knowledge of the issues was incomparable \nand I am honored to have had her on my staff and my constituents were \nincredibly served by her efforts.\n   I have received many kind words from constituents praising the \noutstanding service Alicia has provided. Her professionalism and \ndedication to this office and my constituents was a great example of \nhow government should work. She would often work nights and weekends, \nall without complaint. While I am losing a valuable member of my team, \nI am excited for Alicia to begin the next chapter of her life.\n   Mr. Speaker, I proudly ask you to join me in thanking Alicia Jayne \nEndicott for her many years of service to the people of the Sixth \nCongressional District. I know Alicia's colleagues, family and friends \njoin with me in thanking her for her commitment to others and wishing \nher the best of luck in all her endeavors and many years of success to \ncome.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. GRAVES of Missouri", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 3}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "185", "extension": true, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "E1550", "wkday": "Monday", "day": "13", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "HONORING ALICIA JAYNE ENDICOTT", "id": "CREC-2017-11-13-pt1-PgE1550", "title": "HONORING ALICIA JAYNE ENDICOTT"}
