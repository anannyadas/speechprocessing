Mr. Speaker, today I am proud to introduce the Senator \nPaul Simon Study Abroad Program Act with my colleague and my friend \nfrom across the aisle, Congresswoman Ileana Ros-Lehtinen.\n  Paul Simon was a five-term Congressman and two-term Senator from my \nhome State of Illinois. Like me, he believed in bipartisan solutions. \nIn fact, as a Democrat, Paul Simon served as Lieutenant Governor of \nIllinois under Republican Governor Richard Ogilvie--the only time in \nmodern history that Illinois has elected a Governor and a Lieutenant \nGovernor from different parties.\n  Paul Simon believed in a government that helps people and encouraged \nCongress to work together to prepare the next generation with the \nknowledge required to succeed in an increasingly global world.\n  Our bill would establish a competitive grant program and Paul Simon's \nname to help do just that.\n  The program would increase opportunities for college students to \nstudy abroad, especially students who don't get to do so, like so many \nof the rural and community college students in my district.\n  Paul Simon once said: Some of us still think we can change the world. \nI am proud to introduce a bipartisan bill with Congresswoman Ileana \nRos-Lehtinen to help prepare our students to change the world.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mrs. BUSTOS", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "185", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H9159", "wkday": "Monday", "day": "13", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "HELP PREPARE OUR STUDENTS TO CHANGE THE WORLD", "id": "CREC-2017-11-13-pt1-PgH9159-3", "title": "HELP PREPARE OUR STUDENTS TO CHANGE THE WORLD"}
