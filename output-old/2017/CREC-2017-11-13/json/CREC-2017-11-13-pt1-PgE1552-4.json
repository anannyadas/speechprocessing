Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize an outstanding \nconstituent--Leonard Hill from Guilford County. I am honored to \nacknowledge constituents who selflessly answered the call to serve and \ndefend our freedom. A United States Army Air Corps veteran of World War \nII and member of the Greatest Generation, Mr. Hill served his country \nwith honor. Self-sacrifice, personal responsibility, and humility are \ntraits this generation embodied. The tremendous strides our country has \nmade since World War II are a direct result of these great Americans. \nNorth Carolina is truly fortunate to have Mr. Hill, an outstanding \nrepresentative of our community and country.
