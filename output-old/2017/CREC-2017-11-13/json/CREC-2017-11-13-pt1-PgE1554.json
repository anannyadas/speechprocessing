Mr. Speaker, I rise today to include in the Record the \nwords of my young constituent, Anastasia Tsakonas.\n  Her thanks and words of praise for our brave men and women in service \nring loud and true.\n\n       Veterans Day is courage, sacrifice, and patriotism all \n     rolled up into the uniform that an individual wore when they \n     decided to protect this wonderful country.\n       Veterans Day is our reminder that we need to honor and \n     celebrate all the men and women who have served or are \n     currently serving in our military. Veterans are volunteers \n     who offer their lives to protect and die for this country. It \n     takes a lot of courage and strength to enter the military and \n     purposely leave behind everything you love. Many Veterans \n     leave behind their homes, families, and careers knowing that \n     it will be a long time before they see them again. \n     Unfortunately, with this type of sacrifice, many Veterans \n     also know that they may never return to see any of them \n     again.\n       Through a Veteran's selfless sacrifice, we as citizens \n     receive freedom, a freedom that many people in this world \n     would like to have but are not allowed. This freedom lets us \n     enjoy peace, prosperity, the right of speech and religion, \n     the right to education and most important-opportunity; all \n     values and beliefs that this country was originally founded \n     and built on and which continue to exist to this day because \n     of our Veterans.\n       Let us take time to reflect on these men and women who \n     receive nothing in return for protecting our country and be \n     grateful to them that we still have our values and beliefs \n     intact. President Coolidge said: ``The nation which forgets \n     it defenders will itself be forgotten.''\n       Thank you Veterans, without you, I could not be me!\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. CROWLEY", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 3}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "185", "extension": true, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "E1554", "wkday": "Monday", "day": "13", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "ESSAY IN HONOR OF VETERANS DAY BY ANASTASIA TSAKONAS", "id": "CREC-2017-11-13-pt1-PgE1554", "title": "ESSAY IN HONOR OF VETERANS DAY BY ANASTASIA TSAKONAS"}
