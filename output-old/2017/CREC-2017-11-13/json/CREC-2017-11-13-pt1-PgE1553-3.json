Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1900, \nthe National Veterans Memorial and Museum Act.\n  H.R. 1900 seeks to name the Veterans Memorial and Museum in Columbus, \nOhio, the National Veterans Memorial and Museum.\n  The Veterans Memorial and Museum is a landmark that has been under \nconstruction in Columbus, Ohio, since December 2015. The Veterans \nMemorial and Museum will soon be open to the public and aims to display \nthe combined experiences of American veterans from all armed encounters \nand branches of the military. The National Veterans Memorial and Museum \nis just one way we can honor veterans and their families, and guarantee \nthat future generations know the many sacrifices that were made for us.\n  Ohio is an appropriate setting for the new museum, considering that \nthe state is home to the sixth largest veteran population in the United \nStates. As we approach Veterans Day, the passage of the National \nVeterans Memorial and Museum Act is tremendous news for not only Ohio's \nveteran community but to all veterans nationwide. I recognize the value \nof having a national site to reflect on the experiences of veterans \nthroughout American history, and I am pleased to support this \nlegislation.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 3}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "185", "extension": true, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "E1553", "wkday": "Monday", "day": "13", "month": "November"}, "related_bills": [{"type": "HR", "context": "OTHER", "congress": "115", "number": "1900"}], "doc_title": "NATIONAL VETERANS MEMORIAL AND MUSEUM ACT", "id": "CREC-2017-11-13-pt1-PgE1553-3"}
