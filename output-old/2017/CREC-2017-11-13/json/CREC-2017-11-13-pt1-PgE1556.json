Mr. Speaker, I rise today in proud recognition of the \nOperation Recognition Class of 2017. Operation Recognition is a program \norganized by the Riverside County Office of Education, with assistance \nfrom the Riverside County Department of Veteran's Services, that \npresents diplomas to residents of Riverside County who missed \ncompleting high school due to military service in World War II, the \nKorean War, or the Vietnam War, or due to internment in WWII Japanese-\nAmerican relocation camps.\n  Riverside County's Operation Recognition is modeled after programs \nimplemented in other states. Numerous county offices of education and \nschool districts throughout California operate similar programs. The \nprograms are yet another way to express our appreciation and gratitude \nfor the significant contributions and sacrifices made by our veterans.\n  The Operation Recognition Class of 2017 includes: Timothy Lewis \nBasquez, San Jacinto, U.S, Marine Corps, Vietnam War; Manuel Blunt, \nRiverside, U.S. Army, Vietnam War; Edward J. Clark, Norco, U.S. Marine \nCorps, Korean War, Joseph J. Harrison, Perris, U.S. Army, Vietnam War, \nBradford Hotchkiss, Riverside, U.S. Navy, Vietnam War, James Andrew \nMorrison, Canyon Lake, U.S. Navy, Korean War; and Mack Donald Salesky \nSan Jacinto, U.S. Army, Vietnam War.\n  On behalf of all Riverside County residents and a grateful nation, I \nwant to thank these veterans for their service to our country and \ncongratulate them on being part of the Operation Recognition Class of \n2017.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. CALVERT", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 3}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "185", "extension": true, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "E1556", "wkday": "Monday", "day": "13", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "TRIBUTE TO OPERATION RECOGNITION CLASS OF 2017", "id": "CREC-2017-11-13-pt1-PgE1556", "title": "TRIBUTE TO OPERATION RECOGNITION CLASS OF 2017"}
