Last week we confirmed multiple \nnominees to a number of Federal agencies. Soon they will get on the job \nfor our country.\n  This week we will start by considering two nominees for the \nDepartment of Transportation. Later today, the Senate will vote to \nconfirm Derek Kan to serve as the Under Secretary of Transportation for \nPolicy. Mr. Kan has experience in a wide range of transportation \nmatters, from Amtrak to ride-sharing platforms. His career in both the \nprivate and public sectors will serve him well as he works to develop \nimportant policies related to our Nation's infrastructure. I will be \nsupporting Mr. Kan's nomination, and I would urge all Senators to join \nme.\n  Next, we will consider the nomination of Steven Bradbury to be \ngeneral counsel of the Department of Transportation. During Mr. \nBradbury's service at the Justice Department in the Bush \nadministration, he advised the executive branch on various legal and \nconstitutional questions. I am grateful that he has chosen to serve our \nNation once again.\n  Next up will be David Zatezalo to serve as the Assistant Secretary of \nLabor for Mine Safety and Health and, then, Joseph Otting to be the \nComptroller of the Currency. Finally, we have two more talented and \nqualified nominees to serve as Federal district court judges, Donald \nCoggins and Dabney Friedrich.\n  Thoughtful consideration of President Trump's nominees is an \nimportant responsibility of the Senate, and we will continue to move \nswiftly so they can get to work for the American people. I look forward \nto considering each of them this week, and I would urge all of our \ncolleagues to join me.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. McCONNELL", "itemno": 0}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 1}], "header": {"chamber": "Senate", "num": "185", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "S7170", "wkday": "Monday", "day": "13", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "NOMINATIONS", "id": "CREC-2017-11-13-pt1-PgS7170", "title": "NOMINATIONS"}
