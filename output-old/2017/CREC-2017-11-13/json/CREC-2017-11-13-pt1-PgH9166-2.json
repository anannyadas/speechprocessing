Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to be \nhere once again and follow up on the gentleman from Texas and his \nremarks that I think hit the nail on the head with regard to what \nworking class families out in the heartland, in the Deep South are \nfacing every single day.\n  I think it is important that every policy that we push here in the \nUnited States Congress is a policy that addresses some of those deep \nconcerns that they all have.\n  Sometimes I think that this town gets into a little bit of a bubble. \nTwo separate political parties that talk to each other, talk at each \nother, talk within each other, but we are in the midst of deep change \nin the United States. We are in the midst of the kind of structural \nchange we have not seen in our country in a long, long time.\n  We have an economic system, a Tax Code, a trade regime, that has not, \nquite frankly, been up to task to meet the needs of working class \nfamilies.\n  We have a healthcare system that, even though many changes have been \nmade, I think, to help people get coverage, to help them afford their \nhealthcare, it is still not up to task with the deep needs of our \ncountry.\n  We have an education system that is not quite up to speed.\n  The deliberations in this body need to be a little bit deeper. I \nthink we need to take a little bit of a step back.\n  We have tax reform that is on the docket this week.\n  We have a consistent dialogue with other nations with regard to how \nwe are going to organize our trade relationships with other countries, \nwhether it be in North America, whether it be with China or Europe or \nany other country.\n\n\n  Mr. Speaker, I will just say that after looking at the tax bill that \nhas been presented in both the House and the Senate, the Congressional \nBudget Office has said that this tax bill will run a deficit and a \nlong-term debt for our country to the tune of $1.7 trillion. So this \ntax reform that our friends on the other side are pushing has a $1.7 \ntrillion hole in it.\n  What has to happen is that the United States Government, because the \nRepublicans are going to pass a tax cut, which the majority will go to \nthe wealthiest people in the country, and because there will be this \nhole in the budget now, this country--our taxpayers are going to have \nto go to China, go to Saudi Arabia, and we are going to say: Hey, can \nyou loan us some money? We have got this big deficit. We have got this \ndebt we are running up in the United States. Can you loan us like $1.7 \ntrillion? Because we are going to give that money back to the \nwealthiest people in the country, in the hopes that it stimulates the \neconomy and grows jobs and wages. And, oh, by the way, we tried that in \n2001, and 2003, and it didn't work.\n  To me, I think it is very difficult for us as a country to say we are \ngoing to give China more power over us. We are going to give China more \nsay in the negotiations that we have with them, whether it is North \nKorea, whether it is them moving bases out into the South China Sea \nwhere they are actually building islands so that they can put bases on \nthem and project more force in that area of the world.\n  We are going to have less negotiating power with them as they \ncontinue to move into Africa and extract natural resources to feed \ntheir industrial machine. We are going to ask them for $1.7 trillion to \ngive a tax cut that goes primarily to the biggest corporations in the \ncountry and the wealthiest people in the country.\n  Now, that doesn't make a whole lot of sense to most people. It sounds \nlike a little bit of a scam. And the $1.7 trillion, which you have got \nto watch, we are borrowing it, and then we have to pay interest on the \nmoney that we are borrowing. So if interest rates go up, we are going \nto start paying more.\n  Meanwhile, back here in the United States, we have got a number of \nchallenges that we have got to deal with. We have got to rebuild our \ncountry. The President, while he was campaigning, said: We are going to \ndo $1 trillion in infrastructure improvements in the United States. I \nam a builder. We are going to rebuild the country.\n  It is now November, and we have not heard anything about an \ninfrastructure bill or building roads and bridges and all the rest. In \nfact, we have had a President who campaigned--might see a little theme \ndeveloping here--the President also campaigned and said: We are going \nto expand healthcare. We are going to expand Medicare. We are going to \nexpand Medicaid. We are going to make it cheaper, accessible. It is \ngoing to be beautiful, and it will be easy to do. I can do it.\n  And so goes life.\n  The two bills, in both the House and the Senate, from the \nRepublicans, as analyzed by the Congressional Budget Office--not as \nanalyzed by Democrats--it was analyzed by the Congressional Budget \nOffice, which is a neutral third party. They are kind of the umpire \ndown here. They are the referee in\n\n\nWashington. They just look at the numbers. Whatever party is in charge, \nthey always don't like the Congressional Budget Office because they \nalways tell you things you don't necessarily want to hear.\n  So the Congressional Budget Office said, on both of those bills for \nhealthcare, both the House and the Senate: 20-plus million people will \nlose their healthcare.\n  So we had a campaign saying we are going to rebuild the country, and \nthat hasn't happened; a campaign saying we are going to get people more \nhealthcare, and that is not happening. Then, we had a campaign where \nour President was saying: We are going to be tough on China. We have \ngot to be tough on them.\n  There are all kinds of little quotes I can say from when he was in \nOhio, or he was here, or he was there. He was going to be the tough-on-\nChina guy.\n  As you can see from this chart, for good measure, this is a chart \nthat outlines where Chinese trade, foreign trade, and automation have \nhurt our country, and who has been hurt the most. The red is the \nhardest hit; and then as it moves to more lighter colors, less so.\n  So you can see in the industrial Midwest, in the Great Lakes States, \nin the South, up in New England, Pennsylvania, and some out West, they \nwere devastated by trade. The President is in China this past week, and \nhe says: I don't blame the Chinese. It is not their fault, but it is \nthe United States' fault.\n  Now, I will say that the United States has not done a great job of \nbeing as firm on China as I would have liked. I was one of the original \ncosponsors of the China Currency Manipulation Bill, with former \nRepresentative Duncan Hunter, the father of current Representative \nDuncan Hunter.\n  So we have been on this for a long time. But this does not gloss over \nthe fact that the Chinese intentionally steal our intellectual \nproperty. They intentionally skirt global trade rules.\n  If we put tariffs up on Chinese steel tubing coming into the United \nStates, the Chinese will ship it to another country, and then, from \nthat country, send it to the United States to avoid the tariffs that we \nput on because their product, their final product, was cheaper than the \nraw material costs of a company like Wheatland Tube, in my \ncongressional district, that is trying to sell the same thing; or \nVallourec Star, in my district, that is trying to sell the same thing.\n  So we would put tariffs on, and they would skirt the rules and come \naround through another country. So we play this constant game of trying \nto figure out where the Chinese steel is going to come in from. That is \nnot our fault. That is not playing by the rules. That is not playing \nfair.\n  Our President needs to recognize--I am all for being a diplomat--but \nwhen you are in the country, you need to be firm with the leaders of \nthat country and tell them to stop hurting American businesses and \nputting American steelworkers out of work, especially when you \ncampaigned on doing that just a year ago. We are seeing communities \ncompletely wiped out.\n\n  So back to the tax cut, we are going to go to this same country, and \nwe are going to borrow money from them. That doesn't make any sense at \nall.\n  What Democrats are proposing, and what our side is proposing, is that \nthe people in the country that really need a break are those people the \ngentleman from Texas was just talking about, the ones working swing \nshifts; the ones who take a shower after work; the ones who stand on \ntheir feet all day long, making minimum wage or maybe a little bit \nmore. Those are the people we should be pushing a tax cut toward. Put a \nlittle money in their pocket; help them lift up the ladder.\n  Here is why I think this makes sense: If you go back to the last time \nwe did tax reform, 31 years ago, in the last 31 years, 96 percent of \nall income growth went to the top 10 percent of the wealthiest people \nin the United States. So over 30 years, 96 percent of that growth went \nto the top 10 percent. That is where all of the money went.\n  We have seen it flatline wages across the middle class for 30 years. \nWe know the story, unfortunately: communities gutted, manufacturing \nbase eroded. So to say we are going to take this group that has made \nall of the income gains in the last 31 years, and we are going to give \nthem a tax cut that we are going to finance by borrowing money from \nChina, which is going to increase our national debt; so we are going to \nhave to pay more on that; we are going to lose leverage in the world \nwith China; and now they are our banker--even more so than they are \nright now.\n  So what I am asking is for us, in this body, to take a time out, to \nstop the process, to reach across the aisle to Democrats, to say that \nwe have got to figure out this disparity that has happened over the \nlast 20 or 30 years between capital and between labor. All of the gains \nhave been on the capital side, yet capital gets taxed at a lower rate \nthan wages.\n  Warren Buffett said it a million times that he pays a lower tax rate \nthan his secretary pays. Now, is that fair? Is that right? It is not. \nOf course, it isn't.\n  The argument is--because we have been adopting this system in one \nform or fashion or another for most of the last 30 years since \nReaganomics--that has been the same time that all of this has happened. \nSo we need a new way of doing this. This is not working for people. The \nTax Code is an opportunity for us, I think, to ask those people who \nhave been doing pretty well over the last 30 years, who make their \nmoney through capital gains, to pay the same level as the guy working \nthe second shift at General Motors Lordstown. I think that is only \nfair. With that revenue, we can start rebuilding the country.\n  Let me just say, lastly, that there is no evidence--and I know in \nWashington that most things aren't based on evidence--but there is no \nevidence that cutting taxes for the wealthiest people in the country \nsomehow makes it down to improve wages for middle class people. There \njust isn't any evidence of that.\n  George W. Bush, I was here for the second round of these tax cuts, \nbut he cut, primarily, for the top 1 percent and threw some crumbs to \nthe middle class folks. They got 300 bucks. That was supposed to create \njobs, stimulate the economy, grow wages, and everything else. That was \nthe slowest decade of growth in modern American history going back to \nthe Great Depression.\n  We had a more stable line of growth with the Bill Clinton budget in \n1993, in which we asked the wealthiest to pay a little bit more. We \nbalanced the budget, reinvested back into the country, and created 20 \nmillion new jobs. Every income group, from top to bottom, saw wages go \nup.\n\n\n  When he walked out of this Capitol and George W. Bush came in, I \nthink there was a $5.6 trillion projected surplus. I hate to say it, \nbut we were having the debate about what we were going to do with the \nsurplus. You may remember Al Gore was campaigning saying: We ought to \nput that surplus in a lock box, and make sure we support Medicare and \nSocial Security and extend the life of those programs.\n  George Bush was saying that we want to give it back in a tax cut. So \nGeorge Bush won, and it went back in a tax cut. The only benefit--\nsupposed benefit--is that at least we didn't necessarily borrow that \nmoney. We were projected to have that money come in, and then we gave \nit back in a tax cut as the country collectively--some of us weren't \nfor that.\n  But now we don't have a surplus we are going to give away. We have \ngot to go borrow the money. So then we give that $5.6 trillion back--\nagain, primarily to the top 1 percent--and have a slow decade of \ngrowth. We ended up in two wars, put that on a credit card, too, then a \ncomplete economic collapse, and we are just trying to climb our way \nback.\n  This is not the time to go borrow more money from China and give a \ntax cut to the wealthiest people in the country. It is just not the \ntime to do that. We have got a lot of investments here at home that we \nneed to make. We need to create an economic system that starts working \nfor most people in the country which it is not now.\n  We have jobs, but we have stagnant wages. We do have jobs, but wages \nare low. We do have jobs, but people are still losing their pensions. \nWe do have jobs, but people still don't have the kind of healthcare \nthat they need.\n  We can do better than this. It starts, I think, now with our \nrejecting the Republican tax bill and saying to them:\n\n\nReach across the aisle, work with Democrats, and let's do something \nthat is bipartisan here and something that makes this a revenue \nenhancer or, at the very least, revenue neutral by asking and \nincreasing the rates on capital and not borrowing $1.7 trillion--if not \nmore--with increased interest rates from China.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n", "turn": 1, "speaker": "Mr. RYAN of Ohio", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "185", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H9166-H9168", "wkday": "Monday", "day": "13", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "REFORMING OUR TAX CODE", "id": "CREC-2017-11-13-pt1-PgH9166-2", "title": "REFORMING OUR TAX CODE"}
