Mr. Speaker, George Orwell wrote, in his \nnovel 1984, ``Who controls the past controls the future. Who controls \nthe present controls the past.''\n  The context of this slogan is Winston's struggle to maintain his \nmemory, his vital connection to truth--against the evil ambition of the \nall-powerful party to control what we remember of the past, and, \nthrough that, to control the pathways into the future.\n  That is also the context in which the Victims of Congress Memorial \nFoundation carries on its work. This outstanding foundation held a \nlandmark three-day conference in Washington last week, marking 100 \nyears since the Bolshevik revolution unleashed the evils of communism \non the world.\n  The foundation works to ensure that the memories, the real \nexperiences of millions of people who suffered under communism are \npreserved--notwithstanding the efforts of powerful persons, ideologies, \nand interests, for whom the memory of the horrific crimes of communism \nmust be forgotten, or more or less subtly distorted so as to promote \ntheir own contemporary agendas.\n  On one level, reluctance to remember the communist crimes might seem \nan understandable human weakness--the sheer scale of communist crimes \nis so vast that it beggars our power of comprehension.\n  Since 1917 communism has claimed at least 100 million lives, in the \nSoviet Union, China, Mongolia, Eastern Europe, Indochina, Africa, \nAfghanistan and parts of Latin America according to the painstaking \nresearch of demographers.\n  Writing in the Wall Street Journal two weeks ago, Professor Stephen \nKotkin specified that in China, ``Mao's program resulted in one of \nhistory's deadliest famines, claiming between 16 and 32 million \nvictims.'' On Cambodia: ``All told, perhaps as many as 2 million \nCambodians; a quarter of the population, perished as a result of \nstarvation, disease and mass executions during the four nightmarish \nyears of Pol Pot's rule.''\n  Yet we have a duty to remember the past accurately. Rather than \ndwell, today, on the many ways in which the memory of communist crimes \nhas been obliterated or retouched, let's consider one thing that is \ncommon to most, if not all, of them: they deny the profound spiritual \nsignificance of the victims' experiences, and of the perpetrator's \ncrimes.\n  No one has been more eloquent in calling us back to this than \nAlexander Solzhenitsyn. In 1983 the great writer received the Templeton \nPrize, which is made to honor an exceptional contribution to affirming \nlife's spiritual dimension. He opened his remarks with these memorable \nwords:\n\n       More than half a century ago, while I was still a child, I \n     recall hearing a number of older people offer the following \n     explanation for the great disasters that had befallen Russia: \n     Men have forgotten God; that's why all this has happened.\n       Since then I have spent well-nigh fifty years working on \n     the history of our Revolution; in the process I have read \n     hundreds of books, collected hundreds of personal \n     testimonies, and have already contributed eight volumes of my \n     own toward the effort of clearing away the rubble left by \n     that upheaval. But if I were asked today to formulate as \n     concisely as possible the main cause of the ruinous \n     Revolution that swallowed up some sixty million of our \n     people, I could not put it more accurately than to repeat: \n     Men have forgotten God; that's why all this has happened.\n\n  Solzhenitsyn recalled us forcefully to the spiritual values that were \nalways at stake in the communist assault on humanity--and remain at \nstake in the struggle to maintain the memory of what communism \nperpetrated on the peoples who fell victim to it.\n  Over my many years in Congress, I have been blessed to meet and work \nwith many other men and women who have been great living witnesses to \nthe effort to maintain a true memory of the crimes of communism. It's \nno coincidence that most of them have also been witnesses to God, and \ncame into conflict with communism for that very reason.\n  Thirty-seven years ago, during my first term in Congress, I read \nTortured for Christ by Romanian pastor Richard Wurmbrand.\n  It is the true story of unspeakable physical torture and \npsychological abuse of underground Christians under Romania's Communist \ndictator Nicolae Ceausescu--and of Pastor Wurmbrand's harrowing 14-year \nincarceration. Wurmbrand had defied the communists by declaring openly \nthat Communism and Christianity were incompatible. Sabina, his brave \nwife, stood by him and also suffered prison and forced labor for her \nfaith.\n  In 1964 the Wurmbrands were ransomed out of Romania for $10,000, and \nin 1966 Richard testified before Congress, taking off his shirt to show \nAmericans the scars from his torture.\n  Like so many, both my wife Marie and I read his book and were \ninspired by Pastor Wurmbrand's indomitable faith, breathtaking courage \nand hope and challenged by his admonishment to believers to cease \nenabling evil by our naivete, cold-hearted indifference or cowardly \ncomplicity.\n  After being drugged and beaten Pastor Wurmbrand said he was in such \nbad shape that he even forgot the words to the Lord's Prayer so he \nsimply prayed: ``Our Father I have forgotten the prayer, but you surely \nknow it by heart. . . .''\n  Russia gave us many witnesses to the ugly reality of communism. In \nthe 1980s, my first religious freedom mission was to Moscow and \nLeningrad in 1982 on behalf of Soviet Jews--the heroic refuseniks, like \nNatan Sharansky. I got to know many of them and their families. And \nwhen in 1989 Frank Wolf and I visited Perm Camp 35 the prisoners told \nus of their hunger--for food, and for Scripture as well.\n  In Moscow I also met, and prayed with the Siberian Seven--a group of \nPentecostal Christians who fled to the U.S. Embassy and lived there for \nfive years until finally getting exit visas. During that trip--and many \nsubsequent trips to meet Orthodox clergy and believers--began to grasp \nAlexander Solzhenitsyn's astute observation that communism doesn't \nmerely believe that God does not exist, it hates Him.\n  Solzhenitsyn called it ``militant atheism''.\n  Like many of you I saw that hate throughout the Soviet Union, in \nRomania, the Warsaw Pact Countries--and that God-hatred continues to \nthrive today within dictatorships like North Korea, Cuba, Vietnam and \nChina.\n  China has produced many witnesses, and because its communist \ndictatorship endures, and even hardens its militancy, today, we all \nhave the opportunity to meet those who witness and document its crimes \nagainst the Chinese people. As the chair of the China Commission I have \nmany times heard testimony from Bob Fu, Wei Jingsheng, Chai Ling, Harry \nWu, Joseph Kung, and so many others.\n\n\n  One of the most memorable encounters I had was in China itself, in \n1994. I had the awesome privilege of a private meeting with Bishop Su \nZhimin. Bishop Su was the leader of the underground Catholic Church in \nHebei province.\n  We met at dawn, for an outdoor Mass with many other believers. As we \nspoke and then prayed, the Bishop prayed for his persecutors, he prayed \nfor the misguided leaders of the Chinese Communist Party. Bishop Su's \nbody bore witness to the brutality of China's Communist Party. He was \nbeaten, starved, and tortured for this faith and spent some 40 years in \nprison. Yet, he prayed not just for the persecuted church, but for the \nconversion of those who hate, torture and kill. His witness and his \nfaith absolutely amazed me. Love those who hate you as Christ did from \nthe cross? Do good to those who persecute you? For Bishop Su these were \nmore than words, it was his faithful and faith filled response to one \nof our Lord's most difficult teaching. Unfortunately, only couple years \nlater Bishop Su was arrested again and disappeared. He has not been \nheard from since.\n  Over and over in the lives of these heroic witnesses, we see that the \neffort to stand up for the truth against the communists cost them a \ngreat deal. Sometimes it cost them everything but their lives--and \nalmost that too.\n  To follow in their footsteps, to remember the truth of what communism \nreally was and did, will cost us something too. We will have to \nremember that what was at stake with communism was not a question of \ncompeting economic systems or system of social organization, but the \nquestion of God--the human being deprived of any divine connection. \nThis will require us to swim upstream, against the dominant mentality. \nWe will have to think, and at times to speak and act, differently. And \nthis will not always be welcome.\n  We owe a profound debt of gratitude to the foundation and its \nsupporters, who have done so much to honor the memory of the victims of \ncommunism.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. SMITH of New Jersey", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 3}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "185", "extension": true, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "E1557-E1558", "wkday": "Monday", "day": "13", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "REMEMBERING THE VICTIMS OF COMMUNISM", "id": "CREC-2017-11-13-pt1-PgE1557-2", "title": "REMEMBERING THE VICTIMS OF COMMUNISM"}
