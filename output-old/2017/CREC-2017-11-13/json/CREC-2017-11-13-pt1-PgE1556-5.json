Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Vera Souza as she \ncelebrates 40 years of dedicated service to the Cabrillo Civics Club of \nCalifornia. It is both fitting and appropriate to honor Vera, who has \ndedicated much of her time preserving and advancing the Portuguese \nculture in the Central Valley and California.\n  LaVera Teixeira was born and raised in the Central Valley. Vera spent \nher career working for the Central Union School District in Kings \nCounty, California, as an administrator. She worked there from July 1, \n1961 to June 30, 1999. Vera retired and then worked part time for the \ndistrict until 2007, culminating a 46-year career.\n  Vera and her husband Bob Souza first joined the Kings County Cabrillo \nCivic Club No. 9 in 1960. The Cabrillo Civics Club of California is a \nservice organization dedicated to the progress of Californians of \nPortuguese descent. The club is named after John\n\n\nRodrigues Cabrillo, a Portuguese navigator and explorer, best known as \nthe first European to navigate the coast of present-day California. \nToday there are nine clubs statewide with over 1,975 members. The club \nmembers work tirelessly to ensure the preservation of the Portuguese \nculture, while engaging in service activities to benefit their local \ncommunities.\n  From the beginning, Vera's dedication to the club was evident. In \n1978 Vera became Kings County local club secretary and for one period \nserved as both secretary and president. During the 1990s Vera held \ndouble duty again, serving as local secretary and Cabrillo Club State \nsecretary from 1991 to 1994. Even after 40 years, Vera will stay on to \nserve as an active board member for the state and local Kings County \nCabrillo Club No. 9.\n  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing the \nachievements of Vera Souza. I congratulate Vera for her dedicated \nservice to the Cabrillo Club and ask that you join me in wishing her \ncontinued success and happiness.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. COSTA", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 3}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "185", "extension": true, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "E1556-E1557", "wkday": "Monday", "day": "13", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "RECOGNIZING THE SERVICE OF VERA SOUZA", "id": "CREC-2017-11-13-pt1-PgE1556-5", "title": "RECOGNIZING THE SERVICE OF VERA SOUZA"}
