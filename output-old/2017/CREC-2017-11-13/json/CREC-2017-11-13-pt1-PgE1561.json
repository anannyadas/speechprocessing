Mr. Speaker, today I honor my constituent Grant R. Ward. \nGrant is a resident of Gilbert, Arizona. He is receiving the Lifetime \nAchievement Award by the National Water Resources Association (NWRA).\n  This lifetime achievement award was established in 1948. According to \nthe NWRA, this award ``recognizes members and individuals who have \nactively served in the leadership of the Association for many years and \nwho, by their activities and service to the goals and objective of the \nAssociation, merit Life Member status.'' Grant embodies the spirit of \nthis distinguished award.\n  Grant has an impressive resume of service. He graduated from Brigham \nYoung University in 1967 and received his law degree in 1969 from the \nUniversity of Idaho. From there, he commenced his professional career, \nserving as an assistant branch manager at the Valley National Bank for \na few years. He then took a job as General Manager of the Roosevelt \nWater Conservation District for over a decade. Following this \noccupation, he progressed through several jobs, starting with Executive \nVice President of the Agri-Business Council of Arizona, Assistant \nGeneral Manager of the Central Arizona Water Conservation District, and \nGeneral Manager of the Maricopa-Stanfield Irrigation & Drainage \nDistrict. He currently is an independent water and power consultant.\n  Grant is married to Judy. They have seven children and 36 \ngrandchildren.\n  Mr. Speaker, Grant has a remarkable track record of service and \nperseverance in employment. He showed his children the value of hard \nwork and the necessity of pushing through each day to pay the bills. \nHis children now have his example to lean on as they demonstrate \nsimilar work ethics to their own children.\n  However, Grant's service didn't simply stop with his paycheck. He was \nextremely involved with his community--and still is today. Grant has \nsat on several boards and presided over several clubs and committees in \nArizona. Grant looks for any possible way to give back to his \ncommunity.\n  I applaud Grant for his award, and I look forward to his continued \nservice.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. BIGGS", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 3}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "185", "extension": true, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "E1561", "wkday": "Monday", "day": "13", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "HONORING GRANT R.
