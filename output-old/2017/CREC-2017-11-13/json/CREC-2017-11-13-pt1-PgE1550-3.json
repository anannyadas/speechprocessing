Mr. Speaker, I rise to support H.R. 2123, the \nVeterans E-Health and Telemedicine Support Act of 2017. This \nlegislation would allow the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) \nhealth professionals to practice telemedicine across state borders if \nthey are qualified and practice within the scope of their authorized \nfederal duties. Under current law, VA doctors can only provide \ntelehealth treatment across state lines if the veteran and the doctor \nare located in federal facilities. The VETS Act of 2017 removes these \nbarriers and allows VA physicians to provide treatment without a \nlocation restriction. Veterans will no longer be required to travel to \na VA facility, but rather can receive telemedicine treatment from \nanywhere, including their home or a community center.\n  In this technologically advanced age, there is no excuse for us to \nwithhold support from veterans. Telemedicine allows qualified \npractitioners to reach veterans even in the most remote areas. \nCurrently, location requirements make it difficult for veterans--\nespecially those struggling with mental health issues--to get the help \nthey need and deserve. H.R. 2123 will ensure that our veterans can \nobtain the best care possible regardless of where they are in the \nUnited States. I fully support H.R. 2123 to make lifesaving resources \neasily accessible for the veterans who have dutifully served our \ncountry\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia", "itemno": 3}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 4}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "185", "extension": true, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "E1550", "wkday": "Monday", "day": "13", "month": "November"}, "related_bills": [{"type": "HR", "context": "OTHER", "congress": "115", "number": "2123"}], "doc_title": "VETERANS E-HEALTH AND TELEMEDICINE SUPPORT ACT Of 2017", "id": "CREC-2017-11-13-pt1-PgE1550-3"}
