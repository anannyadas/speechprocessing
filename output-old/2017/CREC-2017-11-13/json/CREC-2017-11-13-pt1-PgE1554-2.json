Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 918, \nthe Veteran Urgent Access to Mental Healthcare Act. H.R. 918 directs \nthe Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to provide mental health care \nservices to former members of the Armed Forces.\n  Mental health services would be administered to veterans immediately \nafter their discharge, release, or deployment, and would continue as \nlong as necessary. These services would be excluded from those who \nreceived a dishonorable or bad conduct discharge from the Armed \nServices. H.R. 918 would also permit the VA to provide mental health \nservices at a non-VA facility if necessary, eliminating the barrier to \ntreatment for so many rural veterans who are geographically isolated \nfrom VA facilities.\n  It is imperative that the VA helps the men and women who served our \ncountry when they return home. Not all injuries received by our \nveterans are visible but that does not mean they do not exist. Many \nveterans return home with mental health conditions and we need to \naccommodate them so they can get the treatment they need. This is why I \nsupport this legislation and encourage my colleagues to do so as well.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 3}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "185", "extension": true, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "E1554", "wkday": "Monday", "day": "13", "month": "November"}, "related_bills": [{"type": "HR", "context": "OTHER", "congress": "115", "number": "918"}], "doc_title": "VETERAN URGENT ACCESS TO MENTAL HEALTHCARE ACT", "id": "CREC-2017-11-13-pt1-PgE1554-2"}
