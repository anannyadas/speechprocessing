Mr. Speaker, today I recognize Stephanie Farmer of \nDelaware County, Pennsylvania, for her service to the United States and \nher local community.\n  Ms. Farmer honorably served our country in the U.S. Air Force. \nFollowing her service, she returned home to Delaware County to teach. \nShe brought enthusiasm to the classroom that had a tremendous impact on \nthe students she taught. After years of teaching Ms. Farmer was asked \nto accept the Assistant Principal position at Tinicum School in \nEssington. In this capacity, she has become known as a devoted, caring \neducator who pushes her students to be their best.\n  One particular area in which Ms. Farmer challenges her students is \nreading. She intensified the focus on her school's Summer Reading \nProgram--which challenges grade schools to read the most books over \ntheir summer break. Thanks to her devotion, her students consistently \nlead other elementary schools in this competition.\n  Her passion for learning and the energy she brings to school has \nproven infectious. Her efforts have helped her students gain more from \ntheir education than what they otherwise would have.\n  I commend Ms. Stephanie Farmer for her life of service to her \nstudents, community, and country. I wish her and her students much \ncontinued success\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. MEEHAN", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 3}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "185", "extension": true, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "E1551", "wkday": "Monday", "day": "13", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "IN RECOGNITION OF STEPHANIE FARMER", "id": "CREC-2017-11-13-pt1-PgE1551-2", "title": "IN RECOGNITION OF STEPHANIE FARMER"}
