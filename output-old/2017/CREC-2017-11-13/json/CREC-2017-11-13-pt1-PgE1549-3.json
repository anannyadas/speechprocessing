Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate the \nretirement of Mr. Ray Shook. Mr. Shook is an outstanding individual who \nhas served as the Executive Director of the American Welding Society \nsince 2002.\n   Mr. Shook's retirement closes the chapter of a forty-four year \nassociation with the welding industry. Prior to his tenure with the \nAmerican Welding Society, Mr. Shook served on the Board of Directors \nand as Vice President of the International Institute of Welding for \nfive years. He spent twenty five years working his way up at Hobart \nBrothers Company and reached the position of President at the Hobart \nInstitute of Welding Technology, which is the world's largest welding \ntraining organization.\n   Under his leadership, the American Welding Society experienced \nsignificant changes. With membership reaching over 73,000, revenues \nsteadily increased from $15 million to more than $40 million annually. \nHe was instrumental in establishing North America's largest annual \nmetalwork exhibition by forging an alliance with FABTECH. The Society \nalso expanded globally, achieving its first acquisition in its ninety-\nfive year history through its purchase of Weldmex in 2007. Throughout \nhis tenure, the American Welding Society continued to grow and acquire \nadditional global holdings.\n   Having known Mr. Shook for a number of years, I know that he has \nconsistently demonstrated the highest degree of integrity. He has been \ndedicated to his profession and has worked tirelessly to advance the \nSociety's mission of globally advancing the science and technology of \nwelding. His work ethic, loyalty, and service to the welding industry \ncannot be understated.\n   Mr. Speaker, I am honored to pay tribute to my friend, Mr. Ray \nShook, for his impressive career in the welding industry, and I ask my \ncolleagues to join me in recognizing this remarkable individual.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. DIAZ-BALART", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 3}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "185", "extension": true, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "E1549", "wkday": "Monday", "day": "13", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "COMMEMORATING THE RETIREMENT OF MR.
