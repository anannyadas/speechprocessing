Serving 20 consecutive years at the \nhelm, he will retire next month. Friends and colleagues will gather \nthis week to celebrate Hank's years of dedication.\n  Under Hank's leadership, enrollment in CPI's secondary career and \ntechnical education programs have grown significantly.

Scores of \nstudents in the Commonwealth have earned a career in technical \neducation thanks to Hank's vision to grow CPI into the institution it \nis today.\n\n  Mr. Speaker, there has been no greater champion for CPI than Hank \nYeagley for the past two decades, earning him the title of Mr. CPI \namong faculty, staff, administrators, as well as past and present \nstudents alike.
