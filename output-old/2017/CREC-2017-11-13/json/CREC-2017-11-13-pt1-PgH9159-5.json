Mr. Speaker, this week is American Education Week, a time \nto celebrate our public education system.\n  The public education system is one of this Nation's greatest \naccomplishments. In classrooms from Newark, New Jersey, to Nome, \nAlaska, public schools train a new generation of world leaders, bridge \nbuilders, first responders, artists, doctors, plumbers, and CEOs.\n  Children in this country--all of them--have a right to a high-quality \neducation.\n  It is a sad state of affairs that we have a U.S. Secretary of \nEducation who continues to tilt the board against children whose way up \nis through public education.\n  During American Education Week, I call on my colleagues to stop using \npublic schools as a political bargaining chip. Let's put public schools \nback together and back to work for the next generation of leaders.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. PAYNE", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "185", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H9159", "wkday": "Monday", "day": "13", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "AMERICAN EDUCATION WEEK", "id": "CREC-2017-11-13-pt1-PgH9159-5", "title": "AMERICAN EDUCATION WEEK"}
