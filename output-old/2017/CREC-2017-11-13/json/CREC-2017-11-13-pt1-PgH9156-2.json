He is going to be a fine addition \nto our body. I look forward to it.\n  As he has taken the place of Jason Chaffetz, he is going to be in Mr. \nChaffetz's office.\n  I just want you to know, as you are getting settled in and before you \nfind your proper bed, I think I can get you a good deal on a used cot.\n  I am pleased to yield to the gentleman from Utah (Mr. Curtis), our \nnew Representative.", "turn": 1, "speaker": "Mr. BISHOP of Utah", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "None", "text": "  Mr. CURTIS.
