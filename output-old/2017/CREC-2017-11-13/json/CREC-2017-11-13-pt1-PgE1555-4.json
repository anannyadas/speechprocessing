Mr. Speaker, I rise to support H.R. 2601, the \nVeterans Increased Choice for Transplanted Organs and Recovery (VICTOR) \nAct of 2017. This is an important piece of legislation and I am pleased \nto support it.\n  The Veterans Health Administration has provided solid organ \ntransplants since 1962 and bone marrow transplants since 1982. \nCurrently, there are fourteen locations across the country that provide \nthese services. However, if a veteran does not live near one of these \nfacilities, the difficulty of travel could prevent veterans from \ngetting the medical care they need. Also, even if veterans are able to \nget to a facility, they still face the risk of getting waitlisted. We \nneed to provide more options to veterans who require life-saving organ \ntransplant operations. H.R. 2601 provides the solution to this problem \nby amending the Veterans Access, Choice, and Accountability Act of 2014 \nto allow eligible veterans to receive health care from any facility \nwhich is related to the Department of Defense, the Indian Health \nService, federal health centers, or any other health-care provider who \nparticipates in the Medicare program. The conditions of this program \napply to veterans who need an organ transplant operation, live more \nthan 100 miles from a Veterans Affair transplant center, and need care \nrelated to an upcoming transplant.\n  Since the closest Veterans Affairs transplant center to my district \nin Georgia is almost 150 miles away in Birmingham, Alabama, this bill \nwould have a major impact for the nearly 45,000 veterans who live in my \ndistrict. Should anyone require a transplant surgery, they would first \nbe able to explore their options in Atlanta instead of being forced to \ntravel to a different state, which is why I support H.R. 2601.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia", "itemno": 3}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 4}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "185", "extension": true, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "E1555", "wkday": "Monday", "day": "13", "month": "November"}, "related_bills": [{"type": "HR", "context": "OTHER", "congress": "115", "number": "2601"}], "doc_title": "VETERANS INCREASED CHOICE FOR TRANSPLANTED ORGANS AND RECOVERY ACT OF 2017", "id": "CREC-2017-11-13-pt1-PgE1555-4"}
