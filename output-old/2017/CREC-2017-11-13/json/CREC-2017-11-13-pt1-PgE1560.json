Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the extraordinary \npublic service of Elaine Roberts on the occasion of her retirement. \nElaine has spent the last 17 years in Columbus and Central Ohio, \nserving as the Executive Director of the Columbus Airport Authority \nbeginning in 2000 and then as President and CEO of the Columbus \nRegional Airport Authority when it was created in 2003.\n  Our regional airport authority oversees three air facilities: John \nGlenn Columbus International Airport, Rickenbacker International \nAirport, and the general aviation airport, Bolton Field. Those three \nairports, and the businesses associated with them, have flourished \nunder Elaine's leadership and now collectively support 54,000 jobs and \n$6.6 billion in total annual economic output. I greatly appreciate the \nwork she has done to encourage entrepreneurship in the airports, \nparticularly for African-American businesses.\n  During her tenure, Elaine oversaw $1 billion of investment in airport \nimprovements, including the terminal modernization at John Glenn \nInternational and a new control tower at Rickenbacker. I am also \nthankful for Elaine's contribution in honoring Jerrie Mock--a fellow-\nOhioan and the first woman to fly solo around the world in her plane, \nthe Spirit of Columbus--with a life-size statue in the main passenger \nconcourse.\n  From the very beginning, Central Ohio has played a leading role to \nadvances in aviation, and we are particularly proud of Elaine who stood \nout as one of the leading women in her field. She was recognized as a \n``Champion of Change'' by the White House in 2015 and won the 2016 \nDistinguished Service Award from the American Association of Airport \nExecutives. Earlier this year, the YWCA honored her with its Women of \nAchievement Award, and the Women for Economic and Leadership \nDevelopment presented her with their Riveter Award. Elaine also serves \non the board of the Columbus Partnership and Experience Columbus.\n  Elaine has been a steadfast leader over the years, and I am happy to \ncall her a friend. On behalf of the people of Columbus, I thank her and \nwish her the best.\n  After 35 years in the aviation industry, Elaine plans to retire to \nSouth Carolina by the end of the year. I sincerely hope that she and \nher wife, Dale, will travel back to Columbus from time to time to visit \nand to see her lasting, positive impact on our community.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mrs. BEATTY", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 3}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "185", "extension": true, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "E1560", "wkday": "Monday", "day": "13", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "RECOGNIZING ELAINE ROBERT ON HER RETIREMENT", "id": "CREC-2017-11-13-pt1-PgE1560", "title": "RECOGNIZING ELAINE ROBERT ON HER RETIREMENT"}
