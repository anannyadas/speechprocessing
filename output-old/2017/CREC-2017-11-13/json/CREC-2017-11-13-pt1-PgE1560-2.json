Mr. Speaker, I rise to commend the Fairfax County \nHistory Commission and to congratulate the recipients of the 2017 \nAchievement Awards.\n  The Fairfax County History Commission was established in 1969 to help \nidentify, document, record, and preserve the county's rich historic \npast. Fairfax County was founded in 1742 by Lord Thomas Fairfax and his \ncousin, William Fairfax and is celebrating its 275th anniversary. \nEarlier this year, the current Lord and Lady Fairfax traveled from the \nUnited Kingdom to participate in the celebration of this milestone. \nEach year the Commission bestows awards to local residents or \norganizations that have contributed to the preservation of our history. \nIt is my honor to include in the Record the names of the following 2017 \naward recipients:\n  The 2017 Distinguished Service Award is being presented to Melanie \nManikas and Mary Ellen Zavaleta in recognition of their efforts in \npreserving, researching and maintaining the history of Burke, Virginia \nby involving the Cherry Run Elementary School fourth grade classes of \n2015 in creating, composing and executing a video on this topic. The \ndocumentation and preservation of this information in an enlightening \nand entertaining video will be helpful for historians, students and the \ngeneral citizenry of Fairfax County for generations to come.\n  The Nan Netherton Achievement Award is being presented to Nathaniel \nLee for his research, documentation, authoring and chronicling of the \nhistory of the Richmond, Fredericksburg and Potomac Railroad in his \nbook, ``The Iron Road of Franconia''. This railroad connected the area \nof Franconia, Virginia to the remainder of Virginia and Washington. Its \nexistence encouraged connections to multiple areas outside Northern \nVirginia--allowing the growth of commerce, dissemination of \ncommunication and passenger travel to points beyond Fairfax County.\n  The Mary Fehringer Award is being presented to the Bull Run Civil War \nRound Table (BRCWRT) for their 25th Silver Anniversary Commemorative \nPublication. This fine catalogue documents their twenty-five years of \neducational contributions to Fairfax County and beyond via their \nmonthly, well-attended (100+ guests) meetings. In addition, the Bull \nRun Civil War Round Table has been host to over 293 lectures and 128 \ntours, and has assisted in the placement of over 70 historical marker/\nkiosk panels, which were supported by BRCWRT or authored by its \nmembership.\n  Mr. Speaker, I ask that my colleagues join me in commending the \nFairfax County History Commission for their extraordinary efforts to \npreserve and protect the history of Fairfax County and in \ncongratulating the recipients of the 2017 achievement awards. Their \ndedication will ensure that the history of Fairfax County is available \nfor generations to come.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. CONNOLLY", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 3}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "185", "extension": true, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "E1560", "wkday": "Monday", "day": "13", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "IN RECOGNITION OF THE FAIRFAX COUNTY HISTORY COMMISSION AND THE RECIPIENTS OF THE 2017 ACHIEVEMENT AWARDS", "id": "CREC-2017-11-13-pt1-PgE1560-2", "title": "IN RECOGNITION OF THE FAIRFAX COUNTY HISTORY COMMISSION AND THE  RECIPIENTS OF THE 2017 ACHIEVEMENT AWARDS"}
