Mr. Speaker, many times, the American people wonder \nabout the correlation between the work that we do here. As a member of \nthe Budget Committee, I can tell them that the tax bill that is about \nto move through this House--the Republican Trump tax bill--will bring \nabout $1.41 trillion in revenue decreases in discretionary spending, \nwhich means cuts in their Medicare and Medicaid.\n\n\n  Why do they want to do this?\n  They want to do this so that they can compound the injury to those \nwho need a mortgage deduction, which will be eliminated for any home \nthat you buy in the future.\n  If you have medical expenses, that will be eliminated. You will not \nbe able to deduct that, whether you are a young family with a \ncatastrophic illness or a senior citizen.\n  Then those of you who are trying to increase your opportunities for \nthe future--help your children--you will not be able to deduct student \nloan interest, tuition, and other education expenses.\n  Elections matter, but actions matter. This tax bill is a crippling, \ndevastating bill, and it will create the complete opposite of what \nRepublicans say they believe in--a huge deficit, with a huge debt, on \nthe backs of the American people. Vote ``no'' on this tax bill.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Ms. JACKSON LEE", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "185", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H9159-H9160", "wkday": "Monday", "day": "13", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "TAX BILL", "id": "CREC-2017-11-13-pt1-PgH9159-6", "title": "TAX BILL"}
