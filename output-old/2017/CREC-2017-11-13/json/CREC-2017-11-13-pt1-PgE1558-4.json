Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize dedicated \nindividuals of the Fountain Brothers American Legion Post 1619 who are \nworking to reduce the prevalence of hepatitis C among Vietnam Era \nveterans.\n  Vietnam Era veterans are at a significantly higher risk for hepatitis \nC infection than the general population due to dangerous health \npractices applied to service members before the virus was discovered. \nConsequently, many veterans continue to die as a result of \ncomplications from hepatitis C.\n  Due to scientific breakthroughs, hepatitis C is now easily diagnosed \nand largely curable. To ensure that all Vietnam Era veterans receive \nproper testing and follow up care, the Fountain Brothers American \nLegion Post 1619 in my district has been holding regular outreach \ntesting events with the local VA. Post 1619 has tested over 1,200 \nveterans in the past year, providing the first step for diagnosis and \npotential life-saving treatment.\n  On behalf of New York's 21st District, I want to recognize the work \nthat the members of\n\n\nPost 1619 have accomplished and thank them for their dedication to our \nveterans. Those who serve deserve the respect of a grateful nation, and \nthe hard work of Post 1619 represents an important step in the right \ndirection.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Ms. STEFANIK", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 3}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "185", "extension": true, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "E1558-E1559", "wkday": "Monday", "day": "13", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "RECOGNIZING THE WORK OF FOUNTAIN BROTHERS AMERICAN LEGION POST 1619", "id": "CREC-2017-11-13-pt1-PgE1558-4", "title": "RECOGNIZING THE WORK OF FOUNTAIN BROTHERS AMERICAN LEGION POST 1619"}
