Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate the 20th \nanniversary of the opening of the University of Texas at San Antonio's \nDowntown Campus, which has since empowered its many students and alumni \nto pursue excellence both in academics and their careers.\n  In September of 1991, the UTSA Strategic Plan established UTSA \nDowntown. In 1993, with the support of the Texas State Government, the \nSouth Texas Border Initiative was launched, allotting $20 million \ndollars for the UTSA Downtown Campus. With the acquisition of the \nFiesta Plaza site gifted by Bill Miller Bar-B-Q Enterprises, and the \ngroundbreaking of Frio Street Building in 1995, UTSA's Downtown Campus \nlocation was realized.\n  Following the subsequent groundbreakings of additional buildings, in \n2000, UTSA opened its doors to its first college based in the Downtown \nCampus: the College of Urban Programs, now the College of Public \nPolicy. In 2002, The College of Architecture would become the second \ncollege based in the Downtown Campus.\n  In the spring of 2004, UTSA expanded its campus from 11 acres to 18 \nacres with the acquisition of the Cattleman Square parking lot and \nnearby land later used for additional buildings. Since its inception, \nthe campus has expanded to include two colleges, four academic \nbuildings, and two departments in a third college.\n  With a current enrollment of 4,000 students at the downtown campus, \nThe University of Texas at San Antonio continues to be an exemplary \ninstitution serving the needs of those pursuing a high quality \neducation and successful careers in the downtown San Antonio area.\n  As a former chairman of the Subcommittee on Education for the Texas \nLegislature's Appropriations Committee, who worked to secure tuition \nrevenue funding and other state funding for this university, it has \nbeen good to see it grow and develop. In addition, as the author of \nHouse Bill 713, that created Texas' grant program, it is good to see \nstudents at UTSA take advantage of this program. It is clear that this \nuniversity will continue to thrive and I look forward to many more \nyears of continued success.\n  Mr. Speaker, I am honored to have the opportunity to recognize the \n20th anniversary of the University of Texas at San Antonio.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. CUELLAR", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 3}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "185", "extension": true, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "E1556", "wkday": "Monday", "day": "13", "month": "November"}, "related_bills": [{"type": "HR", "context": "OTHER", "congress": "115", "number": "713"}], "doc_title": "IN RECOGNITION OF UTSA", "id": "CREC-2017-11-13-pt1-PgE1556-4"}
