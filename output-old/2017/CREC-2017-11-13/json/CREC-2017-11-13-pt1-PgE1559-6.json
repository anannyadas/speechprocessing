Mr. Speaker, I rise to support H.R. 3949, the \nVeterans Apprenticeship and Labor Opportunity Reform (VALOR) Act. H.R. \n3949 aims to increase access to apprenticeship training programs for \nveterans.\n  Currently, apprenticeship programs are registered state-by-state, \ncreating a cumbersome paper trail and bureaucratic barriers to opening \nnew programs. This legislation aims to streamline this registration \nprocess to ensure that veterans have access to as many apprenticeship \ntraining programs as possible.\n  It is crucial that returning veterans have the skills to join the \nworkforce, and apprenticeship programs are a great way to ensure that \nthese\n\n\nheroic men and women are prepared to rejoin civilian life. H.R. 3949 \nwill strengthen accessibility to these programs, which is why I am \npleased to support this legislation.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 3}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "185", "extension": true, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "E1559-E1560", "wkday": "Monday", "day": "13", "month": "November"}, "related_bills": [{"type": "HR", "context": "OTHER", "congress": "115", "number": "3949"}], "doc_title": "VETERANS APPRENTICESHIP AND LABOR OPPORTUNITY REFORM ACT", "id": "CREC-2017-11-13-pt1-PgE1559-6"}
