Mr. Speaker, both House and Senate \nRepublicans have introduced separate plans to update the U.S. federal \ntax code. Proponents have long argued that the federal tax code is \noverdue for an overhaul that will incentivize businesses to create \njobs, while opponents feel that the existing proposals do not go far \nenough for middle- and lower-income families.\n  It has been 31 years since Congress passed its last major tax reform \noverhaul known as the 1986 Tax Reform Act, signed into law by President \nReagan. Since that time, the tax code has continued to grow more \nintricate in response to the complexities that accompany globalization \nand the unique challenges that we face in a 21st Century economy. While \nI agree that a modern tax code is desperately needed to help shore up \nfunding for critical infrastructure projects, scientific research, and \neducation, the Republican tax plan falls short of helping to address \nthese dire needs.\n  The current plan introduced in the House will expose an estimated 38 \nmillion middle class households to increased taxes, while \nsimultaneously reducing the tax liability for some of our wealthiest \ncorporations. The bill proposes disastrous cuts to Medicare & Medicaid, \nwhich many seniors and underprivileged Americans rely on for medical \ncare. The plan also eliminates many tax deductions that are favorable \nto middle class Americans, such as the medical expense deduction, \nstudent loan interest deductions, and the state and local Tax \ndeduction. Despite all of these reductions, the House Republican plan \nwill cost the American people $1.7 trillion dollars over the next 10 \nyears in order to pay for tax cuts for corporations and wealthy \nAmericans.\n  Mr. Speaker, I believe that many of my colleagues will agree that we \nare due for a major reform of our tax code. However, we must be \nextremely careful not to do so at the expense of millions of middle and \nlower class Americans who are already struggling to get by. An \nincreasingly globalized economy means that we will need to delicately \nbalance our national interests against our ability to compete overseas. \nHowever, the current tax reform plans in the House and Senate must do \nmore to protect American workers, their families, and the critical \nsocial programs on which they depend.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 3}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "185", "extension": true, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "E1558", "wkday": "Monday", "day": "13", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "REPUBLICAN TAX PLAN", "id": "CREC-2017-11-13-pt1-PgE1558-2", "title": "REPUBLICAN TAX PLAN"}
