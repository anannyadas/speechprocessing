Mr. Speaker, I rise to congratulate Paul Fogelberg from \nOrono, Minnesota, on receiving the EveryLife Foundation for Rare \nDisease's RareVoice Abbey Award from the EveryLife Foundation.\n  No one, Mr. Speaker, deserves this recognition more than Paul because \nof his tireless work on behalf of those suffering from pulmonary \nfibrosis, a disease that stiffens and scars the deep tissue in the \nlungs, making it increasingly difficult to breath until eventually you \ndie.\n  Every year, more than 14,000 people die from the disease, essentially \nthe same number of people who die from breast cancer.\n  Paul himself has pulmonary fibrosis and is a strong advocate for \nresearch, for awareness, and for more clinical trials to help those who \nhave contracted this deadly disease. There is no known cure for \npulmonary fibrosis, yet Paul is a fighter, a leader, and a great \nadvocate who is doing all he can to find one.\n  Congratulations again to Paul Fogelberg for being recognized as the \nEveryLife Foundation for Rare Disease's RareVoice Abbey Award.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. PAULSEN", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "185", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H9158", "wkday": "Monday", "day": "13", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "RECOGNIZING PAUL FOGELBERG", "id": "CREC-2017-11-13-pt1-PgH9158", "title": "RECOGNIZING PAUL FOGELBERG"}
