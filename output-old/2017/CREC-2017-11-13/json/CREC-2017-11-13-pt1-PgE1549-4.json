Mr. Speaker, I rise to celebrate the 100th Anniversary of \nTrinity Baptist Church. Founded on November 11, 1917 as a Sunday school \ngroup of three adults and fifteen children, Trinity Baptist has grown \ninto an abundant congregation, housed on a church campus that includes \na lovely sanctuary, built in 1962 and designed by renowned African \nAmerican architect Paul Williams.\n   Rev. Alvin Tunstill, Jr. is the ninth pastor to lead the \ncongregation and only the fourth senior pastor in the last 80 years. \nUnder his leadership, ten clergy members and a cadre of deacons, \ndeaconesses and other lay leaders serve the congregation.\n   Clergy, staff and volunteers oversee a wealth of ministries, \nincluding those that focus on women; fitness, health, and wellness; a \nhot lunch program; homelessness outreach; summer youth employment; and \neducation, including college scholarships. Church programs aim to build \nlasting bonds of service between members of the church, and they play \nan important role in making resources available to the mainly African-\nAmerican congregation and to the surrounding Jefferson Park \nneighborhood of South Los Angeles.\n   Today, Trinity has partnerships with national organizations like the \nAmerican Cancer Society, and it has sponsored sister organizations, \nincluding the Trinity Community Development Corporation, in order to \ntackle issues ranging from obesity to computer illiteracy and to pursue \nsolutions like affordable housing to gang prevention.\n   Commitment to its faith has helped to guide the Trinity Baptist \ncommunity in its mission of service for a century now. I applaud the \nstrong bonds that knit this community together, and I wish the \ncongregation, both leaders and flock, the very best as it embarks on \nthe church's second century.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Ms. BASS", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 3}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "185", "extension": true, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "E1549", "wkday": "Monday", "day": "13", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "CELEBRATING THE CENTENNIAL OF TRINITY BAPTIST CHURCH", "id": "CREC-2017-11-13-pt1-PgE1549-4", "title": "CELEBRATING THE CENTENNIAL OF TRINITY BAPTIST CHURCH"}
