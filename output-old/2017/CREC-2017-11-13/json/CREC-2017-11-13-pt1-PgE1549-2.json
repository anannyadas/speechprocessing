Mr. Speaker, I rise today to officially recognize the \noutstanding public achievement of my constituent Miles David Moore. Mr. \nMoore is a reporter for Crain Communications Inc., the author of three \nbooks of poetry and the Film Critic for Scene4.\n   I take this time to recognize Mr. Moore for his outstanding \nleadership and commitment to the IOTA Poetry Series. Begun in March \n1994, sadly, September 10 was the last poetry performance at IOTA. In \ntotal, 275 readings covering countless themes occurred in the IOTA \nPoetry Series. Missing only two readings in all that time--one because \nof an ice storm, and another because of a water-main break--the \nperformances were a critical part of the Arlington fabric of \nhumanities, and Mr. Moore was a critical tie that bound the series to \nthe community.\n   Along with Mr. Moore, IOTA owners Stephen Negrey and Jane Negrey-\nInge deserve tremendous credit for their commitment to the series which \nbrought so much emotional and intellectual pleasure to so many in \nArlington.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. BEYER", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 3}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "185", "extension": true, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "E1549", "wkday": "Monday", "day": "13", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "HONORING MILES DAVID MOORE", "id": "CREC-2017-11-13-pt1-PgE1549-2", "title": "HONORING MILES DAVID MOORE"}
