Mr. Speaker, I rise to support H.R. 1133, the \nVeterans Transplant Coverage Act. This legislation enables the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs (VA) to provide organ transplants for \nveterans, even if the live donor is a non-veteran, at the facility of \ntheir choice. Current law restricts coverage for veterans receiving an \norgan donation from a non-veteran. This policy means that children, \nsiblings, and other non-veteran family members that are matches and \nwilling to donate are not eligible to receive VA care for the \noperation.\n  The Veterans Transplant Coverage Act was inspired by the Nelson \nfamily from Texas. When veteran Charles Nelson needed a kidney \ntransplant, his son, Austin, was a match. When it came time for the \noperation, the VA healthcare system denied the Nelsons coverage because \nAustin was a non-veteran. The VA's decision forced the Nelsons to \nsolicit donations to ensure that Charles could still have this \nlifesaving transplant surgery. The Veterans Transplant Coverage Act \nwill ensure that no other American hero is denied transplant coverage \never again.\n  The restrictions set forth by our current law have life or death \nconsequences for the men and women that have bravely served our nation. \nI fully support H.R. 1133 to allow the VA to provide organ transplants \nfor veterans when the living donor is a non-veteran.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 3}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "185", "extension": true, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "E1552", "wkday": "Monday", "day": "13", "month": "November"}, "related_bills": [{"type": "HR", "context": "OTHER", "congress": "115", "number": "1133"}], "doc_title": "VETERANS TRANSPLANT COVERAGE ACT OF 2017", "id": "CREC-2017-11-13-pt1-PgE1552"}
