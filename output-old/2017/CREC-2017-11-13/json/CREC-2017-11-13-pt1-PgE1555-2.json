Derr served our \ncountry in the U.S. Air Force for two decades during which he received \nmany honors and awards.\n  Lt. Col. Derr decided to commission into the Air Force after \nreceiving his teaching certificate. His mentor, Samuel Gundy--World War \nII bomber pilot, POW, and esteemed naturalist, was a major influence in \nthe future Lt. Col.'s life and his decision to join the military. This \ndecision began an illustrious 20 year career of service to our nation.\n  Lt. Col. Derr quickly became known for his keen operational and \nscientific talents during his tours of duty in Europe. Here he received \nDistinguished Graduate honors at the prestigious NATO School in \nOberammergau, Germany. Upon returning home, the Lt. Col. was selected \nto be an instructor on weapons of mass destruction at the Interservice \nNuclear Weapons School. He would go on to again be awarded the \nDistinguished Graduate Honors while at the Technical Instructor School. \nEventually, he was named top instructor for the Technical Training \nGroup in 1990.\n  Since retiring from the Air Force, Lt. Col. Derr has continued his \ndedication to our country and those who have served it by directing the \nDepartment of Veteran Affairs for Berks County. In this capacity he \nworks to ensure the county's 27,000 veterans have access to the \ndepartment's many services and benefits.\n  I commend Lt. Col.
