Mr. Speaker, today I recognize Colonel George C. \nCressman, Jr., of Montgomery County, Pennsylvania. Colonel Cressman \nserved the United States honorably for 33 years as an Army Reservist. \nIn that time, the Colonel deployed to Haiti, Iraq, and Kuwait. Though \nhe recently retired from the Army Reserves, Colonel Cressman remains an \nactive former president of the Society of American Military Engineers, \nand continues to serve his community of North Wales, Pennsylvania.\n  The Colonel devotes much of his free time to helping others. Often, \nhis efforts focus on the community's youth. He's organized scholarship \nfundraisers for students in the Reserve Officer Training Corps, mentors \nmilitary college cadets, and even lectures at local universities. This \nguidance and philanthropy has helped open the door to opportunities for \nmany.\n  But Colonel Cressman devotion to his community goes beyond helping \nstudents. He regularly participates in fundraisers to raise money in \nthe fight against Multiple Sclerosis and to help his fellow \nPennsylvania veterans.\n  Colonel Cressman's actions speak louder than any letter. He is a \nproven servant to his community and country. Both are much better off \nhaving Colonel George C. Cressman, Jr. be a part of them. I thank him \nfor all his service.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. MEEHAN", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 3}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "185", "extension": true, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "E1550", "wkday": "Monday", "day": "13", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "IN RECOGNITION OF COLONEL GEORGE C.
