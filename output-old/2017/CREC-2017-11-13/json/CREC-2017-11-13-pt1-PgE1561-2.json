Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remember the life of Staff \nSergeant Emil Rivera-Lopez, 31, from Tucson, Arizona. He was tragically \nkilled on August 25 when his helicopter crashed during a training \nmission off the coast of Yemen.\n  SSgt Rivera-Lopez was born in San Juan, Puerto Rico. He enlisted in \nthe Army in 2006 as a helicopter maintainer, quickly distinguishing \nhimself. He was selected for service in the prestigious 160th Special \nOperations Aviation Regiment in 2013. He was decorated many times for \nhis service in Afghanistan and several other locations in the Global \nWar on Terror.\n  SSgt Rivera-Lopez leaves behind his wife Amanda Rivera, a 13 year-old \nstepson, Master William Sanderson, Jr., his mother Carlita Lopez, and \nhis father Eduvigis Rivera. It is my sad duty to include in the Record \nthe name of Emil Rivera-Lopez for his faithful service to this country.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Ms. McSALLY", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "185", "extension": true, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "E1561", "wkday": "Monday", "day": "13", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "REMEMBERING THE LIFE OF STAFF SERGEANT EMIL RIVERA-LOPEZ", "id": "CREC-2017-11-13-pt1-PgE1561-2", "title": "REMEMBERING THE LIFE OF STAFF SERGEANT EMIL RIVERA-LOPEZ"}
