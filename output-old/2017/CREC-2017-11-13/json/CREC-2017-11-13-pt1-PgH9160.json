This is a very big deal, obviously. We \ndon't do tax reform that often. The last time we did tax reform was in \nthe early 1980s, and that was, obviously, something that was very \nbipartisan. This experience has not been bipartisan whatsoever, and we \nare concerned also about the effect that it is going to have on our \nconstituencies.\n  Mr. Speaker, I am going to open it up for Members to talk about \nwhatever it is that they would like to, but I did want to let you know \nthat the main topic was going to be tax reform.\n  Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative Payne for his participation again \nand for always participating in the CBC Special Order hours. We know \nthat these are very important. Our constituencies, again, want to hear \nhow we stand on these issues. They are getting a lot of press right \nnow. So I thank the gentleman very much for being here this evening.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Payne), my \nfriend and colleague.", "turn": 3, "speaker": "Mr. VEASEY", "itemno": 4}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "P000604", "text": "  Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman Veasey for hosting \ntonight's Special Order hour.\n  Mr. Speaker, we are here, as the gentleman from Texas has stated, to \ndiscuss many different issues that face the American people.\n  H.R. 1, which is interesting that it holds that number, because based \non what we see, that tax cut will only work for the top 1 percent, so \nwe feel that it is appropriate that it was designated H.R. 1.\n  Mr. Speaker, this tax bill, cut tax scam will devastate over a period \nof time the working class, people trying to move into the middle class, \nand middle class families. Eventually, some people might see a bit of a \ncut, but for most people, there will be an increase.\n  I do not understand why we continue to think that trickle-down \neconomics is going to work in this country. It has failed time and time \nagain. To give breaks to the most wealthy, somehow we feel that that is \ngoing to overflow and trickle and drip down to the middle class. \nSometimes a drip is very slow. We continue to wait for this economic \nequation to work one time in the country's history because, up to this \npoint, it has not worked.\n  Why would we not allow families to continue to deduct their interest \non student loans? Why?\n  Most of these families are fighting to get their children into \ncollege and have to take out loans.\n  What is it about the country that we need to tax those people?\n  Tell me why it is that they cannot deduct this interest.\n  Two of my sisters are teachers, both in education--one in alternative \nhigh school work and one a kindergarten teacher for 25 or 30 years. In \nkindergarten, you are looking to help a youngster become creative, find \ntheir gift. On many occasions, with the school not being able to supply \nthings, they would go to the educational stores and buy flashcards and \nbuy other items to enhance the children's education, out of their \npockets, out of their personal moneys.\n  Now you are going to say that they cannot deduct those expenses that \nthey are using to educate our children, our next leaders? Why?\n  Yet, if you go from a 75-foot yacht to a 100-foot yacht, you are \nallowed to deduct the difference. Why?\n  It absolutely makes no sense what we are doing with H.R. 1. It is a \nbillionaire's tax scam, and we need to make sure the American people \nunderstand that.\n  Secretary Mnuchin was on the talk shows on Sunday. He said: Well, we \ncan't promise everybody is going to get a tax break.\n  So they are even, finally, being honest about it.\n  Mr. Speaker, everybody might not benefit from this tax cut, but all \nof the people that they are interested in will benefit from this tax \ncut.\n  We need to be honest with the American people. We need true tax \nreform. My colleagues on this side of the aisle are ready to do that, \nbut the majority continues to stifle any bipartisanship that we can \nhave on this issue.\n  We need to move forward in a positive way for the American people. We \nneed to come together in this body to help the American people. We do \nnot need another tax cut for the rich.\n  In New Jersey--a State that only gets 77 cents back on the money that \nit pays to the Federal Government--for every dollar, we get 77 cents \nback in services. So we are subsidizing other States.\n\n\n  I heard today that West Virginia, for every dollar it sends, gets \nover $4 back.\n  Not to allow New Jersey's citizens and other subsidizing States--\nConnecticut, Maryland, New York--to have the tax break on State and \nlocal exemptions is almost like double taxing people.\n  I just am here to say that this is an issue that is very important to \nthe American people. They do need relief and they do need help, but we \nneed to do it in a bipartisan manner that makes sense for the entire \ncountry--not just the top 1 percent, but the entire Nation.\n  Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Veasey for his leadership on these Special \nOrder hours. He has demonstrated a gift in bringing issues to the \nAmerican people and to the country in a manner that is very even-\ntempered. Some of us get a little excited, but Mr. Veasey seems to be \nable to keep his composure and still be strong in his message, and I \napplaud him for that.", "turn": 4, "speaker": "Mr. PAYNE", "itemno": 5}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "V000131", "text": "  Mr. VEASEY.

Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Texas for \nhis leadership, his stewardship of these very special ways of \ncommunicating to the American people.\n  I just left a meeting on temporary protected status, so I will try to \nsummarize my remarks, because I think it is very important to join in \nthe Congressional Black Caucus Special Order.\n  Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the chairman, Mr. Richmond, and my \ncolleague Mr. Payne and my colleague Mr. Evans, who will join us in \nthat effort, because this is a way to communicate with our colleagues \nof the urgency of some of these issues.\n  So let me first of all take a moment that really gives me great \nconsternation, great concern, and that is that, as I said in my \nremarks, while the President was out of the country, that I will always \nwish him safe travels and safe return, but you have to think about how \nwe have turned the corner on the dignity of the Presidency when you \nhave to monitor the tweets or the words that are being said by that \nOffice when they are out of the country.\n  There is one point I have to make, because I am a product of the \nVoting Rights Act of 1965. Barbara Jordan was able to be the first \nAfrican American from Texas, since Reconstruction, elected to the \nUnited States Congress, along with Andy Young from Georgia, after the \nVoting Rights Act.\n  Mr. Speaker, there was nothing untoward. It was just simply allowing \none person one vote. Heretofore, in the Deep South and in the \nSouthwest, African Americans were denied the right to vote by \nsuppression, poll tax, and a number of tactics; but the Voting Rights \nAct eliminated or prevented, had to have preclearance, any \ndiscriminatory factor that could be raised that would keep minorities \nfrom voting, that one vote, one person.\n\n  It pains me to read the headlines: ``Trump Says He Believes Putin's \nElection Meddling Denials.''\n  I believe that it is important for people of goodwill, for Members of \nthe United States Congress, to denounce these comments and to ask for \nthe dignity of this Office to really put Americans first and put this \nNation first, because that is not what is being done.\n  All of the intelligence agencies, 17 plus, have indicated that not \nonly did they influence, they intruded, they skewed the election. They \ndidn't just meddle. You cannot ask a former KGB officer to tell you \nthat he didn't meddle in our elections. Elections matter.\n  This is no comment on who won or lost. This is a comment on reality. \nThe elections were skewed to one person, and it was confirmed by the \nintelligence agencies, and it is time for the highest Office to speak \non behalf of the American people.\n  That brings me right to the Trump tax cuts, the Republican tax cuts. \nI spoke earlier during 1 minutes to try and correlate between tax cuts \nand the needs of the American people.\n  These major tax cuts will offer more benefits to corporations, which, \nby the way, are having their biggest season of profits that we have \never had. They are succeeding beyond imagination. They have not only \nstock prices going up, but the profits that they are able to stock away \nare going up.\n  Take that in the backdrop of this tax bill, having to cut and violate \nthe Medicare trust fund and Medicaid in order to find the dollars to be \nable to give the top 1 percent the greatest tax cut and to give \ncorporations a 20 percent tax cut in the United States and a 12 percent \ntax cut overseas, which, in addition to giving them that money on the \ncorporate rates, which is a reasonable thing to discuss, but by the \ninequity of the lower amount being overseas, you can imagine that jobs \nare still going to leave and go overseas.\n  This is a tax cut that is made for the basket, if you will, of \ngoodies for the top 1 percent. This is not worrying about working \nAmericans.\n  Let me put into the Record what you will lose.\n  You will lose the mortgage interest.\n  You will lose the fairness of the child tax credit.\n  You will lose the student loan interest, tuition, and other education \nexpenses; personal casualty losses; tax preparation costs; medical \nexpenses; alimony payments; moving expenses--which will impact victims \nof Hurricane Harvey, my constituents in Kashmere Gardens, northeast \nHouston, Third Ward, Acres Home, the Heights, Jacinto City, places \nwhere individuals have been impacted; this moving expense, elimination \nof that as a deduction, will impact individuals who are trying to \nrestore their lives--and employee business expenses.\n  This bill will hurt the average working American. It is a frightening \nbill. I would almost like to say it is a bill made near purgatory on \nthe way to you know where. This is a disgusting attack on hardworking \nAmericans.\n  I want to also put in the Record my concern about extending the \ntemporary protected status for Haitians as well as El Salvadorans and a \nnumber of other countries that are facing the 6-month deadline that \nseems to be what has come out of the administration.\n  All of these countries have devastation, and all of these countries \nare deserving, if you will, of an extension for the people who are here \nbecause they are, in fact, suffering still. Haiti is suffering still \nfrom the earthquake. El Salvador is suffering.\n  I want to mention one of my constituents, Jose, and his wife, who \nwere deported during the horror and the hysteria of the announcement \nfrom the administration of: I am going to be hard on deportation.\n  A hardworking family man, a manager of a paint store, was deported \nout of this country back to El Salvador where there is no work, there \nis no opportunity, and they are still suffering from the devastation of \nyears past. This is what we are in the midst of.\n  Let me, finally, express, as I indicated, my concerns about extending \nthe temporary protected status certainly for Haitians and others. We \nare working on that as we speak.\n  Then let me come back to Hurricane Harvey. There are about 50,000 \npeople in the hotels. We are still in need.\n\n\n  I am going to close with this.\n  We just experienced Veterans Day. What a pleasure to be able to speak \nwith the many veterans, the Buffalo Soldiers, who celebrated at the \ndowntown celebration, the American Legion. The Aldine Mail Route had a \nparade. Stafford had a parade. Many places had a parade. I want to \ncelebrate our veterans by saying thank you.\n  When I spoke to young people, eighth graders, I told them about the \nvalue of joining the United States military, putting on the uniform. \nPolicy does not relate to the value of the men and women who put on the \nuniform.\n\n\n  I believe that it is certainly of concern that we should understand \nwhat the needs of the military are. And if this proposal goes forward \nof giving waivers for individuals with depression, bipolar disorder, \ngetting waivers, let me be very clear, I advocate for the full \nutilization of people, and those people who have mental health issues.\n  It is very important, as they are recruited into the United States \nmilitary, that all of the resources needed to have them perform at the \nfullest of their capacity, we must ensure, as Members of Congress, that \nthat happens. That must be our responsibility because, as we look at \nour veterans and we see the sacrifice, we see what war means, we have \nto make sure that we embrace them solidly and respect them and honor \nthem.\n  So I thank the gentleman for allowing me to share a few thoughts. I \nwill simply say that the gentleman is absolutely right, this tax \nlegislation will be devastating, costly, and hard for the country to \ndig out of the deepening debt that is going to be created.\n  Mr. Speaker, I join my colleagues in the Congressional Black Caucus \nin drawing attention to the Republican Leadership's latest plan to hurt \nthe American taxpayers, especially those who did not support the \nPresident during the election.\n  The Republican tax cut bill will hurt hospitals.\n  The House tax bill would remove tax-exempt status of private activity \nbonds for construction of a non-profit facility such as a hospital.\n  This could potentially impact a fourth of the rural hospitals in \nTexas and many urban hospitals that may be planning construction or \nextensive renovation projects in the next few years.\n  Many non-profit hospitals depend on tax exempt private-activity bonds \n(PABs) as a financing tool.\n  PABs are tax exempt for certain entities, including qualified \n501(c)(3) organizations including hospital bonds, but under the new tax \nreform legislation being considered by this body, the tax exemption \nwill be removed.\n  PABs play a critical role in helping not-for-profit hospitals and \nhealth systems access low-cost capital.\n  Access to low-cost capital financing allows qualifying entities to \nkeep infrastructure expenditures low.\n  This increases the ability for qualifying hospitals and health system \nto use these savings to increase more efficient, more affordable care.\n  Federal tax-exempt financing is part of what continues to help health \ncare providers and hospitals serve our nation and support rural \ncommunities.\n  The Texas Organization of Rural & Community Hospitals opposes removal \nof tax-exemption for PABs and urges Republicans to stop threatening \nsmall and rural hospitals.\n  The Republican Tax plan amends Title 26 of the United States Code 529 \nthat deals with Qualified tuition programs.\n  The Code was intended to encourage persons to attain higher education \nand provide incentives for persons who pursue doctorates.\n  Most people know that going back to school to obtain a degree is a \ndifficult choice to make with full time jobs and family obligations.\n  Having a degree can substantially increase income and provide choices \nthat would otherwise be unattainable to the recipient of advanced \ndegrees.\n  The benefit to the economy and our nation's leadership in the \nsciences rests with the number of people who attain undergraduate and \ngraduate degrees.\n  The Republicans have gone into this section 529 of the tax code and \nextended the tax write-offs to those sending their children to K-12 \nprivate schools.\n  Other ways the Republican Tax bill hurts tax payers who pursue \ncollege educations for themselves or their children.\n  Repeal of Lifetime Learning Credit;\n  Repeal of the Student Loan Interest Deduction;\n  Repeal of the qualified tuition reduction;\n  Repeal of educational assistance program;\n  Termination of private activity bonds; and,\n  Creation of a new excise tax on endowments at private colleges and \nuniversities.\n  The Republican leadership of the House is also causing problems for \nprivate sector investments in Colleges and Universities.\n  The tax bill threatens tax write offs for donations to colleges and \nuniversities and will limit tax credits associated with university-\nindustry partnerships.\n  The Republicans claim that their Child Tax Credit proposal would help \nworking families, but it simply does not do enough.\n  The House tax plan proposes a nonrefundable $600 increase in the \nChild Tax Credit (CTC), and would make more families earning six \nfigures eligible to claim the CTC.\n  This proposal wouldn't help the women who need it most.\n  In addition, whatever benefits this CTC proposal would provide pales \nin comparison to those that would be received by the wealthy and \ncorporations under this tax plan.\n  The bill cuts taxes for major corporations who already pay far less \nthan their fair share.\n  Republicans claim that economic growth will more than pay for the \nlost revenue but we've tried this before.\n  When trickle-down economics fails again and this bill explodes the \nnation's deficit, Republicans will call for huge spending cuts to \ncritical programs that hardworking Americans depend on to make ends \nmeet.\n  The plan's negative impact on the Lone Star state would be \nparticularly hard.\n  Independent analyses show the Republican plan would actually raise \ntaxes on about 1.5 million Texas households, or 12.4 percent of \nhouseholds next year.\n  On average, families earning up to $86,000 annually would see a \n$794.00 increase in their tax liability, a significant burden on \nfamilies struggling to afford child care and balance their checkbook.\n  According to the IRS, 23 percent of tax filers, or 2.8 million Texas \nhouseholds, deduct their state and local taxes with an average \ndeduction of $7,823 in 2015.\n  The Ryan-McConnell plan eliminates this deduction, which would lower \nhome values and put pressure on states and towns to collect revenues \nthey depend on to fund schools, roads, and vital public resources.\n  Placing further strains on middle-class Texans is the elimination of \nthe personal exemption, which deducts $4,050 for each taxpayer and \ndependent on a return from taxable income.\n  In 2015, roughly 9.3 million dependent exemptions were claimed in the \nLone Star State.\n  The GOP's reckless and irresponsible tax plan is made all the more \nobscene by its disproportionate and immoral handouts to the wealthiest \nfew.\n  According to the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, \nmillionaires in Texas, 0.31 percent of filers in 2015 would receive \nalmost 57 percent of the benefits from the tax plan.\n  Texans deserve a tax plan that puts working and middle class families \nfirst, not more deficit-exploding tax cuts for millionaires and \nbillionaires.\n  We need bipartisan tax reform that creates jobs, fuels economic \ngrowth, and puts more money into the pockets of hard-working American \nfamilies.\n  A recent Pew Research Center report found little support for cutting \ntaxes for high-income households, which is defined as more than \n$250,000 or large businesses and corporations.\n  In fact, 43 percent favored raising taxes on high-income households \nand 52 percent said corporate taxes should be raised.\n  The Republicans persist with their scheme of raising taxes on hard-\nworking middle class families to pay for tax cuts for the rich.\n  It is reckless to explode our deficit which according to the Tax \nPolicy Center, would skyrocket by $2.4 trillion over the first decade.\n  The wealthy must pay their fair share, but the GOP tax scheme offers \nthem a free lunch at the expense of those who are most in need of a \nhelping hand.\n  The power of the purse rests with the House of Representatives and it \nis our job to make sure that the American People are treated fairly.\n  Mr. Speaker, as a senior member of the House Committees on the \nJudiciary and Homeland Security Committee, I also rise today to express \nmy strong objection to the announced intention by the Trump \nAdministration not to extend Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for \nHaiti, Honduras, and El Salvador.\n  On May 24, 2017, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) \nredesignated Haiti for 6 months of Temporary Protected Status (TPS), \nrather than the full 18 months requested by the Government of Haiti, \nHaiti experts in the United States, and the Congressional Black Caucus, \namong others.\n  DHS' decision did not reflect the realities on the ground in Haiti, \nwhich include Haiti's food scarcity crisis, cholera epidemic, and the \nongoing challenges posed by the unprecedented 2010 earthquake.\n\n\n  In a letter sent on November 3, 2017, the Congressional Black Caucus \nurged DHS, once again, to fully extend Haiti's TPS designation for 18 \nmonths by the November 23, 2017 deadline in light of the aforementioned \nconditions in Haiti, as well as the exarcerbated damage caused by \nHurricanes Irma and Maria.\n  In a report published in October 2017, the highly regarded Global \nJustice Clinic concluded that conditions justifying Haiti's \nqualification for TPS in 2011 remain as acute today as they were then.\n  The study also found that 40,000 Haitians uprooted by the 2010 \nearthquake are officially displaced and that many more likely remain \nunofficially displaced in dangerously inadequate shelters.\n  The cholera epidemic that was tragically caused by international \nefforts to aid Haiti in 2010 more than doubled following Hurricane \nMatthew and is expected to directly affect more than 30,000 people by \nthe end of 2017.\n  Hurricane Matthew also exacerbated the food insecurity crisis in \nHaiti, placing 2.4 million Haitians--22 percent of its population--in \nthe grips of an acute food insecurity crisis.\n  The Haitian government has been working diligently for years to \nimprove its economy, public health conditions, and infrastructure in \ncoordination with the United States government and international \ncommunity.\n  In order to accomplish this task, Haiti relies in large part on \nremittances that its citizens receive from TPS beneficiaries in the \nUnited States.\n  Therefore, the negative consequences of terminating Haiti's TPS \ndesignation would be twofold.\n  It would end essential remittances that significantly contribute to \nHaiti's recovery while also forcing the poorest republic in the Western \nHemisphere to absorb the cost of reintegrating thousands of citizens \nall at once.\n  Such actions could be catastrophic to Haiti's recovery efforts and \nrun counter to Congressional efforts to improve American relations in \nthe region through the recently-passed United States-Caribbean \nStrategic Engagement Act (Public Law 114-291).\n  Finally, it is essential to note that Haitian TPS beneficiaries \ndirectly contribute to the United States.\n  They pay taxes, spend money, contribute to Social Security and \nMedicare, and help promote American prosperity in numerous sectors, \nsuch as the restaurant and food service, construction, and hospitality \nindustries.\n  About 30 percent of TPS beneficiaries are homeowners, stimulating the \nreal estate industry and contributing to the local property tax base.\n  Also, one in nine TPS beneficiaries in the labor force is self-\nemployed, meaning they not only create jobs for themselves, but also \ncreate jobs for others.\n  A recent report found that the expiration of Haitian TPS would cost \nthe United States economy more $2.8 billion over a decade in lost gross \ndomestic product.\n  Mr. Speaker, we need to be both smart and compassionate when it comes \nto extending TPS for Haiti.\n  The compassionate thing to do is extend TPS for Haiti.\n  But just as important, extending TPS for Haiti is the smart thing to \ndo because it strengthens the American economy and advances the \nnational interests of the United States.\n  Mr. Speaker, here are the top reasons why temporary protect status \n(TPS) for Haiti should not be revoked:\n  1) Trump Administration Actions:\n  The DHS termination of TPS decision threatens families and key \nindustries in the United States and threatens the stability of nations \nin our region.\n  On November, 2017, the Washington Post reported that the State \nDepartment irresponsibly recommended that Temporary Protected Status \n(TPS) be revoked for over 300,000 Honduran, Nicaraguan, Haitian and \nSalvadorans living and working in the United States.\n  This is paving the way for the mass deportation of over 300,000 \nindividuals who are legally in the US--many of whom have children who \nare US citizens.\n  It was an inhumane, foolish and terrible decision to make, given TPS \nholders' contributions to our economy including critical hurricane \nrecovery efforts, to say nothing of the national security and \nhumanitarian implications of kicking these individuals out.\n  That's why everyone from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, to national \nsecurity experts, to Catholic bishops has expressed strong support for \nextending this vital program.\n  These nations are in no condition to receive 300,000 returnees.\n  In Haiti, forcing the return of 50,000 people would disrupt the \nfragile recovery, exacerbate the food, housing, and public health \ncrises, and potentially destabilize the new government.\n  In El Salvador and Honduras, the return of over 250,000 people would \nstrain government services and lead to job displacement in countries \nbesieged by violence, narcotics trafficking and weak institutions.\n  The revocation of TPS will further destabilize fragile countries in \nour neighborhood. With remittances making up more than 15% of the GDP \nof TPS-designated countries, the sudden loss will put an added strain \non the U.S. foreign aid budget while families who have long relied on \nthis source of income will have no other option than to attempt to come \nto the U.S. as undocumented workers.\n  That's why Congress must act without delay to pass CHC-endorsed bill \nby Rep. Nydia Velazquez--the American Promise Act--would ensure \nindividuals who have resided in the U.S. under these programs for a \nperiod of three years can remain in the country and pursue a path to \nnaturalization.\n  2) TPS Revocation Is Not in America's National Interest:\n  Americans with Temporary Protected Status (TPS) are hardworking \nindividuals who are contributing to our economy, our communities and \nour industries.\n  TPS recipients have passed numerous criminal background checks and \nhave often been living in the U.S. for over a decade.\n  With more than 300,000 TPS beneficiaries expecting a Trump \nAdministration decision on their fate, and some 800,000 DACA \nbeneficiaries depending on Congressional action to shape their futures, \nwe are entering a stretch of time that will be of huge consequence to \n1.1 million immigrants who are deeply rooted and legally present in \nAmerica.\n  Regardless of how you might feel about the policy, TPS holders from \nthese countries have been in legal limbo for at least 16 years.\n  They are perhaps the most vetted, legally present, and work \nauthorized community in our country.\n  They have submitted to numerous criminal background checks, once \nevery 18 months.\n  Life has gone on for these folks--they have families here, are \ncontributing to our economy, and our communities.\n  There are an estimated that 273,000 U.S.-born children in the country \nhave parents with TPS.\n  Economic, legal, and policy experts have highlighted the disastrous \neconomic impacts of revoking Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for \nhundreds of thousands of Americans, as country-specific deadlines loom.\n  3) Positive Economic Impacts of TPS\n  Approximately 250,000 TPS recipients are currently employed--\napproximately 94% of men and 82% of women.\n  The average TPS recipient works between 40-45 hours per week.\n  Given the length of time on the job, many of these workers are \nsenior, specialized and not easily replaceable such as construction \nsite supervisors and nursing home professionals.\n  The five leading industries that would face mass layoffs are \nconstruction (50,000+), restaurants and other food services (32,000+), \nlandscaping services (15,000+), child day care services (10,000) and \ngrocery stores (9,000+).\n  The mass layoffs of 250,000 TPS recipients would cost employers \napproximately $967 million in immediate turnover costs.\n  The revocation of TPS status would cost the U.S. an estimated $164 \nbillion in Gross Domestic Product.\n  Revocation of TPS status would result in a loss of $6.9 billion in \nSocial Security and Medicare payments over a decade.\n  Given that 30% of TPS recipients are homeowners, the consequences of \nsimultaneously dumping 60,000 mortgages could disrupt housing markets \nacross the country including Texas (13,000 mortgages), Florida (5,000+ \nmortgages) and Virginia (4,100 mortgages).\n  Mass deportations of TPS recipients would cost taxpayers more than $3 \nbillion dollars.", "turn": 10, "speaker": "Ms. JACKSON LEE", "itemno": 11}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "V000131", "text": "  Mr. VEASEY.

I appreciate any insight the gentleman wants to give us on tax \nreform or any of the other issues that the American public wants to \nhear from their congressional representatives on this day.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Evans).", "turn": 11, "speaker": "Mr. VEASEY", "itemno": 12}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "E000296", "text": "  Mr. EVANS. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from the great State of \nTexas. He has consistently done a very great job in leading these \nefforts for the Congressional Black Caucus, as well as our chairman, \nCedric Richmond.\n  Mr. Speaker, this is an interesting time that we are in, obviously, \nin the country, and it is a rather challenging time. Mr. Speaker, I \nwould like to let\n\n\nyou know, last year this time, on November 14, 2016, I was sworn in. So \nI have been here for 1 year, Mr. Speaker. In that 1 year, when I stood \nin this well of this House, I talked about the importance of putting \ncountry first and moving America forward.\n  I said at that particular time that I thought it was extremely \nimportant that we work together, and all my colleagues, at that time, \nfrom Pennsylvania, stood with me, Democrats and Republicans alike. I \ntalked in this well of the House on November 14, 2016, about the need \nto concentrate on the people first; that I thought it was extremely \nessential that we understood that we should talk about the issues that \nare most important to people and not what is important to us; that we \nnow are in a governance mode, not a political mode.\n  There will be time to have discussions about political next year, but \nthis particular time we need to put people first.\n  Mr. Speaker, our country has not seen bipartisan tax reform since \n1986, and that was when President Reagan was President of the United \nStates, and Speaker Tip O'Neill was Speaker of this House.\n  I think it is safe to say, the U.S. Tax Code is in need of major \nfacelifting. But let me make it very clear when I say the way the \nRepublican Party and the Trump administration are going about tax \nreform is all wrong.\n  One of my main priorities in Congress is to help keep moving the city \nof Philadelphia forward. The Republican tax bill impedes our ability to \nmove our city forward. At a time when older cities and suburbs are \npressed for funding, this destructive tax plan is yet another way the \nRepublican Party is taking resources from our cities.\n  What do I mean by this?\n  On Friday past, Mr. Speaker, I joined with the mayor of the city of \nPhiladelphia, Mayor Jim Kenney; the city council president, Darrell \nClarke; Congressman Bob Brady; and HELP USA to hold a press conference \nto call attention to how our neighborhoods would be hard hit by this \nRepublican tax plan.\n  We stood in front of what used to be a school building in \nPhiladelphia, but has now been transformed into a supportive housing \nfacility that will soon house 37 veterans and individuals aged 55 and \nolder. It is these kinds of investments and transformations that will \nmove our neighborhoods forward that are at stake under the GOP tax \nplan. We have a lot to lose under the Republican tax plan.\n  Mr. Speaker, you may recall that the President, at that time, \nCandidate Trump, went to the city of Philadelphia and asked, \nspecifically targeted to the African-American community: ``What do you \nhave to lose?'' That is what he said.\n  He talked about the schools. He talked about the neighborhoods. He \ntalked about all of the challenges that we face in urban America and, \nparticularly, to the African-American community.\n  So, Mr. President, we have a lot to lose under the Republican tax \nplan. The repeal of private activity bonds would be devastating for \nhospitals--I have a number of hospitals in my district. Temple \nUniversity, Einstein, Lankenau, University of Penn, Saint Joseph's \nUniversity--universities, and other nonprofit institutions in \nPhiladelphia and Montgomery County who depend on these bonds and rely \non public-private partnerships to address critical infrastructure \nneeds, finance valued projects, and ensure affordable housing.\n  The list of harmful provisions in this bait-and-switch tax bill goes \non and on.\n  I just received a letter from Chairwoman Val Arkoosh and Vice Chair \nKen Lawrence of the Montgomery County Board of Commissioners. They \nwrote to me to tell me how residents in Montgomery County are alarmed \nby what is happening in this tax bill. They are extremely concerned \nabout the fate of the State and local tax deductions. Without SALT, \ntaxpayers are going to be feel an extreme tax hike. They are extremely \nconcerned about the fate of the State and local tax deductions because \nthis will have an extreme impact on local government.\n  That is just not right, Mr. Speaker.\n  Just the other day, I spoke with local labor leaders who expressed \ntheir great concerns on this tax scam. Mr. Speaker, that is true, it is \na tax scam. It is something where jobs will continue to go overseas, \nnot to our communities.\n  In a district that has 27 percent poverty in the Second Congressional \nDistrict, I am truly concerned about the loss of jobs. They are \nincredibly fearful of what this plan means to the lives of hardworking \nfamilies across our Commonwealth. They know it is going to be too many \nof their families who are going to be among those hit the hardest.\n  Mr. Speaker, remember what I said when I got elected and sworn in. I \nsaid that we need to put people first. This tax scam does not put \npeople first.\n  These are the stories, fears, and concerns of real people in our \nneighborhood. These are the people we should be concerned with. These \nare the people on the front line; people who have serious questions \nabout the intentions of this tax plan.\n\n  What is the Republicans' response?\n  To push it through for a win. Let me repeat that. To push it through \nfor a win. That is wrong and unacceptable.\n  We are in the business of building a stronger tomorrow for our \nstudents, our seniors, our veterans, hardworking families, and all who \ncall our neighborhoods home.\n  Instead of taking away more resources from our cities and suburbs, we \nshould be looking for ways to build, invest, and enhance the existing \ninfrastructure our cities have to offer to make them what they are, to \nattract prospective home buyers and current homeowners. Let me repeat \nthat. We should be looking for making ways more attractive to \nprospective home buyers and current homeowners.\n  Mr. Speaker, we have a real opportunity here to make a difference. \nAgain, I am happy to be a part of the Congressional Black Caucus under \nChairman Richmond's leadership, as well as Mr. Veasey, in leading this \neffort because this is the kind of effort that we have to raise the \nconsciousness and convince people they must resist.\n  We must resist, no matter what they say the numbers are, and keep our \nvoices loud so that they can hear that we are not accepting what is \ntaking place here.\n  Mr. Speaker, I stand here with my colleagues expressing the concern \nand the outrage that I have about this tax scam. This is not about the \npeople. This is about the interest groups. We have a chance to make a \nchange, Mr. Speaker, and we need to work together.\n  I said almost 1 year ago on this day, in this well of this House, \nthat the only way we can move America forward is when we work together. \nI don't say that just to be saying it. I say it because that is what I \ndid when I was in the Pennsylvania Legislature, working together to \nmake a difference. That is the only way we are going to move the \nneedle, when people work together.", "turn": 12, "speaker": "Mr. EVANS", "itemno": 13}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "V000131", "text": "  Mr. VEASEY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman very much for laying \nout those concerns about the tax plan, and he did so very eloquently. I \nalways appreciate the gentleman's participation.\n  Kind of building on what the gentleman talked about, I just want to \ngive the American public out there and the constituents that we \nrepresent in the Congressional Black Caucus just a quick outline of who \nexactly this plan will hurt.\n  I am very concerned about this terrible tax plan because it is going \nto cut rates for the highest 1 percent of earners and corporations, \nwhile increasing the tax burden on lower and middle class families, \nwhile the Republicans are falsely going around claiming that they are \ngoing to be helping these individuals and these families. That is just \nnot the case. That is not the case at all.\n  For example, let me give you one area that has been touched upon that \nI am concerned about, and that is State and local taxes. You won't be \neligible any longer for the deduction, which means many individuals end \nup paying twice the amount of taxes on the same income.\n  The elimination of deductions for student loan payments: we have \ntalked extensively on this House floor, on the Democratic side, about \nwhat students loans are doing to this country and the costs of a higher \neducation. We know that a lot of people seek out higher education just \nbecause of the benefits that it can yield incomewise, and everybody is, \nagain, always trying to see\n\n\nhow they are going to live that American Dream. They want to be able to \npay their taxes, pay their car payment, pay their house note, whatever \nit may happened to be. When you look at the fact that people won't be \nable to write off their student loans to help pay for their education \nanymore, that is really going to hurt and probably convince a lot of \nyoung people that they just shouldn't seek out higher education.\n\n\n  We want young people to seek out a higher education. I mean, even the \nblue-collar jobs out there we know are becoming harder and harder to \nkeep and maintain, and they require some form of education. Even going \nto community college for a couple years after they graduate from high \nschool almost seems to be something that they have to do.\n  The Center for American Progress found that 78 percent of Black \nstudents, in comparison to 57 percent of White students, took out \nFederal loans for their undergraduate studies. And again, just not \nbeing able to write those off means that dream that everyone has, \nregardless of race, being able to buy their first home, the American \nDream, they are going to have to put that off because they can no \nlonger pay off these very costly student loan interest payments. These \ntax deduction eliminations are going to be very troubling for so many \npeople in the community in light of the fight just to build \ngenerational wealth.\n  Again, these trickle-down tactics, we have been talking about \ntrickle-down economics now for a very long time, but some of these \ntrickle-down tactics are proving not to work, and it is disheartening \nto see the finish line just being moved again and again, just over and \nover again. Every time people seem like they are doing better, just to \nsee that finish line moved once again and making it just hard on these \nfamilies that I talked about earlier that fall in those lower middle \nclass, working class, middle class tax brackets.\n  You are talking about, when you look at this really closely, the \nrestructuring of these tax brackets under the Republican plan would \nmake it so that the lowest income earners' tax rates are going to \nincrease from 10 to 12 percent, the lowest earners out there. Some of \nthe poorest amongst us will have their tax burden increased, and it \nwill make it so much more difficult for them to climb that economic \nladder of opportunity. It is already hard to climb that ladder of \nopportunity.\n  Just think about it for just a minute, if you have two kids and you \nhave a 10 percent tax burden, and you are making a small amount of \nmoney a year but you are out there working hard every day. You are \ntrying to get overtime. You are punching the clock as much as you \npossibly can. You are having Grandma watch the kids just so you can \npull that extra shift to get those hours in, but you are a single mom \nand you are just really out there just busting it each and every day, \nweek after week, and you still don't have any money in the bank. You \nare still having a hard time making ends meet. You are still getting \nrent notices put on the door once a month. It is just so tough, and \njust to know that we are not really going to be doing anything at all \nin this body. The Republicans aren't going to be doing anything to help \nthese individuals be able to climb out of that hole and just be able to \nsee the light. Just knowing that that mom and those kids are going to \nprobably struggle under this tax plan until the kids leave the house, \nit is just really disheartening.\n  In addition to that, even the tax provisions that are aimed at \nhelping working families are actually reserved, again, for just the \nwealthiest few in the community.\n  White House Republicans highlight their expansion of the child tax \ncredit. Many of the lowest income parents who are in need of assistance \nwill only be eligible to receive a partial amount of the tax credit, if \nany of the expansion at all.\n  According to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, the GOP \nchild tax credit keeps the lowest income workers from benefiting from \nthe expansion of the credit, despite numerous studies finding that the \nchild tax credits benefit children by improving school performance, \nhigher college enrollment, and increasing earnings in adulthood.\n  Further, this tax plan refuses to take the interests of African-\nAmerican communities as a whole into consideration, ensuring those who \nare striving to reach the American Dream will simply fall short.\n  Again, there is just so much in this bill that is going to be tough.\n  You are talking about repealing the estate tax. There are so many \npeople whom I have heard--Rockefellers, Buffetts, Bill Gates, and \nothers--who are saying that they are fine paying that, that they are \nabsolutely okay with paying that. You think about what we are going to \ntake away from people so they don't have to pay that estate tax. I \nmean, it is just amazing.\n  You have heard so many of my colleagues talk about it earlier here, \nbut when you start talking about the local and State tax deductions, \nwhen you start talking about the student loan deductions that people \nreally count on, when you start talking about child tax credits, when \nyou start talking about new market tax credits, so many programs and so \nmany things out there that are really helping individuals, helping our \neconomy, and we want to give it back so a few wealthy people don't have \nto pay estate taxes? I mean, it is just really sad, Mr. Speaker, when \nyou think about that.\n  One of the things that I think that we ought to do, instead of giving \nultrarich people a pass on paying a billion dollars that they can pass \ndown to heirs, is that we ought to start thinking about doing something \nto help grandparents who are raising grandchildren.\n  I will never forget, when I was in the State legislature, I had a \nprincipal come up to me on the house floor, and I was showing the \nkids--I believe it was on the senate floor. We had walked to the other \nside. And there is a picture of the Battle of San Jacinto that hangs \nthere in Austin at the capitol, and I was showing the schoolchildren, \nand the principal pulled me aside and she said: I want to thank you for \ntalking about grandparents who are raising grandchildren.\n  She said: Over 50 percent of the kids at the elementary school where \nI am principal are raised by someone other than their parent, and 99 \npercent of the time it is the grandparent.\n  Instead of giving superrich people, ultrarich people a pass on paying \nthe inheritance tax, why don't we give grandparents who serve as \nprimary caregivers for their grandchildren out there a $500 refundable \ntax credit? That would help out so much, because you have to think \nabout what these grandparents are facing.\n\n  They didn't think that their Social Security check or their pension \ncheck was going to have to be used to help pay for school supplies, \nhelp pay for school clothes, help pay for backpacks, help pay for \nschool uniforms, help pay for kids' haircuts, prom dresses. The \ngrandparents of America out there are really balancing a lot now, more \nthan any other generation of grandparents have.\n  We could take the money that we are going to give away to the Bill \nGateses and the Warren Buffetts and the Rockefellers and other folks \nlike that, and we could give it to these grandparents, grandparents who \nrepresent people from every congressional district in this country.\n  Oftentimes, you start talking about grandparents who are raising \ngrandchildren, there has been some kind of issue with drugs or alcohol \nin the kids' parents' life or some other reason why the parents can't \ntake care of the kids. We know that that is true, particularly with the \nissues that we have had with the opioid crisis. We know that this is an \narea that is growing in all congressional districts, all races, all \nbackgrounds.\n  Again, why not give our grandparents out there that are buying \nbackpacks with their Social Security check, why not give them a $500 \nrefundable tax credit to help them make ends meet? If we were to do \nthat, these grandparents would be able to have a little bit more money \nto buy healthier foods instead of buying processed foods. They could \nbuy fruits, vegetables, other things like that that could really go a \nlong way in just helping them maintain their household.\n  That is what I am eager to do. I want to sit down with colleagues and \ncome up with something that is fair. I think\n\n\nthat everybody here that I have talked to has said that they want to \nwork in a bipartisan manner to be able to pass a tax reform bill that \nis fair, that is done under regular order, that is done with \ntransparency and done in the light, but the way that this is happening, \nit is just not right.\n  We know, again, that these trickle-down economics just simply do not \nwork, and we need to start all over. We need to head back to the \ndrawing board and sit down as Democrats and Republicans like they did \nback in the eighties when Reagan was President and Tip O'Neill was \nSpeaker and work out some of these issues that the American public has.\n  We know that people are very anxious about some of the things that \nthey have been hearing about this tax reform bill, people from all \ncongressional districts and, again, all backgrounds. We in the \nCongressional Black Caucus, we are concerned about the impact that this \nis going to have in the African-American communities around this \ncountry--and all of the communities, quite frankly, Mr. Speaker.\n  Again, let's just sit down at the drawing board, talk about some of \nthese things, and come up with something that is fair that the American \npublic can feel good about, knowing that Members of Congress, that they \nare not trying to gain advantage over one another, that we are trying \nto come up with a fair way how to reform our Tax Code, keep our \nbusinesses here, and keep a little bit more money in people's pockets \nat the end of the week or the end of the month, whenever they get paid, \nso they can take care of their families and buy a home, take care of \ntheir grandkids, do whatever it is they need to do in order to make \nends meet.\n  Mr. Speaker, thank you very much for this evening, and I yield back \nthe balance of my time.\n", "turn": 13, "speaker": "Mr. VEASEY", "itemno": 14}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 15}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "185", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H9160-H9166", "wkday": "Monday", "day": "13", "month": "November"}, "related_bills": [{"type": "HR", "context": "OTHER", "congress": "115", "number": "1"}], "doc_title": "TAX REFORM", "id": "CREC-2017-11-13-pt1-PgH9160"}
