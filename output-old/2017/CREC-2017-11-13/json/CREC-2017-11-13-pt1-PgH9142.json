The bill requires all Federal \nagencies to ensure any Federal Government website intended for use by \nthe public is mobile friendly. Services offered by the Federal \nGovernment should be effective but also accessible to the public. \nAgency websites are one of the most important tools for taxpayers to \nobserve services and information from the government.\n  The U.S. Government runs more than 6,000 websites on over 400 \ndomains. One recent study estimated that approximately 40 percent of \ngovernment websites either are not accessible or are difficult to \naccess on a phone, yet nearly 80 percent of Americans own a smartphone, \nand at least 1 in 10 American adults rely exclusively on a smartphone \nfor access to the internet, according to a Pew survey. The data clearly \npoints to the utility of making all government websites mobile \nfriendly.\n  Another study found that more people accessed the internet on their \nmobile devices than a desktop computer for the first time last year. It \nis clear that Federal agencies must emphasize mobile accessibility to \neffectively serve the American people. The Connected Government Act \nwill require agencies to do just that.\n  This bill requires Federal agencies to ensure their websites are \nmobile friendly during the course of creating new websites or updating \nexisting ones. A mobile-friendly government is a necessary step in the \nmodernization of the government's IT infrastructure.\n  Mr. Speaker, I applaud my colleague, the gentlewoman from Illinois, \nfor her work in sponsoring this bill.

Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a blog post regarding this bill \nwritten by Congressman Pallone and myself.\n\n         [From the Energy & Commerce Democrats, Sep. 13, 2017]\n\n    It's Time To Give the Government an Upgrade for the Mobile World\n\n                (By Frank Pallone, Jr. and Robin Kelly)\n\n       In the wake of the natural disasters devastating so much of \n     the country, millions of Americans are turning to federal \n     agencies for help--but the government's websites don't always \n     make it easy. We've introduced legislation in the House that \n     would change that, and it's moving forward at a time when it \n     can help a lot of Americans who are suffering.\n       For people who were forced from their homes or are without \n     power because of hurricanes, storms or wildfires, their only \n     connection to necessities of survival--food, water, fuel, and \n     shelter--is through their mobile phones. It's the device they \n     could take with them when they had to flee their homes. But \n     while private websites and charities have developed new \n     mobile websites and apps to help those who are still \n     struggling, many of the essential government websites on \n     which people depend are essentially unusable on a phone.\n       During any natural disaster, we expect the government to be \n     at its best. But for people whose homes have been flooded, \n     burned out, or leveled, trying to navigate government \n     websites on their phones likely feels like a waste of time. \n     For instance, if you need to start looking for a loan to \n     rebuild your home, good luck trying to use your phone to \n     navigate the website for the Department of Housing and Urban \n     Development. If you need to reach state or local authorities, \n     the problems get worse. And asking people to hunt down a \n     working desktop computer right now is just unreasonable.\n       Although these natural disasters are making this problem \n     more acute, the need for a\n\n\n     government-wide upgrade is only growing more important every \n     day. That's because the people who need the most help are \n     often on mobile devices. If you are young, if you have a \n     lower income, or if you are a minority, you are much more \n     likely to use a smartphone as your only entry point to the \n     internet.\n       The gap is significant--people earning less than $30,000 \n     were 13 times more likely in 2015 to depend on a smartphone \n     than people earning more than $75,000. Yet websites that are \n     intended to strengthen the social safety net like programs \n     providing food assistance are nearly inaccessible on a phone.\n\n\nA smart government brings services to people when they need them most--\n                        not the other way around\n\n       Last year we crossed a significant threshold--Americans are \n     now more likely to access the internet on their mobile device \n     than on their desktop computer. If people rely on mobile \n     devices, our services should be designed for mobile devices, \n     and that's why agencies with consumer-facing websites should \n     be designed with an eye towards mobile first. These mobile \n     sites can make it easier for people who may not have the time \n     to wait in line at a government office.\n       In order to bring government up to speed, we have \n     introduced the Connected Government Act, which ensures that \n     all new federal agency websites are designed to work well on \n     mobile devices. These federal sites would serve as an example \n     to the states who need to do more to modernize their own \n     technology. This simple change can have a big impact--from \n     shorter lines and faster service, to providing more help to \n     more people. Mobile friendly websites will ultimately help \n     build a stronger democracy.\n       Today, our bill is expected to clear a crucial committee \n     vote in the House. And our colleagues Senators Maggie Hassan \n     (D-NH) and Cory Gardner (R-CO) recently introduced a \n     companion bill in the Senate. With this progress, our path to \n     a smarter government is within reach. Congress should act \n     soon to get this bill passed.\n       In the wake of these recent disasters, we need to ensure \n     that anyone looking for assistance from a federal agency can \n     get the information they need through their mobile device. \n     This is the least we can do to help alleviate some of the \n     stress people feel in times of need.\n", "turn": 5, "speaker": "Ms. KELLY of Illinois", "itemno": 11}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "K000385", "text": "  Ms. KELLY of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I thank the coleader on this \nbill, Congressman Frank Pallone, who has been a strong supporter every \nstep of the way, from the bill's drafting through today's floor \nconsideration. I also thank my good friend Congressman Mark Meadows, a \ncosponsor of the bill, and I thank Senator Hassan, who introduced the \nSenate companion.\n  Mr. Speaker, this is a simple bill that will ensure all government \nwebsites are accessible to all Americans. It simply requires that any \nnew or updated Federal websites be mobile friendly. It is 2017. We need \nFederal websites to work for all Americans.\n  In the past 90 days, there were 2.61 billion visits to Federal \nwebsites. Almost 40 percent of those came from mobile devices. That is \nover 1 billion hits from mobile devices like tablets and smartphones. \nBut today, according to a report by the Information Technology and \nInnovation Foundation, 40 percent of government websites don't work on \nsmartphones or are mobile unfriendly.\n  Alarmingly, many of these sites are critical to serving the American \npeople, like the application for Federal student aid and the launch \npoint for bidding on Federal Government contracts. For millions of \nAmericans without access to reliable broadband or without a desktop \ncomputer, smartphones are their doorway to the internet.\n  A recent Pew report found that younger Americans, low-income \nAmericans, rural Americans, and people of color are more likely to rely \nonly on smartphones to browse the web.\n  Today, 77 percent of Americans own and use smartphones to access the \ninternet. For 10 percent of Americans, it is their primary access to \nthe internet. That is 32 million Americans. It is unacceptable for 32 \nmillion Americans to have difficulty reaching their government simply \nbecause we couldn't keep up with technological trends.\n  Recently, Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria showed just how vital \nsmartphones have become, especially during disasters. In the aftermath \nof these storms, millions of Americans relied on their smartphones to \nfind assistance. Imagine the frustration of navigating SBA, FEMA, or \nHUD websites, looking for assistance on a 5-inch screen, and the site \nnot working because it is only designed for desktop browsing.\n  In my time serving as the ranking member of the Information \nTechnology Subcommittee, it has been clear that the Federal \nGovernment's IT systems are not working and have not kept up with even \nthe most basic technology trends that are common in the private sector.\n  Americans deserve a modern American Government that is accessible and \nresponsive to their needs. This bill takes us one step closer to \nrealizing this goal.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this commonsense bill \nthat the CBO has said will have no significant cost to taxpayers.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.", "turn": 6, "speaker": "Ms. KELLY of Illinois", "itemno": 12}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "H001071", "text": "  Mr. JODY B.
