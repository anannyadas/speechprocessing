Mr. Speaker, last week I held a hearing on \nthe political crisis in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The DRC \nwas supposed to conduct elections one year ago this month in order to \nachieve the required transition of political power by December 19. \nHowever, after years of stalling on making preparations for elections, \nthe Government of the DRC failed to hold elections last year and relied \non a constitutional provision that President Joseph Kabila could not \nstep down until an election was held to select a replacement.\n  This interpretation is in apparent contradiction to other \nconstitutional provisions requiring elections to be held on time and \nlimiting Kabila to two terms. The election commission has just \nannounced that elections cannot be held until sometime in late 2018, \nwith an inauguration in early 2019. The prolonging of the Kabila regime \nhas ratcheted up tensions in the country.\n  Polling has indicated that a majority of Congolese want the Kabila \ngovernment to end and be replaced by a transitional government until a \nnew one can be elected.\n  Enduring conflict hotspots in eastern DRC have seen recent flare-ups, \nwhile new hotspots have emerged in previously relatively stable areas, \nsuch as the central Kasai region and southeastern Tanganyika province. \nThe conflicts in Kasai and Tanganyika alone have caused the \ndisplacement of nearly 2 million people since mid-2016, giving DRC one \nof the highest rates of human displacement in the world. Political \nunrest in urban centers, a string of large prison breaks, and violent \nattacks in Kinshasa by members of a religious sect that has declared \nitself in opposition to Kabila have further contributed to worsening \ninsecurity.\n  The conflict in Kasai, which reportedly was first sparked in 2016 by \nthe murder of a traditional leader by state security forces, has become \na catastrophic humanitarian crisis, featuring severe atrocities and the \nwidespread recruitment and abuse of children. Meanwhile, the ongoing \nconflict in eastern DRC at one time saw violent activity by two dozen \nmilitia groups and an out-of-control national army, resulting in the \nsystematic rape of about 50 women and girls each hour.\n  The hearing intended to look at possible solutions to a political \nstalemate that could very well lead to further violence and upheaval in \na large African country bordering on nine neighbors. It followed a \nsuccessful resolution on DRC that I introduced and was passed by the \nHouse last year and new legislation that Ranking Member Bass and I are \nintroducing soon.\n  We understand that there are no easy solutions to the current crisis \nin DRC. A negotiated transition likely could be achieved if President \nKabila were convinced that neither he nor his family would be \nprosecuted for human rights violations or corruption. However, that \nwould reward them for abusing their citizens and plundering the \ncountry's resources, and that is even if members of his government were \nnot covered.\n  A palace coup might take place to oust Kabila. That is not unknown in \nthe DRC. Kabila's father, Laurent Kabila, was assassinated in office in \n2001. Mobutu Sese Seko, who the elder Kabila had overthrown, had \nhimself overthrown an elected government in 1965. He was chased from \npower and fled into exile in 1997. However, a coup would not support \ninternational efforts to instill democratic practices in the DRC and \ncould lead to protracted in-fighting and national chaos.\n  The status quo, as detailed earlier, is already leading to growing \nviolence and will not lead to a peaceful solution the longer a \ntransition is delayed. In fact, it is more likely violence could \nescalate and spill over into neighboring countries as did conflict in \n1996 through 97 and 1998 through 2003.\n  Over the past year, we have heard many promises by the Government of \nthe DRC about when elections would be held. There have been several \ndates given for when voter registration would be completed during this \npast year. The current government timetable calls for voter \nregistration to extend to a point at which elections couldn't be held \nin the DRC until late 2018 with an inauguration early in 2019. That \nwould mean that Joseph Kabila would have had an extra half-term in \noffice, when the constitution precluded him from going past December \n2016.\n  Consequently, we heard last week from the State Department on our \ngovernment's diplomatic efforts to resolve the transition stalemate and \nthe U.S. Agency for International Development on our government's \nprograms on the ground to promote democracy and free and fair \nelections.\n  Our second panel last week consisted of scholars and activists who \ngave us their informed suggestions on how we can break this political \nstalemate and prevent more bloodshed in the DRC.\n  Again, no solution will be easy or without cost, but non-action would \nhave an even higher cost in human lives. That we must not tolerate\n\n\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. SMITH of New Jersey", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 3}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "185", "extension": true, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "E1554-E1555", "wkday": "Monday", "day": "13", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "RESOLVING THE POLITICAL CRISIS IN THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF THE CONGO", "id": "CREC-2017-11-13-pt1-PgE1554-3", "title": "RESOLVING THE POLITICAL CRISIS IN THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF THE CONGO"}
