Paychecks \nseemed to stagnate, good-paying jobs seemed harder to find, and \nopportunities seemed difficult to come by.\n  Our country can do better for hard-working families, and that is \nexactly what we are working to deliver as we continue our efforts to \npass tax reform. It is a once-in-a-generation opportunity, and it is \nthe most important thing we can do today to get our economy really \ngrowing again and going again.\n  Last week, the House Ways and Means Committee passed its proposal to \nlower taxes and to boost economic growth. I would like to commend \nChairman Brady for his efforts to get the bill approved by the \nCommittee and to the floor of the House.\n  Here in the Senate, we also remain focused on tax reform this week. \nToday, the Finance Committee began its mark-up of the tax reform \nproposal released last week. Under the leadership of Chairman Hatch, \nthe committee will consider this plan that really has been many years \nand dozens of hearings in the making.\n  The Finance Committee's tax plan will help hard-working Americans \nkeep more of their own money. It will help create more jobs here at \nhome, and it will help increase opportunities for the middle class. \nConsider this from a recent news report titled: ``Middle class biggest \nwinners in Senate tax plan, study says.''\n  ``Moderate-income people would consistently see the largest \npercentage declines in their tax bills,'' the article says, ``according \nto an analysis released late Saturday by the official, nonpartisan \nJoint Committee on Taxation.''\n  ``In 2019,'' the article continues, ``people in the middle of the \nincome spectrum earning, between $50,000 and [$75,000], would see their \ntaxes fall by 7.1 percent. Those earning between $20,000 and $30,000 \nwould see a 10.4 percent decline.''\n  Here is another recent article, titled: ``Senate bill would cut taxes \nby $1.78 trillion, create [925,000] new jobs, study finds.''\n  The article noted that the Finance Committee's bill ``would boost the \neconomy, creating 925,000 new jobs and raising wages by 2.9 percent \nover 10 years, according to a new analysis released Thursday by the Tax \nFoundation.'' According to that study, families in my home State of \nKentucky can see a boost to after-tax incomes for middle-income \nfamilies,'' of nearly $2,000.\n  Earlier today, I had an opportunity to meet with a number of Kentucky \nsmall business owners and workers to hear from them about the \nimportance of tax reform. We discussed how this effort can help provide \nrelief to small businesses and middle-class families by making taxes \nlower, simpler, and fairer. Tax reform can help provide real relief to \nfamilies and small businesses that felt left behind by our economy.\n  The proposal that the committee will take up today is the product of \nyears of listening to people across the country who are calling out for \nrelief. It is from careful study of our current Tax Code, understanding \nwhat it gets right and what it too often gets wrong.\n\n\n  The Senate's Tax Cuts and Jobs Act represents the consensus views of \nthe Finance Committee members and it reflects the values shared by the \nHouse, the Senate, and the Trump administration, put forward in our \nunified framework earlier this year. Chairman Hatch has shown \nimpressive leadership to craft this proposal, and I look forward to his \ncontinued guidance of the committee under regular order.\n  Today, members will have the opportunity to give opening statements \nand provide their insights on the proposal. During this process, the \ncommittee will consider amendments from both sides. As of this morning, \nmore than 300 amendments have been filed by both Republican and \nDemocrat members. Additionally, all Senators will have the chance to \nshare their opinions here on the Senate floor. This is an open process.\n  It is time to reform our Tax Code and provide much needed relief to \nthe hard-working men and women of this country. The Finance Committee's \nproposal would do just that.\n  In a related action this week, the Senate Energy and Natural \nResources Committee, under the leadership of Chairman Murkowski, will \nbegin to mark up legislation supporting our Nation's energy security. \nFurther developing Alaska's oil and gas potential in an environmentally \nresponsible way is an important effort to help create new jobs, \ngenerate new wealth, and provide for our energy future and energy \nsecurity.\n  These committee markups are positive steps toward growing our economy \nand helping the middle class.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. McCONNELL", "itemno": 0}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 1}], "header": {"chamber": "Senate", "num": "185", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "S7169-S7170", "wkday": "Monday", "day": "13", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "TAX REFORM", "id": "CREC-2017-11-13-pt1-PgS7169-6", "title": "TAX REFORM"}
