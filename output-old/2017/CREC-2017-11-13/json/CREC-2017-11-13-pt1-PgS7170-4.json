Madam President, I am going to spend the bulk of my time \nthis afternoon focusing on the tax plan, but first I must address \nPresident Trump's trip to Asia.\n  Without exaggeration, the President's trip to Asia has been one of \nthe most embarrassing foreign trips a President has taken in my memory. \nIt shows when it comes to foreign policy, President Trump is not ready \nfor prime time.\n  After a campaign in which he routinely criticized China--rightly, in \nmy opinion--for rapacious trading practices that have stolen American \njobs and depressed American wages, President Trump went to China and \ngave them a get-out-of-jail-free card. Instead of speaking sternly and \ntruthfully to the Chinese leaders about the realities of our unbalanced \nand unfair trade system--where we play by the rules, and they do not; \nwe lose jobs, they gain them--President Trump tried to appease the \nChinese and their leader.\n  Instead of demanding concessions on trade, instead of demanding the \nsame equal access to markets we provide Chinese firms, instead of \naddressing the sordid history of intellectual property theft and \nextortion, President Trump was eager to let China off the hook, saying \nit was ``not their fault'' but rather the failure of American \nPresidents. Imagine blaming America for the Chinese trade imbalance and \nletting China get off scot-free. Is that putting America first?\n  President Xi flattered President Trump, and he fell for it hook, \nline, and sinker. From each of his interactions with President Xi, \nPresident Trump has only gotten flattery, pomp, and circumstance but \nnothing for the American worker--nothing.\n  If he keeps this approach up with a growing economic power like \nChina, President Trump will be the author of a new international \nreality: America second.\n  Concerning the situation on the Korean Peninsula, instead of working \ntoward a new meaningful understanding of how to best deal with North \nKorea, President Trump traded petty barbs with the President of North \nKorea on Twitter. Close your eyes for a moment and imagine if this was \nthe way Roosevelt behaved toward Stalin or Eisenhower toward Khrushchev \nor Kennedy toward Castro. This is below the dignity of the Office of \nPresident of the United States, and it erodes America's power in the \nworld.\n  Worst of all, again, President Trump seemed to instinctively accept \nthe word of President Putin against 17 U.S. intelligence agencies about \nwhether Russia interfered in our election. We know that Russia \ninterfered with our elections. Our entire intelligence community--17 \nagencies--has concluded it. Why does President Trump continue to give \nPresident Putin the benefit of the doubt while discrediting and \ndemeaning American intelligence officers? It is shameful, unpatriotic--\ndeeply unpatriotic--and he only halfheartedly walked back his comment \nafter the fact. Every American should wonder why President Trump goes \nto such great lengths to avoid criticizing President Putin.\n  After 8 years of Republicans questioning President Obama's toughness \nwith foreign leaders--an attack that I give no credence to by \nrepeating--it seems that President Trump, not President Obama, is the \none who is afraid to take on America's adversaries. He forgives China \nand cozies up to President Putin.\n  For the steelworker in Ohio or in Upstate New York whose job is on \nthe line\n\n\nbecause China is dumping cheap steel and aluminum into our markets, \nthat is not good enough. For every American concerned about the \nsanctity of our elections, that is not good enough. When it comes to \nstanding up for the needs of the American worker, for American firms, \nand for American consumers, when it comes to standing up for American \ndemocracy, this President needs to wake up and toughen up.\n\n\n                          Republican Tax Plan\n\n  Madam President, now on taxes. Today the Finance Committee will begin \nto mark up the Senate Republican tax plan. The bill put forward by the \nchairman will not contain the ideas of a single Democrat in the Senate. \nIt is the result of not a single negotiation between our two parties. \nIt has been discussed in exactly zero hearings, its merits weighed by \nexactly zero expert witnesses.\n  Rather, the tax bill is one party's backroom deliberations, and \nthough it will affect nearly every person and industry in the country, \nit is being rushed through committee and may come to the floor of the \nSenate in a matter of weeks.\n  The Republican leadership is making a mockery of the legislative \nprocess, a mockery of regular order, and the reason for such reckless \nhaste is all too obvious. The product is a wretched one.\n  If Republicans had crafted a popular bill that could get bipartisan \nsupport, they would have announced it with great fanfare and fanned out \nall over the country to champion it. Instead, it is being rushed \nthrough with hardly any consideration because my Republican friends \nknow from their experience with healthcare that the longer an unpopular \nidea is left out in the open, the more it would fester in the public's \nmind.\n  That is what will happen with this tax bill because of one simple \nreason: It is focused on the wealthy to the exclusion of the middle \nclass. While big corporations and wealthy individuals get lower rates \nand new permanent loopholes, the middle class gets benefits that \nexpire. Corporations will be able to continue to deduct their State and \nlocal taxes while individual taxpayers will not. Wealthy estates worth \nover $5 million are ensured a massive tax break while millions of \nmiddle-class families lose their popular deductions like the personal \nexemption.\n\n  That is why, according to an analysis by the New York Times, under \nthe House Republican bill, nearly one-third of all middle-class \ntaxpayers will see a tax hike next year. Let me repeat that. Under the \nHouse Republican bill, nearly one-third of all middle-class taxpayers \nwill see a tax hike next year, and almost half of middle-class \ntaxpayers will see a hike in 10 years.\n  According to a JCT analysis of the Senate Republican bill, of all the \ntaxpayers making less than $200,000 a year, 13 million will see a tax \nhike next year in 2019, and nearly 20 million Americans will see a tax \nhike by 2027. Another 64 million Americans making under $200,000 a year \nwill see no change in their taxes. Meanwhile, everyone at the very top, \nthe top 1 percent, will see tax cuts of tens of thousands of dollars. \nOne hundred times more money would go to a family earning $1 million a \nyear as a family making between $40,000 and $50,000.\n  Now, let me ask you, who needs the tax break more, the family making \n$50,000 or the family making $1 million? God bless the wealthy. So many \nof them worked hard to achieve great wealth. Good, but they don't need \na tax break; middle-class people do.\n  Now President Trump is suggesting Republicans tip the scales even \nmore in favor of the rich by repealing the individual mandate to pay \nfor more tax cuts for the rich.\n  Here is what he tweeted. I find this hard to believe. How out of \ntouch can the President be with the American people?\n\n       How about ending the unfair and highly unpopular \n     Indiv[idual] Mandate . . . & reducing taxes even further? Cut \n     top rate to 35% w/all of the rest going to middle [class] \n     income cuts.\n\n  What does the proposal do? It sends premiums, healthcare premiums, \nfor millions of middle-class Americans skyrocketing, all so that the \nwealthy--the top bracket--can get even bigger tax breaks than they get \nunder the original Republican plan. The middle class only gets the \nleftovers, if there are any at all.\n  Sooner or later, even President Trump's core supporters will realize \nthat he is selling them out. That is why most polls show that less than \none-third of Americans support the Republican tax plan, and a majority \nactually oppose it. That is an astounding fact.\n  Tax cuts are historically popular. Somehow Republicans have managed \nto make a tax cut bill politically unpopular, again, for a \nstraightforward reason. On balance, the tax cut is for big corporations \nand a tiny group of wealthy Americans while millions in the middle \nclass pay more to help finance it. To make tax cuts unpopular is quite \na feat. I would urge my Republican colleagues not to fall for the bait.\n  There is broad agreement on the goals of tax reform between our two \nparties. We all want to lower middle-class taxes. We all want to reduce \nthe burden on small businesses and encourage companies to locate jobs \nhere in the United States instead of shipping them overseas. We could \nput a tax bill together that does those things. This bill doesn't.\n  I know many of my Republican colleagues are concerned about the \ndeficit. They are worried about the one-party legislative ramrodding \nthat is eroding the grand traditions of this body, and they are afraid \nof passing a tax bill that raises taxes on millions of working \nAmericans in their States.\n  So I say to my Republican friends: Hit the brakes on this bill. Come \nback to the table. We can work on a real bipartisan tax reform bill \nthat delivers middle-class tax relief but only--only--if you defeat \nthis bill first.\n  I yield the floor.", "turn": 5, "speaker": "Mr. SCHUMER", "itemno": 7}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

I thank the distinguished Acting President pro tempore.\n\n\n                          Russia Investigation\n\n  Madam President, over the past 10 months, the Attorney General has \ntestified before the Senate on three occasions about his knowledge of \nand contacts with Russian operatives. He also answered written \nquestions and provided additional supplemental testimony, but he still \nhas not gotten his story straight. On numerous occasions, new \ndisclosures of his communications involving Russia have raised serious \ndoubts about his testimony, and not one of these disclosures has come \nfrom the Attorney General; all have come from the press or unsealed \ncourt records. That is a problem.\n  This started in January. At his nomination hearing, both Senator \nFranken and I asked him about contacts with Russian officials. I asked \nhim in writing whether he had been in contact with anyone connected to \nthe Russian Government about the 2016 election. It was not a tricky or \nsurprising question. Other Trump officials' undisclosed contacts with \nRussians, like those of Michael Flynn or Jared Kushner, were major \nheadlines at the time. Under oath, then-Senator Sessions answered with \na single word, ``no.'' We soon learned that the answer was ``yes''--\njust the opposite.\n  In March, the Washington Post reported that Sessions met with Russian \nAmbassador Kislyak on two occasions during the height of the 2016 \ncampaign. Days later, the Attorney General was forced to recuse himself \nfrom the Russia investigation. In June, the press reported on a third \nundisclosed contact. In July, despite the Attorney General's previous \nassertions that he never discussed the campaign with Russian officials, \nU.S. intelligence intercepts reportedly revealed that he had done just \nthat--discussing the campaign and its positions on Russia-related \nissues with the Russian Ambassador. When I asked the Attorney General \nabout this report in the Judiciary Committee last month, his testimony \nshifted yet again; he acknowledged that it was ``possible'' he had \nthose conversations. That flatly contradicts his testimony to me in \nJanuary.\n  The disclosures show no sign of stopping. Two weeks ago, unsealed \ncourt records revealed additional Russian connections that were \ndiscussed during a Trump campaign meeting in March 2016. Then-Senator \nSessions reportedly admonished those in attendance to not discuss the \nissue again out of fear it\n\n\nwould leak to the press. Just last week, another foreign policy \ncampaign aide testified that he informed Sessions of his planned trip \nto Russia in July 2016. Once again, the descriptions of these \ncommunications are impossible to reconcile with the Attorney General's \ntestimony, in which he claimed under oath that he was not aware of any \ncontact between the Trump campaign and Russian officials.\n  The notion that the Attorney General is just forgetful is simply not \nbelievable. Potential Russian involvement in our elections was a major \nstory at the time. In July 2016, then-candidate Trump encouraged Russia \nto commit espionage against his political opponent, Hillary Clinton, by \nstealing her emails. That same week then-Senator Sessions told CNN that \n``people come up to [him] all the time'' to talk about Russia hacking \nHillary Clinton's emails. Exactly who were all these people talking to \nhim about Russia hacking Hillary Clinton's emails? And should he have \ndisclosed any of these conversations to the Judiciary Committee? We do \nnot yet know. Senator Durbin recently asked him this in a written \nquestion, and we look forward to his response.\n  I want another point to be clear: I have never accused the Attorney \nGeneral of colluding with Russia, and I am not doing so now. But it is \nclear that the Kremlin tested the waters with then-Senator Sessions, as \nit did with so many other Trump campaign officials. It is equally clear \nthat the Attorney General concealed his own contacts with Russian \nofficials, and he has failed to correct the record even when given \nmultiple opportunities to do so. I agree with Senators Graham, Franken, \nand others that he needs to come back once again to testify before the \nSenate Judiciary Committee. It is time we hear the whole story.\n  An important part of that story is what the Attorney General did on \nMay 9, the day President Trump fired FBI Director James Comey. To \njustify the dismissal, the President cited a Justice Department \nmemorandum signed off by Attorney General Sessions. The memo attempted \nto justify firing Director Comey because he treated Hillary Clinton \nunfairly during the email investigation. We later learned there was an \nearlier, unsent letter that pointed to President Trump's true \nmotivation for firing Director Comey: the Russia investigation. The day \nbefore the dismissal, the Attorney General and Deputy Attorney General \nwere reportedly called into the White House to discuss the earlier \nletter. The next day, May 9, they delivered their own hastily drafted \nmemo that provided the alternative justification for firing Director \nComey.\n  Here is the problem: The May 9 memo was a facade. It was a pretext. \nThe White House needed to point to anything other than Russia to \njustify dismissing Director Comey, and the Attorney General obliged, \nbut the President could not keep the secret. The very next morning, he \nboasted to Russian officials visiting the Oval Office that firing \nDirector Comey took great pressure off of him from the Russia \ninvestigation. Two days later, on national television, the President \nmade clear what we all knew: He fired the lead Russia investigator due \nto concerns over how he was handling the Russia investigation.\n  Here is another problem: Firing an investigator in order to stymie a \nlegitimate investigation is a crime--it is called obstruction of \njustice. Whether there is sufficient evidence to merit a charge of \nobstruction against the President will likely be revealed by Special \nCounsel Mueller. If so, the Attorney General may have to admit the May \n9 memo that he approved was nothing but a smokescreen--an attempt to \nmask an uncomfortable truth and excuse the inexcusable. Prosecutors do \nnot look kindly upon those who aid others in covering up crimes.\n  For many years, I sat with Senator Sessions on the Judiciary \nCommittee. We disagreed on many policy issues, but I never questioned \nhis commitment to the rule of law. I do question this President's \ncommitment to the rule of law. This month alone, President Trump \nrepeatedly directed the Justice Department to target his political \nopponents and chase his conspiracy theories. This is a President who \nneeds to be told ``no.'' May 9 was one of those moments. I am greatly \ndisappointed that Attorney General Sessions was not up to the task. \nThis is a solemn obligation that goes to the heart of what it means to \nbe Attorney General: ensuring that no person, not even a President, is \nabove the law. He is not a ``Secretary of Justice,'' serving the \nPresident blindly and covering his flaws. He is the Attorney General of \nthe United States, serving the American people. I fear Attorney General \nSessions has lost sight of this distinction.\n  We are in the midst of perhaps the most serious national security \ninvestigation of our time. A foreign adversary attacked our democracy \nand our elections. We know that Russia will be back. If we are serious \nabout preventing the next attack, we must know what happened during the \nlast. The American people deserve answers--no more obfuscation, no more \nfalsehoods. This starts with the Attorney General returning to the \nSenate Judiciary Committee to explain, in person, under oath, why he \nhas not provided truthful, complete answers to some of the most \npressing questions facing our Nation today.\n  Madam President, I yield to the Senator from Minnesota, a Senator who \nhas been relentless in asking these questions. I ask unanimous consent \nthat he be given such time as he needs.", "turn": 9, "speaker": "Mr. LEAHY", "itemno": 11}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, I thank Senator Leahy, my good friend.\n  New developments in the ongoing investigation into Russian \ninterference in the election have, once again, raised concerns about \nthe accuracy of statements made by Attorney General Jeff Sessions \nduring his appearance before the Senate. In light of the Attorney \nGeneral's failure to tell the truth about not just his own interactions \nwith Russian operatives, but also the extent to which he knew about \nRussian contacts by other members of the Trump campaign team, I call \nupon Attorney General Sessions to return to the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee and provide us with a complete and accurate accounting of the \nfacts.\n  There is no question that Russia--a hostile foreign power--meddled in \nour election. Russia carried out this attack in order to undermine \nconfidence in American democracy, to damage Hillary Clinton's campaign \nfor President, and to help Donald Trump. Our intelligence agencies have \nconfirmed this to be true. But in order to keep our country safe and \nprevent an attack like this from happening again, the American people \nneed to understand what happened, including whether members of the \nTrump campaign either participated in the Russian operation or turned a \nblind eye to it. We need to get to the bottom of this, and to do that, \nwe need to know the truth.\n  Regrettably, Attorney General Sessions, our Nation's chief law \nenforcement officer, seems to have a real problem telling the truth \nabout both his own interactions with Russians and those of the larger \nTrump campaign team. At his confirmation hearing in January, when I \nreferenced a breaking report from CNN that there had been a \n``continuing exchange of information during the campaign between \nTrump's surrogates and intermediaries for the Russian government,'' I \nasked him, ``If there is any evidence that anyone affiliated with the \nTrump campaign communicated with the Russian government in the course \nof this campaign, what will you do?'' This was a simple, \nstraightforward question: ``What will you do?'' The implication was, \nwould you recuse yourself? But rather than answer that question, then-\nSenator Sessions said: ``I didn't have--did not have communications \nwith the Russians.'' That, of course, was not true. It was later \nrevealed that Attorney General Sessions had met with the Russian \nAmbassador at least three times during the campaign. Only after two of \nthose meetings were uncovered and disclosed--7 weeks later--did \nAttorney General Sessions announce his recusal from the Russia \ninvestigation.\n  After he was confronted with the truth, the Attorney General began to \nsubtly change his story. His first answer, under oath before the \nJudiciary Committee in January, was that he ``did not have \ncommunications with the Russians.'' But after his meetings with the \nRussian Ambassador were exposed, Attorney General Sessions began to \nqualify his explanations. In a\n\n\nstatement issued on March 2, the day after his Russian contacts were \nrevealed, he said: ``I never met with any Russian officials to discuss \nissues of the campaign.'' But in July, the Washington Post published a \nreport suggesting that the Attorney General did discuss campaign issues \nwith the Russian Ambassador. According to the report, American \nintelligence agencies intercepted communications between the Russian \nAmbassador and the Kremlin in which the Ambassador described his \nconversations with then-Senator Sessions. The two men reportedly talked \nabout substantive policy matters, including campaign-related issues.\n  In response to this report, the Justice Department issued a statement \nstating that Attorney General Sessions stood by his testimony and again \nclaimed that the Attorney General did not discuss ``interference with \nany campaign or election.''\n  Each and every time new information comes to light about the Attorney \nGeneral's contacts with the Russians, he has responded not by coming \nclean and admitting that his initial testimony was inaccurate but by \nshifting his story and moving the goalposts. The truth has a nasty \nhabit of catching up with Attorney General Sessions.\n  Recently, unsealed court documents revealed that in early October, \nformer Trump campaign foreign policy adviser George Papadopoulos pled \nguilty to lying to the FBI about his communications with Russian \noperatives during the campaign. The unsealed documents also revealed \nthat Mr. Papadopoulos didn't just meet with Russian operatives during \nthe campaign, he did so with the express goal of facilitating meetings \nbetween the Russian Government and other Trump campaign officials, \nincluding the candidate himself, Donald Trump. According to the court \ndocuments, Mr. Papadopoulos made no secret of his Russian contacts. He \ndescribed his Russian meetings in emails to senior campaign officials, \nand according to Mr. Papadopoulos, he discussed his Russian contacts \nwith then-Senator Sessions directly.\n  On March 31, 2016, Mr. Papadopoulos attended a meeting of the Trump \ncampaign's National Security Advisory Committee--a group led by \nAttorney General Sessions, who chaired the committee and advised the \ncandidate on foreign policy and national security matters. The court \ndocuments revealed that after Mr. Papadopoulos introduced himself to \nthe group, he ``stated, in sum and substance, that he had connections \nthat could help arrange a meeting between then-candidate Trump and \nPresident Putin.'' Mr. Papadopoulos made that pitch while seated two \nseats to the left of Attorney General Sessions. We know that for a fact \nbecause then-Candidate Trump posted a photo of the meeting on \nInstagram. There is then-Senator Sessions, there is George \nPapadopoulos, and there is then-Candidate Donald Trump.\n  After the court documents were unsealed, reports about what happened \nat the March 31 meeting began to emerge. Reportedly, Mr. Papadopoulos \nspoke about facilitating a meeting between the candidate and the \nRussian President for a few minutes. Then-Candidate Trump reportedly \n``listened with interest and asked questions of Mr. Papadopoulos.'' But \naccording to an adviser present at the meeting, then-Senator Sessions \nreacted negatively to Mr. Papadopoulos's idea and reportedly ``shut \n[Papadopoulos] down.'' Attorney General Sessions is reported to have \nsaid: ``We're not going to do it'' and ``I'd prefer that nobody speak \nabout this again.'' If those reports are accurate, they would signal \nthat then-Senator Sessions reacted quite strongly to the suggestion \nthat then-Candidate Trump should meet with President Putin. Such a \nstrong reaction suggests that Attorney General Sessions would have \nremembered a conversation like that.\n  Mr. Papadopoulos wasn't the only member of the campaign to tell \nAttorney General Sessions about his Russian contacts. Earlier this \nmonth, Carter Page--yet another former Trump campaign foreign policy \nadviser who is under scrutiny for his Russian contacts--testified to \nthe House Intelligence Committee that he told then-Senator Sessions \nabout a trip to Russia that Page was going to take in July 2016, where \nhe met with Russian officials and state-owned businesses.\n  Nonetheless, time and time again, Attorney General Sessions has \nclaimed under oath that he was unaware of any communications between \nRussians and members of the Trump campaign.\n  During his confirmation hearing in January, when I mentioned reports \nthat there was a ``continuing exchange of information during the \ncampaign between Trump's surrogates and intermediaries of the Russian \ngovernment,'' the Attorney General said that he was ``not aware of any \nof those activities.''\n  My good friend Senator Pat Leahy asked him in writing whether he had \n``been in contact with anyone connected to any part of the Russian \ngovernment about the 2016 election.'' The Attorney General answered, \nsimply, ``No.''\n  In June, Attorney General Sessions appeared before the Senate \nIntelligence Committee. In his opening statement, he said: ``I have \nnever met with or had any conversations with any Russians or any \nforeign officials concerning any type of interference with any campaign \nor election in the United States. Further, I have no knowledge of any \nsuch conversations by anyone connected to the Trump campaign.''\n  Senator Risch asked him: ``Did you hear even a whisper, or a \nsuggestion, or anyone making reference within that campaign that \nsomehow the Russians were involved in that campaign?'' Attorney General \nSessions replied: ``I did not.''\n  Senator Joe Manchin asked him: ``Are there any other meetings between \nRussian government officials and any other Trump campaign associates \nthat have not been previously disclosed that you know of?'' Attorney \nGeneral Sessions said that he did not recall any such meetings.\n  Senator Kamala Harris asked him: ``Are you aware of any \ncommunications with other Trump campaign officials and associates that \nthey had with Russian officials or any Russian nationals?'' Attorney \nGeneral Sessions replied: ``I don't recall that.''\n  Just last month, during the Attorney General's most recent appearance \nbefore the Judiciary Committee, Senator Lindsey Graham asked him: ``Did \nanybody in the campaign--did you ever overhear a conversation between \nyou and anybody on the campaign who talked about meeting with the \nRussians?'' This time, Attorney General Sessions replied quite \ncarefully. He said: ``I have not seen anything that would indicate \ncollusion with Russians to impact the campaign.''\n  But when I asked him to clarify his shifting explanations for his own \ninteractions with the Russian Ambassador, Attorney General Sessions \nsaid that when he first heard about reports of a ``continuing exchange \nof information'' between Russians and the Trump campaign, that he was \n``taken aback by this dramatic statement that I'd never heard before \nand knew nothing about.'' He said that ``a continuing exchange of \ninformation between Trump's surrogates and intermediaries for the \nRussian government . . . did not happen, at least not to my knowledge, \nand not with me.''\n\n  Describing his January testimony, he said:\n\n       [A]nd I said, I'm not aware of those activities. And I \n     wasn't, and am not. I don't believe they occurred.\n\n  Setting aside the convenient amnesia that Attorney General Sessions \nseems to experience when asked about his own interactions with Russians \nor those he witnessed, I find it disturbing that he went so far as to \nclaim, as recently as October of this year, that he didn't believe that \nany meetings between Trump associates and Russians ever occurred.\n  Just think about the Trump campaign members we know to have met with \nRussians from publicly available information: Carter Page, former \ncampaign adviser; Paul Manafort, former campaign manager and chief \nstrategist; Michael Flynn, the disgraced former National Security \nAdvisor, who in 2015 spoke at a party honoring Russia's state-owned \ntelevision network, where he sat next to Vladimir Putin; Jared Kushner, \nWhite House senior adviser and son-in-law; and Donald Trump, Jr., the \nPresident's son. Each and every one of these former members of the \nTrump campaign have had unusual contacts with the Russians.\n  Nonetheless, just last month the Attorney General said:\n\n       I'm not aware of those activities. And I wasn't, and am \n     not. I don't believe they occurred.\n\n\n\n\n  I wanted to say to Attorney General Sessions: Listen, I understand \nthat you are recused from the Russia investigation, but do you think \nthat means you are not allowed to watch the news or read a newspaper? \nMy God, what is going on here?\n  It is clear that Attorney General Sessions has an ongoing difficulty \nremembering his own interactions with Russians and the extent to which \nhe knew about Russian contacts with other members of the Trump \ncampaign. As the record demonstrates, Attorney General Sessions has \nmisrepresented the truth about those contacts to Members of this body \ntime and time again. The interference by a hostile power in our \nNation's elections represents an attack on democracy itself, and the \ninability of our Nation's top law enforcement official to speak with a \nclear and consistent voice about what he knows of the Russian operation \nis disturbing.\n  Tomorrow morning, the Attorney General will appear before the House \nJudiciary Committee, where I am confident he will once again face \nquestions about this issue.

The Senator from Iowa.\n\n\n                           Blue-Slip Courtesy\n", "turn": 12, "speaker": "The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore", "itemno": 14}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "G000386", "text": "  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, in the last several weeks, there has \nbeen a lot of discussion regarding the blue-slip courtesy that applies \nto judicial nominations. I want to take a moment to clarify a few \nthings. My position hasn't changed. Like I said in November of last \nyear, I intend to honor the blue-slip courtesy, but there have always \nbeen exceptions.\n  First, the blue slip has always been a Senatorial courtesy. It is \npremised on the idea that home State Senators are in a very good \nposition to provide insights into a nominee from their State for the \nFederal judiciary. It is meant to encourage consultation between the \nWhite House and home State Senators about judicial nominations. That is \nwhy I value the blue-slip tradition and ask for the views of Senators \non all nominees to courts from their respective States.\n  Throughout its history, the many chairmen of the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee have applied this blue-slip courtesy differently. That is a \nchairman's prerogative. The chairman has the authority to decide how to \napply the courtesy. Over the past 100 years, there have been 18 \nchairmen of the Senate Judiciary Committee who recognized the value of \nthe blue-slip courtesy, but only 2 out of these 18 chairmen required \nboth Senators to return positive blue slips before scheduling a \nhearing.\n  The practice of sending out blue slips to home State Senators started \n100 years ago, in 1917. Chairman Charles Culberson started the blue-\nslip practice to solicit the opinions of home State Senators, but he \ndid not require the return of two positive blue slips before the \ncommittee would proceed on a nominee. In fact, in the blue slip's very \nfirst year, Chairman Culberson held a hearing and a vote for a nominee \nwho received a negative blue slip. His successors over the next nearly \n40 years had the same policy. It was not until 1956 that the blue-slip \npolicy changed under Chairman James Eastland, a Democrat from the State \nof Mississippi. Chairman Eastland began to require both home State \nSenators to return positive blue slips before holding a hearing and a \nvote.\n  Chairman Eastland, as history tells us, was well known for his \nsegregationist views. Unfortunately, it is likely that he adopted a \nstrict blue-slip policy to veto judicial nominees who favored school \ndesegregation. This is what Villanova Law School Professor Tuan Samahon \nexplained: ``When segregationist `Dixiecrat' Senator John Eastland \nchaired the Judiciary Committee, he endowed the blue slip with veto \npower to, among other things, keep Mississippi's federal judicial \nbranch free of sympathizers with Brown v. Board of Education.''\n  After Chairman Eastland retired in 1979, Senator Kennedy became \nchairman. He got rid of Senator Eastland's policy. He didn't want a \nsingle Senator to be able to unilaterally veto a judicial nominee. \nSenator Kennedy's policy was that an unreturned or negative blue slip \nwouldn't prevent the committee from conducting a hearing on a nominee. \nThen along comes Senator Strom Thurmond, continuing this policy when he \nbecame chairman. So did Senator Joe Biden. So did Senator Orrin Hatch. \nEach of those chairmen allowed hearings for nominees who had negative \nor unreturned blue slips.\n  In 1989, Chairman Biden sent a letter to the White House articulating \nhis blue-slip policy. This is what Chairman Biden wrote: ``The return \nof a negative blue slip will be a significant factor to be weighed by \nthe committee in its evaluation of a judicial nominee, but it will not \npreclude consideration of that nominee unless the Administration has \nnot consulted with both home State Senators prior to submitting the \nnomination to the Senate.''\n  Obviously, chairmen from both parties saw the danger of allowing one \nor two Senators to veto a nominee for political or ideological reasons. \nMy predecessor, Chairman Leahy, reinstated Chairman Eastland's strict \nblue-slip policy. Some believe he did so in order to exert firmer \ncontrol over the new Bush administration nominees, but even he said he \nwouldn't stand for Senators abusing the blue slip to delay or block \nnominees. Chairman Leahy said the blue-slip courtesy was ``meant to \nensure that the home state Senators who know the needs of the courts in \ntheir state best are consulted and have the opportunity to make sure \nthat the nominees are qualified'' and should not be ``abused simply to \ndelay [the Committee's] ability to make progress filling vacancies.''\n  Chairman Leahy also said:\n\n       I assume no one will abuse the blue-slip process like some \n     have abused the use of the filibuster to block judicial \n     nominees on the floor of the Senate. As long as the blue-slip \n     process is not being abused by home-state Senators, then I \n     will see no reason to change that tradition.\n\n  As I have said all along, I will not allow the blue slip to be \nabused. I will not allow Senators to block nominees for political or \nideological reasons. This position is consistent with the historical \nrole of the blue-slip courtesy. It also matches my personal experience \nwith the blue slip.\n  I am going to tell you about a personal experience I had when I first \ncame to the U.S. Senate. In my first year in the Senate, a vacancy \narose on the Eighth Circuit. At the time, I served with a Republican, \nmy senior Senator from Iowa, Roger Jepsen, and we had a Republican \nPresident, Ronald Reagan. Senator Jepsen and I thought the nominee \nshould be a State judge from Des Moines so we recommended his name to \nthe White House--not like we do now in Iowa, submit two or three names, \nfour names sometimes, for the President to pick from. In 1981, the \nWhite House decided they would like to consider another name for the \nvacancy. The other individual, Judge Fagg, was a State court judge in \nIowa. The White House interviewed the judge who was supported by both \nSenator Grassley and Senator Jepsen along with having interviewed this \nother nominee.\n\n  President Reagan, ultimately, nominated the other nominee for the \nvacancy. He was not the person Senator Jepsen and I recommended, but \nthe White House thought that he was better suited to the circuit court, \nand that ended up being the correct decision. Judge Fagg served with \ngreat distinction for more than two decades. Even though he was not our \npick, Senator Jepsen and I returned our blue slips on the nominee. That \nwas not unusual as more deference has always been given to the White \nHouse, particularly for circuit court nominees, which is different from \ndistrict court nominees.\n  When Judge Fagg was nominated to the Eighth Circuit, both Senators \nfrom Iowa were Republicans, and the blue slip practice did not change \nwhen Senator Harkin, a Democrat, was elected to the Senate, succeeding \nSenator Jepsen.\n  Senator Harkin and I served together for 30 years, and we did not \nhave any problems with judicial nominees. Generally, when there was a \nRepublican\n\n\nPresident, I sent a list of names to the President, and when there was \na Democratic President, Senator Harkin sent a list of names to the \nWhite House. We served together for those 30 years and never had any \nproblems with blue slips, not once.\n  During the Clinton administration, a vacancy arose on the Eighth \nCircuit. The White House nominated Bonnie Campbell for the court. Ms. \nCampbell was originally from New York and had previously worked for two \nDemocratic Senators. For 6 years, she served as chairwoman of the Iowa \nDemocratic Party. Ms. Campbell was elected as Iowa's attorney general \nafter having defeated the Republican candidate. She also ran for \nGovernor against Gov. Terry Branstad. After she lost that election, she \nwas appointed by President Clinton to a position within the Department \nof Justice.\n  It happens that I liked Ms. Campbell very much. She was not the type \nof nominee I would have picked for the court, but that did not stop me \nfrom returning my blue slip.\n  Ms. Campbell was a controversial nominee. During the campaign for \nGovernor, she was quoted discussing Christian conservatives. She said: \n``I hate to call them Christian because I am Christian, and I hate to \ncall them religious, because they're not, so I'll call them the radical \nright.''\n  Ms. Campbell had a very liberal record and had spent most of her \ncareer as a politician, and a lot of people did not want me to return \nher blue slip. So why did I return her blue slip? In the process, I was \ncriticized extensively by the conservative base of my State of Iowa.\n  I did that because the blue slip is not supposed to allow the \nunilateral veto of a nominee. A Senator cannot use a blue slip to block \na nominee simply because he or she does not like the nominee's politics \nor ideology. A Senator cannot use a blue slip to block a nominee \nbecause it is not the person the Senator would have picked.\n  The President gets to nominate judges. The White House should consult \nhome State Senators, and it is important that they do so in a \nmeaningful way. The White House may disagree with Senators and may \ndetermine that a different individual is more suited to serve on the \ncircuit court, but so long as there is consultation, the President \ngenerally gets to make that call. So I will not let Senators abuse the \nblue slip to block qualified nominees for political or ideological \nreasons.\n  I yield the floor.", "turn": 13, "speaker": "Mr. GRASSLEY", "itemno": 15}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "S000148", "text": "  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I rise today to highlight the \nimportance of the Gateway Project and express my continued frustration \nwith the administration's approach to infrastructure and this critical \nproject.

Time is running out, and we must quickly build new tunnels under \nthe Hudson River before the current tunnels have to be closed for \nrepairs.\n  The closing of either tunnel without a new tunnel in place would be \ndevastating because it would essentially shut down the Northeast \nCorridor, the transit route from Boston to Washington that produces \nover $3 trillion in economic output, a full 20 percent of the national \ngross domestic product. The importance of this project cannot be \noverstated.\n  Unfortunately, despite repeated campaign promises to focus on \ninfrastructure investment, President Trump has proposed severe cuts to \ninfrastructure programs, including the Capital Investment Grant \nProgram. That cut is significant because it was the likely source of \nfunding for the Gateway groject. In addition to proposing to cut the \nfunding needed for the Gateway Project, the Department of \nTransportation has been unresponsive to a number of important interim \nactions that are necessary to advance this critical project.\n  Given the lack of focus on infrastructure investment by the current \nadministration and the continued roadblocks the administration has \nerected in front of the Gateway Project, I must oppose the nomination \nof Mr. Derek Kan to be Under Secretary of Transportation.", "turn": 14, "speaker": "Mr. SCHUMER", "itemno": 16}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "G000386", "text": "  Mr. GRASSLEY.
