Mr. Speaker, I rise to support H.R. 3634, the \nSecuring Electronic Records for Veterans' Ease (SERVE) Act of 2017. \nThis is an important piece of legislation and I am proud to support it.\n  The Post-9/11 GI Bill is an educational benefit program for veterans \nwho have courageously served our country since the terrorist attacks on \nSeptember 11, 2001. Through this bill, tuition and fee payments, as \nwell as a monthly housing allowance, are paid to schools on behalf of \nveterans based on the length of their period of active duty. H.R. 3634 \ndirects the Secretary of the Department of Veterans Affairs to provide \nthese veterans with verification of the amount of their monthly housing \nstipend. This verification would also be available online in the same \nway that the VA provides information about other benefits it offers.\n  This bill is the simplest way to clarify a living expense for those \nwho have sacrificed for their country. Since 2009, this program has \nprovided benefits to over 773,000 veterans and their family members, \nproviding over $20 billion in benefits. As a representative from \nGeorgia, a state that hosts a number of military bases, supporting this \nbill is the least I can do to make life easier for veterans and their \nfamily members who are transitioning to life after active duty.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 3}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "185", "extension": true, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "E1559", "wkday": "Monday", "day": "13", "month": "November"}, "related_bills": [{"type": "HR", "context": "OTHER", "congress": "115", "number": "3634"}], "doc_title": "SECURING ELECTRONIC RECORDS FOR VETERANS' EASE ACT OF 2017", "id": "CREC-2017-11-13-pt1-PgE1559-2"}
