HICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as \nI may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 3071, introduced by my \ncolleague from Georgia (Mr. Carter), and which I have cosponsored.\n  The Federal Acquisition Savings Act of 2017 would require the \ngovernment to consider renting equipment over buying or leasing that \nequipment. The Government Accountability Office reported that agencies \nannually spend an average of more than $200 billion on purchasing or \nleasing equipment, with purchasing accounting for almost all of that \nspending.\n  The Federal Acquisition Savings Act of 2017 provides an opportunity \nto save money when obtaining equipment. The current rules encourage \nagencies to consider the most cost-effective way to obtain equipment, \nbut only between purchasing or leasing. Renting is not an option.\n  H.R. 3071 requires agencies to consider renting equipment as a cost-\nsaving measure over purchasing or leasing. The bill also directs that \nthe Federal Acquisition Regulation be revised to implement this policy. \nRenting equipment can provide a more cost-effective and flexible \nalternative to buying or leasing.\n  When purchasing equipment, the purchaser makes a long-term investment \nand assumes the total cost of ownership for that equipment. However, \nsome short-term needs can be met without assuming the cost of \npurchasing and maintaining equipment. Leasing or renting are options in \nsuch cases. Leasing should be considered, but, depending on an agency's \nneeds, leasing may not be the best low-cost option. Typically, leases \ninvolve defined leasing periods and are specific to a single piece of \nequipment.\n  In addition, leasing may require a large upfront outlay of capital, \nand, under a lease, the government is generally responsible for the \ncost of maintenance, insurance, and storage of the equipment. \nAlternatively, rental for a temporary period with no fixed duration may \nfit the need and provide a more flexible option.\n\n\n  Renting equipment may be cost-effective because rental agreements \ntypically cover costs such as storage, maintenance, insurance, \ntransport, and licensing.\n  Other State and local governments have used the equipment rental \noption with great success, but the Federal Government has not widely \nadopted this low-cost option. For example, the Texas Department of \nTransportation reported saving $10.8 million due to a rental program. \nThey reported renting more than 1,200 pieces of equipment at a cost of \n$18.9 million and purchasing 931 assets costing more than $40 million.\n  The Mississippi Department of Transportation commissioned a study on \ntheir equipment management processes and systems, and that study found \nthat renting equipment, such as bulldozers and motor graders, to \nsupplement their fleet was the most cost-effective option. In fact, \nthat study found that Mississippi could realize over $13,000 in annual \ncost savings and $180,000 in lifecycle cost savings per bulldozer unit.\n  H.R. 3071 presents an opportunity to realize cost savings in \nobtaining equipment by directing agencies to consider the rental \noption.\n  Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Representative Buddy Carter for his \nleadership on this bill. I urge my colleagues to support it, and I \nreserve the balance of my time.", "turn": 4, "speaker": "Mr. JODY B.

Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  H.R. 3071, the Federal Acquisition Savings Act, as amended, would \nrequire Federal contracting officers to consider short-term rentals in \naddition to long-term leasing or purchasing when acquiring equipment \nagencies need. I would like to thank Chairman Gowdy and Representative \nCarter for working with the minority in a bipartisan manner to address \nconcerns that were raised about the bill as introduced.\n  The Federal Acquisition Regulation is currently unclear about whether \nshort-term rentals are permitted. Rental equipment, as opposed to \npurchasing or leasing, can be a cost-effective option for Federal \nagencies in certain circumstances.\n  This bill would provide additional flexibility by allowing such \nrentals. It would also improve efficiency by requiring the cost-\neffectiveness of renting to be considered by Federal contracting \nofficers. I support giving contracting officers additional tools to \nmake the most cost-effective decisions.\n  The bill, as amended, also would require GAO to produce a report card \non the use of renting or leasing by Federal agencies. The requirements \nfor that report were very burdensome for GAO in the bill as introduced. \nI know we all value GAO's work and want to make the best use of its \nresources. I am glad that those reporting requirements have been \nstreamlined.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.", "turn": 5, "speaker": "Ms. KELLY of Illinois", "itemno": 11}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "H001071", "text": "  Mr. JODY B.

Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for \nyielding.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of my legislation, H.R. 3071, \nthe Federal Acquisition Savings Act of 2017. This legislation seeks to \nmodernize our government's outdated acquisition strategies, while \nsimultaneously acting as good stewards of valuable taxpayer dollars.\n  My bill would simply require Federal agencies to consider renting as \na cost-effective alternative in equipment acquisition, giving the \ngovernment options that the private sector has undertaken and has seen \nsuccess and cost savings with.\n  As previously reported by the Government Accountability Office, the \nGAO, the Federal Government spends more than $200 billion, on average, \neither purchasing or leasing equipment. Of those acquisition decisions, \npurchasing of equipment accounts for more than 99 percent of that \nshare.\n  Federal agencies are instructed to consider the cost-effectiveness of \nthese strategies as they move through the process, but even that has \nbeen found to be lacking. The GAO has found that, in many instances, \nFederal agencies don't even bother to undertake these analyses. That \nmeans that the taxpayers are the ones who lose out as Federal agencies \nsidestep these responsibilities and undertake what is, many times, the \neasiest but most expensive route--purchasing.\n  This is an issue the committee and this body have been looking at for \nyears. In 2012, the GAO issued a report finding that contracting \nofficials from the Air Force and Department of the Interior did not \nperform the lease-versus-purchase analysis for many of the contracts \nawarded. In July of 2013, GSA issued an RFI seeking to determine if \nthere is a distinction between leasing and renting of equipment. The \noverwhelming response to the RFI indicated that amending the Federal \nAcquisition Regulation, the FAR, to include renting would be pertinent. \nHowever, the GSI did not act on that recommendation.\n  These actions have resulted in this legislation and the good-faith \neffort to ensure taxpayer dollars are spent wisely and that the Federal \nrequirements for Federal acquisition are followed.\n  Under subpart 7.4 of the FAR, agencies are directed to conduct a \ncase-by-case evaluation of the cost between leasing and purchasing. As \nI mentioned earlier, many of those analyses aren't conducted.\n  Amending this part of FAR will open up new avenues and will allow \nthem to pursue successes and cost savings being used in the private \nsector. For instance, the Texas Department of Transportation reported \nsavings of $10.8 million within the fleet operations division. These \nsavings are realized when the additional costs of ownership are \nfactored, including maintenance, transportation, and other areas.\n\n\n  In addition to this example, the Mississippi Department of \nTransportation commissioned a study finding that they could find \nsignificant cost savings per unit if they utilized renting equipment as \nan option. Rental agreements are often thought of as short-term \ntransactions with no fixed duration. This gives the renter--in this \ncase, the Federal agencies--more say in how the equipment is used and \nthe duration of the need for that equipment. For instance, specialized \nequipment that is only needed several times a year or is needed in \nvarying locations can be sourced via renting to reduce overhead costs.\n\n  As this body continues to pursue meaningful legislation to reduce the \nburden on our constituents and streamline the government, this is a \ngreat step forward. My bipartisan legislation will reduce waste in the \nFederal Government while giving them the opportunity to pursue new and \ninnovative ways to source equipment.\n  Too often, we see areas of mismanagement within the Federal \nGovernment that can and should be addressed, and this is a chance to \nhelp correct the ship one step at a time.\n  This bipartisan legislation passed the Oversight and Government \nReform Committee with overwhelming support, and I thank my colleagues \non the committee and on this bill for their support and persistence in \naddressing shortfalls in the Federal Government.\n  Mr. Speaker, please join me in support of this legislation and help \nus ensure future acquisition decisions are done with the taxpayers in \nmind.", "turn": 7, "speaker": "Mr. CARTER of Georgia", "itemno": 13}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "K000385", "text": "  Ms. KELLY of Illinois.
