Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and career of \nArt Doucette. Art is a science teacher at Sequoia High School, a \ncommunity day school in Merced that provides second chances to at-risk \nstudents. Art's passion for teaching and the enthusiasm with which he \nrelates scientific concepts to even his most challenging students has \nmade him a classroom favorite at Sequoia and a model for teachers \nthroughout Merced County.\n  Born in Arkansas to a military family, Art moved over seventy times \nacross the United States and abroad as a child. One ofhis childhood \nhomes was in Merced County, a community that would greatly benefit from \nArt's work in the years to come. As a young adult, Art worked as a \nfinish carpenter until a serious injury prompted him to attend Cuesta \nCollege in pursuit of a new career. It was there that Art met the love \nof his life, Holly, whom he married in 2000. After studying chemistry \nand biology at Stanislaus State, Art began his teaching career. He \neventually found himself back in Merced County, where he has now taught \nand inspired countless students for over a decade.\n  Teaching at Sequoia High School offers a unique set of challenges not \nfound at most high schools. Sequoia students often come from adverse \nbackgrounds and struggle with a wide range of behavioral problems. It \nis in this environment that Art has flourished as an engaging and \ndedicated educator, characterized by a genuine passion for his subject \nand unwavering faith in his students.\n  Not long ago, Art was diagnosed with cancer and has since had to \nspend much of his time outside the classroom, seeking medical care. It \nhas not been an easy road, and the pain and heartache associated with \nsuch a diagnosis is only made more acute by the absence felt by Art's \nstudents and colleagues. However, with his wife, Holly, and son, James, \nby his side, Art is courageously undergoing treatment and hopes to be \nback at Sequoia soon. In his honor, Sequoia High School and its \naffiliated network of schools are celebrating Art's devotion and \nlasting contributions to his community with an Art Doucette Honor \nSquare Dedication Day. I stand with the students and staff of Sequoia \nHigh School in my support and encouragement for Art and his family \nduring this difficult time, and in our shared gratitude for the \ndifference he has made in Merced.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in honoring the life and \ncareer of Art Doucette. Art's relentless positivity and eagerness to \nresume teaching--even in the face of immense personal hardship--is both \nhumbling and inspiring. Though the impact Art has made on the community \nhas not waned, his presence at Sequoia High School is greatly missed. \nHis colleagues, his students, and I all look forward to his return to \nthe classroom.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. COSTA", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 3}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "185", "extension": true, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "E1555", "wkday": "Monday", "day": "13", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "HONORING THE LIFE AND CAREER OF ART DOUCETTE", "id": "CREC-2017-11-13-pt1-PgE1555-3", "title": "HONORING THE LIFE AND CAREER OF ART DOUCETTE"}
