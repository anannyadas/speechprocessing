Mr. Speaker, on November 6th, 7th, 8th, and 9th, I \nwas ill, so I was not present for the Roll Call votes held on those \ndays. Had I been present, I would have voted:\n  ``Aye'' on Roll Call 607, on the motion to suspend the rules and pass \nH.R. 3562, to amend title 38, United States Code, to authorize the \nSecretary of Veterans Affairs to furnish assistance for adaptations of \nresidences of veterans in rehabilitation programs under chapter 31 of \nsuch title, and for other purposes.\n  ``Aye'' on Roll Call 608, on the motion to suspend the rules and pass \nH.R. 1066, the VA Management Alignment Act.\n  ``No'' on Roll Call 609, on approving the journal.\n  ``No'' on Roll Call 610, on ordering the previous question on H. Res. \n607, providing for consideration of the bill (H.R. 3043) Hydropower \nPolicy Modernization Act and providing for consideration of the bill \n(H.R. 3441) Save Local Business Act.\n  ``No'' on Roll Call 611, on agreeing to H. Res. 607.\n  ``No'' on Roll Call 612, on approving the journal.\n  ``Yea'' on Roll Call 613, on the motion to recommit H.R. 3441, the \nSave Local Business Act.\n  ``No'' on Roll Call 614, on passage of H.R. 3441. This bill would \neffectively eliminate joint employment from the National Labor \nRelations Act and Fair Labor Standards Act, blocking workers from \nholding a joint employer accountable for wage theft, equal pay \nviolations, and other unfair labor practices. Today, many employers \nseek to avoid their legal obligations to ensure that workers receive \nthe wages they are due and bargain in good faith, and H.R. 3441 would \nmake it more difficult for workers to hold the joint employers who set \nmany of the conditions of their work accountable.\n  ``No'' on Roll Call 615, on the motion to suspend the rules and pass \nH.R. 3911, the Risk-Based Credit Examination Act. H.R. 3911 would \nweaken oversight of major credit rating agencies such as S&P and \nMoody's, which were at the center of the 2008 financial crisis, and \ncreate the possibility of credit rating agencies challenging the SEC in \ncourt if they felt the examinations were not ``appropriate''.\n  ``No'' on Roll Call 616, on ordering the Previous Question on H. Res. \n609, providing for consideration of H.R. 2201, the Micro Offering Safe \nHarbor Act.\n  ``No'' on Roll Call 617, on passage of H. Res. 609.\n  ``Yea'' on Roll Call 618, on the motion to suspend the rules and pass \nH.R. 4173, the Veterans Crisis Line Study Act.\n  ``Yea'' on Roll Call 619, the Rush Amendment to H.R. 3043.\n  ``No'' on Roll Call 620, on passage of H.R. 3043, the Hydropower \nPolicy Modernization Act. I recognize the need and importance of \nmodernizing the licensing process for hydropower projects to both power \ncompanies and the workers who build, operate, and maintain them. \nHowever, I have concerns that H.R.\n\n\n3043 ignores constructive suggestions that would improve the licensing \nprocess while still maintaining environmental protections and will \nusurp the authorities of states, tribes, and federal natural resource \nagencies.\n  ``Yea'' on Roll Call 621, on the motion to suspend the rules and pass \nH.R. 3705, the Veterans Fair Debt Notice Act.\n  ``No'' on Roll Call 622, the Micro Offering Safe Harbor Act.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Ms. ROYBAL-ALLARD", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 3}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "185", "extension": true, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "E1560-E1561", "wkday": "Monday", "day": "13", "month": "November"}, "related_bills": [{"type": "HRES", "context": "OTHER", "congress": "115", "number": "607"}, {"type": "HRES", "context": "OTHER", "congress": "115", "number": "609"}, {"type": "HR", "context": "OTHER", "congress": "115", "number": "1066"}, {"type": "HR", "context": "OTHER", "congress": "115", "number": "2201"}, {"type": "HR", "context": "OTHER", "congress": "115", "number": "3043"}, {"type": "HR", "context": "OTHER", "congress": "115", "number": "3441"}, {"type": "HR", "context": "OTHER", "congress": "115", "number": "3562"}, {"type": "HR", "context": "OTHER", "congress": "115", "number": "3705"}, {"type": "HR", "context": "OTHER", "congress": "115", "number": "3911"}, {"type": "HR", "context": "OTHER", "congress": "115", "number": "4173"}], "doc_title": "PERSONAL EXPLANATION", "id": "CREC-2017-11-13-pt1-PgE1560-3"}
