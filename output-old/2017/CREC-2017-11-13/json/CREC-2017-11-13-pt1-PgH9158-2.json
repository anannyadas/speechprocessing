Mr. Speaker, as co-chair of the bipartisan Career and \nTechnical Education Caucus, I rise in recognition of National \nApprenticeship Week.\n  Apprenticeships, Mr. Speaker, provide valuable industry-driven job \ntraining for students of all ages, preparing them for careers in high-\nskilled, high-demand fields. They are a proven workforce development \ntool that is crucial to meeting the demands of skilled trades, \nhealthcare, and IT businesses, among many others, all of which \ncurrently face a significant shortage of qualified workers.\n  Now, this summer, the House passed the Strengthening Career and \nTechnical Education for the 21st Century Act with strong bipartisan \nsupport, which promotes work-based learning as a key component of CTE \nprograms.\n  My colleagues on both sides of the aisle and on both sides of the \nCapitol tout the value of apprenticeships. Now, Mr. Speaker, it is so \nimportant that we back our words with action by passing the \nStrengthening CTE Act into law and providing robust funding for \napprenticeship programs across the Nation.\n  It is the right thing to do for our young people. It is the right \nthing to do for our workforce. It is the right thing to do for our \nNation.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. LANGEVIN", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "185", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H9158", "wkday": "Monday", "day": "13", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "NATIONAL APPRENTICESHIP WEEK", "id": "CREC-2017-11-13-pt1-PgH9158-2", "title": "NATIONAL APPRENTICESHIP WEEK"}
