Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, cybersecurity is critical to consumers, investors, \nmarket participants and, frankly, the very markets themselves. However, \nin April of 2016, the GAO--the Government Accountability Office--\nidentified weaknesses regarding information security protocols at the \nSecurities and Exchange Commission, and noted that the SEC's failure to \nimplement an agencywide data security program had occurred.\n  Once confirmed in May of this year, SEC Chairman Jay Clayton \ninitiated an assessment of the SEC's internal cybersecurity risk \nprofile and their approach to cybersecurity from a regulatory and \noversight perspective. The SEC's internal assessment found that the \nagency had inadequate controls and that there were serious cyber and \ndata risks.\n  Unfortunately, in September of this year, Chairman Clayton issued a \nstatement on cybersecurity in which he revealed that a cyber breach \n``previously detected in 2016 may have provided illicit gain through \ntrading.''\n  Specifically, a software vulnerability existed in the test filing \ncomponent of the SEC's Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis, and \nRetrieval--also known as the EDGAR system--which resulted in access to \nnonpublic information. While this breach provided hackers access to \nhighly sensitive material, at the time, the SEC believed ``the \nintrusion did not result in unauthorized access to personally \nidentifiable information''--or PII, as we commonly refer to it--\ntherefore, ``jeopardize the operations of the SEC, or result in a \nsystemic risk.'' And that was a quote from the SEC's report.\n  However, unfortunately, in a follow-up disclosure shortly after that, \nChairman Clayton revealed that personally identifiable information, \nincluding names, birth dates, Social Security numbers, were actually \ncompromised for two individuals in that particular breach.\n  The GAO report and the EDGAR data breach underscore what is now even \nof greater concern, the sufficiency of risk control mechanisms for the \nSEC-approved consolidated audit trail, or also known as the CAT system. \nThe CAT will be the most comprehensive repository of market data we \nhave seen, and it will collect and identify every order, cancellation, \nand trade execution for all exchange-listed equities and options across \nall U.S. markets. It will also collect personally identifiable \ninformation beginning 1 year after it begins accepting market data.\n  Thesys Technologies, which was selected to be the plan processor for \nthe CAT, is scheduled to begin accepting data from self-regulatory \norganizations who must provide data to CAT on Wednesday, November 15, \njust merely days from today.\n  Many of my colleagues, as well as market participants, have voiced \nconcerns about the cost of building and implementing such a system and \nthe amount of PII that will be required to be collected by the CAT.\n  Last Congress, several Members wrote to former SEC Chair Mary Jo \nWhite expressing serious concerns\n\n\nabout the security of such sensitive information held within that CAT \nsystem, as well as those who will have access to such information.\n  As I mentioned, the deadline for the SROs to begin reporting to this \nCAT system is just 2 days away. It is paramount that the SEC has \nadequate data security controls in place before that implementation.\n  Previously, in committee, I had put it this way: That is a repository \nof the information of gold. Gold is the equivalent of information \ntoday. What they are doing is they are putting more gold into that data \nvault, and we don't have the security to support it.\n  So while the CAT may be a helpful resource for the SEC, and even the \nself-regulatory agencies or organizations--SROs--once fully \nimplemented, insufficient data security controls will undermine \nconfidence in our markets and may very well result in the CAT being \ncounterproductive.\n  Thus, I joined with Financial Services Committee Chairman Hensarling \nin writing Chairman Clayton to ``encourage the SEC to delay \nimplementation of the CAT system until the SEC can implement \ninformation security safeguards and internal controls to ensure the \nsecurity of confidential and sensitive data.''\n  No assurances for a delay in implementing the CAT have been provided, \nand even if they have, it is appropriate for Congress to set baseline \nstandards to ensure that controls are in place. In other words, Mr. \nSpeaker, we are trying to do our job.\n  H.R. 3973, the Market Data Protection Act, introduced by \nRepresentatives Davidson and Sherman, is necessary to ensure that the \nSEC is properly securing critical data that supports our financial \nmarkets as well as the personal information of millions of customers \nwith broker-dealer accounts.\n  Specifically, the bipartisan legislation would mandate that the SEC, \nFINRA, and the operator of the consolidated audit trail, in \nconsultation with the SEC's chief economist, develop comprehensive \ninternal risk control mechanisms to safeguard and govern the storage of \nmarket data, all market data-sharing agreements, and all academic \nresearch using that market data.\n  The bill also halts market data reporting to the consolidated audit \ntrail until the operator of the CAT system develops such internal risk \ncontrol mechanisms that they are deemed satisfactory.\n  The EDGAR security breach and the recent massive Equifax data \nbreach--and I might add, Mr. Speaker, we just saw a report of an NSA \nbreach that had just happened, our largest database--well, this would \nbecome the second largest database in the country.\n\n  Those breaches--in which the sensitive information of nearly 150 \nmillion Americans have been compromised, in the Equifax breach--only \nunderscore the importance of proactively ensuring that any highly \nsensitive data being collected by the Securities and Exchange \nCommission or at the SEC's discretion, subject to their oversight, is \nprotected with appropriate safeguards. We owe that to the American \npeople.\n  The importance of cybersecurity at the SEC cannot be overstated. The \nSEC's ability to safeguard nonpublic financial information and other \nhighly sensitive data instills confidence in the markets.\n  SEC Commissioner Michael Piwowar recently commented regarding CAT \nthat ``deadlines are important, but the SEC has one chance to get this \nright. We have to make sure that we have everything locked down. We can \nget it done, or we can get it done right. We need to get it done \nright.''\n  I couldn't agree more with Commissioner Piwowar. That is why this \nlegislation is so urgently needed. I commend the bipartisan work of \nRepresentatives Davidson and Sherman, and I urge my colleagues to vote \nin favor of this very important bill.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.", "turn": 4, "speaker": "Mr. HUIZENGA", "itemno": 10}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "S000344", "text": "  Mr. SHERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I want to commend the sponsor of this legislation, the \ngentleman from Ohio (Mr. Davidson). It was a pleasure working with him, \nand I am pleased that he and I introduced this legislation.\n  This legislation deals with a broader issue of cybersecurity. From \nEquifax to Moscow, worldwide, people are concerned with cybersecurity. \nOne particular part of cybersecurity that is important is the SEC's \naccumulation of very sensitive data, whether it be about individuals \nand their trading, or about the overall market.\n  In September, the SEC disclosed that hackers had breached the SEC \nEDGAR database, which is the home to millions of public and nonpublic \nfilings, and that that breach had occurred in 2016. The breach, which \nwas not discovered until August of this year, may have led to some \nillicit trading activities.\n  This bill requires the SEC to develop and implement cybersecurity \nrisk controls to ensure that market data is protected. This will help \nprotect our markets from harmful disruptions and manipulative trading.\n  In addition, this bill requires that FINRA--the Financial Industry \nRegulatory Authority--and the operator of the new consolidated audit \ntrail develop and implement risk controls to protect the data they \nstore. The new consolidated audit trail system will not accept data \nuntil they have the cybersecurity risk controls necessary to protect \nit.\n  Once the CAT, or consolidated audit trail, is operational, it will \nserve an important purpose in assisting the SEC in identifying issues \nthat deserve investigation. But it will also store a large amount of \ndata, and it is important that this data be secure. We must ensure that \nthere are proper controls in place.\n  Now, this bill passed our committee by a vote of 59-1 in its present \nform. There was an effort after the bill passed committee to try to \nbroaden the bill, and it may very well be that other related issues \nneed to be dealt with by this House. But I think we made the right \ndecision in bringing to the floor today the bill that passed our \ncommittee 59-1.\n  We should then have hearings and perhaps work on additional \nlegislation that will add to our ability to provide for cybersecurity \nin this area. I look forward to working with the chairman of the \nsubcommittee, and Mr. Davidson, and so many others, on additional \nlegislation designed to ensure our cybersecurity is as good as it can \nbe, and to make sure that we are not putting information into systems \nunless we are sure that everything has been done so the systems can \nprotect that information.\n  Mr. Speaker, I call upon all of our colleagues to support this \nlegislation that had 59-1 support in our committee, and I reserve the \nbalance of my time.", "turn": 5, "speaker": "Mr. SHERMAN", "itemno": 11}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "H001058", "text": "  Mr. HUIZENGA.

Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to work with \nMr. Sherman and the rest of the committee on this bill. It is indeed \nimpressive that it was 59-1 in our committee in its present form. It \ndoes do some really good things, and I think the message that it really \nsends is that it is important for our government agency to lead by \nexample.\n  The SEC holds people that they oversee accountable for maintaining \ncybersecurity and protecting personally identifiable information.\n  What we know: on September 20, Chairman Clayton highlighted that they \nhad had a breach of the EDGAR system. This follows on an April 2016 \nreport by the GAO that highlighted some concerns with their \ncybersecurity program with SEC. The concerning thing is that when \nChairman Clayton took over the SEC, he found this so much time \nafterwards. It wasn't part of his in-briefing. So there is a real \nconcern that there could be some systemic cybersecurity risks there.\n  I think it is great that our committee came together to provide SEC a \nmandate to get their own house in order in quick fashion, and to do \nthat with not just their existing products, but with products that are \non the cusp of launching: notably, the consolidated audit trail.\n\n\n  The consolidated audit trail became the subject of some additional \nconcerns because it is so close to launching.\n\n\nWhat we are trusting here is that Chairman Clayton does the right \nthing--takes the message from this vote that we are about to take, and \nthen begins to work with our committee to get this cybersecurity risk \nunder control to provide the assurances that the American people want \nand that the markets need in order to trust that no more data is \ncollected and made vulnerable than is necessary to accomplish the \nmission, but that whatever data is made available is secure.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge all of our colleagues to support the passage of \nthis bill.", "turn": 7, "speaker": "Mr. DAVIDSON", "itemno": 13}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "S000344", "text": "  Mr. SHERMAN.
