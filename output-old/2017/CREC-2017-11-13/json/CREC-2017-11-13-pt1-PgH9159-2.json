Mr. Speaker, I rise to ask for my colleagues' \nsupport for the Senator Paul Simon Study Abroad Program Act, which I \nintroduced along with my good friend, Congresswoman Cheri Bustos.\n  As a former Florida certified teacher, I know that education is the \nkey to unlocking long-lasting and positive change in all of our \ncommunities. But in today's interconnected world, students must gain \nforeign language skills and the ability to learn from other cultures.\n  Study abroad programs are an excellent way to learn these essential \nskills. However, Mr. Speaker, the ability to study abroad remains just \na dream for rural, minority, and first-generation college students.\n  Cheri Bustos and I filed this bill to address this problem by \nestablishing a competitive grant program that will allow universities \nto provide low-income and other underrepresented undergraduates with \nthe means to be able to study abroad.\n  Mr. Speaker, the Senator Paul Simon Study Abroad Program Act is a \ncommonsense bill that will help our students gain essential skills and \nempower them to thrive in a global and interconnected marketplace, and \nI thank my friend, Congresswoman Bustos, for allowing me to enter this \nbill with her.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "185", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H9159", "wkday": "Monday", "day": "13", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "STUDENTS GAIN ESSENTIAL SKILLS IN A GLOBAL AND INTERCONNECTED MARKETPLACE", "id": "CREC-2017-11-13-pt1-PgH9159-2", "title": "STUDENTS GAIN ESSENTIAL SKILLS IN A GLOBAL AND INTERCONNECTED  MARKETPLACE"}
