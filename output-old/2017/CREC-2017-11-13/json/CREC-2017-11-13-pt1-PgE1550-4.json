Mr. Speaker, today I recognize Mr. William J. Gaul, Jr. \nof Delaware County, Pennsylvania. Mr. Gaul served his country during \nthe Vietnam War and continued his selfless work upon arriving home to \nUpper Darby, Pennsylvania.\n  While in Vietnam, Mr. Gaul went above and beyond his duties through \nhis volunteer work. In his free time he taught English in a local \nschool and brought food, clothing, and medical supplies to an \norphanage. Mr. Gaul exemplified the true mission of America in Vietnam \nby working to improve the lives of the local community.\n  Upon returning to Upper Darby, Mr. Gaul remained active in his own \ncommunity. He has served as Emergency Management Coordinator since \n1980, is a member of the Upper Darby School Board, and also serves on \nthe Upper Darby Township Square Club. Mr. Gaul even led a fundraiser to \nprovide bullet-proof vests for his local police department.\n  As seen during his time in Vietnam, Mr. Gaul's good works go further \nthan his local community. In 2005, he spent 8 weeks in New Orleans, \nproviding help in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina.\n  Mr. William J. Gaul has shown throughout his life that he is willing \nto go above and beyond the call of duty to provide for others. I thank \nhim for honorably serving our country and the public with passion and \ncommitment\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. MEEHAN", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 3}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "185", "extension": true, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "E1550", "wkday": "Monday", "day": "13", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "IN RECOGNITION OF WILLIAM J.
