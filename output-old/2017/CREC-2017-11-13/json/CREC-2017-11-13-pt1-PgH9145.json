HICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as \nI may consume.\n  I rise today in support of H.R. 3739, a bill I introduced to limit \nthe allowances paid to former Presidents.\n  Congress passed the Former Presidents Act of 1958 to maintain the \ndignity of the Office of the President and assist former Presidents who \ndid not have sufficient financial resources. It is a noble purpose, but \ntimes have changed. When the Former Presidents Act was passed, Herbert \nHoover and Harry Truman were the only two former living Presidents. \nUnlike the more recent former Presidents, they did not earn millions of \ndollars from speaking fees and book deals after leaving office.\n  For example, President Clinton earned more than $100 million in \nspeaking fees between 2001 and 2013. President George W. Bush received \n$10 million for his book deal. In April 2017, President Obama spoke at \na Wall Street firm for a fee of $400,000, and he and the former First \nLady also reportedly signed a joint book deal worth over $65 million.\n  It is a fact of the modern Presidency that these lucrative financial \nopportunities are available now as they were not to former Presidents. \nBecause of these opportunities, it is no longer necessary to provide \ntaxpayer-funded support to former Presidents in the same way as \nenvisioned in 1958.\n  H.R. 3739 presents a fair way to reduce taxpayer support to those \nformer Presidents who no longer need such assistance. Furthermore, with \nour Nation facing $20 trillion in debt, we must find ways to save \ntaxpayer money, and our former Presidents will lead by example in \ncutting costs under this bill.\n  The Presidential Allowance Modernization Act reforms pensions and \nallowances provided to former Presidents and surviving spouses and \nreduces unnecessary costs to the taxpayer.\n  This bill sets a former President's pension at $200,000, compared to \ncurrent law where the pension is linked to the Cabinet Secretary's pay \nlevel, currently at $204,700. Surviving spouses of former Presidents \nwill be eligible for a pension of $100,000, a more realistic amount \nthan the $20,000 pension available under current law.\n  Currently, former Presidents are also eligible for other benefits \npaid through annual appropriations. These include\n\n\noffice space and leases, furniture and supplies, and staff salaries. \nSuch additional benefits provided to former Presidents totaled $2.84 \nmillion in fiscal year 2017 and $2.43 million the year before.\n  Instead, this bill will provide a $500,000 lump sum allowance for \neach eligible former President to cover such expenses. This allowance \nwill be reduced dollar-for-dollar for any earned income in excess of \n$400,000. For example, a former President making $900,000 in earned \nincome would not be eligible for the allowance.\n  For former Presidents eligible for the allowance, the allowance will \ndecrease over time. Five years after the former President has left \noffice, the allowance is reduced to $350,000, and then 10 years later, \nthe allowance is reduced to $250,000.\n  In the 114th Congress, the Presidential Allowance Modernization Act \nof 2016 was passed, but it was not signed into law. Senator Joni Ernst \nand I have worked with other stakeholders to improve the bill in 2017. \nThis 2017 bill advances the same principles of accountability and \nmodernization as the 2016 legislation but makes some key changes.\n  First, the bill provides a 6-month period after the date of enactment \nbefore the bill takes effect to ensure current former Presidents have \ntime to plan for the changes.\n  Second, the bill increases the allowance amount from $200,000 in the \nprevious bill language to $500,000. However, as described earlier, this \nallowance decreases over time, but it is not entirely eliminated should \na former President be eligible for the allowance.\n  The office of the former President is an important institution to \nsupport in a nominal way. We were all recently reminded of the \nimportance of this institution by the joint effort of former Presidents \nto raise hurricane relief funds.\n  The third change made in this version of the bill is the pension and \nallowance are terminated 30 days after the death of a former \nPresident--instead of immediately upon death. This change was made to \naccommodate the work that must be done to wrap up the affairs of a \nformer President.\n\n\n  Finally, I want to assure my colleagues that this bill does not \nimpact funding for the security or protection of a former President.\n  Again, I want to thank Senator Ernst for her work on this bill in the \nprevious years and this particular bill in 2017. It has been a real \npleasure to work with her and her staff.\n  I want to acknowledge Members such as Mr. Cummings, Mr. Grothman, and \nthe former chairman, Mr. Chaffetz, whose work on this bill last year \npositioned us to be successful this year. I also want to express my \ngratitude to the professional staff on the House Oversight and \nGovernment Reform Committee, who have put in so many hours of work on \nthis legislation.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve \nthe balance of my time.", "turn": 4, "speaker": "Mr. JODY B.

Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Speaker, this legislation would amend the Former Presidents Act \nof 1958 to cap a former President's annual pension at $200,000 indexed \nto inflation. The bill also would provide an additional annual \nallowance for expenses that would start at $500,000 per year and \ndecrease gradually to $250,000. Under this bill, the annual allowance \nwould be reduced dollar for dollar in instances in which a former \nPresident's adjusted gross income in a taxable year exceeds $400,000.\n  Taxpayers should not have to pay for a former President's allowance \nif the former President is making a comfortable living earning millions \nof dollars a year, as many former Presidents do. This legislation would \nnot affect any funding for the security and protection of former \nPresidents and their spouses. This legislation would update the pension \namount for surviving spouses of former Presidents, which has been \nunchanged since 1958, by increasing it from $20,000 to $100,000.\n  Last Congress, President Obama vetoed a previous version of this \nlegislation because it would have had unintended consequences. For \nexample, due to technical drafting errors, it would have resulted in \nthe immediate termination of the salary and benefits of certain staff \nof the former Presidents. It would also have resulted in the \ntermination of leases for office space and the removal of furniture and \nequipment. That was clearly not an acceptable situation, and I am glad \nwe have been able to resolve these problems in the legislation before \nus today.\n  I believe this bill makes fiscal sense, and I urge Members to support \nit.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from the District \nof Columbia (Ms. Norton).", "turn": 5, "speaker": "Ms. KELLY of Illinois", "itemno": 14}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "N000147", "text": "  Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend from Illinois for \nyielding to me.\n  I would also like to thank Representative Hice, our own Chairman \nGowdy, and Ranking Member Cummings for including in this bill, like the \nsimilar bill from the last Congress, an update to the Former Presidents \nAct to reflect the positively changed status of the District of \nColumbia government since the enactment of the Former Presidents Act of \n1958. As it affects the District of Columbia, this bill provides an \nupdate to indeed reflect the law regarding the District of Columbia as \nit is now as opposed to how it was at the time the Former Presidents \nAct was originally passed in 1958.\n  In 1958, the District of Columbia had no elected local government. It \ndidn't have any member of this body to draw this matter to the \nattention of the House. Instead, the D.C. government was run by three \nPresidentially appointed commissioners, and all locally raised D.C. \nfunds were deposited in the U.S. Treasury--locally raised, but put \nright there in the Treasury--and the Federal Government paid the \nemployer contribution of the pensions of D.C. government employees. You \ncan see why D.C. thought of itself at that time as a colony of the \nUnited States of America.\n  We have changed all that. Thanks to the Home Rule Act and the work of \nthis Congress, this bill would treat employment of former Presidents \nand the widows of former Presidents in the District government in the \nsame manner as employment in other local and State governments.\n  The Former Presidents Act was intended to prevent former Presidents \nand widows of former Presidents from double-dipping in the Treasury by \ncollecting a Federal pension during any period they were employed by \nthe Federal Government or the D.C. government, just in case that \nhappened. However, the Former Presidents Act became outdated with \nrespect to the D.C. government after Congress passed the Home Rule Act \nof 1973, and it needs to be updated.\n  The Home Rule Act granted the District of Columbia a locally elected \ngovernment. Under the Home Rule Act, D.C. local funds consisting of \nlocal taxes and fees are deposited in D.C. government accounts, not the \nU.S. Treasury. Also, because of the Home Rule Act, former Presidents \nand widows of former Presidents would not be double-dipping by \ncollecting both a Federal pension and a salary from the D.C. government \nbecause they are funded by what is now different governments.\n  I am very grateful that the House passed this bill last year. This \nis, of course, leftover business from more than 40 years ago.\n", "turn": 6, "speaker": "Ms. NORTON", "itemno": 15}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "  The SPEAKER pro tempore.
