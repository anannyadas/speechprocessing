PETER J. VISCLOSKY\n\n                               of indiana\n\n                    in the house of representatives\n\n                       Monday, November 13, 2017\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "V000108", "text": "  Mr. VISCLOSKY. Mr. Speaker, it is with great pleasure and sincerity \nthat I take this time to congratulate thirty individuals who will take \ntheir oaths of citizenship on Friday, November 17, 2017. This memorable \noccasion will be held at the United States Courthouse and Federal \nBuilding in Hammond, Indiana.\n   America is a country founded by immigrants. From its beginning, \nsettlers have come from countries around the world to the United States \nin search of better lives for their families. Oath ceremonies are a \nshining example of what is so great about the United States of \nAmerica--that people from all over the world can come together and \nunite as members of a free, democratic nation. These individuals \nrealize that nowhere else in the world offers a better opportunity for \nsuccess than here in America.\n   On November 17, 2017, the following people, representing many \nnations throughout the world, will take their oaths of citizenship in \nHammond, Indiana: Suzanna Krivulskaya, Krysta Carmella Ma Abuyo Mapoy, \nJohn\n\n\nMutua Imanene, Saroja Valluru, Slavko Veljanoski, Marija Veljanoska, \nMaher Awwad, Haya Daoud, Maria Diaz, Adriana Garcia, Eva Tanghal \nHernandez, Feda Ahmad Mattour, Slavica Todoroski, Anna Sijie Xiong, \nShuhui Grace Yang, Gail Patrich Mendoza de Chavez, Chao Ye, Norma \nAlicia Bautista, Suyapa Rodriguez Handres, Vicar Serrano Valencia, Ivan \nDidier Ros, Soammy Silvia Aguilar, Mira Deven Patel, Maria Guadalupe \nCoria Espino, Connie Withers, Hebah Allan Musleh, Titilayo Folasade \nAloba, Maureen Wanjiru Papai, Oscar Barajas, and Rosa Nelly Chavez.\n   Although each individual has sought to become a citizen of the \nUnited States for his or her own reasons, be it for education, \noccupation, or to offer their loved ones better lives, each is inspired \nby the fact that the United States of America is, as Abraham Lincoln \ndescribed it, a country ``. . .of the people, by the people, and for \nthe people.'' They realize that the United States is truly a free \nnation. By seeking American citizenship, they have made the decision \nthat they want to live in a place where, as guaranteed by the First \nAmendment of the Constitution, they can practice religion as they \nchoose, speak their minds without fear of punishment, and assemble in \npeaceful protest should they choose to do so.\n   Mr. Speaker, I respectfully ask you and my other distinguished \ncolleagues to join me in congratulating these individuals who will \nbecome citizens of the United States of America on November 17, 2017. \nThey, too, will be American citizens, guaranteed the inalienable rights \nto life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. We, as a free and \ndemocratic nation, congratulate them and welcome them.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. VISCLOSKY", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 3}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "185", "extension": true, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "E1549-E1550", "wkday": "Monday", "day": "13", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "HONORING NEW CITIZENS", "id": "CREC-2017-11-13-pt1-PgE1549-6", "title": "HONORING NEW CITIZENS"}
