Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3911, \nthe Risk-Based Credit Examination Act. This legislation amends the \nSecurities Exchange Act of 1934 to make the annual reporting \nrequirements of the Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating \nOrganizations (NRSROs) risk-based.\n  The Securities Exchange Act was an innovative piece of legislation \npassed to regulate the secondary trade of securities such as stocks, \nbonds, and debentures. This act led to the creation of the U.S. \nSecurities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and is the framework for the \ncurrent federal regulations on financial markets. H.R. 3911 focuses \nspecifically on federal requirements of NRSROs or credit rating \nagencies. Currently, the SEC performs annual reviews of NRSROs in eight \nreview areas for its annual reports. These reviews disproportionally \nburden smaller NRSROs in the market. H.R. 3911 allows the SEC to \nperform reviews in the eight categories based off of risk-based \nanalyses; reducing the burden on smaller credit rating agencies.\n  This legislation promotes fairness, encourages small businesses in \nour financial markets and is a simple fix for a burdensome problem. \nH.R. 3911 also helps the SEC allocate its energy more efficiently and \nuse its resources more effectively. I support this legislation, and I \nurge my fellow members to support H.R. 3911, the Risk-Based Credit \nExamination Act.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 3}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "185", "extension": true, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "E1557", "wkday": "Monday", "day": "13", "month": "November"}, "related_bills": [{"type": "HR", "context": "OTHER", "congress": "115", "number": "3911"}], "doc_title": "RISK-BASED CREDIT EXAMINATION ACT", "id": "CREC-2017-11-13-pt1-PgE1557"}
