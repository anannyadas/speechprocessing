Mr. Speaker, today I recognize Mr. George M. Roach of \nDelaware County, Pennsylvania, for his service in the U.S. Air Force. \nAfter he was honorably discharged, he became a career member of \nPennsylvania's Air National Guard and has since been deployed to Kuwait \nand Qatar.\n  In his capacity with the National Guard, Mr. Roach has also served \nmany humanitarian missions. He supported Pennsylvania's National Guard \nactivation for the response to Hurricane Katrina's devastation, and was \ndeployed again to provide recovery assistance to areas affected by \nHurricanes Gustav and Ike in 2008.\n  In 2011, Mr. Roach was deployed to Afghanistan as a Public Affairs/\nMilitary Liaison for Armed Forces Entertainment. Mr. Roach also \nparticipated in a NATO mission to support Hungarian forces and \nvoluntarily deployed himself to Houston this year to assist victims of \nHurricane Harvey. He currently has a civilian career in TV \nphotojournalism, and helped found FOX's annual ``Military Appreciation \nDay.'' He has also produced recruitment content for the Philadelphia \nPolice Department that the force uses to help bring in qualified \napplicants.\n  Mr. Roach's career speaks for itself. He's a proven humanitarian, \npublic servant, and role model for others who wish to dedicate their \nown lives to public service. I commend Mr. Roach for all his work over \nthe years and thank him for his service.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. MEEHAN", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 3}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "185", "extension": true, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "E1553", "wkday": "Monday", "day": "13", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "IN RECOGNITION OF GEORGE M.
