Mr. Speaker, the tax plan that has been proposed \nby the House Republican leadership fails to support working families \nwhile making them foot a $1.5 trillion bill.\n  Nonpartisan research projects that this legislation would raise taxes \non 38 million hardworking Americans. The impact would be far and wide \nas the tax plan would end deductions for seniors facing growing medical \nexpenses, young adults working to shrink their student debt, and \nfamilies paying State income and sales taxes.\n  This legislation would also have enormously damaging economic \nconsequences as it would leave our children to pay off its $1.5 \ntrillion price tag. We need tax reform that puts working families \nfirst, but this clearly isn't it.\n  For the sake of our economy, seniors, students, and working families, \nas well as the middle class, we must defeat this bill.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "185", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H9159", "wkday": "Monday", "day": "13", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "DEFEAT THE TAX REFORM PLAN", "id": "CREC-2017-11-13-pt1-PgH9159", "title": "DEFEAT THE TAX REFORM PLAN"}
