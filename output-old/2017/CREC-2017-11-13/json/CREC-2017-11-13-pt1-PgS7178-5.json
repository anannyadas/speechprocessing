Mr. President, I rise to speak on the nomination of \nSteven Bradbury, but first I want to speak on a much lighter subject, \nthe reason that I wore this orange tie. The University of Miami \nfootball team has a perfect record. This is hearkening back to the \nglory days, and I will tell you why I do this.\n  My neighbor and one of my best friends, Cortez Kennedy, who was \noriginally from Arkansas, was the defensive player of the year for the \nnational companionship team in 1989 at the University of Miami. Then, \nhe spent 10\n\n\nyears with the Seattle Seahawks, and he was an NFL Pro Football Hall of \nFamer.\n  I am doing this for my friend, Cortez Kennedy, whom we lost 6 months \nago to a heart attack, much too early, at the age of 48. What a Miami \nfan he was, and how proud he would be now of his cherished University \nof Miami football team and the perfect record they have thus far.\n  Mr. President, now I speak to Steven Bradbury. We have seen real \ntrouble signs lately in the transportation safety area. Last year was \nthe most deadly year on the highways in nearly a decade. Over 37,000 \npeople were killed in highway accidents in 2016, an increase of 5.6 \npercent over the previous year. Many of those fatalities were \npreventable and were caused by people not wearing seatbelts or driving \nunder the influence of alcohol or drugs or distracted drivers.\n  We need leaders in the Department of Transportation who are willing \nto speak up and take action to reduce these highway deaths. We also \nneed leaders who embrace a safety culture and ensure that defects in \nautomobiles are quickly addressed.\n  Let me talk about something that is one of the most egregious defects \nthat we have heard about--the Takata airbag fiasco. It has caused 16 \ndeaths and 180 injuries worldwide.\n  This came to my attention several years ago through the Orlando \nPolice Department in what was thought to be a fender bender in the \nmiddle of a traffic intersection. By the time they got to the driver of \nthe car, they thought it was a homicide: Her throat had been slit, and \nshe had bled to death. But, indeed, a Takata airbag had exploded--a \ndefective airbag--and all the metal surrounding the housing of the \nairbag. The defective material exploded with such force, it was as if a \ngrenade exploded right in the face of the driver.\n  There have been 16 deaths and 180 injuries worldwide. It was a fender \nbender for the lady in the middle of the intersection, but the airbag \nexploded and sent metal shards into her neck and cut her jugular.\n  A big, strapping, very muscular firefighter had a Takata airbag \nexplode in his face, and he doesn't have a left eye anymore. He can't \nbe a firefighter anymore.\n  These are just two that happened in my hometown of Orlando.\n  Many of the deaths we have seen in the Takata airbags are due to pure \nneglect, but it is also true that Takata covered up critical defect \ninformation. Information has come to light that engineers at Takata \nkept it from becoming public--these defective Takata airbags--when, in \nfact, they knew they were defective. On top of that, the regulator--the \nNational Highway Traffic Safety Administration--did not react quickly \nenough.\n  This brings us to the fact that we need people in the Department of \nTransportation who will take a strong stand for safety, and that brings \nme to the nomination of Steven Bradbury, who is up for general counsel. \nIndeed, he has had a lengthy legal career, but far too much of his \nlegal career involved working against the interests of safety.\n  For almost 2 years, Mr. Bradbury represented Takata in its response \nto our Senate Commerce Committee and in the NHTSA investigations. \nNaturally, when he came in front of our committee, I asked him if he \nwould recuse himself from all matters involving Takata if confirmed to \nthis position because he had represented Takata as their lawyer for 2 \nyears. But listen to what he said. He said that while he will recuse \nhimself from Takata airbag matters, he has not agreed to recuse himself \nfrom all Takata matters, such as their pending bankruptcy. Wait a \nminute. Are you going to recuse yourself from the client you used to \nrepresent or not? He in essence said he is not.\n  In Mr. Bradbury's legal career, he has also represented several \nairlines in antitrust and consumer proceedings--and I emphasize \nconsumer proceedings. It is hard for me to see how he will put that \npast representation aside and work for airline consumer protections. \nFor example, if you check a bag and it gets to you late, you at least \nought to get your bag fee refunded. In the Commerce Committee, we were \nable to get that into last year's FAA reauthorization bill, but it is \nanother potential conflict.\n  Drivers and consumers need champions at the Department of \nTransportation. Unfortunately, I believe Mr. Bradbury has not \ndemonstrated the ability to put consumers first; therefore, I will \noppose his nomination.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.", "turn": 2, "speaker": "Mr. NELSON", "itemno": 3}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, last month, President Trump said that \npharmaceutical companies are ``getting away with murder.'' Those were \nhis words, not mine. It is not the first time he has said it, and there \nis some truth to it. So it is time to get specific and then question \nwhy he just announced that the person who will be running the health \ndepartment for the United States of America has spent 10 years running \na pharmaceutical company.\n  Look at what is happening. When a company hikes the price of a \nlifesaving drug by 5,000 percent overnight, he is right--that is \ngetting away with murder. When the price of 4 of the top 10 bestselling \ndrugs in this country goes up by 100 percent in the last few years--we \nare not talking about one specific drug, a rare drug; no, we are \ntalking about 4 of the top 10 bestselling drugs going up 100 percent in \njust the last few years--that is getting away with murder. When \nAmericans are forced to skip doses or split pills because they can't \nafford their prescription, that is getting away with murder. When the \nadministration repeatedly delays penalties for drug companies that \nintentionally overcharge hospitals for prescription drugs, that is \ngetting away with murder.\n  So what do we find out today? After the President has said that these \ncompanies are getting away with murder, we find out that he has \nnominated the former president of one of the country's biggest drug \ncompanies as the Secretary of Health and Human Services, someone who \nhas been in that industry for 10 years running the biggest company. It \nis happening again. They are getting away with murder.\n  In the United States--the biggest economy in the world, the frontier \nfor capitalism--drug prices are higher than any other developed nation. \nThat is outrageous. So, yes, they are getting away with a lot.\n  So here is my question: Why are we letting them? Why are we literally \nputting former pharma executives in charge of healthcare policy for our \ncountry? Why can't we get anything done to actually lower drug prices \nin America?\n  I have often said that the pharmaceutical industry owns Washington. \nNow, with this announcement today, they will actually be running it.\n  Lowering prescription drug costs is my top priority. Healthcare is \none-sixth of our economy, and prescription drug costs account for over \n15 percent of all healthcare spending. This has a big impact on \nfamilies, on communities, on our economy, and on our country.\n  For most Americans, this is deeply personal. Everyone has their own \nstory. My daughter has a severe nut allergy. She keeps an EpiPen with \nher at all times. So when the price of that particular prescription \ndrug went up and up and up, like parents across the country, I noticed. \nI took action. I spoke out, moms and dads all across the country spoke \nout, and we saw some reduction in those prices. But we shouldn't have \nto have a social media campaign, a write-in campaign, and Members of \nCongress giving speeches on the floor for every single drug to see a \nreduction in prices.\n  Abigail just graduated from college. I don't want her to have to \nthink about this for the rest of her life when she is filling a \nprescription. But what about the thousands of others like her, young \npeople just starting their careers who can't afford to pay these \nskyrocketing prices? I don't want parents to worry about how to afford \nthe inhaler their kid relies on to get through the day. I don't want \nseniors to worry about how they will be able to put food on the\n\n\ntable and pay for the insulin they need. But that concern for so many--\nfor too many--is constant. As prescription drugs keep rising, so does \nthe worrying, so does the concern.\n  Over and over again, that is what I hear from my constituents. I \ndon't think one of them would tell me that they think the solution is \nto do nothing legislatively and then put the head of one of the biggest \npharmaceutical companies in our country into the job of running \nhealthcare policy. No, I don't think they would think that is going to \nfix everything. It is not fair, it is not right, and we need to do \nsomething about it.\n\n  Look at the numbers. Why is it happening? Last year alone, the drug \ncompanies spent $152 million lobbying Congress, and it is getting \nworse. They are doubling down on their bets by betting on an \nadministration with big ties to pharma. There are more than 800 \nlobbyists working for the pharmaceutical industry, meaning that almost \nevery Member of Congress is double-teamed by the lobbying force. Every \nMember of Congress now, when you look at the registrations, has two \nlobbyists assigned to them from pharma. Is it no surprise that now we \nare going to have the nominee as head of HHS, Health and Human \nServices, someone directly out of pharma? I don't think so.\n  In my first run for the Senate, in 2006, I talked about how Medicare \nshould be able to negotiate drug prices on behalf of millions of \nseniors. It was such common sense. In each Congress since 2011, I have \nintroduced bills to allow Medicare to do just that. Right now, Medicare \nis barred by law from negotiating directly with the drug companies. \nThat seems pretty crazy to me. I think 41 million seniors would have a \nlot of power. They are good at getting bargains. They want to get some \nbargains on their prescription drugs. You harness that bargaining power \nand allow the U.S. Government to negotiate on their behalf with the \npharmaceutical companies. By the way, that would not just bring drug \nprices down under Medicare for seniors; it would bring drug prices down \nfor everyone because that is such a large chunk of the people who are \nusing prescription drugs.\n  This bill has not passed year after year. Why? Is it because the \npeople don't want it? No. A recent poll found that 92 percent of people \nwant the Federal Government to negotiate drug prices for Medicare \nbeneficiaries. Ninety-two percent of the public supports the bill, and \nwe have a growing number of sponsors. Right now, they are just on my \nside of the aisle, but we have over 30 sponsors on that bill. We want \nto bring that bill up for a vote.\n  My bill to allow Medicare to negotiate for prescription drugs, \nhowever, has never been brought up for a vote. I introduced these bills \nin 2011, 2013, 2015, and in 2017, and each time there was not a vote.\n  President Trump says he is a good negotiator. He says he is in favor \nof this negotiation. He said it not just once, not just twice on the \ncampaign trail but many times. So I thought this is great. He is coming \nin, and we are immediately going to see support for my bill and support \nfor negotiating prices under Medicare part D. No, we do not see that. \nWe have seen no action at all. Instead, what do I find out? When I woke \nup this morning, I found out that he is putting the head of a big \npharmaceutical company in charge of Health and Human Services.\n  For those of us who have been doing this work for a long time now, it \nis unsettling, but it is not that surprising. It is not just the \nPresident literally nominating the head of a big drug company to be the \nSecretary of Health and Human Services--we see this kind of thing all \nthe time--but since 2000, at least 56 officials from the DEA and the \nJustice Department have gone to work for the pharmaceutical industry. \nBasically, the industry buys the expertise they need to then gum up the \nworks so we can't get anything done. Former lobbyists and execs are \npopping up all over this administration.\n  Joe Grogan works at the Office of Management and Budget. He led a \nworking group on pharmaceuticals that this administration convened. He \nhelped draft an Executive order on prescription drugs. The catch? Until \nMarch of this year, he was a lobbyist for the pharmaceutical industry.\n  What does this mean? What this means is, you have this revolving door \nwhere this is going on. You have two lobbyists for every Member of \nCongress; just talk, talk about it. What does it really mean? Let me \ntell you what it really means.\n  Insulin--the price of insulin has tripled in the last decade. A form \nof insulin that was listed at $17 per vial in 1997 costs nearly $138 in \n2016. That is a 700-percent increase. We have seen major companies jack \nup their prices in near harmony.\n  In November 2015, NovoLog increased to $236.70. Within 14 days, \nHumalog jumped to $237, and Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk have raised \ntheir prices for both even higher within the last year. Of course, one \nof those companies is the company this HHS nominee ran in North \nAmerica.\n  Healthy competition usually doesn't involve price increases in almost \nperfect sync among competitors. That is why I demanded an explanation \nfrom these companies. I demanded answers on behalf of people like Kim \nfrom Plymouth, MN. She just retired. She has diabetes. She keeps the \npen injectors after she uses them because they have small amounts of \ninsulin left, and she says it is too precious to throw them out.\n  This is in America, in 2017. Older people are keeping their insulin \ninjectors because there are a few drops in them--a drug that \nhistorically has been incredibly inexpensive and cheap. There are not \nnew developments with this drug. It is insulin. There is no reason you \nwould see this dramatic price increase, except that it is price \ngouging.\n  It doesn't have to be this way. Pharma often argues that these high \nprices are necessary for research and development. As I mentioned, \ninsulin is an old drug. It is cheap to make. It has been around for \nyears. In fact, when insulin was discovered in 1921, the original \npatent was sold to a university for just $3, for the whole patent. The \nresearchers who worked hard to develop this life-sustaining drug wanted \nto make sure--are you ready for this--that no one else would turn its \nproduction into a profitable monopoly. So those researchers, knowing \nthey had this incredible lifesaving drug, wanted to keep the prices \ndown and sold the patent for $3.\n  So then what happened? Well, they jacked up the prices over and over \nagain. As I mentioned, it was $17 per vial in 1997 to $138 in 2016--a \n700-percent increase for insulin. They didn't need to jack up those \nprices to develop a new form of insulin. It is the same insulin. They \ndid it to make money.\n\n  This isn't just a hit on consumers' pocketbooks. It is also becoming \na threat to public safety. One drug company, Kaleo, increased the price \nof a two-pack of a device containing naloxone that treats life-\nthreatening opioid overdoses.\n  We passed a bill last year, with strong bipartisan support, to be \nable to have a blueprint for this country to deal with opioid \noverdoses. The President just declared this a public health emergency, \nbut what is going on with the one drug that we know saves people from \noverdoses? Guess what. The drug companies said: Well, here is \nsomething. More people are using this drug so let's jack up the prices.\n  This form of naloxone from Kaleo has gone from $690 to $4,500 during \nthe last 3 years. This is what they did for these opioid addicts. The \ndrug companies get people hooked to begin with. We all know those \nstories are coming out right now. Then, when people get hooked and they \noverdose, they increase the price of the drug you use to help them. \nWhat a racket.\n  All of us know the opioid epidemic is becoming a bigger and bigger \npublic safety issue. In other words, there isn't a worse time to hike \nthe price up on a drug that helps first responders deal with the \nnational public health crisis. When I called the drug company out on \nthis earlier this year, that company used the same old playbook. Sure \nas clockwork, they claimed that the prices you and I see might be high, \nbut they have special programs to make sure people don't actually pay \nthese absurdly high rates for lifesaving medicine.\n  You know what, I have heard from Minnesota law enforcement \nofficials--sheriffs, police chiefs--who are shocked because the cost of \nnaloxone increased by more than 60 percent in a single year. I have \nheard from doctors who have told me their patients recovering\n\n\nfrom addiction can't afford the medication. So I can promise you that \nthe special discount programs and rebates don't apply to everyone, \ndespite what the drug companies say.\n  The role the drug companies are playing in the opioid epidemic \ndoesn't end with naloxone. That is just the beginning. In just the last \ncouple of weeks, we have seen report after report about how the greed \nof the pharmaceutical companies, as I mentioned, led to the rise of the \nepidemic to begin with. In Minnesota, 637 people died from opioid and \nother drug overdoses last year alone. That is more than homicides and \ncar crashes combined. By the way, it is not just our States, it is \nStates all over the country. Ninety-one people die from this overdose \neach day in our country. That is the reality of this crisis. Getting \naway with murder? Well, now it is actually true.\n  Two weeks ago, The New Yorker and Esquire pulled back the curtain on \nPurdue Pharma. The Sackler family, the family behind Purdue, is well \nknown for its generous donations to cancer research, medical schools, \nart museums, universities. What is less well known is the role that \nPurdue Pharma has played in the spread of OxyContin and opioid \naddiction.\n  OxyContin, the drug at the heart of the U.S. opioid epidemic, is \nregarded by many public health experts as one of the most dangerous \nproducts ever sold on a mass scale. If people have not read this \narticle in The New Yorker, you can get it online. You can read it, and \nyou better read it so you will understand why I am so mad while I am \ngiving this speech today and why I am so angry that the administration \nhas just put a pharma executive in charge of the HHS. It is not a \npharma executive, from Purdue Pharma, but this whole culture where they \nhave been allowed to do whatever they want and no one is holding them \naccountable is what has led to where we are today.\n  Purdue Pharma aggressively marketed OxyContin to physicians as a \npainkiller and claimed that the drug's delayed release mechanism would \nlimit the risk of addiction. Instead, OxyContin led to many new \naddictions, and, as we all know, many addicted patients eventually \nturned to heroin.\n  Here is what is so stunning and what is so obvious in this well-\nresearched article. The company knew OxyContin was addictive all along. \nIt knew its marketing campaign was misleading people. Steven May \nstarted at Purdue Pharma as a sales rep in 1999, and years later went \non to allege fraud against Purdue in a whistleblower lawsuit. He was \ntrained to market the drug as one ``to start with and to stay with,'' \ndespite knowledge of its addictive potential. The hits just keep \ncoming--but that happened. When you read that article, you find out \nthere were so many signs that this was addictive; that they were seeing \nit all over the country and they kept selling it. They kept telling \npeople it was good for them, they should have no pain, and it would be \nfine if they took this drug, even if they were getting one wisdom tooth \nout, whatever it is.\n  That is what happened in our country. That is how people got addicted \non opioids. Now we see lawsuits. Yes. OK. That will hold them \naccountable, to a certain degree, but do we see any action from \nCongress at all to reduce the pharmaceutical prices or to do anything \nabout this? Are there any votes in this Chamber? No, there are not.\n  CNN just released an investigation on how Endo Pharmaceuticals \nprioritizes profits over people's lives. One of their best selling \ndrugs was an opioid called OPANA ER. The drug was often abused. Addicts \nwould crush it and snort the pills, which could increase the risk of an \noverdose, so Endo Pharmaceuticals had to pull the drug off the market, \nbut that is not the whole story. Endo made a newer, more addictive \nversion of the drug, which President Trump has called ``truly evil.'' \nThe FDA got involved, for one of the first times ever, to force Endo to \nstop selling the new truly evil drug earlier this year.\n  What did Endo then do? The company then cut a deal with a generic \ndrug company to split the profits on the sales of the original version \nof the drug--you know, the one with the history of abuse. It is \nunbelievable the company will now profit off a highly dangerous opioid \nit once pulled from the market for being unsafe.\n  The FDA has linked Endo drugs to serious public health problems, such \nas outbreaks of HIV and hepatitis C, in addition to addictions and \noverdoses, but the company doesn't think those risks are good enough \nreasons to stop selling these opioids.\n  I don't think there are better examples of how greed trumps \neverything else. That is what we are talking about here. There are good \npeople who work in the pharmaceutical industry. We have always been \nproud to have innovation in America. Innovation is great, but greed \nunchecked is not. You can literally trace this opioid epidemic, where \nnow four out of five of those people who originally got hooked on legal \npharmaceuticals are now turning to heroin. You can literally trace it \nback to these very companies. That happened. Then, just when the \nepidemic gets bad and we figure out that at least you can stop drug \noverdoses with naloxone, those companies jack up those prices.\n\n  This is not a free market right now. This is a monopoly market that \nis getting people sucked into their products, either with advertising \non TV or with addictions to drugs, like opioids, then getting them into \ntheir nets, and then charging them enormous amounts of money. That is \nwhat is happening right now.\n  The examples do not end.\n  The price of Daraprim, a drug that treats malaria and other \ninfections, went up 5,000 percent overnight. The price for a multiple \nsclerosis drug went up 21 times in a decade. ARIAD Pharmaceuticals \nraised the price for a leukemia drug four times in 1 year alone. Now it \ncosts nearly $199,000 a year. The only people who can afford that drug \nare the executives at the company.\n  It is no wonder that people like President Trump are starting to say \na little bit more about the rising costs of prescription drugs. OK. \nThat is good. That is a start in talking about it, but we need action.\n  For years, the pharmaceutical lobby bought Washington's silence, but \nnow, in being faced with a nationwide crisis brought on by that silence \nand in being confronted by constituents who all agree that this is a \nproblem, many are feeling that they have to do more than just talk \nabout it. Talking and tweeting are different from doing, and actions \nspeak louder than words. There is a saying that you cannot just talk \nthe talk; you need to walk the walk. Well, it is time to walk the walk.\n  By the way, putting someone who ran a pharmaceutical company for 10 \nyears in charge of HHS, the Nation's healthcare Department for the \nentire United States of America, is not called walking that walk. There \nare actions we can take right here, right now, because the solutions \nare right here on the table.\n  Here we go.\n  First and foremost, let's finally take up that bill that would \nharness the negotiating power of 41 million seniors who are on Medicare \nand bring drug prices down. My bill would repeal the law that bans \nMedicare from using that market power to negotiate prices. Literally, \nMedicare is banned by law from negotiating prices. There are 33 \nSenators who have joined me on this bill. We could pass this if we \ncould just get a vote.\n  Second, as the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee's \nSubcommittee on Antitrust, Competition Policy and Consumer Rights, I \ncannot stress enough that competition is the best way to ensure that \nprescription drugs are affordable. Where there is a lack of \ncompetition, price increases often follow.\n  A recent poll found that 87 percent of the public agrees that we need \nto increase competition. Senator Grassley and I, the Republican of \nIowa, have a bill that, for years, we have tried to push ahead. It \ncalls for a stop to this outrageous play called pay for delay, where \nbig pharmaceutical companies actually pay off generic companies--their \ncompetitors--in order to keep their products off the market.\n  So the pharma companies go to a generic and say: Hey, I know that you \nare going to compete with me, but I will give you a little money so \nthat you can keep that product off the market for a little while, and \nthat will be better for both of us. We will give you more money than \nyou will make off the product.\n  According to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, putting an\n\n\nend to this ridiculous practice would save taxpayers $2.9 billion over \n10 years. Guess what. That is just the government's piece of it. It \nwould also save consumers because they are paying the copay money as \nwell. Once again, I cannot imagine any of my colleagues voting against \nthis legislation if it were to actually come to a vote on the Senate \nfloor. So let's let it come for a vote and see how people vote.\n  I also have a bipartisan bill with Senators Grassley, Leahy, \nFeinstein, Lee, and several others called the CREATES Act. It would put \na stop to other pharmaceutical companies' tactics, like refusing to \nprovide samples or to share important information about how to \ndistribute a drug safely, which delay more affordable generic drugs \nfrom getting to the market.\n  The FDA has received over 100 complaints about these tactics, and \naccording to the Congressional Budget Office, this legislation would \nsave $3.6 billion. Even if the drug companies are not headline grabbers \nlike Martin Shkreli, many pharmaceutical companies are using tactics to \nprevent competition. It is not just one bad guy who goes to jail. It is \na common practice. In fact, it is legally allowed right now for them \nnot to share those samples, for them to make payments to their \ncompetitors to keep the products off the market. We need to end those \npractices, and we do it by having a vote on these bills.\n  Finally, we should look beyond our borders. We should know that our \nfriends right across the border in Canada often pay less--much less--\nfor prescription drugs than we do.\n  For example, in the United States, a 90-day supply of an anti-\ninflammatory drug called Celebrex can cost more than $1,000. Canadian \npharmacies sell it for only $220. That is just one example. I could \nspend all night giving examples of where the prices in the United \nStates are more than double what they are in Canada.\n  Senator McCain and I have a bill to allow Americans to bring in \nsafe--they have to be safe--and less expensive prescription drugs from \nCanada. Our neighbors to the north have similar quality and safety \nstandards as those in the United States. Our bill has strong safety \nmeasures, too, so as to make sure that we protect American consumers \nfrom scammers or counterfeit drugs. Senator Sanders has also been a \nleader on this issue.\n  Why do we care about this, Senator McCain, Senator Sanders, and I, in \nour coming from such different perspectives? We know that we only allow \nimportation from pharmacies that have existed for 5 years, so they are \nsafe, and then have a brick-and-mortar store, not just some fly-by-\nnight website.\n  Just like Medicare negotiation, the public is overwhelmingly on our \nside, with 72 percent of people who support allowing Americans to buy \nprescription drugs that are imported from Canada, including 66 percent \nof Democrats, 77 percent of Independents, and 75 percent of \nRepublicans. So why can't we get it passed? We need to.\n  Beyond Canada, Senator Lee and I have a bill, another bipartisan \nbill, that would allow for the temporary importation of safe drugs that \nhave been on the market in another country for at least 10 years when \nthere is not healthy competition for that drug in this country.\n  We have all heard the drug companies and others say that the FDA \napproval process can take a long time, and that results in a lack of \noptions in the marketplace and higher prices. When it comes to drugs \nthat have already been sold safely in other countries for years, why \nshould we force American consumers to wait for the same options? It \ndoesn't make sense. This bill would let patients access these safe, \nless expensive drugs at the same time that they are going through the \nfull FDA approval process.\n  So the idea is to, one, allow negotiation for our biggest negotiating \nbloc--41 million seniors. That would bring prices down. The President \nsaid that he knows the art of the deal, that he is the negotiator. Well \nthen, let's get that negotiation in place and get some big-time \nlobbying for this bill instead of putting pharmaceutical executives in \ncharge of Health and Human Services.\n  The second set of ideas is about bringing in more competition. You \ncan do it with safe drugs from overseas. I think that if some of the \ndrug companies that have a monopoly on our consumers' drugs knew that \ncompetition might come in, maybe they would want to bring those drug \nprices down. In fact, I know that they would because that is how \ncapitalism works. A high school economics class could tell you that.\n  The other idea is more generics. Keep competition going by making it \neasier for generics to get their products out to market, and please \nstop the practice where the big pharma companies are paying their chief \ncompetitors, the generics--great for both of them--to keep their \nproducts off the market. Who are the losers? Americans are the losers.\n  The administration actually has the authority to take action now. \nUnder current law, we could allow for the temporary importation of less \nexpensive drugs from Canada tomorrow. What are we waiting for? I urge \nthe administration to act now. If the administration will not act, \nCongress must. We need to have those Medicare negotiations. There is so \nmuch that we could do here if we could just get a vote. Yet we cannot \nstop with just passing legislation to lower pharmaceutical prices. We \nhave to stop pharmaceutical companies from rigging the system in the \nfirst place or else we are just going to get back to where we started.\n  We have to give ethics watchdogs in Washington, like the Office of \nGovernment Ethics, real teeth. We need to overturn Citizens United and \nundo the outside influence of special interests on our elections. We \nhave given them this carte blanche to come in and influence people, and \nlook at what is happening. There is an opioid epidemic; the price of \ninsulin has gone up multiple times; four of the top 10 best-selling \ndrugs in America have gone up over 100 percent in the last 10 years. \nAll of that has happened because we have said: Come on in with all of \nyour special money. Influence people. Hire two lobbyists for each \nMember of Congress.\n  Guess what we have. That is what we have.\n  I will just remind my colleagues to talk to their constituents \nbecause I can tell you what you will find. You will find what I found--\na woman in Duluth who chose not to fill her last prescription because \nthat one medicine would cost a full 25 percent of her income; someone \nin Saint Paul who even with Medicare cannot afford $663 a month for the \ndrug; a woman from Crystal, MN, who told me ``I am practically going \nwithout food'' to pay for her prescriptions.\n  It is heartbreaking that this is happening in America. Washington has \nto stand up to the pharmaceutical industry.\n  It took a while and a lot of lawsuits and some brave people coming \nforward, but eventually, Washington stood up to Big Tobacco, and States \nstood up to Big Tobacco. They started suing. They started requiring \nlabels. They started doing more for kids so they wouldn't get hooked. \nIt made a difference.\n  It is time to take this on. There are a lot of good things that \npharmaceuticals can do to save people's lives. We know that--that is \nimportant--but what we cannot do is let them wreak havoc on people's \nbudgets. What we cannot do is give them unfettered monopoly power to \njerk us around with prices to start an opioid epidemic and then \nincrease the prices for the very drugs that can help prevent people \nfrom dying.\n  If we work together, we can get this done. Most of the bills that I \nhave mentioned are bipartisan. In fact, every one that I mentioned on \nthe Senate floor is bipartisan except for the negotiation of Medicare \nPart D, and that is the one that the President wants to see happen. So \nI don't understand. This is not just my standing here alone on this \nside of the aisle. There are people of good faith who want to move on \nthis, but I can tell you that you don't move on it by putting a \npharmaceutical executive in charge of the biggest health Department in \nthe United States of America.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.", "turn": 6, "speaker": "Ms. KLOBUCHAR", "itemno": 7}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
