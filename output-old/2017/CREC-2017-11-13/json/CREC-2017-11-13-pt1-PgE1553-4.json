Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate the life of Dr. \nNapoleon Washington, Jr., a local business owner, advocate, minister \nand community organizer in Merced County who passed away after a battle \nwith cancer. Dr. Washington's boisterous laughter, leadership, \nhumility, and genuine compassion for the people of Merced were \nqualities that will be deeply missed by our community.\n  Born on April 12, 1948 in Fort Baker, California, Dr. Washington \nmoved to Merced California with his family in 1961. He graduated from \nMerced High School in 1966, and then went on to earn an Associate of \nArts degree from Merced College and a Bachelor of Arts in Social \nScience at Chapman University. He received two doctoral degrees, one in \nBusiness Administration from Trinity Southern University and one in \nTheology from Anderson Theological Seminary.\n  In his youth, Dr. Washington also served in the U.S. Army before he \nbegan his 47-year career in the insurance industry in 1970, starting \nwith Metropolitan Life Insurance and Farmers Insurance.
