  Mr. LaHOOD. Mr. Speaker, today, I would like to honor Lisa Stone of 
Springfield, Illinois for receiving the 2017 State Journal Register 
First Citizen Award.
  Since 1963, the State Journal Register has been awarding the First 
Citizen award to a resident who goes above and beyond their commitment 
to making Springfield a better place. For over four decades, Lisa has 
volunteered countless hours and raised money for numerous organization 
in the Springfield community. Lisa's many contributions to the 
community include: fundraising for the Sojourn House, a domestic 
violence shelter; fundraising for the Jewish Federation; and helping 
Russian refugees resettle in America. Additionally, Lisa served as an 
original board member of Habitat for Humanity of Sangamon County.
  Lisa's commitment to the Springfield community is unmatched. Her 
years of volunteering and fundraising have made a true difference in 
Springfield. I applaud her for her efforts to make our community a 
better place.
  I extend my sincere congratulations to Lisa Stone on receiving the 
State Journal Register First Citizen award, and I wish her much success 
as she continues to lead a life of service to the community.

                          ____________________
