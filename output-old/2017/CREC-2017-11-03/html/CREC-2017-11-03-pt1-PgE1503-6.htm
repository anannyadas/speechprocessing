                                of texas

                    in the house of representatives

                        Friday, November 3, 2017

  Mr. BABIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remember WWII veteran, 
Leonard ``Lenny'' Swartz of Beaumont, TX who died peacefully in his own 
bed on October 30, 2017.
  Lenny was born on April 17, 1919 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. In 
1930, the Great Depression forced the Swartz family to move to Atlantic 
City in hopes of a better living. After High School, Mr. Swartz moved 
back to Philadelphia until December of 1941. When WWII began for the 
United States, Lenny felt the call to serve his country and immediately 
enlisted in the United States Army. After graduating Officer's 
Candidate School in Ft. Jackson, South Carolina Lenny was next 
stationed at Camp Polk, in Deridder, Louisiana. While he

was stationed at Camp Polk, Lenny took a trip to Beaumont, TX on leave 
and met a woman named Marie ``Mongie'' Eisen. In March of 1943, the two 
entered into a marriage that would last over 74 years. Mongie died just 
ten weeks ago in August. The couple lived in Deridder until Lenny was 
sent to Ft. Ord California for training before he boarded a ship headed 
to fight in the Pacific.
  Lenny was a captain in the 536th Amphibious Tank Battalion that 
played an important role in the Battle of Leyte Gulf that began the 
invasion of the Philippine Islands. It was while fighting during the 
invasion of Okinawa that Lenny was wounded badly and received his 
battlefield recognition. When the war ended, Lenny left the military as 
a Major and returned with Mongie to Beaumont. After working for his 
father-in-law in the produce business, Lenny opened his own produce 
business.
  Lenny was very active in the American Legion, Jewish War Veterans and 
the Masons. He always set an example for his sons and community by 
working hard every day and being active at his synagogue. After 
retiring, Lenny worked in his flower gardens around his home and 
watched his favorite football team, the Dallas Cowboys. Mr. Swartz 
loved his family dearly and truly lived a life worth living.
  It is always an honor for me to recognize those American heroes who 
sacrificed so much defending and preserving our freedom in World War 
II. This truly was the greatest generation. We thank Mr. Swartz--as 
well as his entire family--for their bravery and sacrifice to our great 
nation.
