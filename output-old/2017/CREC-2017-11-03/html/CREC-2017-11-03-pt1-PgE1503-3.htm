      HONORING NORTHEAST GEORGIA EFFORTS TO END DOMESTIC VIOLENCE

                                 ______
                                 

                           HON. DOUG COLLINS

                               of georgia

                    in the house of representatives

                        Friday, November 3, 2017

  Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize my 
northeast Georgia neighbors for their efforts in raising awareness 
surrounding domestic violence.
  Nearly 25 million Americans have been victims of domestic violence at 
some point in their lives, and more than 65,000 Georgians have reported 
experiencing domestic violence.
  Recently, the community of Clarkesville held a vigil to remember 
local victims of domestic abuse. By rallying around each other, they 
demonstrated their commitment to helping neighbors who may be suffering 
in silence.
  Tricia Hise is one Clarkesville neighbor whose dedication to 
addressing this scourge head-on stands out. Hise, a local attorney, has 
invested countless hours in pro-bono litigation to amplify the voices 
of domestic abuse victims. Through her work, Hise has inspired victims 
to take a stand on behalf of themselves and their loved ones.
  My neighbors in Clarkesville serve as an encouragement to us all. As 
we continue to oppose and address domestic abuse, I encourage everyone 
here today to find opportunities to work for the well-being of 
Americans who are impacted by domestic abuse.
