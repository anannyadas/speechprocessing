 HONORING THE 250TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE CLAVERACK REFORMED DUTCH CHURCH

                                 ______
                                 

                           HON. JOHN J. FASO

                              of new york

                    in the house of representatives

                        Friday, November 3, 2017

  Mr. FASO. Mr. Speaker, today I am honored to recognize the 250th 
anniversary of the Reformed Dutch Church in Claverack. Reverend John 
Gabriel Gebhard dedicated this historic sanctuary on November 8, 1767, 
adorning the church with the text, ``Stand in the gate of the Lord's 
House, and proclaim there His Word . . . enter in at these gates to 
worship the Lord.'' Reverend Gebhard headed the church for the next 
fifty years until his death, laying the foundation for what would be 
two more centuries of continued worship and community in central 
Columbia County.
  Listed on the National Register of Historic Places, Claverack's 
Reformed Dutch Church is a historic treasure. During the Revolutionary 
War, this building served as a refuge for soldiers and officers. 
Surrounding the church is the Claverack Cemetery, where Claverack 
residents connect to the community's earliest members.
  The church continues to serve as a center for religious, educational, 
and community activities. On November 5, 2017, Claverack will come 
together to celebrate this incredible milestone. I thank Pastor Linda 
Miles, Vice President and Senior Elder Louise Bliss, Senior Deacon 
Donna Lynk Campion, and all members of the local Reformed Dutch Church 
for their contributions to this special community. I am proud to honor 
the Reformed Dutch Church in Claverack for fostering 250 years of 
prayer and kinship.
