                  COMMEMORATING NATIONAL ADOPTION DAY

                                 ______
                                 

                        HON. K. MICHAEL CONAWAY

                                of texas

                    in the house of representatives

                        Friday, November 3, 2017

  Mr. CONAWAY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate the National 
Adoption Day celebration that is taking place today in Odessa. 
Throughout the day, local courts in Ector County will open their doors 
and finalize the adoption process for families in the community.
   It is fitting that National Adoption Awareness Month occurs in the 
month of November, a time of family and Thanksgiving. During this time 
of the year, we reflect on what we are most thankful for in our lives, 
such as our families. Each of our families provide us with 
unconditional love, help shape our character, provide a lifetime of 
precious memories and motivate us through challenging times.
   Unfortunately, not everyone is afforded this opportunity in life. 
Thankfully, God has blessed our world with selfless individuals who 
open their hearts and homes to these children. Many of these children 
have various medical, developmental, and emotional needs that requires 
special nurturing from devoted parents and families. These special 
individuals who elect to take on full responsibility for their care, 
upbringing, and overall well-being provide an important service not 
only to these children, but also to our communities and country.
   I am particularly gratified to recognize these new families because 
I am adopted myself. My father adopted my little brother, sister, and 
me, so seeing other children who have the benefit of a loving family 
warms my heart.
   I want to thank CASA of the Permian Basin and the other 
organizations across the nation who help make National Adoption Day 
possible. I also want to thank the dedicated individuals who make a 
powerful difference in the lives of children through adoption.
