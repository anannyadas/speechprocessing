                        Friday, November 3, 2017

  Mr. KEATING. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of Carol 
Jackman, who turns 80 years young on December 4th.
  Carol's dedication to our veterans stretches back to her childhood. 
Growing up on army bases, she developed a keen awareness of the 
important work our servicemembers do every single day. Not only is she 
the daughter of a U.S. veteran, but she is the sister, wife, mother, 
grandmother, sister-in-law, and aunt of U.S. veterans.
  Volunteerism has been an important theme in Carol's life. For over 50 
years, Carol has been a proud member of the American Legion Auxiliary. 
She has served as unit president, district director, state president, 
and the chair of many different programs. During the 1970s Carol worked 
to ensure no veteran was forgotten. She created and delivered homemade 
Easter baskets for sick and homebound veterans. Carol has also spent 
decades volunteering at the West Roxbury and Brockton VA hospitals.
  Honoring veterans is her passion. To this day she plants flowers in 
the Highland Cemetery, a tradition she has kept up longer than she can 
remember. She also serves on the Memorial Day committee in Dover, 
working to ensure each year's celebration properly honors our 
servicemembers.
  Mr. Speaker, I am proud to honor Carol Jackman on this joyous 
occasion of her 80th birthday. I ask that my colleagues join me in 
wishing her many more years of health and happiness.
