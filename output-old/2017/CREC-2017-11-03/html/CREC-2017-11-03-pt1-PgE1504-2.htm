                    in the house of representatives

                        Friday, November 3, 2017

  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the achievements 
of several constituents in my district who have taken it upon 
themselves to improve their health and wellness by incorporating 
exercise and a balanced diet into their daily routine.
  Last year, my staff and I created the Idaho STEP Challenge. The goal 
of the challenge was to encourage residents from across the state of 
Idaho to get fit and healthy by walking virtually across the United 
States, while collecting data on a wearable activity tracker and 
pedometer. Beginning on June 1, 2016, a group of more than 300 
residents and several workplace teams set out on the virtual walk 
across the United States starting at the U.S. Capitol Building in 
Washington D.C. and arriving at the Idaho Statehouse in Boise, Idaho 
more than a year later.
  The nearly 3,000 mile route took participants through 18 iconic 
American cities, national parks, and spacious heartlands. The event was 
documented on social media under the #hikewithMike hashtag, and through 
regular email newsletters sent to participants. Residents also shared 
their encouraging weight loss and fitness stories online, and uploaded 
their mileage counts to a special section of my website. The event was 
devised to be a non-partisan, non-political interactive event open to 
all Idaho residents.
  The Idaho STEP Challenge officially concluded on October 23, 2017. 
Those who participated demonstrated their commitment to healthy living 
and a spirited stand for fitness within our state. I would like to 
acknowledge the following participants for joining me on the virtual 
road to Boise and I thank them for promoting healthy lifestyles in our 
community.
  Nick Abshire, Jeff Daniels, Kathy Parks, Lisa Lane, Susan 
Littlefield, Miranda Collins, Jeannette Barnes, Jessica Padour, Suelynn 
Williams, Pat Mills, Kellie Gough, Carolyn Simpson, Maryl Fisher, Penny 
Handley, Fred Hughes, Carolee McKenzie, Patrick Kole, Dana Flatter, 
Miranda Smith Collins, Bart & Julie Harwood, Gerald Simpson, Wendy 
Jaquet, Celia R. Gould, Sheila Woods, Gina Martin, Ray Simpson, Jan 
Simpson Rhoades, Dennis & Sheila Conley, Toni Orth, Ron Fisher, Connie 
Pond, Angela Degni, Sheila Ames, Elizabeth Criner, Elain M. & James 
Long, Glen Tait, Cheryl Hardy, Shelby C. Sommer, Judy Slayton.
  Once again, thanks to all the participants in the Idaho STEP 
Challenge and I congratulate them on their commitment to a better 
Idaho.
