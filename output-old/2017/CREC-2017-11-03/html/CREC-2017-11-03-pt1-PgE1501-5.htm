                    in the house of representatives

                        Friday, November 3, 2017

  Mr. THOMPSON of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate 
former United States Representative Lynn C. Woolsey on her 80th 
Birthday. She represented California's 6th congressional district, 
including Marin County and most of Sonoma County from 1993 to 2013.
  Lynn was born in Seattle, Washington on November 3, 1937. A graduate 
of Lincoln High School, she attended the University of Washington from 
1955 to 1957. Lynn received her Bachelor of Science degree in 1980.
  As a working single mother in Northern California, Lynn spent several 
years receiving public assistance to help make ends meet. During her 
20-year career in the House of Representatives, she focused on issues 
facing children and families. She describes herself as the ``first 
former welfare mom to serve in Congress.'' Prior to entering public 
service, Lynn opened her own human resources consulting and employment 
agency, Woolsey Personnel Service, and taught at the College of Marin 
and the Dominican University of California.
  Lynn won her first election in 1984, when she ran for a city council 
seat in Petaluma. She served on the Petaluma City Council until 1992, 
her last year as Vice Mayor. The people of Sonoma and Marin Counties 
elected Lynn to Congress in 1992 and continued to elect her to eight 
more terms.
  In Congress, Lynn served as a member of the House Foreign Affairs 
Committee, Chair of the Committee on Education and Labor's Workforce 
Protections Subcommittee and as a senior member of the House Committee 
on Science and Technology. Lynn had many proud moments in federal 
public service. She secured federal funds for her district for a 
variety of projects, including funds for the Petaluma River flood 
control project and for the seismic retrofit of the Golden Gate Bridge. 
She voted against authorizing the invasion of Iraq and consistently 
voted to suspend funding for the wars. She was one of Congress' 
foremost advocates on education issues, offering legislation to expand 
school breakfast programs, expand childcare programs and encourage 
young girls to study science and math. Her measure to provide job-
protected leave for family members of injured soldiers was incorporated 
into the FY 2008 defense authorization bill. Lynn's former colleagues, 
staff and constituents admire her immeasurably and continue to benefit 
from her dedicated years of service.
  Mr. Speaker, former United States Representative Lynn C. Woolsey 
served her constituents diligently for ten consecutive terms. Her 
career is an excellent model of principled and dedicated leadership for 
members of this

body. It is therefore fitting and proper that we commemorate her on her 
80th birthday and send her our best wishes here today.
