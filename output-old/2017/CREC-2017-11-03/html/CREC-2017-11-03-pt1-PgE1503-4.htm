                        Friday, November 3, 2017

  Mr. RYAN of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of Rex 
Earl Golden, age 95 of Machesney Park, Illinois who passed away 
peacefully surrounded by family on Tuesday, October 31, 2017.
  Rex was on born on September 3, 1922 in Walnut Ridge, Arkansas to 
Luther M. & Mettie Golden (Hislip). A Veteran of the U.S. Army Air 
Corps, he served his country with distinction in Europe during World 
War II on D-Day. He was a proud 50-year member of the International 
Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, Local Union 364, and a former member 
of the Ancient Free & Accepted Masons, Rockford Lodge No. 102.
  Rex was a beloved father, grandfather, and brother who will be dearly 
missed by his friends and family. He is survived by his sons, Darrin 
(Tracy) Golden and Alan (Nikki) Golden; grandchildren, Kiley, Brayden, 
Brant, Kassidy, and Jack; brother, James ``Bud'' Golden; sister, 
Jeanette (Bob) Pace and Pat (Frank) Todd; and brother-in-law, Thomas 
Neton Sr. He is predeceased by his wife, Jean C. Golden (Edwards); 
siblings, Edward (Edna) Golden, Georgia Gatewood and Ruby Neton.
  His son Darrin and I are good friends, and it is with deep respect 
that I extend my most sincere and heartfelt condolences to all the 
family and friends of Rex Golden.
