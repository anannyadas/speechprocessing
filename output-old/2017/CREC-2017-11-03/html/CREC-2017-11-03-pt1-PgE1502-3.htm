                        Friday, November 3, 2017

  Mr. TED LIEU of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise to celebrate the life 
of Louis Papia, 92, of Agoura Hills, California, a constituent of mine 
who was laid to rest at Arlington National Cemetery on Monday, October 
30, 2017. Mr. Papia was a decorated World War II veteran who fought in 
the D-Day invasion with the 1st Batallion, 314th Regiment, 79th 
Infantry Division. He was a recipient of the Bronze Star and eight 
other citations, including the Good Conduct Medal, the Presidential 
Unit Emblem, the American Campaign Medal, the European-African-Middle 
Eastern Campaign Medal, the World War II Victory Medal, the Army of 
Occupation Medal with German Clasp, the Combat Infantryman Badge and 
the Honorable Service Lapel Button for WWII. Mr. Papia was also a 
recipient of the French Jubilee Medal, for his service at Utah Beach 
during the Invasion. Mr. Papia received his Bronze Star when helping an 
Army medic save the life of a fellow soldier while under heavy fire.
  Mr. Papia landed at Utah Beach with the 79th, and took part in the 
Battle of Cherbourg. His initial mission was to battle his way 
southwest, across the Cherbourg Peninsula. One of the critical missions 
was to capture the port city so the Army Corp of Engineers could 
quickly erect a working port big enough to accommodate large U.S. 
supply ships. The 79th fought in Normandy, Northern France, Rhineland, 
Ardennes-Alsace and in Central Europe, including Germany. Mr. Papia was 
under the command of Colonel Olin E. Teague, who later became the 16-
term Congressman from Texas's 6th Congressional District. After serving 
his country abroad in Germany, and as the war in Europe was drawing to 
a close, Mr. Papia was shipped back to the U.S. where he began to 
prepare to do his part in Operation Downfall, the planned U.S. invasion 
of Japan.
  Louis Papia is survived by his wife of 65 years, Kay Papia, of Agoura 
Hills, California, and four sons: Louie, Russell, Mark, and Todd. Mark 
and Melissa Papia reside in Calabasas, California, with two of Papia's 
five grandchildren.
  Mr. Papia will be remembered for his selfless service to our country, 
and we are forever grateful to him.
