                          ETHIOPIA RESOLUTION

                                 ______
                                 

                           HON. MIKE COFFMAN

                              of colorado

                    in the house of representatives

                        Friday, November 3, 2017

  Mr. COFFMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to call attention to the 
Government of Ethiopia's continued pattern of repression and violence 
against its own people, and I urge the House of Representatives to vote 
on House Resolution 128, the ``Supporting Respect for Human Rights and 
Encouraging Inclusive Governance in Ethiopia Resolution.'' This 
resolution calls on the Government of Ethiopia to take clear, decisive, 
steps toward becoming more inclusive, more democratic, and more 
respectful of the basic human rights of its own people.
  This resolution has overwhelming bipartisan support with more than 70 
cosponsors, and it passed out of the House Foreign Affairs Committee 
unanimously on July 27.
  The ongoing human rights crisis in Ethiopia is extremely troubling to 
me, to the resolution's other co-sponsors, the many Americans of 
Ethiopian heritage, and to numerous human rights groups. I firmly 
believe that the passage of this resolution will encourage the 
Ethiopian government to end its practice of violence and repression and 
provide a strong basis of an inclusive government.
  Specifically, this resolution condemns: the excessive use of force by 
Ethiopian security forces; the killing of peaceful protestors; the 
arrest and detention of journalists, students, activists, and political 
leaders, and; the Ethiopian government's abuse of the Anti-Terrorism 
Proclamation to stifle political and civil dissent.
  The resolution does not simply highlight the Ethiopian government's 
increasingly authoritarian acts, but it also encourages the United 
States to support efforts to improve democracy and governance in 
Ethiopia. I believe that the United States can take actions that will 
positively influence the Ethiopian government and use our existing 
institutions to further democracy and effective governance in Ethiopia. 
Critically, the resolution calls on the Ethiopian government to admit 
UN human rights observers so they can conduct an independent and 
thorough examination of the current state of human rights in Ethiopia.
  On March 9 of this year, the House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on 
Africa, Global Health, Global Human Rights, and International 
Organizations, held a hearing to discuss specific steps the United 
States can take to bring about positive changes for the Ethiopian 
government and their people. Among those who testified was Deacon 
Yoseph Tafari, of the St. Mary's Ethiopian Orthodox Church located in 
Aurora, Colorado. Deacon Yoseph was raised in Ethiopia and has 
experienced the daily struggles too many Ethiopians have faced living 
in abject poverty under an oppressive government.
  Deacon Yoseph fled from Ethiopia in 1976, and came to the United 
States as a refugee. He and many of the members of the Ethiopian 
community in my Congressional district in Colorado--including the Oromo 
and Amharas--have worked diligently to organize and assist those still 
suffering from repression in their home country.
  Oromo Community President of Colorado, Jamal Said, has also shared 
his concerns with me, and both of these gentlemen have no motives other 
than a concern about the safety

and state of democracy in Ethiopia. I appreciate their leadership in 
the community as they continue to fight for democracy in their 
homeland.
  Unfortunately, stories like this are not uncommon in my district and 
I am disappointed that the House has not yet scheduled a floor vote on 
House Resolution 128. I note that on two prior occasions a vote was 
tentatively scheduled. In both of these instances it is my 
understanding that the vote was postponed due to pressure from the 
Ethiopian government who continues to make promises to curb human 
rights abuses against their own people but fail to deliver. 
Additionally, it has been brought to my attention that the Ethiopian 
Government has threatened to cut off security cooperation with the 
United States should we proceed with House Resolution 128.
  I am particularly dismayed that rather than solving their problems 
and moving towards becoming a more democratic country, the Ethiopian 
government has chosen instead to hire a D.C. lobbying firm, at a cost 
of $150,000 a month, to ``work with the [Ethiopian Government] to 
develop and execute a public affairs plan to enhance the dialogue and 
relationships with policymakers, media, opinion leaders and business 
leaders . . .'' in addition to ``meetings with members of Congress, 
their staffs, and executive branch officials.''
  The issue the Ethiopian government needs to address is the repression 
of democracy and its citizens in Ethiopia. The solution to whatever 
negative perception it has in the halls of the U.S. Congress is not a 
public affairs one, but rather what concrete steps are being taken 
against democracy in Ethiopia. That is why I remain committed to 
working with House leadership to have a vote scheduled on House 
Resolution 128.
  Mr. Speaker, I encourage leadership to schedule a vote and I call on 
my colleagues to vote in favor and pass House Resolution 128. I will 
continue working with local Ethiopian community leaders in Colorado and 
across the country to raise awareness of the human rights abuses 
occurring in Ethiopia and to bring relief from oppression to the 
Ethiopian people.
