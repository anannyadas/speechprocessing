                     CONGRATULATING HESLER CARDENAS

                                 ______
                                 

                           HON. DOUG COLLINS

                               of georgia

                    in the house of representatives

                        Friday, November 3, 2017

  Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Hesler 
Cardenas, a visually impaired senior at Gainesville High School who 
recently placed second in a nationwide art competition.
  Hesler submitted a painting titled ``Blossom Petal'' to the 2017 
American Printing House for Blind Insights Art Competition. Out of 
nearly 400 entries, Hesler's painting surpassed all but one and earned 
a spot on the walls of the American Printing House in Kentucky.
  Hesler stands out among his peers by pursuing his goals despite his 
visual limitations.
  Mr. Speaker, Hesler's success reminds us that with tenacity, hard 
work and determination often take us closer to our dreams than we could 
imagine.
  As Hesler continues to inspire his fellow northeast Georgians, I look 
forward to seeing where his talent will take him next.
