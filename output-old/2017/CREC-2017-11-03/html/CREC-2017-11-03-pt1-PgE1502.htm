            IN RECOGNITION OF THE REV. DR. THOMAS L. WALKER

                                 ______
                                 

                         HON. G. K. BUTTERFIELD

                           of north carolina

                    in the house of representatives

                        Friday, November 3, 2017

  Mr. BUTTERFIELD. Mr. Speaker, it is with great pride that I rise 
today to congratulate my constituent and friend, Rev. Dr. Thomas L. 
Walker, for 50 faithful years in ministry, and 47 years as pastor of 
Ebenezer Missionary Baptist Church.
  Dr. Walker, a native of Edgecombe County, North Carolina, was called 
to the ministry in 1970. At the age of 22, he and his wife Joyce, and 
their two children, Timothy and Teresa, began a ministry that would 
inspire and uplift the faithful for decades. Today, under his 
leadership, the church's community outreach includes TV and radio 
ministries, a daycare center, a tutorial program, and ministerial 
trainings.
  The church also has a non-profit corporation called the EBC ``ATOM'' 
Project, Inc., whose objective is to improve the quality of life for 
low and middle-income citizens. Dr. Walker has committed his life to 
serving both his community and fellow man. One of Pastor Walker's many 
talents is his success as a gospel recording artist. Through song, his 
messages and voice have uplifted and inspired countless individuals. 
His signature, ``One Day at a Time,'' continues to inspire hearts 
across the nation.
  In 1996, Dr. Walker received troubling news when he was diagnosed 
with prostate cancer. Yet, he would not sit idly by or be sidelined. 
His perseverance led him to write, ``Brother to Brother--You Don't Have 
to Die of Prostate Cancer.'' A thoughtful and informative book, Dr. 
Walker presents an honest account of his challenges and frustrations, 
with the goal of empowering men and their families. In April of 2014, 
First Lady Joyce Walker, having battled sickness for many years, was 
called home to be with the Lord. Dr. Walker remained steadfast and 
continues to stand as a pillar of strength, persistence, and a living 
testament of the Gospel.
  Mr. Speaker, I celebrate this great North Carolinian and ask that my 
colleagues in the United States House of Representatives join me in 
expressing sincere appreciation for Dr. Walker's fortitude, 
faithfulness, and servant leadership on this historic milestone.
