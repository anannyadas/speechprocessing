  LEGISLATION TO COMPEL THE RELEASE OF ALL JFK ASSASSINATION DOCUMENTS

                                 ______
                                 

                            HON. STEVE COHEN

                              of tennessee

                    in the house of representatives

                        Friday, November 3, 2017

  Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the legislation I 
introduced today that would require President Trump to immediately meet 
his obligation to release all documents that can and should be released 
pertaining to the assassination of President John F. Kennedy.
  Despite the 1992 passage of a Congressionally-mandated October 26, 
2017 deadline requiring the President of the United States make a 
determination about what documents can and should be released to the 
public regarding President John F. Kennedy's assassination, the current 
President failed to comply.
  The President's failure to execute this requirement before the 
established deadline raises long-held concerns that the U.S. government 
continues to withhold critical information about the former President's 
assassination.
  As a result, it is now up to Congress to enforce this deadline and 
deliver to the American public the certainty it deserves.
  I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to exert the 
authority of this body's intent when it passed the 1992 President John 
F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act and enact this 
important measure to enforce the required release of all appropriate 
documents concerning the assassination of the late, and Honorable, 
President John F. Kennedy.
