                                 ______
                                 

                           HON. DARIN LaHOOD

                              of illinois

                    in the house of representatives

                        Friday, November 3, 2017

  Mr. LaHOOD. Mr. Speaker, today, I would like to recognize Brig. Gen. 
William ``Robbie'' Robertson on his promotion in rank and to Chief of 
Staff of the Illinois Air National Guard.
  In 1983, Brig. Gen. Robertson became an officer in the 182nd Airlift 
Wing of the Illinois Air National Guard. Over his years of service, 
Brig. Gen. Robertson defended our nation in Operations Desert Shield, 
Desert Storm, Southern Watch, Joint Forge, Enduring Freedom and Iraqi 
Freedom. As a command pilot, he has flown over 4,800 hours in various 
aircraft. Brig. Gen. Robertson's leadership was critical to the 
conversion of the unit from the OA-37 Dragonfly to F-16 Fighting Falcon 
and to the C-130 Hercules, which equipped our Armed forces with tools 
they need to combat our nation's enemies.
  In 2004, Brig. Gen. Robertson took over command of the 182nd Airlift 
Wing. Under his command, the 182nd Airlift Wing maintained the highest 
mission capability rates for ten of the past eleven years for all C-130 
units. As commander, he is responsible for maintaining the combat 
readiness of eight C-130 aircraft and over 1,200 Illinois Air National 
Guardsmen. The 182nd Airlift Wing received the Air Force Outstanding 
Unit Award five times during his tenure.
  Brig. Gen. Robertson has committed his life to serving our nation. I 
am grateful for his leadership and sacrifice in the Illinois Air 
National Guard. This country is blessed to have servicemen like William 
Robertson and I extend my sincere congratulations to him on his 
promotion to Brigadier General.
