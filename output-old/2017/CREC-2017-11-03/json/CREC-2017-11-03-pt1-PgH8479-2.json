Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize Frank Doolittle \nof Bainbridge, New York. At 104 years old, Frank will be awarded the \nNation's highest honor for a civilian, the Congressional Gold Medal for \nhis service in the Civil Air Patrol.\n  At a pivotal time in our Nation's history, Frank dedicated himself to \nservice here at home. In 1944, in the midst of World War II, Frank \nvolunteered to join the Civil Air Patrol squadron in Sidney, New York. \nHis unit was active and often tasked with finding C-47s that went down \nin the Northeast.\n  In addition to being on call 24 hours a day, Frank taught classes \nranging from navigation to meteorology 3 nights a week. During World \nWar II, members patrolled the country's coastline from Maine to Mexico, \nwatching for enemy submarines and potential saboteurs while conducting \nsearch and rescue missions.\n  On Saturday, November 11, Veterans Day, I will have the distinct \nhonor of presenting Mr. Doolittle with the Congressional Gold Medal. \nSince 1776, only 300 of these medals have been awarded. I ask everyone \nto join me today in thanking Frank Doolittle and all serving the Civil \nAir Patrol for their service and dedication to our country.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Ms. TENNEY", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "179", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H8479", "wkday": "Friday", "day": "3", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "HONORING FRANK DOOLITTLE, CONGRESSIONAL GOLD MEDAL RECIPIENT", "id": "CREC-2017-11-03-pt1-PgH8479-2", "title": "HONORING FRANK DOOLITTLE, CONGRESSIONAL GOLD MEDAL RECIPIENT"}
