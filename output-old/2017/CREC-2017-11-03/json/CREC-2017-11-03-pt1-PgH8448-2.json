Mr. Speaker, as time goes on, people are going to \nhave a chance to look at the details of the Republican tax plan. It is \nclear that the benefits are concentrated to those who need help the \nleast, ignoring those who need help the most, and producing an \nunaffordable deficit in the future.\n  But one of the most disturbing elements of this is that the \nRepublican plan would gut the agreement that we negotiated in good \nfaith with the wind energy industry to be able to wean them off tax \nsubsidies. It was phased down in exchange for that certainty. The \nindustry has up to $50 billion that is at risk by having the Federal \nGovernment pull the rug out from underneath them.\n  We were well on the path towards sustainability with a clean American \nbill--low carbon energy. It puts at risk 50,000 jobs as a result of the \nreversal in course, and it raises questions for American business \nwhether or not they can trust the American Congress to keep a deal.\n  This is an element that must be changed. We must respect the \nagreement that we made and protect the massive investment in \nmanufacturing and employment.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. BLUMENAUER", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "179", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H8448", "wkday": "Friday", "day": "3", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "PROTECT WIND ENERGY INVESTMENT", "id": "CREC-2017-11-03-pt1-PgH8448-2", "title": "PROTECT WIND ENERGY INVESTMENT"}
