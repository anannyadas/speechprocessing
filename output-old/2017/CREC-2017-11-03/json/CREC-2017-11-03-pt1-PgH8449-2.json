Mr. Speaker, 20 years ago, Congress enacted \nwith strong, bipartisan support the Children's Health Insurance \nProgram.\n  It fulfilled one of the highest responsibilities we have, which is to \nensure the health and well-being of our Nation's children. Children \nwithout health insurance are less healthy, they go to the emergency \nroom for chronic conditions like asthma and diabetes, and they do worse \nin school.\n  The program is extremely successful, increasing insurance coverage \nfor children to 95 percent nationwide. Because of this, 138,000 \nMaryland children--and more than 8 million around the country--have \nreceived routine checkups, vaccinations, sick visits, prescriptions, \ndental and vision care, and emergency services.\n  We should not only reauthorize CHIP but work together to ensure every \nchild in America has insurance.\n  Instead, the Republican Party is breaking the history of \nbipartisanship that CHIP has long enjoyed. Republicans are forcing us \nto choose between insuring kids and taking away coverage from 700,000 \nlow-income Americans, raising premiums on seniors, and cutting the \nPrevention and Public Health Fund.\n  Mr. Speaker, let's stop playing politics with the healthcare of our \nchildren.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. BROWN of Maryland", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "179", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H8449", "wkday": "Friday", "day": "3", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "ENSURING THE HEALTH OF OUR NATION'S CHILDREN", "id": "CREC-2017-11-03-pt1-PgH8449-2", "title": "ENSURING THE HEALTH OF OUR NATION'S CHILDREN"}
