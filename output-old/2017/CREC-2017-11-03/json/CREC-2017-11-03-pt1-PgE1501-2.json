Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate the National \nAdoption Day celebration that is taking place today in Odessa. \nThroughout the day, local courts in Ector County will open their doors \nand finalize the adoption process for families in the community.\n   It is fitting that National Adoption Awareness Month occurs in the \nmonth of November, a time of family and Thanksgiving. During this time \nof the year, we reflect on what we are most thankful for in our lives, \nsuch as our families. Each of our families provide us with \nunconditional love, help shape our character, provide a lifetime of \nprecious memories and motivate us through challenging times.\n   Unfortunately, not everyone is afforded this opportunity in life. \nThankfully, God has blessed our world with selfless individuals who \nopen their hearts and homes to these children. Many of these children \nhave various medical, developmental, and emotional needs that requires \nspecial nurturing from devoted parents and families. These special \nindividuals who elect to take on full responsibility for their care, \nupbringing, and overall well-being provide an important service not \nonly to these children, but also to our communities and country.\n   I am particularly gratified to recognize these new families because \nI am adopted myself. My father adopted my little brother, sister, and \nme, so seeing other children who have the benefit of a loving family \nwarms my heart.\n   I want to thank CASA of the Permian Basin and the other \norganizations across the nation who help make National Adoption Day \npossible. I also want to thank the dedicated individuals who make a \npowerful difference in the lives of children through adoption.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. CONAWAY", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 3}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "179", "extension": true, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "E1501", "wkday": "Friday", "day": "3", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "COMMEMORATING NATIONAL ADOPTION DAY", "id": "CREC-2017-11-03-pt1-PgE1501-2", "title": "COMMEMORATING NATIONAL ADOPTION DAY"}
