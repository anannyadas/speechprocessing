Mr. Speaker, yesterday, Republicans unveiled their vision \nfor tax reform, and it is not pretty.\n  The proposal raises taxes on the middle class and showers the \nwealthiest 1 percent of our country with 80 percent of the benefits, at \na total cost of $1.5 trillion charged to our Nation's credit card.\n  The plan should be called ``Hurt the Middle Class Act.''\n  It eliminates personal deductions for medical expenses; it eliminates \nthe deductibility of interest paid on student loans; it eliminates the \ndeductibility of State and local income taxes, again, raising taxes on \nthe middle class; and to add insult to injury, the proposal eliminates \nthe deduction for personal property losses from one natural disaster \nfire.\n  Now, in California, we just experienced the worst fires in \nCalifornia's history. Over 14,000 people lost their homes, at a cost of \nat least $3 billion. The heck with them.\n  When policies weaken the middle class, the backbone of our country, \nthey weaken our entire country. The President said tax reform will be \nthe best Christmas present of all, but, for the middle class, this bill \nwill be one lump of coal.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Ms. ESHOO", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "179", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H8448", "wkday": "Friday", "day": "3", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "REPUBLICAN VISION FOR TAX REFORM NOT PRETTY", "id": "CREC-2017-11-03-pt1-PgH8448-4", "title": "REPUBLICAN VISION FOR TAX REFORM NOT PRETTY"}
