Madam Speaker, this year marks the 75th anniversary of \nExecutive Order 9066, which authorized the internment of over 110,000 \nJapanese Americans on U.S. soil during World War II.\n  Our country will never be able to undo this grave miscarriage of \njustice or relieve the pain and suffering that was inflicted upon our \nfellow Americans. So we must remember this dark period in our Nation's \nhistory and ensure that this dark shadow of prejudice, bigotry, and \nhate never occurs again.\n  However, sadly, as we look around us, today we see that this \ndivisiveness and bigotry persists far too much. We cannot give into \nhate and intolerance. We must confront it and defeat it with the light \nand love of the Aloha Spirit.\n  We must learn from this dark stain on our past and vow to never \nrepeat it again.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Ms. GABBARD", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "179", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H8480", "wkday": "Friday", "day": "3", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "75TH ANNIVERSARY OF EXECUTIVE ORDER 9066", "id": "CREC-2017-11-03-pt1-PgH8480-4", "title": null}
