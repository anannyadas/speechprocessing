Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the achievements \nof several constituents in my district who have taken it upon \nthemselves to improve their health and wellness by incorporating \nexercise and a balanced diet into their daily routine.\n  Last year, my staff and I created the Idaho STEP Challenge. The goal \nof the challenge was to encourage residents from across the state of \nIdaho to get fit and healthy by walking virtually across the United \nStates, while collecting data on a wearable activity tracker and \npedometer. Beginning on June 1, 2016, a group of more than 300 \nresidents and several workplace teams set out on the virtual walk \nacross the United States starting at the U.S. Capitol Building in \nWashington D.C. and arriving at the Idaho Statehouse in Boise, Idaho \nmore than a year later.\n  The nearly 3,000 mile route took participants through 18 iconic \nAmerican cities, national parks, and spacious heartlands. The event was \ndocumented on social media under the #hikewithMike hashtag, and through \nregular email newsletters sent to participants. Residents also shared \ntheir encouraging weight loss and fitness stories online, and uploaded \ntheir mileage counts to a special section of my website. The event was \ndevised to be a non-partisan, non-political interactive event open to \nall Idaho residents.\n  The Idaho STEP Challenge officially concluded on October 23, 2017. \nThose who participated demonstrated their commitment to healthy living \nand a spirited stand for fitness within our state. I would like to \nacknowledge the following participants for joining me on the virtual \nroad to Boise and I thank them for promoting healthy lifestyles in our \ncommunity.\n  Nick Abshire, Jeff Daniels, Kathy Parks, Lisa Lane, Susan \nLittlefield, Miranda Collins, Jeannette Barnes, Jessica Padour, Suelynn \nWilliams, Pat Mills, Kellie Gough, Carolyn Simpson, Maryl Fisher, Penny \nHandley, Fred Hughes, Carolee McKenzie, Patrick Kole, Dana Flatter, \nMiranda Smith Collins, Bart & Julie Harwood, Gerald Simpson, Wendy \nJaquet, Celia R.
