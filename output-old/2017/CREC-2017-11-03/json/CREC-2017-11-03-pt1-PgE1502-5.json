Mr. Speaker, today I am honored to recognize the 250th \nanniversary of the Reformed Dutch Church in Claverack. Reverend John \nGabriel Gebhard dedicated this historic sanctuary on November 8, 1767, \nadorning the church with the text, ``Stand in the gate of the Lord's \nHouse, and proclaim there His Word . . . enter in at these gates to \nworship the Lord.'' Reverend Gebhard headed the church for the next \nfifty years until his death, laying the foundation for what would be \ntwo more centuries of continued worship and community in central \nColumbia County.\n  Listed on the National Register of Historic Places, Claverack's \nReformed Dutch Church is a historic treasure. During the Revolutionary \nWar, this building served as a refuge for soldiers and officers. \nSurrounding the church is the Claverack Cemetery, where Claverack \nresidents connect to the community's earliest members.\n  The church continues to serve as a center for religious, educational, \nand community activities. On November 5, 2017, Claverack will come \ntogether to celebrate this incredible milestone. I thank Pastor Linda \nMiles, Vice President and Senior Elder Louise Bliss, Senior Deacon \nDonna Lynk Campion, and all members of the local Reformed Dutch Church \nfor their contributions to this special community. I am proud to honor \nthe Reformed Dutch Church in Claverack for fostering 250 years of \nprayer and kinship.\n\n\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. FASO", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 3}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "179", "extension": true, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "E1502-E1503", "wkday": "Friday", "day": "3", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "HONORING THE 250TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE CLAVERACK REFORMED DUTCH CHURCH", "id": "CREC-2017-11-03-pt1-PgE1502-5", "title": "HONORING THE 250TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE CLAVERACK REFORMED DUTCH CHURCH"}
