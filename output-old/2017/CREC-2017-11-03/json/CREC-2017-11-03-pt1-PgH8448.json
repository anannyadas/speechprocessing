Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize some outstanding high \nschool students from my district in Missouri, who have displayed a deep \nappreciation and respect for our Armed Forces.\n  Before the last regular season varsity football home game, members of \nthe Waynesville High School Freshman Mentor Council presented pocket \nflags to the 763rd Ordnance Company, who will soon be deploying. The \nstudents also presented the pocket flags to Waynesville High School's \nPartners in Education, the 787th Military Police Battalion and 3rd \nBattalion, 10th Infantry Regiment, to share with deploying soldiers.\n  The flags are part of the Pocket Flag Project, which provides \nmilitary personnel on the front lines with personal pocket flags. \nWaynesville High School freshmen folded the flags and wrote \npersonalized messages to accompany each flag on Patriot Day.\n  I applaud these students for taking the initiative to honor our men \nand women in uniform. With young people like these walking down the \nhalls of schools, I am certain America has a bright future.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mrs. HARTZLER", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "179", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H8448", "wkday": "Friday", "day": "3", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "HONORING WAYNESVILLE HIGH SCHOOL FRESHMAN MENTOR COUNCIL", "id": "CREC-2017-11-03-pt1-PgH8448", "title": "HONORING WAYNESVILLE HIGH SCHOOL FRESHMAN MENTOR COUNCIL"}
