Madam Speaker, Uzbekistan uber terrorist Saipov's \nattack in New York City is another example why the United States should \nend the diversity visa lottery. And I emphasize the word ``lottery.''\n  The program should have ended years ago. Under this 1990 program, the \nState Department gives 50,000 visas each year to immigrants from \ndifferent parts of the world using a lottery system. Getting into the \nUnited States is like playing bingo. It is a game of chance.\n  Our immigration system should be changed to accept the best and \nbrightest throughout the world. It is time to go to a merit-based visa \nsystem. Grant visas to people who will benefit America. Stop the random \nsystem that allowed Saipov to come in; a system that rolls the dice \nwhere foreigners win and Americans lose.\n  And that is just the way it is.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. POE of Texas", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "179", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H8480", "wkday": "Friday", "day": "3", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "MERIT-BASED VISA PROGRAM", "id": "CREC-2017-11-03-pt1-PgH8480-3", "title": "MERIT-BASED VISA PROGRAM"}
