Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remember WWII veteran, \nLeonard ``Lenny'' Swartz of Beaumont, TX who died peacefully in his own \nbed on October 30, 2017.\n  Lenny was born on April 17, 1919 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. In \n1930, the Great Depression forced the Swartz family to move to Atlantic \nCity in hopes of a better living. After High School, Mr. Swartz moved \nback to Philadelphia until December of 1941. When WWII began for the \nUnited States, Lenny felt the call to serve his country and immediately \nenlisted in the United States Army. After graduating Officer's \nCandidate School in Ft. Jackson, South Carolina Lenny was next \nstationed at Camp Polk, in Deridder, Louisiana. While he\n\n\nwas stationed at Camp Polk, Lenny took a trip to Beaumont, TX on leave \nand met a woman named Marie ``Mongie'' Eisen. In March of 1943, the two \nentered into a marriage that would last over 74 years. Mongie died just \nten weeks ago in August. The couple lived in Deridder until Lenny was \nsent to Ft. Ord California for training before he boarded a ship headed \nto fight in the Pacific.\n  Lenny was a captain in the 536th Amphibious Tank Battalion that \nplayed an important role in the Battle of Leyte Gulf that began the \ninvasion of the Philippine Islands. It was while fighting during the \ninvasion of Okinawa that Lenny was wounded badly and received his \nbattlefield recognition. When the war ended, Lenny left the military as \na Major and returned with Mongie to Beaumont. After working for his \nfather-in-law in the produce business, Lenny opened his own produce \nbusiness.\n  Lenny was very active in the American Legion, Jewish War Veterans and \nthe Masons. He always set an example for his sons and community by \nworking hard every day and being active at his synagogue. After \nretiring, Lenny worked in his flower gardens around his home and \nwatched his favorite football team, the Dallas Cowboys. Mr. Swartz \nloved his family dearly and truly lived a life worth living.\n  It is always an honor for me to recognize those American heroes who \nsacrificed so much defending and preserving our freedom in World War \nII. This truly was the greatest generation. We thank Mr. Swartz--as \nwell as his entire family--for their bravery and sacrifice to our great \nnation.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. BABIN", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 3}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "179", "extension": true, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "E1503-E1504", "wkday": "Friday", "day": "3", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "HONORING THE MILITARY SERVICE OF LEONARD SWARTZ", "id": "CREC-2017-11-03-pt1-PgE1503-6", "title": "HONORING THE MILITARY SERVICE OF LEONARD SWARTZ"}
