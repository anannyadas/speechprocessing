MIKE COFFMAN\n\n                              of colorado\n\n                    in the house of representatives\n\n                        Friday, November 3, 2017\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "C001077", "text": "  Mr. COFFMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to call attention to the \nGovernment of Ethiopia's continued pattern of repression and violence \nagainst its own people, and I urge the House of Representatives to vote \non House Resolution 128, the ``Supporting Respect for Human Rights and \nEncouraging Inclusive Governance in Ethiopia Resolution.'' This \nresolution calls on the Government of Ethiopia to take clear, decisive, \nsteps toward becoming more inclusive, more democratic, and more \nrespectful of the basic human rights of its own people.\n  This resolution has overwhelming bipartisan support with more than 70 \ncosponsors, and it passed out of the House Foreign Affairs Committee \nunanimously on July 27.\n  The ongoing human rights crisis in Ethiopia is extremely troubling to \nme, to the resolution's other co-sponsors, the many Americans of \nEthiopian heritage, and to numerous human rights groups. I firmly \nbelieve that the passage of this resolution will encourage the \nEthiopian government to end its practice of violence and repression and \nprovide a strong basis of an inclusive government.\n  Specifically, this resolution condemns: the excessive use of force by \nEthiopian security forces; the killing of peaceful protestors; the \narrest and detention of journalists, students, activists, and political \nleaders, and; the Ethiopian government's abuse of the Anti-Terrorism \nProclamation to stifle political and civil dissent.\n  The resolution does not simply highlight the Ethiopian government's \nincreasingly authoritarian acts, but it also encourages the United \nStates to support efforts to improve democracy and governance in \nEthiopia. I believe that the United States can take actions that will \npositively influence the Ethiopian government and use our existing \ninstitutions to further democracy and effective governance in Ethiopia. \nCritically, the resolution calls on the Ethiopian government to admit \nUN human rights observers so they can conduct an independent and \nthorough examination of the current state of human rights in Ethiopia.\n  On March 9 of this year, the House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on \nAfrica, Global Health, Global Human Rights, and International \nOrganizations, held a hearing to discuss specific steps the United \nStates can take to bring about positive changes for the Ethiopian \ngovernment and their people. Among those who testified was Deacon \nYoseph Tafari, of the St. Mary's Ethiopian Orthodox Church located in \nAurora, Colorado. Deacon Yoseph was raised in Ethiopia and has \nexperienced the daily struggles too many Ethiopians have faced living \nin abject poverty under an oppressive government.\n  Deacon Yoseph fled from Ethiopia in 1976, and came to the United \nStates as a refugee. He and many of the members of the Ethiopian \ncommunity in my Congressional district in Colorado--including the Oromo \nand Amharas--have worked diligently to organize and assist those still \nsuffering from repression in their home country.\n  Oromo Community President of Colorado, Jamal Said, has also shared \nhis concerns with me, and both of these gentlemen have no motives other \nthan a concern about the safety\n\n\nand state of democracy in Ethiopia. I appreciate their leadership in \nthe community as they continue to fight for democracy in their \nhomeland.\n  Unfortunately, stories like this are not uncommon in my district and \nI am disappointed that the House has not yet scheduled a floor vote on \nHouse Resolution 128. I note that on two prior occasions a vote was \ntentatively scheduled. In both of these instances it is my \nunderstanding that the vote was postponed due to pressure from the \nEthiopian government who continues to make promises to curb human \nrights abuses against their own people but fail to deliver. \nAdditionally, it has been brought to my attention that the Ethiopian \nGovernment has threatened to cut off security cooperation with the \nUnited States should we proceed with House Resolution 128.\n  I am particularly dismayed that rather than solving their problems \nand moving towards becoming a more democratic country, the Ethiopian \ngovernment has chosen instead to hire a D.C. lobbying firm, at a cost \nof $150,000 a month, to ``work with the [Ethiopian Government] to \ndevelop and execute a public affairs plan to enhance the dialogue and \nrelationships with policymakers, media, opinion leaders and business \nleaders . . .'' in addition to ``meetings with members of Congress, \ntheir staffs, and executive branch officials.''\n  The issue the Ethiopian government needs to address is the repression \nof democracy and its citizens in Ethiopia. The solution to whatever \nnegative perception it has in the halls of the U.S. Congress is not a \npublic affairs one, but rather what concrete steps are being taken \nagainst democracy in Ethiopia. That is why I remain committed to \nworking with House leadership to have a vote scheduled on House \nResolution 128.\n  Mr. Speaker, I encourage leadership to schedule a vote and I call on \nmy colleagues to vote in favor and pass House Resolution 128. I will \ncontinue working with local Ethiopian community leaders in Colorado and \nacross the country to raise awareness of the human rights abuses \noccurring in Ethiopia and to bring relief from oppression to the \nEthiopian people.\n\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. COFFMAN", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "179", "extension": true, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "E1504-E1505", "wkday": "Friday", "day": "3", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "ETHIOPIA RESOLUTION", "id": "CREC-2017-11-03-pt1-PgE1504-3", "title": "ETHIOPIA RESOLUTION"}
