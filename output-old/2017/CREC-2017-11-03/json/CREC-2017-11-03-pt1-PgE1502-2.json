Mr. Speaker, today, I would like to recognize Brig. Gen. \nWilliam ``Robbie'' Robertson on his promotion in rank and to Chief of \nStaff of the Illinois Air National Guard.\n  In 1983, Brig. Gen. Robertson became an officer in the 182nd Airlift \nWing of the Illinois Air National Guard. Over his years of service, \nBrig. Gen. Robertson defended our nation in Operations Desert Shield, \nDesert Storm, Southern Watch, Joint Forge, Enduring Freedom and Iraqi \nFreedom. As a command pilot, he has flown over 4,800 hours in various \naircraft. Brig. Gen. Robertson's leadership was critical to the \nconversion of the unit from the OA-37 Dragonfly to F-16 Fighting Falcon \nand to the C-130 Hercules, which equipped our Armed forces with tools \nthey need to combat our nation's enemies.\n  In 2004, Brig. Gen. Robertson took over command of the 182nd Airlift \nWing. Under his command, the 182nd Airlift Wing maintained the highest \nmission capability rates for ten of the past eleven years for all C-130 \nunits. As commander, he is responsible for maintaining the combat \nreadiness of eight C-130 aircraft and over 1,200 Illinois Air National \nGuardsmen. The 182nd Airlift Wing received the Air Force Outstanding \nUnit Award five times during his tenure.\n  Brig. Gen. Robertson has committed his life to serving our nation. I \nam grateful for his leadership and sacrifice in the Illinois Air \nNational Guard. This country is blessed to have servicemen like William \nRobertson and I extend my sincere congratulations to him on his \npromotion to Brigadier General.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. LaHOOD", "itemno": 3}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 4}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "179", "extension": true, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "E1502", "wkday": "Friday", "day": "3", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "RECOGNIZING BRIG.
