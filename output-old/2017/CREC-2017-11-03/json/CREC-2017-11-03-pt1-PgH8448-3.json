Mr. Speaker, I rise today because, when we \ntalk about the Tax Code, it is easy to get bogged down in numbers. But \ntax reform isn't about percentages, it is about people.\n  It is about small-business owners like Sean Register, in Georgia's \nFirst Congressional District, who wants to grow his business that has \nbeen his passion for much of his life.\n  Mr. Register is the sole owner of Register International, a shipping \nbusiness in Bryan County, Georgia: a type of business very important to \nthe Coastal Empire's economy.\n  Mr. Register worked hard to guide his business through the 2008 \nfinancial crisis, but, in the economic downturn, was forced to lay off \nemployees, leaving himself as the only one remaining. Now, he would \nlike to hire employees but needs a little push to be able to afford the \nextra help.\n  With our tax reform plan, Mr. Register will have the ability to grow \nhis business and provide much-needed jobs to citizens in the First \nDistrict.\n  Tax reform has many faces, more than 300 million, and every single \none of them inspires our work in Congress as progrowth tax reform. We \nwill get this done for them.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. CARTER of Georgia", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "179", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H8448", "wkday": "Friday", "day": "3", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "TAX REFORM ISN'T ABOUT PERCENTAGES, IT IS ABOUT PEOPLE", "id": "CREC-2017-11-03-pt1-PgH8448-3", "title": "TAX REFORM ISN'T ABOUT PERCENTAGES, IT IS ABOUT PEOPLE"}
