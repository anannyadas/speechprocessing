Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend for that information.\n  First, I want to start by saying that the majority leader and I and \nfour other Members of the House had an opportunity to visit both Puerto \nRico and the Virgin Islands last weekend since we had our last \ncolloquy.\n  First, I want to thank the majority leader for organizing that trip \nand including me on it. It was an eye-opening trip. The majority leader \nand I have done an op-ed, which will be appearing sometime in the near \nterm, on our observations.\n  One of the things, Mr. Speaker, that I know the majority leader and I \nhad the opportunity to see, we were in Marathon, where you had housing \nthat was built after Andrew and housing that was built before Andrew.\n  Now, the difference was, after Andrew, that extraordinary hurricane, \nthe building code was changed. We saw the stark difference between \nhousing that survived essentially Maria and Irma and housing that did \nnot, and the difference was, of course, that the housing that survived \nwas built to different standards after Andrew.\n  The majority leader and I discussed this matter, along with Mr. \nBishop, who chairs the committee that oversees both Puerto Rico and the \nVirgin Islands, and I think all of us are convinced that it would be \npenny-wise and pound-foolish not to build back, as Florida did, to \nstandards that can withstand storms of this type.\n  So I wanted to thank the majority leader for his leadership on this \nissue.\n  The majority leader took the extraordinary effort to climb down a \nriver bank, go across the river--the river was very low at that point \nin time--and then up a very long ladder, because people were stranded \non the other side. The majority leader went to see them and assure them \nthat we would not forget them.\n  We were the first codel to go to the interior of Puerto Rico, as \nopposed to simply go to San Juan or another large city, so I thank the \nmajority leader for his leadership on that issue.\n  Mr. Leader, let me ask you about tax reform. That, of course, has \nbeen the big issue for some period of time now, but now we have a bill \nthat is not on the floor yet, but was released yesterday.\n  It is clear this bill will cut taxes, in our view, for the wealthy. I \ndon't know the statistics yet, what the division is, whether it is 80/\n20, as the initial proposal was, or perhaps a little less than that \nthat goes to those over $900,000 in income. But, in any event, it also \neliminates tax preferences that the middle class families rely on, and, \nobviously, we think it is going to face hurdles in Congress.\n  What I wanted to ask was: When does the gentleman expect the bill to \nbe marked up?\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield to my friend.", "turn": 2, "speaker": "Mr. HOYER", "itemno": 4}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "M001165", "text": "  Mr. McCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I \nam excited about his question, because I am excited about this bill.\n  For more than three decades, we have waited for tax reform. Many \npeople know the challenge of what they have with the government taking \nmore than they should, and the challenge to see individuals raise their \npaychecks.\n  Ways and Means has announced that they will start markups next week. \nI assume that it will take them probably a week to get through the \nentire bill, going through regular order as we do, and then I would \nassume that we would bring that to the floor right after. We would like \nto get this to the American people as soon as possible.\n  I am willing to talk about the bill, I am willing to talk about the \nbill in any different manner, because we spent a lot of time working on \nthis.\n  The very first thing that is going to happen for the American public, \ncome January 1, they are going to get more in their paycheck, because \nwhat we do, we take the standard deduction, because in the current law \ntoday, a single individual in America, it is only the first $6,000 they \nhave are tax free. Well, that is going to go to 12. For a couple, it is \ngoing to go to 24.\n\n  We take seven confusing rates and make it four. It is about cutting \nthem. Every rate is lowered except the highest rate.\n  Then we go and look at: How can we make America competitive? I \nstarted my first business when I was 20 years old. Small business is \nthe backbone of this country. Small businesses work harder than almost \nanybody else. We lower their rate to 25. That is the lowest it has been \nin 40 years.\n  Then all this money that is being pushed overseas that we tax too \nhigh so people won't bring it back--and there are trillions of dollars \nthere--we are going to have that money come back. And what are they \ngoing to do? They are going to invest in America.\n  Now, the name of our bill is Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Just yesterday, I \nwas with a company, Broadcom. We went into the Oval Office. I had \nworked with this company for quite some time. They started in America. \nBell Labs was part of it, and others. Three companies got together. \nThey are technology; they were building; they were growing. Then what \nthey found was, America's Tax Code was so burdensome on them, that for \nthem to compete around the world, they became a company that domiciled \nin Singapore.\n  Talking to them just the last month or so, laying out our tax bill, \nthey said: You know what, we are so confident in you passing this, we \nare going to announce that we are moving back to America.\n\n\n  They have $20 billion a year in revenue. They invest $9 billion every \nyear in R&D and manufacturing, those manufacturing jobs we care so much \nabout.\n  So yesterday, we were sitting in the Oval Office, and this is exactly \nwhat the CEO said. You know what he talked about? He grew up in \nSingapore. He said: When I turned 18, the greatest engineering school \nin America gave me an opportunity, MIT, but my parents did not have \nwealth, but they gave me a scholarship.\n  He comes to America, gets his education, becomes an American, builds \na company. He said it broke his heart he had to leave. He wants to give \nback to this country that has been so good to him, and he said this tax \nbill is actually doing it.\n  So we are creating jobs even before we pass it.\n  So I am very excited, but, if I may, I wanted to do a little research \nfor you. So we have taken all the IRS tax information, and I broke it \ndown in spreadsheets. So any district that wants to know about it, \nplease come see me, and I will walk you through it.\n  So I take your district, Maryland's Fifth, currently, 47 percent of \nyour filers in Maryland's Fifth take the standard deduction. They will \nbe better off, because it doubles right off the bat. Another 11 percent \nof those who itemize their deductions won't have to do that anymore. \nInstead of spending weeks on their taxes, they will put it on a \npostcard in minutes. So they are going to get a higher deduction; they \nare going to get more money. That means even before lowering of the \nrates, 58 percent of your district is better off from day one.\n  Now, in addition, we repeal the alternative minimum tax, that AMT. So \nthat costs 13,000 of your constituents in your district an average of \n$3,750. That is wiped away.\n  As we lower all the brackets, we will create a great deal of savings \nfor everybody else. So I am excited about this.\n  I would love to look forward to working with you on it, because just \nas we just passed the CHIP bill bipartisan and the IPAB with more than \n70 Democrats on that, I think this has been a very good week for \nAmerica.", "turn": 3, "speaker": "Mr. McCARTHY", "itemno": 5}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "H000874", "text": "  Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his comments. He \ntalks about IPAB. Of course, we add the $17.5 billion to the debt.\n  The gentleman did not mention the $1.5 trillion in additional debt \nthat the passage of the tax bill will result in, but he did talk about \nsome people who are going to be really advantaged.\n  So I would like to ask the majority leader: Will those people who \nwill be advantaged or, for that matter, disadvantaged have the \nopportunity next week to testify in a hearing on the substance of this \nbill?\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield to my friend.", "turn": 4, "speaker": "Mr. HOYER", "itemno": 6}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "M001165", "text": "  Mr. McCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I \nthink this is an excellent question.\n  So, first of all, you are asking about hearings. I caught you \nyesterday; I caught you on TV yesterday. You were pretty good. You were \nasked about hearings. This is what you said: A hearing is when you ask \nthe public to come in and say: What do you think? What are your \nsuggestions? How will this impact you?\n  Since taking the majority--you know what anniversary it is this week? \nWhen we rolled this bill out, it was the seventh anniversary of the \nRepublicans winning on that election day for the majority. This is what \nwe campaigned on.\n\n  Now, we have been working quite some time. Dave Camp has retired, but \nwhen he was with Ways and Means, he put out a Camp proposal. We have \nbeen having numerous hearings in those Congresses and this Congress. It \ntook us to win the White House, it took us to win the Senate, but, you \nknow what, we have kept our promise.\n  Let me walk you through the rest of what we have done. Since taking \nthe majority, we have held at least 59 hearings on tax reform with \nwitnesses from all sides on everything from simplification, to closing \nthose loopholes that we have talked so much about together, to creating \njobs, to accelerating economic growth. That is not to mention the \ncountless town halls and the forums of Members who have held them in \ntheir districts all across.\n  Now, if we need further witnesses on the burden of our Tax Code, look \nno further than just me. As I told you, I was 20 when I started that \nfirst business. You know the three lessons I learned in my first \nbusiness? I was the first one to work, I was the last one to leave, and \nI was the last one to be paid.\n  I remember investing all that I had. It was just a deli. I had six \nemployees. It was early in the morning, the front was all glass, and \nhere pulled up a little truck from the city, and they were knocking on \nthe door 2 hours before I started. I thought maybe they wanted to give \nme a key to the city for starting a new business. He wanted to give me \na ticket for my sign. I thought that was a little odd, because the sign \nwas bringing more people in that paid more sales tax that paid their \nsalary.\n  I learned the challenges of starting a small business.\n  What is so great about this bill is there are going to be so many \nmore Americans who are going to take that risk, start a small business, \nand be successful, with so many more Americans working.\n  So I am excited about this, because that is what we have been hearing \nin our hearings--all those hearings we had, all those town halls, all \nthose years we fought so hard to get to this point.\n  Mr. Speaker, I think this has been a good week.\n\n", "turn": 5, "speaker": "Mr. McCARTHY", "itemno": 7}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "H000874", "text": "  Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, he did not answer my question, however. Will \npeople have an opportunity to testify on this bill? The answer is no. \nNo American will have an opportunity to come to a hearing.\n  In 1968, the gentleman from California, the majority leader, was not \nhere. I was here. We had hearings over months, both sides of the aisle. \nOver 450 witnesses testified not on tax bills that may have been \noffered at some time in the future, including the Camp bill.\n  When the Camp bill, Mr. Speaker, was reported--actually, it wasn't \nreported. When it was put on the table by Chairman Camp from Michigan, \nwho is now retired, the Speaker's response was, when asked by the \npress, ``What are you going to do with that bill?'' he said, blah, \nblah, blah, blah. In other words, what he was saying was all talk. We \nare not going to do anything with that bill, and that bill never saw \nthe light of day.\n  It was paid for, Mr. Speaker. It was tough love. I didn't agree with \neverything in the Camp bill, but I congratulate Congressman Camp for \nhaving the courage to put a bill on the floor that was paid for, not \ncreating $1.5 trillion in additional debt that our children will have \nto pay. They are not here to testify either.\n  I don't want to really get into a debate on the specifics. We are \ngoing to have a lot of time to do that next week, and I intend to do it \nnext week, but he talked about small businesses being reduced to 25 \npercent. They will be if they make over $500,000.\n  That is why the NFIB is not for this bill, Mr. Speaker, talking about \nsmall business. They are the spokespersons for small businesses, and \nthey are not for this bill.\n  We will talk about the substance, but the process mirrors the process \nfor the Affordable Care Act: no hearings, no witnesses, very, very \nlittle time for the public or the Congress to digest the substance of \nthis bill dropped yesterday. It is going to be marked up on Monday. \nThat is 96 hours to consider a bill well over 500 pages.\n  Mr. Speaker, I asked about process. The reason I asked about process \nand regular order is because regular order provides for input from the \npeople we serve, the public, about whether the bill is good, bad, or \nindifferent and how it will impact them.\n  We are going to debate it here. We represent those people. But \nregular order is hearing from them before we act, not after we act.\n  Yes, we are replicating the Affordable Care Act: put on the table, \nquickly passed, jammed through, sent to the Senate. And it didn't work, \nMr. Speaker. I don't think this will work either.\n  I was here in 1986, Mr. Speaker, when Tip O'Neill and Ronald Reagan, \nBob Packwood, who was the Republican's chair of the Senate Finance \nCommittee, and Dan Rostenkowski from Illinois, the Democratic chairman \nof the Ways and Means Committee, worked together with Jim Baker, the \nformer Secretary of State but then Secretary of the Treasury, worked \nwith us to\n\n\ncome up with a bill that could be passed. And it was passed, Mr. \nSpeaker, with overwhelming votes from both sides of the aisle. It was \nthe last time we passed tax reform. Since then, we have just passed tax \ncuts.\n  Under Ronald Reagan, we passed a tax cut in 1981. The deficit \nincreased under Ronald Reagan 189 percent. Under George H.W. Bush, the \ndeficit increased 55 percent in 4 years, 189 percent in 8 years. Under \nBill Clinton, the debt increased 36 percent; George Bush, 87 percent \nafter the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts, and we were promised that they were \ngoing to energize the economy and dynamic scoring would come into \neffect and the country would be rolling in clover. Seven years later, \nwe had the deepest recession anybody serving in this body has \nexperienced, Mr. Speaker, and the debt exploded.\n  Barack Obama, just by contrast, inherited the worst economy any of us \nhas seen--the worst economy--hemorrhaging 787,000 jobs per month in \nJanuary of 2009. We had to bring the economy out of that deep \nrecession, and we invested dollars. But even given all that necessity \nand the $700 billion bill that we passed, that George Bush passed, \nwhere two-thirds of Republicans were opposed and which kept us out of a \ndepression, Barack Obama increased the debt by 1 percentage point more \nthan George Bush.\n  I say to my friend, the reason for having hearings, the reason for \nhaving economic experts like Mr. Bartlett, who worked for Ronald \nReagan, who said that tax cuts do not pay for themselves. They say $1.5 \ntrillion. I guarantee you, Mr. Speaker--I may not be here when we can \nfind this out--this is going to be far above $1.5 trillion in \nadditional debt, and my children and my grandchildren and my great-\ngrandchildren will be exposed to paying that bill.\n  It is a shame, Mr. Speaker, that we do not have extensive hearings on \nthis bill in the House and in the Senate. My judgment is the Senate \ndoesn't expect to have hearings on this either. They are just going to \ntry to jam it through, Mr. Speaker, and that is not good. That is not \ngood for this institution. Much, much more importantly, it is not good \nfor the present generation or generations to come.\n  We will debate, Mr. Leader. I know you are passionate about the \nsubstance. You are very knowledgeable about the substance. We talked \nabout it in private, and I admire the passion that you have and the \ninformation that you argue. I may differ with your information, but we \nwill have the opportunity to debate that, I think, next week and the \nweek after.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California.", "turn": 6, "speaker": "Mr. HOYER", "itemno": 8}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "M001165", "text": "  Mr. McCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  Mr. Speaker, the first lesson, if you ever take debate, if you cannot \nwin the argument on the substance of the bill, argue about process; go \nto process.\n  But you know what? This is not the beginning of the process. This is \nthe end of the process. For 31 years, we have been working to get here. \nWe had hearings upon hearings. We have gone to the American people. We \nwent to the American people 7 years ago this week, and they made a very \nbig decision: to change the direction.\n\n  We went back in 2014, and they made another big decision, and they \nmade one just a short time ago.\n  I heard you talk about a lot of Presidents, but I think you missed \none. Really, this bill is about growth in this country, about job \ncreation, about raising somebody's paycheck.\n  The history of America, from the beginning of time until 2006, we \nalways averaged more than 3 percent growth. If you just take the last 8 \nyears, if you take the very best year under Barack Obama--and I will go \napples to apples. Let's take Bill Clinton. The growth year under Bill \nClinton's worst year is higher than Barack Obama's best year. That is \nwhy the middle class is hurting. That is why this tax cut helps the \nmiddle class.\n  What is most interesting, you want to talk about debt? You talked \nabout a lot of Presidents. You can add up all those Presidents, and you \nknow what? Just one President, Barack Obama, added all that money and \nmore to the debt.\n  What is more interesting to me, if my friend is concerned about the \ndeficit, I want to ask you this: Why did you vote for a budget that \nincreases the deficit by $6.8 trillion over 10 years? Why would you do \nthat this year? Why would you, as a party, bring that forward as your \nplan.\n  Do you know what we are bringing forward? We are going right through \nthe rules. We have gone all through the hearings. We know, even before \nthis bill passes, just as yesterday, that the companies are coming back \nto America; $20 billion a year in revenue, one company has already \nannounced. They are going to put $3 billion every year into research \nand development and $6 billion into manufacturing.\n  I think the debate on process is over. This bill is less than 500 \npages.\n  You talk about us bringing it up? Yes, so the whole American public \ncan see the bill and read it. It is much different than when we talk \nabout your ACA--more than 2,000 pages, and I was here. I watched what \nwas brought right to the floor and jammed through. And you are right; \nthe ACA doesn't work.\n  We believed in doing something different. We made a promise to the \nAmerican public--3 days for public viewing. It is longer than 3 days.\n  We made a promise to the American public that we would make sure you \nkeep more of what you earn, we would create more jobs. You know what \nhappened after that last election? We just went through the second \nquarter of 3 percent growth.\n  You and I just talked about the number of hurricanes we just watched, \nthe devastation. People say it probably knocked off 1 percent of \ngrowth. You know what the Atlanta Fed just came out with? They are \npredicting, they think we are going to go to 4\\1/2\\.\n  Do you know what? The best days of America are in front of us because \nof the work we have done. Let's not argue about process, because we \nknow we have been through this process for 31 years. We know what the \nAmerican public has said. We know in the hearings what they have told \nus, and we have listened. Now I think is the time to have the courage \nto lead. Let's take what we heard in those committees and put it into a \nbill, exactly what we just did.\n  To have the returns before the bill is even passed of jobs coming \nback, to me, like I said earlier, this is a good week, but this is \ngoing to be a great month.", "turn": 7, "speaker": "Mr. McCARTHY", "itemno": 9}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "H000874", "text": "  Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, we are going to debate the substance of the \nbill; we are going to debate it fully. We think it will not hold up \nwell under that debate. Therefore, we will have a significant \ndifference.\n  He is right. The best economy anybody in this House has experienced--\nthe best economy--was the last 4 years of the Clinton administration, \nperiod. Guess what we had? We had a little bit of a tax increase. We \nincreased the gasoline tax, and we tried to pay to for infrastructure. \nWe haven't increased it since then.\n  The Republicans said: You do that, oh, the economy is going to go \ndown the drain. The best economy any Republican has experienced in \ntheir lifetime is under Bill Clinton. We balanced the budget 4 years in \na row under Bill Clinton, the only President you can mention that \nbalanced.\n  It never balanced under Ronald Reagan. It never balanced under George \nH.W. Bush. It never balanced under George Bush. As a matter of fact, as \nsoon as they took office, they made sure we wouldn't have further \nbalances because they cut taxes in 2001 and 2003, but they didn't cut \nspending.\n  He talks about President Obama. I know the majority leader will be \ninterested in these statistics. I didn't count January of 2017 because, \nafter all, that was the Obama economy. Trump had not done anything on \nthe economy, but let's start with February 2017.\n  Under Donald Trump, 232,000 jobs were created. That is great. That is \ngood. I would say that the Obama economy is still working.\n  Same exact month a year earlier, not 232, but 237,000 jobs were \ncreated under Barack Obama.\n  March 2017, 50,000 under Trump. March 2016, 225,000 jobs created \nunder Barack Obama.\n  April 2017, 207,000 jobs. Barack Obama was a little down that month, \n153,000 jobs.\n  145,000 under Trump, 43,000.\n  Then June of 2017, 210,000 under Donald Trump, 297,000 jobs under \nBarack Obama.\n  July of 2017, we are getting more recent. Under Trump--now he has \nbeen in\n\n\noffice a little longer--138,000. What was it under Barack Obama? \n291,000 jobs--double.\n  August of this year, just a few months ago, 169,000 under Donald \nTrump; 176,000.\n  Last month we had hurricanes. I will give the majority leader that. \nWe lost 33,000 jobs. Under Barack Obama, same month a year ago, 249,000 \njobs created.\n  As a matter of fact, under Barack Obama, we created 11,773,000 jobs.\n\n\n  Under George Bush, 2 million--excuse me--lost under George Bush, \nprivate sector jobs, a loss, after the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts, lost \n1,159,000 jobs. The last 12 months of the George Bush administration, \n2001 and 2003 tax cuts, we couldn't change economic policy. We were in \ncharge for the last 2 years, couldn't change it, lost 4,568,000 jobs.\n  Now, as a matter of fact, I have done a little thing for 68 years. \nOver 68 years, we had 36 years of Republican Presidents and 32 years of \nDemocratic Presidents. Under Republican Presidents, from Truman to \nObama, there were 35,448,000 jobs created, Mr. Leader. Under Democrats, \nin 32 years, 62,669,000 jobs.\n  Now, I would like to go on to another subject, as we could go on \ndebating this all day, but I will yield to my friend.", "turn": 8, "speaker": "Mr. HOYER", "itemno": 10}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "M001165", "text": "  Mr. McCARTHY. I thank the gentleman for yielding, because you did ask \na question in there.\n  When you talked about Bill Clinton, you asked: What did he have?\n  Well, when he first came in, he had Democrats in the majority, but \nall that growth happened because he won a Republican House and a \nRepublican Senate. That is when we turned it around with John Kasich as \nthe budget chair. That is when we balanced the budget in those 4 years.\n  We had to send him welfare reform how many times?\n  Three times. He vetoed it all the other times and claimed some glory.\n  But also there is another question you asked. I love a good debate. I \nlove to pick just facts when you don't want to look at the whole \npicture. The best thing to even just look at if you want to go: Did the \nelection matter? Did the election matter to the American public?\n  Well, I heard a lot of pundits on the other side say: Oh my God, if \nPresident Trump got elected, the market is going to crash.\n  You know what? Most everyone in America that invests for retirement \ninvests in the market, and President Donald Trump has given them all a \nraise because we set new records, more than 60 times; that is because \nof the belief of what they think he could achieve.\n  When you look at what he has been able to do with regulation, \nunbelievable.\n  The few headlines you didn't announce during Obama, when you were \ndoing those jobs, you didn't say anything about Nabisco leaving the \ncountry, or Burger King went and domiciled someplace else. Why?\n  What was the answer that President Obama would have when companies \nwere leaving America because the taxes were too high? We will pass a \nlaw to say they can't.\n  You know the difference that election has made?\n  We just proposed a tax bill. Companies are now coming to the Oval \nOffice to say: We are coming back. And all that means is more jobs, \nmore money for Americans.\n  I understand that we are going to probably have a philosophical \ndifference of agreement. I believe Americans should keep more of what \nthey earn. I know what you said a few weeks ago. My friend cast his \nvote in favor of a budget that calls for ``$3.9 trillion in revenue \nenhancements.''\n  You know who I think needs the revenue?\n  The American public. That is why we doubled the standard deduction, \nand that is for every American. On day 1 they will get more in their \ncheck.\n  Small businesses, lowest tax in 40 years. All that money that those \ncompanies were being pushed out are going to come back.\n  We can argue all you want about this, but for 31 years we have had \nthis argument. I think the American public is waiting for us to lead.", "turn": 9, "speaker": "Mr. McCARTHY", "itemno": 11}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "H000874", "text": "  Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, you noticed that he didn't talk about any of \nthe statistics I mentioned about job creation under Barack Obama. He \ndidn't talk about the 62 million jobs that were created in 32 years, as \nopposed to the 35 million jobs, just half of what we did in less than 4 \nyears than they had as President of the United States.\n  And what he didn't talk about was--he said: You know, we Republicans \nwere in charge of the Congress the last 6 years of the Clinton \nadministration.\n  That is right.\n  And what Bill Clinton said: Let's save Social Security first. Let's \nnot cut out revenues that we need to invest in the education and the \ngrowth of our economy.\n  They weren't for that, but they couldn't do anything about it.\n  Then, guess what happened. They took the Presidency. They had the \nHouse and they had the Senate.\n  Why couldn't you do what was done under Bill Clinton then, when you \ncontrolled everything, I ask my Republican friends, Mr. Speaker? Why \ncouldn't you, when you controlled every organ of government, do what \nyou say was done under the Clinton administration, because you were in \nthe minority, very frankly, or you were in the majority and controlled \nthings? Why couldn't you do it when you controlled everything? Why did \nyou leave us with 4.8 million hemorrhaging jobs as you came out of \noffice, and your economic program was still in place that you put in \nplace in 2001 and 2003, and the deepest recession you and I have \nexperienced in our life times?\n  And I am older than you are. You didn't answer that. You continue to \ntalk about what is going to happen.\n  I tell the story about the guy who comes in and he wants to be the \nleft fielder for the Nats, and he says: You know, I am going to hit 350 \nnext year.\n  I said: But you hit 260 last year.\n  He says: Well, yeah, I know, but this year I am going to hit 350.\n  And the other guy comes in and says: I would like the same job. I hit \n325 this year and I hit 324 last year. Who do you think you hire?\n  The whole point is, Mr. Leader--I say to the Speaker--is that \nperformance counts, not just talk, not just promises. Because I will \ntell you, Mr. Leader, I have been here a long time and I heard the same \nlanguage in 1981 from David Stockman. He now says it was baloney. I \nheard the same talk in 2001 and 2003. It didn't work out so well.\n\n  So, Mr. Speaker, I am going to go on to another subject because we \nneed to go to another subject, but we need to have this debate because \nit is critical for my children, my grandchildren, and my great-\ngrandchildren, and for generations to come as to whether this country \nis, like we did it under Clinton, on a fiscally sustainable path where \nwe are balancing budgets, or whether we are going to go back to the \ndeep deficits.\n  He didn't respond, 189 percent increase in the debt under Ronald \nReagan. One person in America, Mr. Speaker, can stop spending: the \nPresident. He can veto spending bills.\n  In my 37 years, we have never had a veto overridden of a President \nwho vetoed a bill because we spent too much money; not once in the 37 \nyears I have been here, Mr. Speaker.\n  But I want to go on to another subject that ought to be less \ncontroversial because I think the majority of Republicans and I think, \nunanimously, the Democrats want to see us do what the President, \napparently, has asked us to do. And that is, protect the DACA students, \nthe DACA doctors, the DACA teachers.\n  We have a Dream Act that has been filed. Every Democrat supports it. \nWe want that to come to the floor in this transparent, open process, \nand I have talked to the majority leader about it.\n  The President, contrary to Speaker Ryan's advice, rescinded the \nprotections for the childhood arrivals who arrived here through no \nfault of their own. He said to the Congress, it needs to be done in \nlegislation. He didn't say it needs to be done in legislation with a \nlot of other things. And the Speaker has said we are going to take one \nissue at a time. I won't bring out that quote, but the majority leader \nhas heard me use it before.\n  So I urge the majority leader because I believe he does not want to \nsend these mostly young people who don't know any other country but \nAmerica, who see themselves as Americans, who have\n\n\nbeen educated in our schools, serving in our communities, positive \nparticipants in growing America like so many immigrants before them, a \nnation of immigrants. Send me your tired, your poor, your huddled \nmasses.\n  We should have the DACA bill on the floor before we leave for this \nThanksgiving. Mr. Leader, I said this with respect to the Export-Import \nBank, that a majority of your party would vote for that if it came to \nthe floor. We got it to the floor and, as I predicted, a majority of \nyour Members voted for it.\n  I believe that very close to, if not all, a majority of your party \nwill vote for this, and the overwhelming numbers in this House will \nvote for that bill.\n  I would urge my friend to bring it to the floor before we leave for \nthe Thanksgiving break on the 16th of November. I would urge that \nbecause we are going to have some very messy 8 days after Thanksgiving, \nwith great workload on our desks; not the least of which is how to deal \nwith the sequester, how to deal with funding government for the balance \nof the year, what to do with flood insurance, and so many other issues; \nnot to mention our supplemental that we need to do with respect to \nHouston and Florida and Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands.\n  So I urge my friend to work with us to bring the Dream Act to the \nfloor, or bring your alternative to the floor. But let us not leave \nthese people, who the President says he loves, who are positive \nAmericans in everything but paper, who have been here almost all of \ntheir lives. Some came at 2 or 3 years of age and know no other \ncountry. Let's bring a bill to the floor that we can end before we go \non the Thanksgiving break, in a united way--we are going to be divided \non the tax bill. We understand that--but in a united way on this, where \neven Rush Limbaugh says we are not going to send these kids home.\n  I would hope that you could do that, Mr. Leader. I believe you have \nit in your heart to do it, and I would hope that we could do it.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield to my friend.", "turn": 10, "speaker": "Mr. HOYER", "itemno": 12}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "M001165", "text": "  Mr. McCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. I have \ngreat respect for the gentleman.\n  It is true, we just recently traveled to look at the hurricanes and \nwe had a lot of discussions. We disagree philosophically at times, but \nI think there is a place that we can find agreement upon.\n  I listen to you when you speak. I did just hear you ask right before: \n``Why couldn't you do it when you controlled everything?''\n  I kind of ask my friend the same thing. When you controlled \neverything, the White House, the House, and the Senate, you had a self-\nproclaimed master legislator as Speaker. You had an opportunity.\n  But I know this is the window, and I know President Trump wants to \nget it done. That is why he put out things that he wants to see done as \nwell. We talked about chain migration. We talked about border security.\n\n  We have been meeting--the Speaker and I just had a meeting yesterday \nwith a number of Members about this. We would like to solve this \nproblem overall, and I think it is a place everybody can work together, \nto secure our border, work on the chain migration problem, and solve \nthis problem for others.\n  Now, I know there is a 6-month time period here, and I don't want to \nconfuse issues because I would like to focus on this issue as well, but \nI don't want to have the government shutting down over an issue. You \nand I know we both discussed things like that, and I never think that \nis productive with whatever we do; but I look forward to continuing \nworking with you to solve this issue.", "turn": 11, "speaker": "Mr. McCARTHY", "itemno": 13}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "H000874", "text": "  Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, let me remind the leader that we passed the \nDream Act through the House of Representatives. We brought it to the \nfloor. We had a vote on it.\n  I know you and the Speaker said there was going to be a working task \nforce on this issue, and it has been, I think, going on for nigh on to \na month, but we haven't seen anything on the floor.\n  Mr. Leader, what I am saying is that I think we agree on this issue. \nLet us not confuse it with things on which we do not agree. Don't hold \nhostage these 800,000 young people who are positive--because if they \nare not positive they couldn't get into the Dream Act--I mean, they \ncouldn't get into DACA. They had to have a sterling performance, be in \nschool, be working, be in the Armed Forces. This is not a free pass to \npeople.\n  We agree on this, I think. Maybe I am wrong on that, but it seems to \nme that we agree. The President seems to agree.\n  Wouldn't it be--as we have done in the past some bipartisan things, \nand we thought that was good for the institution and good for the \nAmerican people to see us work in a bipartisan fashion. I think we \nagree on this issue.\n  Some of the things you want to attach to it, we are going to have \ndisagreements on. Why don't we enact what we agree upon?\n  By the way, this has been pending for a long period of time, as \nopposed to your tax bill. I know you think we have had hearings on it, \nbut, very frankly, that bill changed from Tuesday to Thursday of last \nweek.\n\n\n  We think your bill is a pretty new bill and we would like to have \nhearings on it. But nevertheless, on DACA, I think we have an \nagreement. If you bring it to the floor, I think it will get a majority \nof the votes, a significant majority. I think it will get close to 300, \nif not over. So I would just urge my friend to see if he, as the \nmajority leader--I was the majority leader--as the gentleman knows, I \ncould bring a bill to the floor or I could keep it off the floor. This \nis a bill that ought to come to the floor. We ought to give peace of \nmind to these 800,000 of folks, and we ought to pass this bill and give \nthe House an opportunity to work its will.\n  Mr. Speaker, if the gentleman does not want to say anything further, \nI yield back the balance of my time.\n", "turn": 12, "speaker": "Mr. HOYER", "itemno": 14}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 15}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "179", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H8475-H8479", "wkday": "Friday", "day": "3", "month": "November"}, "related_bills": [{"type": "HR", "context": "FIRSTPARAGRAPH", "congress": "115", "number": "2201"}, {"type": "HR", "context": "OTHER", "congress": "115", "number": "2201"}, {"type": "HR", "context": "FIRSTPARAGRAPH", "congress": "115", "number": "3043"}, {"type": "HR", "context": "OTHER", "congress": "115", "number": "3043"}, {"type": "HR", "context": "FIRSTPARAGRAPH", "congress": "115", "number": "3441"}, {"type": "HR", "context": "OTHER", "congress": "115", "number": "3441"}], "doc_title": "LEGISLATIVE PROGRAM", "id": "CREC-2017-11-03-pt1-PgH8475-2"}
