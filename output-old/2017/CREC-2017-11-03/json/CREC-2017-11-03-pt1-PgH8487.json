Madam Speaker, it is certainly an honor and pleasure to \nfollow my dear friend from Iowa with whom I got to share a little time \nlast\n\n\nweekend, be out in God's nature and just enjoy the best Iowa has to \noffer, and Steve King is one of those best things.\n  Well, we have heard a great deal about the New York terrorist, \nalthough I believe Governor Cuomo told us there are no terrorist ties \ninitially, before he had any time to know anything, really. But that \nseems to be kind of the way most mayors where these terrorist attacks \noccur respond. They immediately declare, ``This is not terrorist. No \nterrorist ties.'' And then, lo and behold, we find out, eventually, \nthere certainly are.\n  One of the problems that has been created during the last 8 years and \na little bit during the last part of the Bush administration is the \ndevelopment discussion of countering violent extremism. But I do want \nto touch on something about the diversity visa lottery program.\n  My first year in Congress, in 2005, we eliminated the diversity visa \nlottery program--at least voted in the House to eliminate it--but the \nSenate would not take it up, wouldn't take it up. We had a Republican \nmajority in the House and Senate, and the Senate wouldn't take it up.\n  Then, in November of 2006, we lost the majority in both Houses. And, \nof course, the Democratic majority in both Houses loved the diversity \nvisa lottery program. In fact, I have a floor speech from Senator Chuck \nSchumer where he extols the virtues of the diversity visa lottery \nprogram. Here are some highlights.\n  Senator Schumer said--this is May 24, 2006: ``As a Member of the \nHouse, I helped create this program, which my colleague, Senator \nKennedy, created in the Senate in 1990.''\n  He said: ``In fact, my city of New York has dramatically benefited \nfrom this program, and diverse countries such as Ireland, Poland, and \nNigeria have had large numbers of immigrants to be able to come, set \nroots, and help the diversity of New York and of America.\n  ``So this is an excellent program. Nobody has said it has done a bad \njob.''\n  Those were his comments in 2006.\n  Well, I am here to say it has done a bad job. So now nobody can say \nthat nobody has said it has done a bad job, because I am saying it has \ndone a bad job.\n  No matter how noble the original idea was, you should never trust the \ncountry's security to a lottery. That is insanity.\n  Of course, in a speech back in 2006, then Congressman Schumer, now \nSenator Schumer, said--or, actually, he was a Senator in 2006. But \nSenator Schumer said: ``I think America should admit many more of those \npeople but not at the expense of this small, successful program that \nguarantees that other countries, such as the Irelands, the Polands, and \nthe Nigerias that are unable to have immigrants come in for family \nreasons, can get people to come into this country.''\n  Senator Schumer also said, about the diversity visa lottery program: \n``But one of the things great about America is, again, we allow people \nfrom all over the world to come here.\n  ``So I plead with my colleagues, keep the diversity visa program.''\n  He said: ``As I ride my bike around New York City on the weekends, I \nsee what immigrants do for America. This program has dramatically \nhelped. Neighborhoods such as Woodlawn and Greenpoint have been \nrevitalized by new Irish and Polish immigrants. Neighborhoods such as \nEast Flatbush and Harlem have been revitalized by West African \nimmigrants. We don't have to stop this program.''\n\n\n  Well, again, it is insanity to trust our national security to a \nlottery, and that is what the diversity visa lottery program does.\n  We have had terrorists, and we have known it for a number of years, \nthat have been getting their names into the lottery so that hopefully \nthey would win the lottery and come to America to kill Americans.\n  I understand that there was a stepped-up effort in the last couple of \nyears to vet people a little better, but the trouble here is, as then-\nDirector Comey of the FBI testified before our Judiciary Committee, we \nhave got nothing to vet these people against, so many of them, from \nSyria, from Yemen.\n  He said in Iraq, we had all of the government records. It turns out, \neven with all the government records, they let in two terrorists. We \nhad fingerprints of theirs on IEDs that killed Americans, and they let \nthem in, and eventually realized they had made a mistake. So they said \nwe are going to step up our vetting after they realized they had \nadmitted known terrorists into the United States that created IEDs to \nkill and maim Americans.\n  They could say we were stepping up the vetting program, but when \nthere is no information--this is what Comey said. With Iraq, we had the \ngovernment records, we had fingerprints, we took fingerprints off IEDs.\n  Syria, Yemen, we have got nothing. The government there doesn't give \nus their records. We have nothing to work from. In Syria, for a while, \nISIS had taken over one of the printing facilities where they could \nprint the passports. So we had no information to work from. We didn't \nknow what was true and what wasn't.\n  So, once again, we were trusting our national security and the lives \nof Americans to a fatal game of Russian roulette, but it was from the \nMiddle East, it was from Uzbekistan, it was from places where people \nhave been radicalized.\n  I have got the numbers here. In fact, let's see, diversity visa \nprogram statistics, as I understand, the New York terrorist, the ISIS \nsupporter who killed eight people, wounded so many others, in 2011, we \nhad 5,091 from Uzbekistan. There were none from Poland, and in the top \nten, there were certainly none from Ireland.\n  We had, in 2012, 4,800 from Uzbekistan; and even better news, we had \n4,453 from Iran. For those who are not keeping track, the Iranian \nGovernment has not given us information that we can count on about \npeople in Iran who want to come to America, and we know Iran is the \nlargest national supporter of terrorism in the world. So we don't have \nmuch of anything to vet these people on, but, you know, Senator Schumer \nsaid it is a great program, and nobody said anything against it as he \nrides his bicycle around.\n  Well, fortunately he wasn't riding his bicycle around in front of the \nterrorist that was allowed in on the program he thinks was so grand. \nAnd, frankly, I am grateful he was not on his bicycle in front of that \nterrorist killer that his program let in.\n  In 2013, Uzbekistan, we had 5,101 come in from Uzbekistan. We did \nhave 2,038 come from Poland that year.\n  In 2014, another 6,027 that we could not adequately vet coming from \nIran. Some of them we could with relatives, but many of those people \nsimply could not be vetted. We don't know if they were sent here by the \nIranian Government to kill Americans or not.\n  In 2015, we have another 4,992 from Iran; Uzbekistan, we had another \n4,368.\n  So we don't have the numbers from 2016 yet, unfortunately, but \nhopefully that gives some idea of what we are dealing with.\n  We also need to understand that government officials tell us: You \nknow, we had no indication this guy was a terrorist.\n  There were even people from the government, the Feds, who were \nsaying: Gee, you know, this was not a known person.\n  This New York terrorist, not a known person to the Federal \nauthorities.\n  Well, it turns out, in 2015, they interviewed him. He had terrorist \nties.\n  The thing people need to understand is--and I have been saying this \nfor years, I have grilled Director Mueller on this issue. I was \ncontacted by one media outlet that says: Why are you just bringing this \nup now about the purge of training materials?\n  My goodness. I have been talking about this for years, I have been \nmade fun of about this for years, but I have been right about it for \nyears, Michele Bachmann and I.\n  It should not have been classified what they took out of the FBI \nmaterials, but they classified it so we couldn't show America how \nstupid some of their purging was, how senseless, how, as some of our \nagents told me, we are blinding ourselves of the ability to see our \nenemy.\n  So I grilled Mueller some years ago over the fact that they got a \nheads-up twice that the older Tsarnaev brother was radicalized, he was \na terrorist, he\n\n\nwas a threat to American lives. They didn't do anything; the CIA didn't \ndo anything.\n  The FBI finally sends some agents out. They interviewed the older \nTsarnaev, but they didn't know what to ask. They don't know what the \nsigns are of someone who is radicalized, because they have had beat \ndown their throats for so long, and this was the Obama administration, \nthey had the FBI's Guiding Principles document on training. And this \nwas the document that the FBI used to say: Oh, no. We have got to be \npolitically correct. We can't teach people about how to find and spot a \nradical Islamist.\n  So there was a purge of FBI training materials.\n  There is a fantastic Judicial Watch special report, it can be found \non their website, dated December 5 of 2013, ``U.S. Government Purges of \nLaw Enforcement Training Material Deemed `Offensive' to Muslims.''\n  Who was complaining? Well, the Council on American-Islamic Relations, \nthe Islamic Society of North America, and they just happened to have \nknown contacts who were named as coconspirators supporting terrorism in \nthe Holy Land Foundation prosecution.\n\n  What did Mueller's FBI do under Mueller's specific direction? They \ncreated an outreach program. They called them their community outreach \npartner for these people who judges said: No. There is plenty of \nevidence to show that these people have ties supporting terrorism. No. \nWe are not going to eliminate their names.\n  The Dallas Federal Court said that; the Fifth Circuit Court of \nAppeals in New Orleans said that. It didn't make it to the Supreme \nCourt, but two courts said: Yeah, there is plenty of evidence to see \nthere are plenty of ties here, evidence of their ties to known \nterrorists.\n  So it wasn't until 2008, after years of having this evidence, that \nDirector Mueller sent kind of an apologetic letter to CAIR, Council on \nAmerican-Islamic Relations, saying: You know, we better suspend our \ncommunity partnership for a while.\n  It is just unbelievable, but it was the political correctness during \nthe Obama administration that has gotten people killed, because they \npurged our training material. And God bless Ken Jensen, FBI agent. He \nhad prepared the 700-page training materials that Mueller ordered \ndestroyed.\n  Somebody needed to study that material before they went out and \ntalked to Tsarnaev. If they had, they would have recognized this guy \nhas probably radicalized, and we better be on the alert. They could \nhave saved lives at the Boston Marathon if Mueller had not prevented \nthem from knowing how to do their job. And he is special counsel.\n  By the way, Madam Speaker, the former Director of the FBI who blinded \nthe FBI of their ability to see terrorists, why do we think he came out \nwith the indictments exactly when he did? Well, I can tell you why, \nbecause he is as easy to read as anybody in the world. He came out with \nthose indictments when he did because he had people starting to call \nfor his resignation, starting to demand that he be removed, demanding \nthat he recuse himself. Even The Wall Street Journal, that has been \nvery sympathetic, they pointed out it was time for him to go. What did \nhe do? He immediately comes out with indictments to show: No, no, no. \nYou can't demand that I go. I am too relevant.\n  You look at those indictments, and I am for punishing anybody who has \ncommitted a crime, but there was no need for a special counsel to come \nup with what he did. The FBI could have done that. The Department of \nJustice could have done that. We didn't need Mueller and 20 lawyers, \nall of these Hillary Clinton sycophants, in there to come up with this. \nThe DOJ could have done this. It was just a ridiculous couple of \nindictments to be spending all these millions of dollars for.\n  We also know that same kind of conduct occurred when Comey came to \nthe Hill and testified there is no trace of evidence of collusion \nbetween President Trump and the Russians.\n  Well, Mueller had to be puckering up, because he knew: Uh-oh. Now \nthere is testimony from the FBI Director that there is no basis for me \nto be special counsel and to have hired all these people. Wow. So the \nPresident could be in line to fire me, because now we have testimony \nfrom the FBI Director there is no basis for this investigation. Shut \nher down.\n  So that night, they leak out he is investigating President Trump for \nobstruction of justice. Excuse me? We all know what that so-called \nevidence was. They will never, ever get a conviction, because it was \nnot obstruction of justice.\n  Obstruction of justice is when you do what Comey and Loretta Lynch \ndid to prevent a proper investigation, and you make an agreement with \npotential defendants that if they will just give you their laptops and \nlet you look at them, you will destroy all that you find, and you will \nnever use any of that information to prosecute them, and you give them \nimmunity from prosecution. That is not what you do if you are going to \nprosecute a case. No.\n  You get them in a bind and then you tell them: Here are the charges \nyou are looking at unless you come clean and identify the person above \nyou with whom you were working and what they did.\n  Then you work up the chain to the big fish, which is how organized \ncriminal organizations have been prosecuted over the years. It would \nwork in this case, but Director Comey was so busy figuring out how to \nexplain how Hillary Clinton should not be prosecuted, though the \nevidence was basically for a slam dunk case of conviction, that he \noverlooked properly pursuing the case.\n  We don't need Director Mueller. We need him gone, and we need a \nspecial prosecutor to get into this, clearly, since Jeff Sessions \nrecused himself on anything involving Hillary Clinton and Russia. And \nwe can't have Rod Rosenstein, for heaven's sake, now that we know that \nhe and Mueller should not be involved in this special counsel \nsituation, because they both were engaged in the coverup of the initial \nRussian investigation that revealed Russia was trying to corner the \nmarket on uranium, and they had to seal that, because if they hadn't \nsealed that and covered up that evidence and that investigation, then \nHillary Clinton would not have been able to hit the Russian \nmegamillions lottery by authorizing the sale of uranium to Uranium One \nthat ends up in Russian hands.\n  Bill Clinton wouldn't have gotten $500,000. He didn't hit the \nmegamillions, except for the 145 or so that went into the Clinton \nFoundation.\n  Mueller cannot possibly investigate this. He is in it up to his \neyeballs, and so is Rosenstein. They both ought to do the decent thing. \nI know it is not characteristic, but they ought to do the decent thing \nand resign and let somebody that is not completely submerged in the \noriginal coverup investigate this whole matter.\n  Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n", "turn": 1, "speaker": "Mr. GOHMERT", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "179", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H8487-H8489", "wkday": "Friday", "day": "3", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "ISSUES OF THE DAY", "id": "CREC-2017-11-03-pt1-PgH8487", "title": "ISSUES OF THE DAY"}
