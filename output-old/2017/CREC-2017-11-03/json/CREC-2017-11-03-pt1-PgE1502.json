Mr. Speaker, it is with great pride that I rise \ntoday to congratulate my constituent and friend, Rev. Dr. Thomas L. \nWalker, for 50 faithful years in ministry, and 47 years as pastor of \nEbenezer Missionary Baptist Church.\n  Dr. Walker, a native of Edgecombe County, North Carolina, was called \nto the ministry in 1970. At the age of 22, he and his wife Joyce, and \ntheir two children, Timothy and Teresa, began a ministry that would \ninspire and uplift the faithful for decades. Today, under his \nleadership, the church's community outreach includes TV and radio \nministries, a daycare center, a tutorial program, and ministerial \ntrainings.\n  The church also has a non-profit corporation called the EBC ``ATOM'' \nProject, Inc., whose objective is to improve the quality of life for \nlow and middle-income citizens. Dr. Walker has committed his life to \nserving both his community and fellow man. One of Pastor Walker's many \ntalents is his success as a gospel recording artist. Through song, his \nmessages and voice have uplifted and inspired countless individuals. \nHis signature, ``One Day at a Time,'' continues to inspire hearts \nacross the nation.\n  In 1996, Dr. Walker received troubling news when he was diagnosed \nwith prostate cancer. Yet, he would not sit idly by or be sidelined. \nHis perseverance led him to write, ``Brother to Brother--You Don't Have \nto Die of Prostate Cancer.'' A thoughtful and informative book, Dr. \nWalker presents an honest account of his challenges and frustrations, \nwith the goal of empowering men and their families. In April of 2014, \nFirst Lady Joyce Walker, having battled sickness for many years, was \ncalled home to be with the Lord. Dr. Walker remained steadfast and \ncontinues to stand as a pillar of strength, persistence, and a living \ntestament of the Gospel.\n  Mr. Speaker, I celebrate this great North Carolinian and ask that my \ncolleagues in the United States House of Representatives join me in \nexpressing sincere appreciation for Dr. Walker's fortitude, \nfaithfulness, and servant leadership on this historic milestone.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. BUTTERFIELD", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 3}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "179", "extension": true, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "E1502", "wkday": "Friday", "day": "3", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "IN RECOGNITION OF THE REV.
