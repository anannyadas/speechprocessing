Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate \nformer United States Representative Lynn C. Woolsey on her 80th \nBirthday. She represented California's 6th congressional district, \nincluding Marin County and most of Sonoma County from 1993 to 2013.\n  Lynn was born in Seattle, Washington on November 3, 1937. A graduate \nof Lincoln High School, she attended the University of Washington from \n1955 to 1957. Lynn received her Bachelor of Science degree in 1980.\n  As a working single mother in Northern California, Lynn spent several \nyears receiving public assistance to help make ends meet. During her \n20-year career in the House of Representatives, she focused on issues \nfacing children and families. She describes herself as the ``first \nformer welfare mom to serve in Congress.'' Prior to entering public \nservice, Lynn opened her own human resources consulting and employment \nagency, Woolsey Personnel Service, and taught at the College of Marin \nand the Dominican University of California.\n  Lynn won her first election in 1984, when she ran for a city council \nseat in Petaluma. She served on the Petaluma City Council until 1992, \nher last year as Vice Mayor. The people of Sonoma and Marin Counties \nelected Lynn to Congress in 1992 and continued to elect her to eight \nmore terms.\n  In Congress, Lynn served as a member of the House Foreign Affairs \nCommittee, Chair of the Committee on Education and Labor's Workforce \nProtections Subcommittee and as a senior member of the House Committee \non Science and Technology. Lynn had many proud moments in federal \npublic service. She secured federal funds for her district for a \nvariety of projects, including funds for the Petaluma River flood \ncontrol project and for the seismic retrofit of the Golden Gate Bridge. \nShe voted against authorizing the invasion of Iraq and consistently \nvoted to suspend funding for the wars. She was one of Congress' \nforemost advocates on education issues, offering legislation to expand \nschool breakfast programs, expand childcare programs and encourage \nyoung girls to study science and math. Her measure to provide job-\nprotected leave for family members of injured soldiers was incorporated \ninto the FY 2008 defense authorization bill. Lynn's former colleagues, \nstaff and constituents admire her immeasurably and continue to benefit \nfrom her dedicated years of service.\n  Mr. Speaker, former United States Representative Lynn C. Woolsey \nserved her constituents diligently for ten consecutive terms. Her \ncareer is an excellent model of principled and dedicated leadership for \nmembers of this\n\n\nbody. It is therefore fitting and proper that we commemorate her on her \n80th birthday and send her our best wishes here today.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. THOMPSON of California", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 3}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "179", "extension": true, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "E1501-E1502", "wkday": "Friday", "day": "3", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "COMMEMORATING THE HONORABLE LYNN C.
