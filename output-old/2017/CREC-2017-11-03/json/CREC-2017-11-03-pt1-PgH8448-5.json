Mr. Speaker, I rise today to support the CHAMPIONING \nHEALTHY KIDS Act.\n  This important legislation continues much-needed funding for programs \nlike the Children's Health Insurance Program, community health centers, \nand our rural hospitals.\n  Community health centers are a critical access point to care, and I \nhave seen firsthand how they bless each person they serve.\n  In addition to community health centers, my district includes many \nrural hospitals, which are truly a lifeline for my constituents.\n  That is why I join my colleagues in letters urging to delay the cuts \nfor the proposed disproportionate share of hospital and community \nhealth centers for at least 2 years. And I am happy to see this \nlegislation doing just that.\n  I won't let Washington forget about the rural communities at the \nheart of my district. They deserve better.\n  And guess what? This bill is fully paid for.\n  While delaying these cuts is a step in the right direction, I will \ncontinue to fight for a permanent solution.\n  Mr. Speaker, I thank the Energy and Commerce Committee for their \nwork,\n\n\nand I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this bill.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. ALLEN", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "179", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H8448-H8449", "wkday": "Friday", "day": "3", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "SUPPORTING HEALTHY KIDS", "id": "CREC-2017-11-03-pt1-PgH8448-5", "title": "SUPPORTING HEALTHY KIDS"}
