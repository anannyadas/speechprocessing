Madam Speaker, again and again, President Donald Trump has \npromised tax reform that would help the middle class; and again and \nagain, the President has broken those promises.\n  Instead of helping America's middle class and the working poor, his \nproposals offer big breaks for millionaires and corporations, and \npainful cuts for nearly everyone else.\n  The House Republican plan rolled out yesterday, rolls over the middle \nclass and those looking to ascend the middle class. It cuts the estate \ntax, a tax that only affects a few thousand of the wealthiest American \nfamilies, all while raising taxes on the lowest income bracket from 10 \nto 12 percent.\n  This plan slashes commonsense deductions for middle class families, \nincluding those for medical bills, student loan interest, and even \nmortgage interest. My Republican colleagues claim their plan would save \npeople money,\n\n\nbut they say nothing about the $1.5 trillion their plan would add to \nthe deficit over the next 10 years. That is about $12,000 of debt for \neach American household.\n  The American people deserve real tax reform, not just more tax cuts \nfor the wealthy and powerful and those connected.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. TONKO", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "179", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H8480-H8481", "wkday": "Friday", "day": "3", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "AMERICANS DESERVE REAL TAX REFORM", "id": "CREC-2017-11-03-pt1-PgH8480-6", "title": "AMERICANS DESERVE REAL TAX REFORM"}
