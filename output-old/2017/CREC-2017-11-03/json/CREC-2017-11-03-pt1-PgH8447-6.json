Mr. Speaker, I rise to celebrate 50 years of community \nservice rendered by the United Way of Greater McHenry County.\n  Members of the community came together in the fall of 1966, with the \nprimary purpose of raising funds in order to help deserving \norganizations achieve their goals.\n  In that first year alone, United Way raised more than $21,000. This \nmoney went to funding organizations such as the Salvation Army and the \nAmerican Red Cross, which remain faithful partners today.\n  By 1977, the United Way's importance was rapidly increasing \nthroughout the community, as they created new partnerships with several \nagencies.\n  In fact, the United Way of Greater McHenry County became the fastest \ngrowing United Way of its size in the country. During their 25th \nanniversary year, they delivered more than $1.1 million to local \norganizations and have continued that record over the years.\n  I am grateful to celebrate this 50-year milestone with the people of \nUnited Way of Greater McHenry County as they continue to help our \nneighbors help each other.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. HULTGREN", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "179", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H8447", "wkday": "Friday", "day": "3", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "CELEBRATING 50 YEARS OF GIVING BACK TO McHENRY COUNTY", "id": "CREC-2017-11-03-pt1-PgH8447-6", "title": null}
