Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my strong \nopposition to the Republican deal to cut taxes for the superrich at the \nexpense of everyone else.\n  Apparently, Republicans believe the American people are just too \ndistracted to recognize a con game when they see one. But make no \nmistake, the Republican plan is about giving tax breaks to the largest \ncorporations and the superrich. It is not about the middle class or \npeople who have to go to work every day. If working families had an \nopportunity to read the fine print, they would see that this bill has \nnothing to do with them.\n  Don't be fooled. The money needed to make this plan work has to come \nfrom somewhere. It will hurt working Americans and will cause our \ndeficit to explode.\n  The strength of our country requires investing in people: so our \nchildren can have a better future, so their parents can have better \njobs, so small businesses can thrive, and so seniors can retire with \ndignity. That is the America that we want, and that is the American \npromise we must keep.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mrs. DEMINGS", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "179", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H8449", "wkday": "Friday", "day": "3", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "CUTTING TAXES FOR THE SUPERRICH AT THE EXPENSE OF EVERYONE ELSE", "id": "CREC-2017-11-03-pt1-PgH8449", "title": "CUTTING TAXES FOR THE SUPERRICH AT THE EXPENSE OF EVERYONE ELSE"}
