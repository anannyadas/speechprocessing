Madam Speaker, it is my honor to be recognized to \naddress you here on the floor of the House of Representatives, and I \nhave a couple of topics that I intend to take up for the folks here \nwatching and listening.\n  Madam Speaker, I want to talk about the Heartbeat bill and I want to \ntalk about the immigration bill and the tax policy all together. But \nthere is an important issue before this Congress that I want to hear \nabout before I take up these issues. And for that purpose, I would be \nhappy to yield to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. DeSantis) to get this \noff of his heart.", "turn": 1, "speaker": "Mr. KING of Iowa", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "D000621", "text": "  Mr. DeSANTIS. Madam Speaker, I thank my friend from Iowa for his \nleadership.\n  Madam Speaker, it was really distressing to hear that Christ Church \nin Alexandria is removing a monument honoring its most famous \nparishioner, George Washington. It just made me think: What is this \nworld coming to?\n  Now, Christ Church is free to do as it pleases, but I think we are \nalso free to criticize such an absurd course of action. If we can't \nhonor the Father of our Country, then we truly are drowning in a sea of \nknee-jerk political correctness.\n  George Washington was one of the few truly great men, an American \noriginal without whom we would not be standing here today as free \npeople.\n  I just want to tick off a few things before I yield back to my \ncolleague from Iowa, but this is important.\n  His stewardship during the American Revolution brought America a \nvictory that we really had no right to win against the most powerful \narmy on Earth.\n  He only had one-third of the country behind the revolutionary cause, \nyet, against all odds, Washington led our country to victory. But then \nhaving won that military victory, what does Washington do?\n  Throughout all of human history, when you win a military victory, \nthat commanding general then seizes power for themselves and creates a \nsociety which is at that individual's beck and call.\n\n\n  That is not what George Washington did. He famously surrendered his \nsword to the Continental Congress and gave up power voluntarily because \nhe wanted to establish a republic. Then he went home to Mount Vernon. \nWhen word of Washington's relinquishment of power reached King George \nIII in England, he was flummoxed. He said: Well, if that is really \ntrue, then Washington is the greatest man in the world.\n  It is unheard of that you would relinquish power in that way. \nNapoleon, on his deathbed--obviously, he had a lot of trials and \ntribulations--said: Look, they wanted me to be another Washington, and \nI just couldn't do it.\n  Washington presided over the Federal Convention in 1787, which \ncreated our Constitution. Had Washington not been willing to lend his \nlegitimacy to that proceeding and to the Constitution, I think it is \npretty clear the Constitution would have never been ratified.\n  He gets elected the first President of the United States unanimously. \nI think we really needed somebody with Washington's character and \nstature to be able to launch this new ship of state. If you had had \nanybody else--and there were many great Founding Fathers--you may not \nhave been able to launch it successfully. He was that type of man.\n  He was also somebody who has offered some of the most eloquent \ndefenses of religious liberty in our country's history. I want to quote \nfrom a letter he wrote to the Hebrew congregation at Newport in 1790.\n  He said: ``It is now no more that toleration is spoken of as if it \nwere the indulgence of one class of people that another enjoyed the \nexercise of their inherent natural rights, for, happily, the Government \nof the United States, which gives to bigotry no sanction, to \npersecution no assistance, requires only that they who live under its \nprotection should demean themselves as good citizens in giving it on \nall occasions their effectual support.''\n  Those are words that I think ring as true today and are as important \ntoday as they were in 1790.\n  He established a two-term voluntary limit for President. People \nthought he could have been President for life, and, of course, he could \nhave been. He didn't think that that was the right way to go. In fact, \nhis entire career--from surrendering his sword at the Continental \nCongress to the two-term limit--was dedicated to the notion that in a \nrepublic--the government of laws and not of men--no one individual is \nindispensable. Yet he really was the exception to that rule. He was \ntruly first in war, first in peace, and first in the hearts of his \ncountrymen.\n  Mr. Speaker, I think, when you look back at history, you can \nobviously point to things that we don't necessarily like, and I think \nit is fair to air that. But to simply remove somebody's monument--\nsomebody who truly exhibited greatness--I think is a direction in this \ncountry that we do not want to go.\n  So I just thought it was important to stand up here and to say that \nthe Father of our Country is somebody who all Americans should hold in \nprofound esteem because I don't think we would be sitting here on the \nfloor of the House of Representatives in the most powerful country on \nEarth if Washington had not existed.", "turn": 2, "speaker": "Mr. DeSANTIS", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "K000362", "text": "  Mr. KING of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Florida for \nhis presentation and certainly support and endorse every word that I \nhave heard here.\n  I think about the leadership that George Washington provided, and a \ncouple of things come to mind. One of them is, in my six trips into \nEgypt, I have met with President el-Sisi each of those times. He finds \nhimself in a position in Egypt very similar to where Washington was in \nhis first term, Madam Speaker, and that is now with a constitution that \nhas a limitation of two 4-year terms for the President of Egypt. He was \nelected under that constitution, committed to accepting civilian \nleadership of the military--and that has been taking place--rebuilding \nthe Christian churches in Egypt, establishing a parliament that \nreflects women as well as men, and religious diversity in allowing for \na lot more religious freedom in Egypt. He has followed through on all \nof that.\n  The real test will be if President el-Sisi is re-elected in Egypt \nwhen he is up for that re-election, if that should happen, and I hope \nit does, then I am also listening very closely to what would be his \nsecond inaugural address. In that second inaugural address, I am \ncalling upon him to announce that the second term will be his last term \nin keeping with the standards that are set by George Washington. That \nis how you transition into a republican form of government that is a \nrepresentative form of government, a government of we the people.\n  I would also reflect, as I listened to Mr. DeSantis speak about the \ngreatness of George Washington--and we understand that there has been, \nI think, an erroneous reading of history and a misinterpretation of \nhistory--that there is an effort to purge from and to revise our \nAmerican history to conform with what contemporary values are. So now \nif we disparage and expunge from history the statues, the faces, the \nwords, and the leadership of people--some of whom were slaveowners back \nin that time: Washington, Jefferson, and a list of others all the way \nup the line--then we fall prey to this weakness of wanting to judge our \nFounding Fathers and the people who went before us in each generation \nby the standards of this generation.\n  Yet we admire people like William Wilberforce and John Adams who \nstood for years to defend the battle against slavery. They made the \nmoral arguments against slavery. We had people who were against slavery \nwho owned slaves. If you were in Virginia, and if you owed taxes, then \nyou couldn't free\n\n\nyour slaves. That was true for some of our Founding Fathers who found \nthemselves in that position. They couldn't legally free their slaves. \nThey opposed slavery anyway, but they just couldn't pay their taxes. \nThat is a piece of history that isn't often discussed, Madam Speaker.\n  We need to judge Washington for what he did as the Father of our \nCountry and judge him within the context of the values that they had \nthen. We should remember that they tried to eliminate slavery in the \nfounding documents of this country. They were not able to do so because \nthey had enough representation in the South that prevented it.\n\n  So we were, then, less than a century later swept into a giant Civil \nWar which was still the bloodiest war that we have been involved in in \nour 200-plus years of our history, and that was a bloody war of brother \nfighting brother, North versus South. 600,000 Americans--mostly White, \nmale Christians--went to their graves to put an end to slavery. That is \nhow huge that contest was.\n  That argument needed to be won here. It was debated here in the U.S. \nHouse of Representatives and in the United States Senate. It went \nthrough the Supreme Court.\n  I listened to the testimony of Star Parker who testified this past \nWednesday morning on the Heartbeat Bill, H.R. 490. Star Parker is a \nmagnificent witness. I count her as a real leader in this country and a \ngood friend. She is also an African American who has had several \nabortions before she came to the conviction that she understood that \nlife begins at the moment of conception and that human life is sacred \nin all of its forms. So now her voice is being heard--heard in this \nCongress and heard across the land.\n  As an African American, she compared slavery to the abortion issue \ntoday. I look back in the slavery era, the first half of the 19th \ncentury building up to the Civil War, and I ask myself, in looking back \nat my heritage and my predecessors and the things that they believed in \nand passed on down to me: Where would I have been? Where would I have \nbeen, Madam Speaker, if I had been, say, born in 1800?\n  Would I have had enough vision to step forward and oppose slavery in \nthe same fashion that I oppose abortion today? I would hope I would \nhave. I pray I would have. I would think that those same principles \nwould apply as Star Parker drew that comparison and that juxtaposition \nin her testimony last Wednesday before the Constitution and Civil \nJustice Subcommittee.\n  Yet here we are today with a similar debate and a similar argument \nbefore us. Slavery was morally wrong. Today, I have never in my \nlifetime met someone who defended slavery, but there were many of them \nwho defended slavery right here where I stand, Madam Speaker, and \nacross the rotunda in the United States Senate where they stand. They \ndefended it because it was the legacy of the culture and the \ncivilization of their times that was included within every civilization \nthroughout the world. Every nation had to figure out how to throw off \nthat yoke of slavery and give all creatures created in God's image an \nequal opportunity and equal freedom. It cost a lot of blood to put an \nend to that--600,000 lives.\n  As a matter of fact, not that long ago, I was standing in the Lincoln \nMemorial. They call it the temple area there around where the huge \nstatue of Lincoln is seated in his chair up in the Lincoln Memorial. \nEvery time I have walked up those steps, I have walked over to \nLincoln's left--it is my right as I face him--I read Lincoln's second \ninaugural address. I don't have the text of it precisely in front of \nme, but I will get the gist of it, Madam Speaker.\n  There in his second inaugural address--remember, the Civil War is not \nover yet, so we don't know how it is going to end. He said:\n\n       Until every drop of blood drawn with the lash shall be paid \n     by another drawn with the sword, as was said, so it is \n     written that the Word of the Lord is true and righteous \n     altogether.\n\n  Now, I stood there some time back and read that. Sometimes you can \nread things four, five, six, ten, or twenty times before you see the \nwisdom in it, but it hit me as I stood there, a drop of blood drawn \nwith the lash shall be paid by a drop of blood drawn by the sword; how \nmany Americans died in the Civil War? 600,000. Lincoln could not have \nknown that.\n  I thought I knew how many Black Africans had been brought to what is \nnow the United States to be slaves and to be enslaved here; I thought I \nknew that number. I looked it up. It is without much contention, there \nis a consensus number out there, Madam Speaker--600,000. 600,000 \nAmericans died to put an end to slavery, and 600,000 Africans were \nbrought to what is now America to be slaves.\n  Lincoln could not have known either number. He could not have known \nthose killed in action and those who died in the Civil War. He could \nnot have known that 600,000. He could not have known how many were \nbrought to what is now America to be slaves. A drop of blood drawn with \nthe lash shall be paid by another drawn with the sword, so it is \nwritten, the Word of the Lord is true and right and just altogether.\n  It turns out to be 600,000 versus 600,000. Those are prophetic words \nthat came from the mouth of Abraham Lincoln in his second inaugural \naddress, Madam Speaker. It is chilling to think about how prescient \nthey were. It is impossible for Lincoln to have known, but the instinct \nthat the hand of God that guided him, the guidance of providence that \nput those words in his mouth that day, turned out to be true this day.\n  I think of all that this Nation went through to put an end to slavery \nand all that we are going through to put an end to abortion. I look at \nthe cases of Roe v. Wade, Doe v. Bolton, and a Supreme Court that one \nmight say was leaning very strongly to it as an activist court and the \nstring of decisions that brought them to Roe v. Wade and Doe v. Bolton.\n  I would take us back through that, Madam Speaker. In about--I have \ngot to guess at the years here again--about 1964 or 1965, there was a \ncase that came before the Supreme Court called Griswold v. Connecticut. \nThere, the State of Connecticut, being a strong Catholic State, had \noutlawed contraceptives in Connecticut because that was also the \nposition of the Catholic Church. There was a couple that decided to sue \nto be able to purchase contraceptives. So it made its way all the way \nto the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court looked into it and decided, \nwell, there is a right to privacy, and the State of Connecticut has no \nbusiness interfering with the constitutional right to privacy that a \nmarried couple has in Connecticut to purchase contraceptives.\n\n  So they created this new right--this right to privacy--that didn't \nexist in the Constitution. It still doesn't exist in the Constitution. \nNow there are those who will argue that it exists in precedent and \nexists in case law, and, according to stare decisis--respect for \nprevious decisions--it cannot be changed. We are stuck with this idea \nthat the Constitution includes a right to privacy, a right to privacy \nthat is applied to married couples who wanted to buy contraceptives in \nthe State of Connecticut.\n  That was when the Supreme Court reached well beyond their bounds, and \nthey needed to stay within the guidelines of the Constitution itself, \nhence this right to privacy.\n  Then there was the Eisenstadt case where the decision was that \nunmarried people had the same right to privacy as married people. So \nthey extended that right to privacy to unmarried people as well, and \nnow everybody could buy contraceptives everywhere at any time, and many \nother things were included underneath that definition.\n  So Roe v. Wade came together, and they decided that, yes, these \nrights existed, this right to privacy could be extrapolated into a \nright to abortion because this was all written in the emanations and \nthe penumbras that are up there. To explain that, emanations and \npenumbras are like this: they are in the shadows of. So if you look up \nat the clouds during, let's say, a semi-cloudy day, then you will see \nthat little shadow along the edge of the cloud. You can't quite see the \nother side of the cloud, but you see that fringe along the edge.\n\n\n  Someplace in there, those black-robed jurists could see \nconstitutional rights that they couldn't actually find in the text of \nthe Constitution, that they couldn't quite find in Griswold,\n\n\nthat they couldn't quite find in Eisenstadt, but they wrote it into Roe \nv. Wade and Doe v. Bolton and decided: Okay, we are going to guarantee \nthis constitutional right to have an abortion as long as the baby is \nnot viable.\n  The viability, of course, is a pretty mushy definition. The Court has \nthrown some of our pro-life legislation back at us because they thought \nour definitions were a little too mushy, but they write some mushy ones \nthemselves.\n  Then you have the Doe v. Bolton case settled at the same time, \nsimultaneous with Roe v. Wade. There they write in the exceptions, \nwhich would be anything that might affect the life or health of the \nmother. The health of the mother can be determined to be the physical \nhealth, the mental health, or even the familial health of the mother. \nSo what it means is any reason whatsoever.\n  When you couple those two cases together--and if you respect the \nSupreme Court decisions, which America did--it said abortion on demand \nfor any reason whatsoever, whether it is a physical reason, whether it \nis a mental health reason, or whether it is a family issue, anything \nthat is an inconvenience. We ended up with abortion as birth control \nand abortion on demand for everyone.\n  At that time, the Court could not have seen that we would be having \npartial-birth abortions conducted across this country in significant \nnumbers to the 24th week and beyond.\n  That is such a ghastly process. This Congress did deal with that \nthrough legislation and wrote legislation to ban partial-birth \nabortion. It was defined. It was outlawed by this Congress. It was \nlitigated all the way to the Supreme Court, as we would know.\n  When I arrived here, the Supreme Court had found that it was \nunconstitutional for Congress to ban this ghastly process of partial-\nbirth abortion, of bringing a baby to birth through breach, feet first, \nand one inch before that baby could fill its lungs full of American air \nand scream for its own mercy. They would kill the baby while it \nstruggled and squirmed, and they would collapse the skull by \nwithdrawing from it the contents. That is the ghastly process. It went \non over and over again.\n  The Court found it to be unconstitutional for Congress to ban--or any \nState, for that matter--that ghastly process. So we went back to work \nhere in this Congress in the Judiciary Committee.\n  Under the leadership especially of Steve Chabot of Ohio, we held \nhearing after hearing after hearing, and we established and first wrote \na definition for partial-birth abortion that was precise so that the \nCourt couldn't argue that it was too mushy, too vague, not precise \nenough. We wrote a precise definition.\n  Then we held hearings that determined that a partial-birth abortion \nis never medically necessary to save the life of the mother. We \noutlawed partial-birth abortion again. Then it went through the \nlitigation process.\n  Our statute that banned partial-birth abortion, that came from we the \npeople, was shot down in three circuits around the country but appealed \nto the Supreme Court, and it finally survived on that final analysis of \nthe Supreme Court. Even they couldn't bear the thought of what was \ngoing on in this country. It was too stark. It was too ghastly. It was \ntoo gruesome.\n  So here we are today, with this House of Representatives having \npassed legislation that bans abortion if the baby can feel pain at 20 \nweeks. It was a true and right and just thing for this Congress, this \nHouse of Representatives to do altogether, Madam Speaker.\n  We have sent that bill over to the United States Senate. The bill has \na little bit of vagueness in it because we are saying 20 weeks. We \nwould like to precisely identify the exact time that the baby can feel \npain. But it screams at our conscience that a baby who is struggling \nfor its own survival can be killed in the womb. If it could fill its \nown lungs, it would scream for its own mercy. It fights to get away \nfrom the abortionist's tools.\n  That is the bill that bans that, the Pain-Capable Unborn Child \nProtection Act, which we sent to the United States Senate and now sits \non Mitch McConnell's desk and probably doesn't move unless there is a \nDemocrat who also agrees with us over in the House of Representatives.\n  It was bipartisan here in the House of Representatives, and I thank \nthe Democrats who have joined us in the pro-life movement; but it has \ndiminished significantly among Democrats in my time here, Madam \nSpeaker.\n  I won't use the name of the Member. I will just say that a Democratic \nMember who is a pro-life Member whom I have served with for roughly a \ndecade, but I went to him and said: Can you sign onto my Heartbeat \nbill, H.R. 490? Are you ready to do that?\n  He said: Not yet.\n  That left the door open for: Well, maybe.\n  I said: How many Democrats do you think we can get to sign onto the \nHeartbeat bill that bans abortion from the time a heartbeat can be \ndetected, the baby is protected?\n  He said, without hesitation: Two. We can get two--which meant, I \nthink, him and one other.\n  I said: How many pro-life votes were there in the House of \nRepresentatives among Democrats when you came here roughly 10 years \nago, how many pro-life votes among Democrats?\n  His answer, without hesitation, was 60. Sixty Democrats would put up \na pro-life vote. Ten years later, today, two, maybe three. I hope and \npray it is more than that. I will work for all the votes that we can \nget.\n  But that, I think, tells us something about how polarized the \npolitical arena here is in this House of Representatives, in the United \nStates Senate, and explains why Tom Perez, head of the DNC, can say \nthere is no room for pro-life people in the Democratic Party. If you \ncan't be a Republican, then transform the Democratic Party so we can \nsave the lives of these innocent unborn.\n\n  That is what the Heartbeat bill is, H.R. 490, the Heartbeat \nProtection Act, which we held a hearing on last Wednesday. The \ntestimony, I think, was stellar that came out of the panelists who were \nthere.\n  David Forte delivered the constitutional arguments even more so in \nthe Q&A than he did so in his presentation.\n  We heard from Dr. Kathi Aultman, who has been an abortionist and \ncommitted an uncounted number of abortions, and she has also had an \nabortion herself. She has delivered a baby girl vaginally herself. So \nshe is a mother and an abortionist.\n  She said in her testimony: I realize that when I meet the young \npeople whom I delivered--an OB/GYN who had a dual purpose of bringing \nbabies forth in the world, protecting their lives with all the medical \ntechnology and skill set that can be developed on this hand, but over \non this hand, kill them, and the dichotomy of that hit her after she \ndelivered her own daughter.\n  She went back to work and her hands were still doing what they had \nbeen doing, but her conscience screamed at her, and she had to put the \ntools down and stop this ghastly practice of abortion. Now she has \ncommitted a significant portion of her life to putting an end to this.\n  But she said she realized, when she met young people, the joy that \nshe had helped bring them into the world if she delivered them; but at \nthe same time, she understood that there were a lot of young people who \nare not here because she aborted them. So it always tore at her \nconscience that way.\n  Another thing that I had not heard from anyone in this movement in \nthe past, in all of our discussions, was this. She said: If I was going \nto abort the baby, I always referred to it, when I spoke with the \nmother, as a fetus. But if we were going to deliver the baby and give \nthis baby a chance at life, I always referred to it as a baby.\n  I think that explains to us the difference in the disagreements we \nhave here in the House of Representatives. Almost universally, over on \nthis side, people support abortion in every form they can, with those \nexceptions whom I tip my hat to and those who will be converted, \nhopefully, by their conscience over time like Cathy Aultman was.\n  They say ``fetus''; we say ``baby.'' God knows it is a baby. God \nknows that it is a unique human being from the moment of conception. \nWhat we can't yet do, medically, is precisely tell the mother the \nmoment of conception. We don't have a medical way to determine that \nmoment, or I would be focusing our legislation on that moment. But what \nwe do have now, with ultrasound,\n\n\nis the ability to identify that heartbeat in that baby.\n  The legislation in H.R. 490, the Heartbeat Protection Act, says this. \nWe require the would-be abortionist to check for a heartbeat before \nthat abortionist would continue with an abortion. They have to maintain \nrecords on this: check for a heartbeat, and then if a heartbeat can be \ndetected, the baby is protected. We know that is life. If an \nabortionist stops that beating heart, we know that has ended the life \nof that innocent baby.\n  As we brought this legislation forward, we found out that there is \nsomething about that heartbeat that speaks to the conscience and the \nhearts of America, Madam Speaker. We know that billboard after \nbillboard--there must be thousands of them around America, many of them \nput up by the Knights of Columbus--saying: Abortion stops a beating \nheart.\n  When we see that billboard, maybe it only registers a little bit, but \nmany of us have seen it hundreds and hundreds of times, and we \nassociate the heartbeat with life. If there is a beating heart, we know \nthere is life. If you stop that beating heart, you know that you ended \na human life.\n  On the argument that a baby isn't viable, in the Roe v. Wade era back \nin 1973, the Supreme Court said maybe that is at 28 weeks. But now we \nhave babies that survive at 22 weeks. That is a month and a half less \nthan before.\n  I recall a circumstance in 1992 where I had an individual who was \npart of the administrative oversight on a construction project that I \nwas on that fall. He was gone for 2 weeks, and I knew why. His wife had \ngone into labor and delivered a little baby boy prematurely.\n  This little baby boy was in the early part of 20-some weeks. And I am \nnot certain, but I am just guessing earlier than 24 weeks, but \ncertainly not 28.\n  They went to the city and stayed in that hospital with this little \nboy for 2 weeks and didn't leave. They stayed at his side and prayed \nfor him and they did all they could. He was hooked up to all kinds of \ntubes.\n  When he came back to me after 2 weeks, he was relatively assured that \nthis little boy would survive. He walked up to me and handed me a cigar \nthat said, ``It's a boy.'' He wasn't handing out those cigars the first \n2 weeks because he wasn't confident this little boy was going to live.\n  But he handed me that cigar--and I knew where he stood politically--\nand I said to him: We would do anything to save the life of any little \nbaby. Any little boy or girl, we would do anything to save their life. \nThere is no amount of expense we wouldn't go to. There is no amount of \nmedical effort we wouldn't go to to save the life of a baby, no matter \nhow small their chance was to survive. We will do everything. We will \nspend $100,000, $200,000, $500,000 to save that innocent little life. \nWe do everything we can do with all the medical technology that we \nhave. We spare no effort from doctors or nurses. We will spare no \neffort on our knees praying to God this little baby can be born and \ngrow into a full human being.\n  He agreed with me 100 percent. He said: I agree with you, and I am so \nglad that my little boy looks like he is going to be okay.\n  I said: Then are you going to go into the polls of next month--this \nis October of 1992--and vote for the man for President who will appoint \nJustices to the Supreme Court who are going to continue to enable \nabortion in America?\n\n  He looked at me and called me a name that we can refer to by the \nfirst letter of those three words, but he said it in such a way that it \nwasn't insulting to me. It said instead: You have drilled a point home.\n  After these 30-some years, I ran into him in the grocery store here \nseveral Sundays ago after mass. We are both Catholic. I hadn't talked \nto him in a long time. I asked him how that little boy was doing, and \nhe told me.\n  He said: You straightened me out back then, didn't you? Do you \nremember that?\n  He asked me if I remembered it. Of course I did. I said: Yes, I \nremembered it, but I didn't want to bring it up. I did want to know how \nhe is.\n  So that is a composite of the conscience of the Nation, Madam \nSpeaker. I think it tells us that we all haven't come to the \nrealization of the immorality of abortion yet, but America came to the \nrealization of the immorality of slavery. We will get to the \nrealization of the immorality of abortion. We are making progress.\n  Looking at this legislation, H.R. 490, we have a number of 69 percent \nof Americans supporting protecting any baby with a heartbeat.\n\n\n  That is, 55 percent of Democrats support protecting a baby with a \nheartbeat, and this legislation would save the lives of at least 90 \npercent of the babies that are otherwise being aborted.\n  So I want to thank all the people who have done so much work on this \nthat brought us to this point. We are at 170 cosponsors. We have had a \nhearing. Next step, hopefully, is to get the markup before the \nJudiciary Committee. My goal is to bring the Heartbeat bill to this \nfloor of the House of Representatives January 19 of 2018. That is the \ndate of the March for Life here in this town, and that is the date we \nneed to bring that legislation to this floor. If we can do so and send \nit over to the Senate, if the Senate can take it up and pass it, I am \nconfident our President will sign it, and we can begin to put an end to \nthis carnage.\n  To speak of the magnitude of the carnage of abortion: 60 million \nbabies aborted since 1973 in Roe v. Wade.\n  I had a lady, who is a Democrat, say to me just over here a couple of \nmonths ago: Steve, why are you so worried about this? We have abortions \ndown to where they are almost, or maybe even are below, a million a \nyear?\n  Only a million abortions a year? How can anyone quantify that and say \nthat is anything other than a bloody carnage and a loss of human \npotential and a denial of the gifts from God?\n  Sixty million babies aborted since Roe v. Wade in 1973. And how many \nbabies would be born to those who were aborted? How many of those \nlittle girls that were aborted in the 1970s, the 1980s, the 1990s, and \neven in the early part of this millennia--for a small part, the \nearliest part of this millennia--how many of those little girls would \nbe having babies today? And how many would they have?\n  Just a back-of-the-envelope calculation tells me that there are \nanother 60 million babies that are missing because of the 60 million \nthat have been aborted. And here we are, America. I am listening to \npeople argue, and they will say: Well, you know there is work that \nAmericans won't do, and we have a shortage of labor, so we have to go \nto some other culture, some other civilization and bring in hundreds of \nthousands or millions of people to do work that Americans won't do.\n  I wonder, if you would ask those innocent little voices that are in \nHeaven today, if they wouldn't mind laying a few bricks or maybe \ncutting some grass or doing a little bit of landscaping around or maybe \ncutting a little bit of meat. These are all things I do, by the way, \neven today, if I get the chance. Ask them if they wouldn't have liked \nto have had a chance at the right to life, if they wouldn't have liked \nto have an opportunity to live, to love, to breathe air, to laugh, to \nhave their own children, to enjoy the greatest country the world has \never seen, and it is all denied to them.\n  It is denied to 60 million of them, and it is denied to perhaps \nanother 60 million who didn't even have the chance to be aborted \nbecause their future parents were killed in the womb. So 60 million \nplus 60 million is 120 million missing in this country today. No wonder \nwe have a labor shortage.\n  Oh, here is another reason why we have a labor shortage, Madam \nSpeaker. If you look at the numbers of--according to the Department of \nLabor statistics in their website, there are 94\\1/2\\ million Americans \nwho are simply not in the workforce. They are old enough to work. They \nare not in the workforce, 94\\1/2\\ million.\n  If you add to that the 7-plus million who are on unemployment today, \nyou get up to right at 102 million Americans who potentially could be \nin the workforce, they are not looking for work or they are on \nunemployment, and I am listening to employers scream for more labor, \nmore labor, more labor.\n  By the way, they are screaming for more unskilled labor. I look on \nthat same website, and I see--where are the highest levels of \nunemployment?\n\n\n  In the lowest skills we have. We don't have a shortage of low-skilled \nlaborers. We have a shortage of employers who want to pay a competitive \nwage.\n  So call it 102 million Americans that could be in this workforce. \nThen we took that number and we started chopping it down.\n  How about those that are too old?\n  We can't ask them to work, so dial that down a little bit.\n  And then how about those that are physically disabled?\n  They can't work, so dial that down.\n  What would it be if we were going to mobilize our workforce on the \nlevels of, say, World War II, where at the end of World War II, we had \nthe lowest unemployment in history? And often this is misquoted and \npeople want to point to some other number. 1.2 percent was our \nunemployment rating at the end of the Second World War.\n  Women went to work. My mother did. Of course, my father was deployed. \nBut if we mobilized on that level, how many would be available to go \ninto this workforce?\n  We think about 82 million Americans are sitting there today. Some of \nthem on a couch in their front lawn, some of them are riding around in \ntheir Mercedes, but a lot of them could be going to work.\n  In fact, everybody I mentioned so far should be at work contributing \nto our GDP instead of just consuming. Eighty-two million or so out \nthere out of the 102 million that are not in the workforce, and they \nsay: Well, we have to bring in hundreds of thousands or millions or \ntens of millions of people to do this work in America.\n  Around our family, Marilyn and I raised three sons. I started a \nbusiness in 1975. I started a family in 1975. Those three sons got an \nallowance. They got paid for the work they did. In addition, the \nallowance was younger, paid for the work they did came a little later. \nBut of those three sons, they all knew what they had to do.\n  Now, if one of those three sons--by the way, I am talking about one-\nthird of our workforce is not in the workforce. They are simply not in \nthe workforce. But one-third of the people who could be are sitting \nback on the sidelines.\n  So let's just say, around our operation, there is work that has to be \ndone. You got to scoop the tracks out of the dozer. Somebody has got to \nchange their oil. Somebody has got to mow the lawn. Somebody has got to \ntake care of the other chores. Somebody has got to trim the trees, all \nthose things that need to be done. They all got their assignments and \nthey did them.\n  But if one of those sons said, ``Well, I am not working. I am going \nto sit on the couch and watch the ball game or sit on the porch and \nwatch the rest of you work. I want to eat with the rest of the family. \nI want to put my feet under the table. I want good food. I want my \nclothes all clean. I want them ironed. I want them ready to go. \nSomebody else can clean my room, too, but I still want my allowance,'' \nyou all know, if you grew up in the family, how long that would last.\n  If one of the siblings, a brother or a sister, said, ``I am not doing \nmy work, but give me my allowance, and I still want the keys to the \ncar,'' it wouldn't last one day.\n  In our house, it goes completely the other way. It is: ``Oh, you \nthink that? Now you get all the work, and they get your allowance until \nyou change your mind.''\n  We fixed that really quick in my household, and I think it would be \nfixed a number of different ways, but really quickly in every household \nin America. We don't tolerate a slacker sitting there taking up a room \nin the house that is demanding all the benefits of the work of the rest \nof the family.\n  But we have got 102 million Americans sitting there. Many of them are \nbeing bribed not to work by welfare checks. We have over 70 different \nmeans-tested Federal welfare programs in the United States. Over 70. \nSome say 87 of them. No one has even memorized the list. So that should \ntell you that no one understands how they interrelate with each other. \nNo one understands whether there are disincentives or incentives for \npeople to do the right thing and step forward and carry their share of \nthe load.\n  So why wouldn't we dial the welfare down in America until the labor \nforce magically shows up in the workplace?\n  That is what happened with John Smith. His experiment early on in \nAmerica worked exactly like that. He said that there were--of all the \nroyalty that was there, they thought, because they had blue blood--and \nthat is, of course, the expression of royalty--that they didn't have to \nwork and those commoners needed to work for the rest of time.\n  He said: I am not going to burn up the labor of these common people \nhere so that a bunch of royalty can sit around with their feet up.\n  That is a summarization of the statement.\n  Everybody had to work, and they had the ``no work, no eat'' policy. \nWell, when you get to that policy, a lot of people decide that working \nis better than going hungry, but it doesn't mean we don't take care of \nthe people who are needy. It doesn't mean we eliminate these programs. \nIt just means, as I said, maybe we need 10 million more American \nworkers. We can dial this welfare system down, ratchet it down.\n  It is now a hammock. It used to be a safety net, and this Congress \nwith special interests has cranked up the level of the safety net to \nthe level of the hammock, and now 102 million Americans, a good share \nof them, are in that hammock.\n  We just crank it back down. We could dial it down in proportion to \nthe amount of labor that we need. Everybody that gets off the hammock \nand goes to work becomes a contributor. They grow our GDP--our gross \ndomestic product--and they pay taxes and they take themselves off the \nwelfare rolls.\n  So why wouldn't you do the twofer, instead of go to some other \ncountry and bring people here to do the work who don't speak our \nlanguage, who don't understand our culture, and who don't embrace the \nAmerican civilization in many cases, and who run down people in bike \npaths in New York, and who attack us at Fort Hood--the list goes on and \non--Orlando, Florida; San Bernardino, on and on, the people who hate \nus?\n  As Louie Gohmert often says, ``We don't have to pay people to hate \nus. They will hate us for free.'' He was talking about foreign policy. \nWe have got people on welfare who hate us. We don't have to pay them \neither. We need more people working. We need more people back in the \nrolls.\n  So I want to applaud Kevin Brady, the chairman of the Ways and Means \nCommittee, and I thank him for the very diligent work that he has done \nin order to bring this tax policy as far as it is today, and to roll it \nout with the coordination that they have, with the support from the \nleadership within the House, the Senate, and the White House, and that \nmessage has been clear.\n  Also, Kevin McCarthy, our majority leader, stood here today and \ndefended it and explained it, I think, very well. He is an articulate \nvoice for our entire conference and he does an excellent job, along \nwith our Speaker and our whip.\n  By the way, our whip, Steve Scalise, maybe he doesn't have all of his \nmoves back yet, but his heart and his head are back as strong as ever. \nHis voice is as strong as ever. Steve Scalise has his mojo back, Madam \nSpeaker, and I am awfully glad to see that. We need that. It is a gift \nto us to have him.\n  So what do we do with this need for labor?\n  I asked the question a little earlier in a tax conference downstairs: \nOf this tax policy, the bill now that was dropped yesterday, does it \nallow an employer to deduct as a business expense the wages and \nbenefits that are paid to illegals who are in his employment?\n  The answer that I got was: We didn't address that in the bill, so \nwhatever it is today is what it is.\n  What it is today, Madam Speaker, is every employer--let me put it \nthis way: I will say virtually every employer who deducts the wages \nthat are paid of them is often--if they have illegals working for them, \nthey go on the schedule C, like any other employer.\n  So let's just say, if there is an employer there who pays $1 million \nout to illegals, that shows up in his schedule C as a business expense, \nwages. And those wages then are deducted as a business expense. Of \ncourse, you don't pay taxes on business expenses.\n\n\n  I don't pay taxes on fuel. I don't pay taxes on parts. I don't pay \ntaxes on the wages our company pays in 42 years in the construction \nbusiness or on the benefit packages that we have there. And--but--so \nemployers are deducting wages and benefits paid to illegals, and that \nis supposed to be against the law.\n  But they don't address that in this tax bill. And the way the IRS has \naddressed it is that--it says this--according to section 162(e) of the \nInternal Revenue Code, it denies a deduction for ``illegal payments.''\n  But even though it denies a deduction, under the statute for illegal \npayments, the IRS has interpreted this a little bit differently. So it \nsays here in this document: even though it is illegal to employ \nunauthorized alien workers, the IRS has ruled that section 162(e) does \nnot apply to the wages paid to those aliens--and I would call them \naliens--even if the employer knowingly broke the law.\n  Well, there is a problem with IRS interpretation, but I also know \nthey are not very likely to change that interpretation, unless Congress \nshould crack them over the knuckles with some legislation.\n  I have, for a number of Congresses, introduced legislation known as \nthe New IDEA Act. Today, the New IDEA Act is H.R. 176. It does this: it \nclarifies. It amends 162(e) of the Code, and it clarifies that wages \nand benefits paid to illegals are not tax deductible for Federal income \ntax purposes. It gives the employer safe harbor if he uses E-Verify to \nverify his employees.\n  In other words, if you hire people, you have got people on your \npayroll, you run them through E-Verify. We know all about this program. \nThe Judiciary Committee passed a mandatory E-Verify bill out of the \ncommittee here a couple of weeks ago. But you run them through E-\nVerify. If you are the employer and they have qualified to be legal to \nwork in the United States through the E-Verify program, then the IRS \ncannot touch you with regard to hiring illegals. So it is a safe harbor \nthat we build into the bill.\n  So tax, wages, and benefits paid to employers are not tax deductible. \nThe employer gets safe harbor if he uses E-Verify.\n  We also require the IRS to exchange information and build a working \ncommittee with the Social Security Administration and the Department of \nHomeland Security so that the right hand, the left hand, and the middle \nhand know what each other is doing.\n\n\n  This is the Federal Government, after all. And how can we have \ndepartments within this government working at cross purposes with each \nother?\n  So the IRS' job should be to collect taxes. They should not be \nallowing the deductions of wages and benefits paid to illegals. They \nare not legal to work in America.\n  If you are buying illegal drugs, do you get to deduct your illegal \ndrugs?\n  If you pay off somebody to commit an illegal activity, do you get to \ndeduct that?\n  No. In none of those cases, we don't allow deductions for illegal \nactivity. That is partly what the legislation said. But the IRS has \ntheir practice.\n  By the way, before I wrote this bill, I was looking around for what \ndepartment within any branch of government do the people respect fear \nthe most. As one who has been audited thoroughly a number of times, I \nnotice that the IRS is the one that we respect the most--probably fear \nthe most--and the last organization that we want to show up at our door \nthat is going to check to see if we are hiring illegals.\n  So what would happen under this bill is the IRS would show up--we \ndon't accelerate any audits. The IRS would show up to do a normal audit \nunder normal terms of identifying businesses that they would normally \naudit, and, in the course of that audit, they would run the Social \nSecurity numbers and the identifying information of the employees off \nof the I-9 forms that have been required since 1986 and punch them into \nE-Verify.\n  If they could verify that all of the employees could work legally in \nAmerica, then, fine, no problem, and that employer only has his other \ntax issues to worry about. But if E-Verify kicks any of those employees \nout--one or more--then the employer has 72 hours' notice to cure, like \nthey would under any other circumstance, to correct any records that \nmight need to be corrected. Otherwise, the IRS could look at that and \nsay: Okay, this million dollars that you wrote off as a business \nexpense is not a business expense. That goes back into the gross \nreceipts and shows up at the bottom as net taxable income.\n  If we do the math on this and break it down, what is the impact? \nWell, the impact works out to be this:\n  If you have a $10-an-hour illegal and the audit comes in and says you \ncan't deduct that $10 an hour, then the impact of it is that the \nemployer then would be billed for interest and penalty and the tax \nliability that we calculated, I think, at around 35\\1/2\\ or 36 percent. \nThat turns your $10-an-hour illegal into about a $16-an-hour illegal.\n  Now, if you are going to have to pay $16 an hour, maybe you could \nactually hire an American to do that work. You wouldn't have to hire \nsomebody that is sneaking around and that snuck into America. That is \none way to look at this is it raises the cost.\n  There is also a 6-year statute of limitations. Nothing goes \nbackwards. There is no ex post facto in this. It would only be from the \nday of enactment. From that point forward, there could be a 6-year \ncumulative liability.\n  So the first year that the bill would pass--hopefully, in this tax \npackage that we have in front of us that is coming to us next week--\nfrom the first year the bill would pass, you have 1 year of liability.\n  And say the IRS doesn't audit you the first year. The second year, \nnow you have 2 years of liability. That risk accumulates then for the \nperiod of 6 years, that statute of limitations. So, each year, the \nemployer would see that they had a contingent liability: the IRS. If \nthe IRS shows up and audits, they are going to go back at least 4 \nyears, I am going to guess, maybe longer.\n  That means that they are going to work to clean up their workforce. \nThey can do it incrementally or they can do it all at once. But nobody \nis going to want to sit there with a 6-year statute of limitations \nhanging over their head.\n  Madam Speaker, I include in the Record an article that is written by \nthe Center for Immigration Studies, dated August 31, 2017, titled: \n``Raise More than a Quarter Trillion Dollars of Tax Revenue by Ending \nTax Subsidies for Unauthorized Employment of Illegal Aliens.''\n\n       [From the Center for Immigration Studies, August 31, 2017]\n\nRaise More than a Quarter Trillion Dollars of Tax Revenue by Ending Tax \n        Subsidies for Unauthorized Employment of Illegal Aliens\n\n                                (By CIS)\n\n       Aliens enter the United States without authorization for \n     many reasons, but for most of them the goal is to secure \n     employment at much higher wages than are available in their \n     native countries. While breaking the law provides very \n     significant economic benefits to these illegal workers and to \n     the businesses that hire them, it comes at a cost to American \n     workers. According to Harvard economist George Borjas, recent \n     empirical research indicates that American workers suffer a \n     reduction of $99 billion to $118 billion in annual wages \n     because of illegal immigration.\n       The economic rewards of unauthorized employment of aliens \n     are not limited to the higher wages of the illegal workers \n     and the lower labor costs of their employers. Unauthorized \n     alien workers and their employers also enjoy multi-billion \n     dollar tax deductions and tax credits that were enacted into \n     law for the benefit of law-abiding workers and businesses.\n       When Congress returns from summer recess on September 5, it \n     is expected to focus attention on a major reform of the \n     federal income tax system, including a combination of lower \n     rates and other tax incentives to families and to businesses. \n     The largest challenge facing tax reformers is finding \n     sufficient additional revenue to pay for the tax cuts and tax \n     incentives they promised to the people who elected them. In \n     fairness to the American families and businesses to whom \n     these tax cuts have been promised, and in particular to the \n     American families whose household incomes have been \n     diminished by illegal immigration, Congress should consider \n     eliminating unwarranted tax breaks to unauthorized alien \n     workers and their employers.\n       Each of the following reforms--one that eliminates a tax \n     subsidy for employers of unauthorized aliens and the other \n     that eliminates a tax subsidy for the unauthorized workers--\n     comes with an estimate of the additional revenues that would \n     be raised by the reform Together they could raise $296 \n     billion over 10 years--more than a quarter-trillion dollars.\n       1. No Deduction for Wages Paid to Illegal Aliens. Section \n     162(e) of the Internal Revenue Code denies a deduction for \n     ``illegal\n\n\n     payments''. Even though it is illegal to employ unauthorized \n     alien workers, the IRS has ruled that section 162(e) does not \n     apply to the wages paid to those aliens, even if the employer \n     knowingly broke the law. On January 3, 2017, Rep. Steve King \n     and eight other members of Congress introduced H.R. 176, the \n     New Illegal Deduction Elimination Act, Section 2 of which \n     would amend section 162(e) to clarify that no deduction is \n     allowed for wages paid to unauthorized alien workers. H.R. \n     176 provides employers a ``safe harbor'', allowing a \n     deduction to employers that used the Department of Homeland \n     Security's free, online E-Verify system to confirm the \n     employee's eligibility to work.\n       The amount of wages paid to unauthorized alien workers \n     cannot be known with certainty. One of the most extensive \n     studies of unauthorized immigrants in the United States was \n     conducted by the Pew Hispanic Center in 2009. According to \n     that study, there were approximately 8.3 million undocumented \n     immigrants in the U.S. labor force, a figure that Pew more \n     recently estimated had fallen to 8.0 million. Pew estimated \n     the median household income of unauthorized worker families \n     to be approximately $36,000 and that there were approximately \n     1.75 workers per household, implying median per-worker \n     earnings of $20,571. Multiplying Pew's estimated number of \n     unauthorized alien workers by the earnings-per-worker \n     estimate yields an estimated total of wages paid to \n     unauthorized alien workers of approximately $165 billion.\n       Many unauthorized workers are employed in the ``underground \n     economy'', i.e., by households and other employers that are \n     not reporting or paying payroll taxes and presumably are not \n     deducting the wages. A 2013 report by the Social Security \n     Administration estimated that, of approximately seven million \n     alien workers in various irregular work statuses in 2010, \n     approximately 3.1 million (44 percent) had Social Security \n     numbers (mostly false or fraudulently secured), while \n     approximately 3.9 million (56 percent) were working in the \n     ``underground economy.'' On the assumption that employers \n     reported payroll taxes and claimed wage expense deductions \n     only for the 44 percent of unauthorized workers who could \n     produce an SSN, and that most employers deducted wages at or \n     near the corporate tax rate of 35 percent, we estimate that \n     disallowing a deduction for wages paid to unauthorized alien \n     workers would increase federal tax revenues by approximately \n     $25.4 billion per year (35 percent x 44 percent x $165 \n     billion), or $254 billion over 10 years.\n       2. Deny Refundable Tax Credits to Illegal Aliens. Section \n     24(a) of the Internal Revenue Code allows a $1,000 per-child \n     tax credit for taxpayer's whose earnings fall below a \n     specified threshold. The Child Tax Credit is refundable to \n     the extent it exceeds the taxpayer's tax liability, in which \n     case it is referred to as the Additional Chad Tax Credit or \n     ACTC. A 2011 report by the U S. Treasury Inspector General \n     for Tax Administration explained that aliens authorized to \n     work in the United States are required to obtain a Social \n     Security number (SSN). For aliens who need to file U.S. \n     federal tax returns for other reasons, such as to claim \n     refunds of withholding tax on dividends, the IRS issues \n     Individual Tax Identification Numbers (ITINs). Unfortunately, \n     according to the inspector general, the IRS had been \n     permitting aliens to claim ACTCs on returns that reported an \n     ITIN rather than a Social Security number.\n       The payment of ACTCs to illegal aliens is arguably a direct \n     violation of the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity \n     Act of 1996 (``PRWOA''), which expressly provides that an \n     illegal alien ``is not eligible for any Federal public \n     benefit.'' The IRS has applied the PRWOA rule to prohibit \n     payments of Earned Income Tax Credits to ITIN filers, but \n     based on a questionable interpretation of the law has allowed \n     ITIN filers refunds of ACTCs.\n       According to the Inspector General, ``[b]ased on claims \n     made in Processing Year 2010, disallowance of the ACTC to \n     filers without a valid SSN would reduce Federal outlays by \n     approximately $8.4 billion over 2 years,'' i.e., $4.2 billion \n     per year. Although the inspector general's figures are based \n     on 2010 fiscal data, Treasury Department tax expenditure \n     estimates indicate that the total child tax credit \n     expenditure was virtually unchanged between 2010 and 2017. \n     Accordingly, based on the inspector general's report, we \n     estimate that limiting the Child Tax Credit to taxpayers with \n     Social Security numbers would increase federal tax revenues \n     by approximately $4.2 billion per year, or $42 billion over \n     10 years.\n", "turn": 3, "speaker": "Mr. KING of Iowa", "itemno": 3}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "K000362", "text": "  Mr. KING of Iowa. The bulk of this article addresses my bill, H.R. \n176, the New IDEA Act, the New Illegal Deduction Elimination Act. They \ngo through the calculations here, and I will just touch on some of \nthem.\n  This is data from a Harvard economist, George Borjas. It is his \nempirical research. He shows that the workers in America, because wages \nhave been suppressed by an oversupply of unskilled and illegal \nlaborers, that American workers are suffering somewhere between a $99 \nbillion and $118 billion loss in annual wages because they haven't \ngotten a raise in a long time. Nobody gets a raise as long as there is \ncheaper labor there that keeps that down--no effective raise. So \nbetween $99 billion and $118 billion. That is the Harvard economist, \nGeorge Borjas. That is the annual wages loss because of illegal \nimmigration.\n  If we go to the next page on this, it lays out the conditions, and we \nare seeing this. This is a number from the Pew Hispanic Center in 2009. \nIt says that there are 8.3 million undocumented immigrants in the U.S. \nlabor force. They recently estimated that number is actually ratcheted \ndown to about 8 million. It doesn't say why. But if they estimated the \nmedian household income of unauthorized worker families to be \napproximately $36,000 at 1-\\3/4\\ average workers per household, that is \nroughly--let's see. It says, ``implying median per-worker earnings of \n$20,571,'' they estimated that the earnings-per-worker estimate yields \n$165 billion a year. This is some of the magnitude of the money that is \ngoing out of our economy. Also, added to that, roughly $60 billion is \nbeing wired out of America.\n  So those who say, ``Well, we really need these illegal workers \nbecause they stimulate our economy, they grow our economy,'' they are \nsiphoning this off. They are holding down the wages for the working \npeople in America to the tune of $100 billion or more a year. They are \nearning something like $165 billion a year, and they are sending at \nleast $60 billion of that south of the border, about half to Mexico and \nthe other half to Central America, South America, and the Caribbean.\n  So all of these are economic impacts.\n  But the CIS, the Center for Immigration Studies, drew this estimate \nthat, should my bill, the New IDEA Act, H.R. 176, become law--and the \nperfect place for it is in this tax policy--they estimate that it would \nscore at, the number would be, $25.4 billion a year. If we do a 10-year \nestimate, that means a $254 billion score, a quarter of $1 trillion \npoured into our budget at a time that we are cutting taxes and we have \na red ink tax policy--which I want to see passed, by the way. We have \ngot some solutions here, and I want to see those solutions become law.\n  H.R. 176 is one of the unique tools that has been here for some time. \nIt is thoroughly vetted. It has had a good number of cosponsors on it \nover the past years. I knew Barack Obama would never sign it, but \nDonald Trump will. It was on his website.\n  Early on, when he first launched his Presidency, the support for the \nNew IDEA Act was on his immigration policy that was posted then. I \nhaven't checked it now in quite some time, but I don't have any doubt \nthat, if we send a tax bill to Donald Trump's desk with H.R. 176 in it, \nit will score better, to the tune of probably a quarter of $1 trillion.\n  It will put an end to the illegal workforce in America, or at least \nan end to the deductibility of wages and benefits paid to illegals, and \nit brings together the Social Security Administration, Department of \nHomeland Security, and the IRS to exchange information so that, if \nthere is a Social Security number that is overused, they need to tell \nthe DHS and they need to tell the IRS. If the IRS comes up with \nemployers that are hiring illegals--and they will--they need to tell \nthe Department of Homeland Security so ICE can come in and enforce the \nlaw.\n  So each one of these agencies needs to cooperate with each other. \nThis way, we open up jobs for American workers, and we give the \nAmerican workers a raise.\n  Now, what could be better than giving the American workers a raise \nand giving the American workers a tax cut all at the same time, while \nwe nearly guarantee an economic growth cycle for the next decade of an \naverage of over 3 percent per quarter? We can do that. It is all \nsitting here in front of us. And my hope, my prayer, and my effort is \nthat we can all work together to reach all of those goals.\n  Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n", "turn": 4, "speaker": "Mr. KING of Iowa", "itemno": 4}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 5}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "179", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H8481-H8487", "wkday": "Friday", "day": "3", "month": "November"}, "related_bills": [{"type": "HR", "context": "OTHER", "congress": "115", "number": "176"}, {"type": "HR", "context": "OTHER", "congress": "115", "number": "490"}], "doc_title": "TOPICS OF THE WEEK", "id": "CREC-2017-11-03-pt1-PgH8481"}
