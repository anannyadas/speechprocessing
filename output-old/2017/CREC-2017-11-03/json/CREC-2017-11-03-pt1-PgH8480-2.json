Madam Speaker, I am proud to recognize and \ncongratulate an immigrant advocate, and now MacArthur genius, Cristina \nJimenez Moreta. Like me, she is a CUNY alumni and she grew up \nundocumented.\n  Since founding United We Dream in 2008, Cristina Jimenez Moreta has \nbecome a powerhouse champion for immigrant groups across the country. \nBy elevating the stories of DREAMers and putting faces and names to a \ndiscussion that was, at times, dismissive and dehumanizing, she changed \nthe dialogue surrounding undocumented young people.\n  Her work has impacted the lives of young immigrants nationwide, and \nin honor of her significant contributions, she was recently selected as \none of 24 MacArthur Fellow winners worldwide in 2017.\n  I congratulate Ms. Jimenez on her MacArthur Fellowship, and I applaud \nher decision to use the grant money to further the development of other \nundocumented young people.\n  Cristina, your work is paramount now more than ever now that we brace \nas a nation to give rich people a big tax write-off that will put our \ncountry in jeopardy, a big gambling casino effort that has seen a \nfailed attempt in the past with trickle-down economy.\n  ``Because we are not one. We are not 100. We are millions. Count us \nwell.'' ``Porque no somos uno. No somos cien. Somos millones. Cuentanos \nbien.''\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. ESPAILLAT", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "179", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H8480", "wkday": "Friday", "day": "3", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "CONGRATULATING CRISTINA JIMENEZ MORETA", "id": "CREC-2017-11-03-pt1-PgH8480-2", "title": "CONGRATULATING CRISTINA JIMENEZ MORETA"}
