JOSEPH CROWLEY\n\n                              of new york\n\n                    in the house of representatives\n\n                        Friday, November 3, 2017\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "C001038", "text": "  Mr. CROWLEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge Congress to delay the \ncuts to Medicaid Disproportionate Share Hospital (DSH) payments that \nwent into effect on October 1, and to protect our nation's safety net \nhospitals from financial ruin.\n  Medicaid DSH hospitals serve a high proportion of Medicaid recipients \nas well as underinsured or completely uninsured Americans. These \nhospitals bear the risk of caring for the most vulnerable members of \nour districts because they recognize the inextricable value of healthy \ncommunities: when we are healthy together, we thrive together. It is \nour duty to return the favor to the hospitals that ensure our \ncommunities have a secure health care safety net.\n  If Congress does not act soon to delay Medicaid DSH cuts, safety net \nhospitals across the country will face a twenty percent cut in federal \nfunding. In my home district in Queens and the Bronx, Medicaid DSH \nhospitals stand to lose over $409 million over the next ten years. I \ncannot stand by as Congress throws our safety net hospitals into an \neconomic upheaval.\n  However, I also cannot stand by as Congress brings forth a proposal--\nthe CHAMPIONING HEALTHY KIDS Act (H.R. 3922)--to pay for a delay of \nMedicaid DSH cuts for two years by imposing steeper cuts on those same \nhospitals in future years, among other flaws.\n  This legislation is an example of how this Republican-led Congress \nhas championed partisan gridlock that threatens the vitality of our \nsafety net hospitals. Within a package to delay Medicaid DSH cuts and \nextend federal funding for the Children's Health Insurance Program \n(CHIP) and community health centers, Republicans proposed several \nproblematic offsets that would ultimately set our health care system \nback. For example, certain changes to Medicaid would inhibit access to \npediatric providers, and cuts to the ACA's Prevention and Public Health \nFund would undermine the value of preventive services delivered at \ncommunity health centers. Furthermore, the package would lead to higher \npremiums for certain seniors receiving Medicare benefits and shorter \ngrace periods for individuals who receive their health coverage through \nthe individual market. In other words, this package would slash \nbenefits and protections for one group of beneficiaries to extend \nservices for another. Democrats will not stand for any packages that \nwould rob Peter to pay Paul.\n  I cannot in good conscience vote for a package that starts a food \nfight amongst different groups of beneficiaries. And I cannot in good \nconscience vote for a bill that would be so irresponsible to the long-\nterm financial viability of the hospitals that are a flagship for the \nmost vulnerable constituents in my district.\n  I urge my Republican colleagues to drop this partisan exercise and \nwork with us on a compromise to extend these long-standing, successful, \nbipartisan federal health programs. The job of our nation's safety net \nhospitals is much too important to bear the brunt of needless political \ngames.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. CROWLEY", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 3}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "179", "extension": true, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "E1503", "wkday": "Friday", "day": "3", "month": "November"}, "related_bills": [{"type": "HR", "context": "OTHER", "congress": "115", "number": "3922"}], "doc_title": "DELAY MEDICAID DSH CUTS", "id": "CREC-2017-11-03-pt1-PgE1503-2"}
