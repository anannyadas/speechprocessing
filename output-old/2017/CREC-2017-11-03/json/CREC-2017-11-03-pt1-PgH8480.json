Madam Speaker, Hoosier families deserve a pay raise, and \nthat is what President Trump's tax plan is going to give them: more \njobs, fairer taxes, and bigger paychecks for working Hoosiers.\n  Importantly, the plan includes a provision that I have been working \non that would stop $4 billion to $7 billion in refundable tax credits \npaid out each year to illegal immigrants. This is a giant step in the \nright direction to protect American taxpayers and American families. In \nthe Trump tax plan these savings will help increase child tax credits \nfor American citizens by $600 each child.\n  Hoosiers get it. It is past time to address an immigration system \nthat rewards people who come here illegally. No one should get a tax \nincentive to violate the law.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. MESSER", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "179", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H8480", "wkday": "Friday", "day": "3", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "TAX PLAN GIANT STEP IN RIGHT DIRECTION", "id": "CREC-2017-11-03-pt1-PgH8480", "title": "TAX PLAN GIANT STEP IN RIGHT DIRECTION"}
