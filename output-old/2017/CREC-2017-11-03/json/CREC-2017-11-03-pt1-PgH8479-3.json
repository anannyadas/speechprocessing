Madam Speaker, there is no question we need to reform \nour outdated, overly complex Tax\n\n\nCode. That is something we all agree on. We need to encourage growth \nand support our middle class. But the Republican decision to approach \ntaxes in an exclusively partisan and fiscally irresponsible way is not \nthe way to go.\n  I am deeply concerned about the partisan plan rolled out by the \nRepublican leadership, in no small part because it saddles future \ngenerations with trillions more in debt just to pay for tax cuts for \nthe most fortunate Americans.\n  Furthermore, restricting provisions relied upon by countless middle \nclass families, including the State and local tax--SALT--deductions and \nproperty tax deductions hurts working families. This is particularly \ntrue in States like Illinois, where one in every three filers depends \non the SALT deduction.\n  In the days ahead, I hope my Republican colleagues will open the tax \nreform discussion to bipartisan engagement. I remain ready and willing \nto sit down and work across the aisle to achieve responsible tax reform \nthat will grow our economy, protect our seniors, truly help middle \nclass families, and secure our future.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. SCHNEIDER", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "179", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H8479-H8480", "wkday": "Friday", "day": "3", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "OPEN TAX REFORM DISCUSSIONS", "id": "CREC-2017-11-03-pt1-PgH8479-3", "title": "OPEN TAX REFORM DISCUSSIONS"}
