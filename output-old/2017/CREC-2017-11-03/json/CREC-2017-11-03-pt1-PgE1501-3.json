Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the legislation I \nintroduced today that would require President Trump to immediately meet \nhis obligation to release all documents that can and should be released \npertaining to the assassination of President John F. Kennedy.\n  Despite the 1992 passage of a Congressionally-mandated October 26, \n2017 deadline requiring the President of the United States make a \ndetermination about what documents can and should be released to the \npublic regarding President John F. Kennedy's assassination, the current \nPresident failed to comply.\n  The President's failure to execute this requirement before the \nestablished deadline raises long-held concerns that the U.S. government \ncontinues to withhold critical information about the former President's \nassassination.\n  As a result, it is now up to Congress to enforce this deadline and \ndeliver to the American public the certainty it deserves.\n  I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to exert the \nauthority of this body's intent when it passed the 1992 President John \nF. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act and enact this \nimportant measure to enforce the required release of all appropriate \ndocuments concerning the assassination of the late, and Honorable, \nPresident John F. Kennedy.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. COHEN", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 3}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "179", "extension": true, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "E1501", "wkday": "Friday", "day": "3", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "LEGISLATION TO COMPEL THE RELEASE OF ALL JFK ASSASSINATION DOCUMENTS", "id": "CREC-2017-11-03-pt1-PgE1501-3", "title": "LEGISLATION TO COMPEL THE RELEASE OF ALL JFK ASSASSINATION DOCUMENTS"}
