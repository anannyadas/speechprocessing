Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize my \nnortheast Georgia neighbors for their efforts in raising awareness \nsurrounding domestic violence.\n  Nearly 25 million Americans have been victims of domestic violence at \nsome point in their lives, and more than 65,000 Georgians have reported \nexperiencing domestic violence.\n  Recently, the community of Clarkesville held a vigil to remember \nlocal victims of domestic abuse. By rallying around each other, they \ndemonstrated their commitment to helping neighbors who may be suffering \nin silence.\n  Tricia Hise is one Clarkesville neighbor whose dedication to \naddressing this scourge head-on stands out. Hise, a local attorney, has \ninvested countless hours in pro-bono litigation to amplify the voices \nof domestic abuse victims. Through her work, Hise has inspired victims \nto take a stand on behalf of themselves and their loved ones.\n  My neighbors in Clarkesville serve as an encouragement to us all. As \nwe continue to oppose and address domestic abuse, I encourage everyone \nhere today to find opportunities to work for the well-being of \nAmericans who are impacted by domestic abuse.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. COLLINS of Georgia", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 3}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "179", "extension": true, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "E1503", "wkday": "Friday", "day": "3", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "HONORING NORTHEAST GEORGIA EFFORTS TO END DOMESTIC VIOLENCE", "id": "CREC-2017-11-03-pt1-PgE1503-3", "title": "HONORING NORTHEAST GEORGIA EFFORTS TO END DOMESTIC VIOLENCE"}
