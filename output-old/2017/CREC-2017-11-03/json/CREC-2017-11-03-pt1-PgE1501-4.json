Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of Carol \nJackman, who turns 80 years young on December 4th.\n  Carol's dedication to our veterans stretches back to her childhood. \nGrowing up on army bases, she developed a keen awareness of the \nimportant work our servicemembers do every single day. Not only is she \nthe daughter of a U.S. veteran, but she is the sister, wife, mother, \ngrandmother, sister-in-law, and aunt of U.S. veterans.\n  Volunteerism has been an important theme in Carol's life. For over 50 \nyears, Carol has been a proud member of the American Legion Auxiliary. \nShe has served as unit president, district director, state president, \nand the chair of many different programs. During the 1970s Carol worked \nto ensure no veteran was forgotten. She created and delivered homemade \nEaster baskets for sick and homebound veterans. Carol has also spent \ndecades volunteering at the West Roxbury and Brockton VA hospitals.\n  Honoring veterans is her passion. To this day she plants flowers in \nthe Highland Cemetery, a tradition she has kept up longer than she can \nremember. She also serves on the Memorial Day committee in Dover, \nworking to ensure each year's celebration properly honors our \nservicemembers.\n  Mr. Speaker, I am proud to honor Carol Jackman on this joyous \noccasion of her 80th birthday. I ask that my colleagues join me in \nwishing her many more years of health and happiness.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. KEATING", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 3}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "179", "extension": true, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "E1501", "wkday": "Friday", "day": "3", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "IN RECOGNITION OF THE 80TH BIRTHDAY OF CAROL JACKMAN", "id": "CREC-2017-11-03-pt1-PgE1501-4", "title": "IN RECOGNITION OF THE 80TH BIRTHDAY OF CAROL JACKMAN"}
