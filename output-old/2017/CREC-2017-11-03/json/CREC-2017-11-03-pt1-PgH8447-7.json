Mr. Speaker, well, yesterday, the Republicans unveiled \ntheir tax cuts that they purport to benefit the middle class. Nothing \ncould be further from the truth. Then again, I\n\n\nguess it depends upon your definition of middle class.\n  Eighty percent of the benefits flow to those who earn over $400,000 a \nyear. Perhaps that is middle class to that side of the aisle.\n  They repealed the alternative minimum tax. We have only seen one \nTrump tax return: $31 million. Eighty percent of his taxes were a \nresult of the alternative minimum tax. That is a middle class tax cut?\n  Oh, then slashing permanently the corporate rate to 43 percent, that \nis going to really benefit the middle class. They pretend somehow that \nis going to raise salaries. Give me a break.\n  Then, under the guise of family farms and small businesses, small \nbusinesses and family farms, between $11 million and $22 million will \nno longer pay an inheritance tax. That is middle class?\n  All of these things are going to drive up the debt by $2 trillion, \nwhich raises interest rates for everybody who has to borrow money to go \nto college, buy a car, or buy a house.\n  Oh, and if you want to go to college, you can't deduct your student \nloan interest anymore.\n  Adopt a kid? No, we did away with that deduction, too.\n  This is a ruse by the public. We have to kill this turkey before \nThanksgiving.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. DeFAZIO", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "179", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H8447-H8448", "wkday": "Friday", "day": "3", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "TAX PLAN", "id": "CREC-2017-11-03-pt1-PgH8447-7", "title": "TAX PLAN"}
