Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, we are here today to consider a very, very important \npublic health bill, H.R. 3922, the CHAMPIONING HEALTHY KIDS Act. This \nlegislation funds a 5-year extension of the Children's Health Insurance \nProgram, known as CHIP, along with a 2-year extension of community \nhealth centers and numerous other critically important public health \nprograms.\n  This bill will deliver quality healthcare and peace of mind to \nmillions of Americans. The patients and families helped by this \nlegislation are our neighbors and our friends. More than 8 million \nchildren receive CHIP-funded coverage, and more than 25 million \npatients are served by our community health centers and other important \nprograms.\n  This 5-year funding of CHIP marks one of the longest extensions of \nthe program since it was created 20 years ago. The policy we are \nconsidering mirrors the bipartisan policy that has been introduced and \nvoted out of our sister\n\n\ncommittee in the United States Senate.\n  Funding for these important programs expired September 30. The \ncommittee worked on a bipartisan basis well before this deadline to try \nand reach a bipartisan agreement on a range of policies to offset the \ncosts of this very critically important funding extension.\n  Three times, at the request of the Democrats, we delayed committee \naction--three times. We tried to find offsets that were agreeable as we \nhave always been able to do before. Unfortunately, that was not the \ncase this time. These delays meant Congress went past the deadline of \nSeptember 30.\n  While States still have rollover CHIP funds available and the next \nwave of community health center funds won't go out until next year, we \ncannot wait any longer. Patients cannot wait any longer. Patients need \ncare, these critical programs need funding, and we must move forward.\n  In my district alone, there are 12 federally qualified health center \norganizations, with 63 delivery sites. They leverage $41 million in \nFederal money in order to serve more than 240,000 patients in Oregon's \nSecond District. These health centers--and I have visited many of \nthem--are prevention and public health in action, often serving as the \nmain provider of care for people for hundreds of miles around.\n  We are also extending the National Health Service Corps and the \nTeaching Health Center Graduate Medical Education program. Now, Mr. \nSpeaker, these are really important workforce programs that place \nqualified providers into some of the most underserved areas of our \ncountry.\n  In addition to community health centers and the workforce programs, \nthis bill extends the funding for the Special Diabetes Program and the \nFamily-to-Family Health Information centers, the Personal \nResponsibility Program, and the Youth Empowerment Program. These \nlocally based, patient-centered organizations provide comprehensive \nservices to those most in need.\n  Moreover, this legislation eliminates 2 years of the across-the-board \ncuts to Medicaid allotments called for under the Affordable Care Act, \nObamaCare. We delay those cuts for disproportionate share hospitals for \n2 years. Medicaid DSH funding represents an important component of many \nState Medicaid programs and is particularly relied upon by many States \nto help provide additional resources to key safety net providers.\n  Now, while this relief is only temporary and does not address the \nlarger structural challenges under ObamaCare, it would give Congress \ntime to explore what budget-neutral approaches there might be to \nallocate existing DSH dollars on a more equitable and fair basis. In my \nState alone of Oregon, hospitals have told me this relief in this bill, \njust for them, represents $6.8 million over the next 2 years that they \ncan use to help low-income people get access to hospital care.\n  Now, in paying for this package--and this is the area where we have \nthe most disagreement with the Democrats--we have taken a fiscally \nresponsible approach, like using existing funding streams for \nprevention and public health efforts, ensuring high-dollar lottery \nwinners are removed from the Medicaid program so its limited resources \ncan be prioritized for the most vulnerable, and stopping individuals on \nthe Affordable Care Act's exchanges from gaming the system.\n  The bill also asks Medicare's wealthiest 1 percent, people who are \nretired and making $40,000 a month--not a year, a month--to pay about \n$135 more for their Medicare just on parts B and D that is already \nsubsidized by 75 percent, just a little more so we can fund children's \nhealth insurance for 5 years.\n  While it was not ultimately possible, unfortunately, to reach \nconsensus on some of the policies to offset the new funding in this \nbill, there is broad bipartisan agreement on the core policies \ncontained in this legislation, and I believe there is bipartisan \nsupport for many of the reasonable and fiscally responsible offsets \ncontained in H.R. 3922.\n  Mr. Speaker, this is good legislation. This is long-overdue \nlegislation. It reflects the good work done by your House Energy and \nCommerce Committee, and I urge my colleagues to put politics aside \ntoday and ensure these vital programs get the funding extensions they \nneed. We are over the deadline.

Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak in opposition to H.R. 3922, a \npartisan bill to reauthorize the Children's Health Insurance Program, \nor CHIP, as well as community health centers and other public health \nprograms.\n  It pains me to be here today, because this should not be a partisan \nbill. I have tried for months to negotiate with Republicans to develop \na bipartisan compromise, but House Republicans chose to spend the first \n9 months of this year trying to repeal the Affordable Care Act. They \nfailed, but now House Republicans are using the reauthorization of CHIP \nand community health centers as a way to once again sabotage the ACA.\n\n  Make no mistake, Mr. Speaker: if Republicans can't repeal the ACA \noutright, they will cripple it any time they can.\n  This time, Republicans are risking the healthcare of nearly 9 million \nchildren and the care of families all around the country that use \ncommunity health centers. They are risking that care because this \npartisan bill has no chance of ever becoming law.\n  By taking this route, Republicans are guaranteeing that CHIP and \ncommunity health centers will not be reauthorized until the end of the \nyear, and that is extremely unfortunate.\n  Mr. Speaker, I strongly support CHIP, our community health centers, \nand all of our public health programs that are extended in this bill. \nThese programs have traditionally been bipartisan, but the bill before \nus extends these programs by taking billions of dollars away from the \nAffordable Care Act and undermining Medicare.\n  In short, this Republican bill offers a false choice. On one hand, it \nstrips healthcare away from upwards of 680,000 Americans and guts the \nPrevention Fund, which pays for immunization and vaccines, lead \npoisoning prevention, opioid treatment, and many other important \nprograms; on other hand, it reauthorizes these important programs. \nDemocrats strongly support reauthorization of these programs, but we \nreject the way Republicans are paying for them.\n  Mr. Speaker, there are so many other policies that save money, \ncountless alternatives that Democrats have offered to Republicans for \nmonths. Yesterday I offered an alternative that would have provided a \nrobust reauthorization and extension of these important programs, and \nit was paid for in a commonsense way.\n  My alternative would have changed the timing of payments to Medicare \nAdvantage Plans. This approach was recommended by both the GAO and the \nOffice of the Inspector General, but Republicans rejected it in the \nRules Committee. They wouldn't even allow it to come before the full \nHouse for a vote. And why is because they would rather use \nreauthorization of CHIP and community health centers as another way to \nsabotage the Affordable Care Act.\n  I simply reject that approach and strongly urge a ``no'' vote.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.", "turn": 4, "speaker": "Mr. PALLONE", "itemno": 55}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "W000791", "text": "  Mr. WALDEN.

Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding the \ntime, for the recognition.\n  Let me just say, I want to thank members of the Health Subcommittee, \nboth sides of the dais, who have worked hard on this legislation, and \nit is unfortunate that it was not brought to the floor of the House in \nthe month of September.\n\n\n  From a subcommittee perspective, we were ready. We had our \nlegislative hearings in June. We were delayed one time when the whole \nHouse recessed after the shooting of the Members at the baseball \npractice, but we rescheduled for 2 weeks later, and we had a successful \nhearing. We had a good hearing; a lot of facts were laid out. We came \nup with commonsense legislation that was offset in a responsible way. \nThe offsets are not draconian.\n  We have before us a bill today that will, in fact, fund some of the \nNation's most important public health programs. It does fund the State \nChildren's Health Insurance for 5 years, one of the longest extensions \nfor this program since its inception in 1996. It will ensure that \nchildren and families who rely on this program will continue to receive \nthe access they need. It also includes, in a fiscally responsible way, \nto delay the harmful ObamaCare-mandated cuts to safety net hospitals, \nwho also provide care to underserved patients.\n  Now, think about that for a minute. We are accused of undermining \nObamaCare, but here is a cut that ObamaCare mandates to your safety net \nhospitals across the country--not just in Texas, but across the \ncountry--and we are replacing that today in a fiscally responsible way.\n  It provides funding for community health centers, an important key \npart of healthcare in communities across the country. It will help the \nAmericans who rely on these vital health services.\n  Not only does the bill provide assistance for underserved \npopulations, but it does so without adding to the national debt. The \nCommittee for a Responsible Federal Budget called this a responsible \nhealth package, noting that the $18 billion cost is fully offset, with \nsavings beyond the 10-year budget window.\n  Other groups have also been supportive: Texas Hospital Association, \nTexas Health Resources--for me back home--Children's Hospital, and a \nnumber of healthcare organizations.\n  We have data from MACPAC, whose job it is to advise Congress on \nMedicaid and CHIP policy; and MACPAC has advised us that, under current \nlaw, there are no new Federal funds for State Children's Health \nInsurance for fiscal year 2018 and beyond. Unless Congress acts to \nrenew funding, all States will experience a shortfall in CHIP funds for \n2018, which means, if someone is contemplating a ``no'' vote on this \nbill, if you are contemplating a ``no'' vote, you do need to be aware \nthat if you live in the States of Arizona and Minnesota, you ran out of \nmoney in October of 2017; North Carolina, same situation. Oregon runs \nout next month. Vermont runs out next month. You need to think about \nyour ``no'' vote before you apply it.\n\n  Every single U.S. territory, with the exception of Puerto Rico, ran \nout of money in the month of October.\n  So those are a few facts that people do need to bear in mind, if they \nvote ``no'' on this bill, what the actual implications of that are.\n  Yesterday, during debate on the rule, I heard a lot of discussion \nabout taking money out of the Prevention Fund. It doesn't take money \nout of the Prevention Fund, but it does provide discretion for some \nprevention and public health dollars. It takes it away from the \nexecutive branch and redirects these dollars to proven public health \nprograms that enjoy broad bipartisan support in Congress, like \ncommunity health centers.\n  So we are fulfilling our Article I responsibility. We shouldn't just \nbe giving everything to the administration to decide how to spend \nmoney, whether it be a Democratic or Republican administration. This is \nthe right thing to do.\n  I am proud of the work done by our subcommittee.

The only sabotage of the \nAffordable Care Act going on here today is stopping cuts for hospitals \nin our districts that serve low-income people that would otherwise \noccur under the Affordable Care Act. We do that for 2 years.\n  The Democrats don't think seniors making $40,000 a month--$40,000 a \nmonth--should pay an extra $135 for their part B and part D Medicare so \nwe can take care of our community health centers and children who need \nhealth insurance.\n  We delayed this bill coming to the floor at a bipartisan request to \nfind a bipartisan solution that was elusive, sadly. We have never had \nthis problem before, but we have it today. We must act.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote on this legislation, and I yield \nback the balance of my time.", "turn": 75, "speaker": "Mr. WALDEN", "itemno": 126}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "M001143", "text": "  Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the Community \nHealth and Medical Professionals Improve Our Nation (CHAMPION) Act of \n2017 (H.R. 3922).\n  While I support reauthorizing funding for the Children's Health \nInsurance Program (CHIP), the Federally Qualified Health Centers \n(FQHCs), and various other important public health programs, I oppose \nthis bill because it cuts funding for public health, puts families at \nrisk of losing their health insurance, and weakens Medicare.\n  The health of children and expecting and new mothers is something \nthat we can all agree on. In my home state of Minnesota, CHIP funding \nis essential for providing healthcare to 125,000 low income children \nand 1,700 expecting and new mothers. Minnesota also depends on FQHC \nfunding with over 190,000 people receiving care from one of the more \nthan 70 community health centers in my state last year.\n  Unfortunately, House Republicans have turned these bipartisan issues \ninto an opportunity to divide us. The offsets included in this \nlegislation are unacceptable to me and to Minnesota families.\n  Once again, Republicans are using this legislation as yet another \nopportunity to weaken the Affordable Care Act (ACA) by cutting $6.35 \nbillion from the Prevention and Public Health Fund over the next ten \nyears. This fund, created by the ACA, directly funds our nation's \nprevention, preparedness, and response capabilities.\n  If these Republican cuts become law, the Centers for Disease Control \nand Prevention would be forced to provide less funding to cities, \nstates, and tribes to rapidly address public health crises. This money \nincludes funding for vaccines, flu prevention, and addressing the \nopioid epidemic. When my home state of Minnesota had to recently deal \nwith a serious outbreak of measles, our community health officials \nutilized these federal resources to rapidly contain the spread of \ndisease. Simply put, this irresponsible offset leaves American \ncommunities more vulnerable to, and unprepared for, outbreaks of \ndisease.\n  In addition, this bill takes aim at yet another ACA provision by \nshortening the 90-day grace period for individuals to pay premiums \nbefore their insurer can terminate their coverage. The current grace \nperiod allows low and moderate income families experiencing temporary \nfinancial difficulties to remain covered by their health insurance. \nShortening this grace period from 90 days to 30 days would cause nearly \n700,000 Americans to lose their health care and bars them from \npurchasing health insurance until the next season.\n  I am also concerned by the provision that introduces means testing to \nMedicare. A key strength of Medicare is its universal nature. All \nAmericans pay into Medicare and all Americans should receive at least \nsome benefit from it. This provision breaks that guarantee and sets a \ndangerous precedent for the future. I am also concerned that it could \nweaken the Medicare risk pool and increase costs for the taxpayer.\n  Mr. Speaker, even the Majority concedes that this bill is unlikely to \npass the Senate due to the partisan nature of its provisions. \nRepublicans need to stop playing games and reauthorize these programs \nbefore Minnesota faces a critical December 1 deadline to continue \ncoverage for children and expecting mothers.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote against this measure and instead to work \ntogether to fund CHIP and community health centers.", "turn": 76, "speaker": "Ms. McCOLLUM", "itemno": 127}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "J000126", "text": "  Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in \nstrong opposition to the bill being considered on the floor today, H.R. \n3922, the CHAMPIONING HEALTHY KIDS Act. Unfortunately, this deceitfully \nnamed measure to reauthorize the Children's Health\n\n\nInsurance Program (CHIP) and Community Health Centers (CHCs) will \nreauthorize these programs through FY19--but does so by kicking \nthousands of Americans off private insurance.\n  Like many of my colleagues, I strongly support CHIP, CHCs, and other \ncritical public health initiatives. However, the bill in its current \nform was drafted as yet another attempt by Republicans to undermine the \nAffordable Care Act in order to justify its repeal. The bill is \nmisguided in its attempt to cut $6.35 billion over ten years from the \nPrevention and Public Health Fund in order to fund the extension.\n  H.R. 3922 also reduces grace periods from 90 to 30 days, putting more \nthan 688,000 low- and moderate-income individuals at risk of losing \ntheir state Marketplace coverage for simply paying their premiums in \nthe second of third month of the existing grace period. This grace \nperiod is essential to low-income households that are barely making \nends meet. By reducing the current grace period, Republicans are \nexposing thousands of families to risk due to a lack of health \ncoverage. It is frankly disgraceful that we would even consider \nundermining these important public health programs in such a manner.\n  Mr. Speaker, CHIP, CHCs, the National Health Service Corps, and other \nprograms funded under this measure are vitally important to our nation \nand the public health of our citizens. As the first registered nurse \nelected to Congress, I understand the critical need for proper long-\nterm funding of our public health centers and programs. However, these \ncuts to the Prevention and Public Health Fund represent a purely \npolitical move by the GOP to undermine the ACA. I oppose this \ncontroversial offset, not my support for health centers across America. \nI urge my colleagues to oppose this measure so that we can find offsets \ndriven by policy, not politics, in order to sufficiently fund our \nhealth centers and promote public health for all.", "turn": 77, "speaker": "Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas", "itemno": 128}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "J000032", "text": "  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak on House consideration \nof H.R. 3922, Championing Healthy Kids Act, which would reauthorize the \nState Children Health Insurance Program (S-CHIP).\n  As the founder and chair of the Congressional Children's Caucus, I am \nwell aware of the work that went into creating this important program.\n  I joined with members of the bipartisan Children's Caucus to champion \nthe worthy goals of S-CHIP.\n  Congress and President Clinton responded to the needs of 10 million \nchildren in the United States who lacked health insurance, S-CHIP was \ncreated in 1997 to insure children in families with too much income to \nqualify for Medicaid and too little to afford private insurance.\n  I voted for the S-CHIP program when it came to the floor for a vote \nas part of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997.\n  I worked tirelessly along with other members of the House to make \nsure the S-CHIP program was created.\n  I voted to extend the life of the program when Congress reauthorized \nS-CHIP in 2009 under the Children's Health Insurance Program \nReauthorization Act and again when it became part of the Patient \nProtection and Affordable Care Act of 2010.\n  The program represented a grand bargain that allowed Democrats and \nRepublicans to agree that healthcare for the nation's children was a \nlaudable and achievable goal.\n  H.R. 3922, Championing Healthy Kids Act, is not a reauthorization of \nthe S-CHIP program it is political theater at its worse.\n  The leadership of the House is betraying all that this body has done \nfor 20 years to sustain and improve S-CHIP.\n  The bill before the House is political theater and not real \nlegislating--a partisan attack against Medicare that has no place in a \nreal bill about healthcare for children.\n  I am a strong supporter of S-CHIP and would vote for that program any \nday it is brought to the House Floor.\n  This imposter S-CHIP bill is not worthy to be considered by this \nbody.\n  The motion to recommit this bill should be supported so that the \noffensive offsets could be removed so that the bill can be brought back \nto the full House for consideration.\n  After weeks of negotiations to reauthorize the Children's Health \nInsurance Program (CHIP), Community Health Centers (CHCs) and other \nimportant public health programs, which have always been bipartisan \npriorities, House Republicans have decided to bring a partisan bill to \nthe Floor.\n  This bill will only further delay the reauthorization of these \nprograms, many of which expired on September 30th.\n  The bill passed out of the Energy and Commerce Committee at the \nbeginning of October with no Democratic support.\n  Democrats in Committee instead offered a package that invests in our \nchildren and safety net providers, and does not sacrifice the nation's \nhealth.\n  Democrats have made it clear for weeks that the pay-fors in this bill \nare problematic.\n  Rather than working toward a bipartisan agreement, Republicans \nrevised their bill to include even steeper cuts to public health \nprograms, in addition to undermining the Affordable Care Act (ACA).\n  The bill includes woefully inadequate funding for Medicaid programs \nin Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, which are facing \nunprecedented demands on their health care systems following the \ndevastation caused by Hurricane Maria.\n  Puerto Rico Governor Ricardo Rossello last week requested $1.6 \nbillion annually to deal with the state's underfunded Medicaid program \nthat is expected to be further strained by the short- and long-term \nhealth implications of the natural disaster.\n  The approximately $1 billion over two years in Puerto Rico Medicaid \nfunding included in the Republican bill is not only insufficient, but \nit would also require Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands to match \nthose dollars at a time of increased demand and revenue collapse in \nboth territories, exacerbating delays in recovery.\n  This bill also seeks to cut $6.35 billion to the Prevention and \nPublic Health Fund (PPHF).\n  The Prevention Fund was created by the ACA to make national \ninvestments in prevention and public health, to improve health \noutcomes, to enhance health care quality, and reduce health care costs.\n  It has been used to increase awareness of and access to preventive \nhealth services, such as cancer screenings, tobacco cessation and \nchildhood vaccines--as well as concentrating on preventing chronic \ndisease to help more Americans stay healthy.\n  Cutting these funds will have a devastating impact on public health \ninitiatives at the federal, state and local levels.\n  Republicans are also shortening the grace period for missed premium \npayments from ninety days to thirty, which would result in up to \n688,000 people losing health coverage.\n  House Republicans are insisting that in order to provide some of our \nmost vulnerable Americans with coverage, it must be paid for by \ncancelling the health insurance of other Americans after a single \npayment is missed.\n  While Republicans are pushing for tax cuts for the wealthy that \nexplode the deficit, when it comes to health coverage for children and \nlow-income Americans, Republicans are insisting that it be paid for at \nthe cost of weakening our health care system and pushing other \nAmericans off health insurance.\n  States have begun to use emergency funding, cut benefits, and will \nsoon begin sending disenrollment notices to thousands of families if \nCHIP is not reauthorized.\n  Republicans' decision to advance a partisan bill rather than a \ncompromise has very real consequences for families across the country.\n  In 2016, 35,626,329 children in the United States had healthcare \ncoverage under S-CHIP or the Medicaid Child Program.\n  In 2016, although the state of Texas had 38 percent of our children \ncovered under the S-CHIP program, there were still 9.2 percent children \nwithout health insurance coverage.\n  Paying for this package by weakening health care in America:\n  Shortening the grace period for missed premium payments will cause up \nto 688,000 Americans to lose their health coverage.\n  Cutting $6.35 billion from the Prevention Fund will have a \ndevastating impact on public health initiatives at the federal, state \nand local levels.\n  Requiring Medicare means testing of 100 percent for beneficiaries \nmaking over $500,000. This provision will take away a benefit American \nseniors have paid into their entire lives.\n  These offsets are even more egregious since they are being considered \njust one week after House Republicans began the process of passing tax \ncuts for the wealthy that is not offset and will add $1.5 trillion to \nthe deficit.\n  Instead of reauthorizing these programs, House Republicans wasted \ntime attempting to repeal the ACA.\n  There are better ways to pay for S-CHIP that do not put the guarantee \nof Medicare at risk our nation's seniors.\n  1. Reduce tax expenditures for the top 1 percent of income-earners--\nOur current tax code imposes higher tax rates on income earned through \nhard work while providing preferential treatment to unearned financial \ngains and allowing billions of dollars of stock profits and other \ncapital gains to pass tax-free to heirs of multi-million-dollar \nfortunes. Reducing the benefit of these tax expenditures would help \nrebalance the tax code so that it stops favoring wealth over work. CBO \nhas determined that 17 percent of the benefits of major ``tax \nexpenditures'' go to households in the top one percent of income \nearners at a cost of more than $1.5 trillion over ten years. We could \nreduce this benefit to pay for needed national priorities.\n  2. Cancel the tax break for corporate jets--Repeal tax breaks such as \nthose for corporate jets, which are allowed a faster depreciation\n\n\nschedule than passenger and freight aircraft. Based on past Joint \nCommittee on Taxation estimates, repealing the tax break on corporate \njets alone would raise $3 billion over ten years.\n  3. Restrict deductions for egregious CEO bonuses when employees don't \nget a raise--Repeal the exemption to the $1 million limit on \ncompensation for CEOs and other specified corporate employees that a \npublicly traded corporation can deduct as a business expense, unless \ntheir workers are getting paycheck increases that reflect increases in \nworker productivity and the cost of living. Based on Joint Committee on \nTaxation estimates, just limiting the deductibility of excessive CEO \ncompensation would raise $12 billion over ten years.\n  4. Close loopholes in the U.S. international corporate tax system \nthat encourage companies to invert, and ship jobs and profits \noverseas--Prevent U.S. companies from ``inverting'' and pretending that \nthey are based in other countries purely to reduce their taxes. Enact \nproposals that would limit the ability of corporations to reap \nsubstantial tax benefits by shifting operations, capital, intellectual \nproperty, and jobs overseas for tax purposes or to shelter their \nprofits from U.S. taxation in foreign tax havens. Based on estimates of \npast proposals, over $500 billion over ten years could be raised under \nsuch proposals.\n  5. Close the ``carried interest'' loophole taxing hedge fund \nmanagers' compensation at lower capital gains rates--End the loophole \nwhich allows certain investment managers at hedge funds and private \nequity firms to pay capital gains tax rates (up to a maximum of just 20 \npercent) on income received as compensation for services they provided, \nrather than ordinary income tax rates up to 39.6 percent that all other \nworking Americans pay on the compensation they receive for their labor. \nPast estimates show closing this loophole would raise over $19 billion \nover ten years.\n  States have begun to use emergency funding, cut benefits, and will \nsoon begin sending disenrollment notices to thousands of families if \nCHIP is not reauthorized.\n  It is time for the House Leadership to stop playing politics with \nhealth insurance coverage for our nation's most vulnerable children and \npass a clean S-CHIP bill.", "turn": 78, "speaker": "Ms. JACKSON LEE", "itemno": 129}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Mr. Speaker, today, Members of this House can deliver \npeace of mind to parents of over 8 million low-income children who \ndepend on the Children's Health Insurance Program. The House can extend \nfunding for important public health programs, including resources for \nthe critical work community health centers do in our communities and in \nmy district and yours. This bill will help deliver much-needed \nhealthcare resources to our friends and fellow citizens in the Virgin \nIslands and in Puerto Rico.\n  Yet we have heard complaints about how this package is paid for. \nWell, let us be clear how this bill funds healthcare for kids and \nimportant public health priorities like community health centers.\n  In paying for this package, we have taken a fiscally responsible and \nreasonable approach. Our bill funds kids' healthcare by allowing States \nto dis-enroll lottery winners--these are winners making $80,000 or \nabove--from the low-income Medicaid program. We ensure high-dollar \nlottery winners are removed from the Medicaid program so that those \nresources can go to Medicaid-eligible, low-income people in our \ndistricts.\n  Our bill directs funding from the Prevention and Public Health Fund \nto finance important prevention and public\n\n\nhealth needs, like funding the National Health Service Corps, Teaching \nHealth Center Graduate Medical Education, Family-to-Family Health \nInformation Centers, and community health centers. If these are not \nimportant programs for prevention, wellness, and public health, I don't \nknow what are.\n  Our bill before us today, which I predict will have bipartisan \nsupport, directs funds from the Prevention Fund for important public \nhealth priorities that have long had bipartisan support. We are using a \nbipartisan fund to pay for bipartisan healthcare support for health and \nwellness, which was its intent from the beginning.\n  Most recently, nearly every House Republican and Democrat supported \nthis idea just a year ago. Just a year ago, when we passed the 21st \nCentury Cures Act, we said: Here is a health and wellness fund and a \nPrevention Fund that makes sense for cures, make sense for, we believe \ntoday, our community health centers, and for Children's Health \nInsurance.\n  Our bill also asks the wealthiest among us, the 1 percent of \nbeneficiaries, those making $40,000 a month, over half-a-million \ndollars a year--that is an individual--to pay a little more to help \nfund health insurance for low-income children. I think they are willing \nto do that, and I think we should be as well.\n  On multiple budgets, President Obama said this is a reasonable way to \npay for other priorities. That was bipartisan. It is bipartisan today.\n  These reasonable pay-fors have been opposed by some in the Democratic \nleadership. Some House Democrats want to use children's healthcare and \nfunding for community health centers as a bargaining chip for a bigger \nend-of-the-year goulash, yet kids and our frontline providers can't \nwait any longer.\n  In just a few weeks, States like Minnesota run out of funding for the \nChildren's Health Insurance Program. At the request of my colleagues on \nthe other side of the aisle, we have agreed to postpone it time and \nagain, but time has run out. The negotiations did not end as we all \nhoped they would.\n  But we can't wait any longer. It is time for this House to deliver \npeace of mind to the families that rely on these critical programs. It \nis time to vote ``yes.''\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the motion to \nrecommit and to approve the underlying bill, and I yield back the \nbalance of my time.", "turn": 92, "speaker": "Mr. WALDEN", "itemno": 180}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "  Ms. BLUNT ROCHESTER. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend and mentor, the \ngentleman from South Carolina, for his kind words and for yielding.\n  Mr. Speaker, we deal with important issues every day in this House, \nbut there are few issues as meaningful to so many lives as the \nChildren's Health Insurance Program.\n  At this time the divisions in this House mimic those in our nation.\n  And on many issues, those divisions can be challenging to bridge.\n  One of my top priorities as a new Member of this body is to help \nbridge those divides, instead of widening them.\n  I hope that my colleagues--both Democrats and Republicans--will tell \nme if I fall short on that commitment.\n  One of the few things that does not divide us is the importance of \nchildren's healthcare and the CHIP program.\n  When it was signed into law 20 years ago, this landmark legislation \nmeant so much to me.\n  First, as a mother of then 9-year-old, Alyssa, and 11-year-old, Alex \nI deeply understood the fear a parent could feel with a sick child and \nno insurance.\n  But also because at that time, I was the Deputy Secretary of Health & \nSocial Services for Delaware.\n  And I had the honor of helping implement the law and seeing thousands \nof children who had never had healthcare get the coverage they \ndeserved.\n  From the 600,000 children across the nation who were the program's \nfirst enrollees in 1998 to the nearly 9,000,000 children in 2016.\n  Kids across this country owe their yearly check-ups, their \nimmunizations, and their doctor's office lollipops to this program.\n  And in Delaware we owe a big debt to the CHIP program, Medicaid, and \nthe Affordable Care Act.\n  Today, 97 percent of Delaware's children obtain medical coverage \nbecause of these programs.\n  In 1997, the legislation passed in a Republican Congress with a \nDemocratic President, highlighting how this truly was not a partisan \nissue.\n  That's why it's disappointing to me that we aren't moving forward on \nrenewing the Children's Health Insurance Program with that same \nreasonable, bipartisan approach.\n  The bill before us today forces us to choose between healthcare for \nchildren and healthcare for other vulnerable populations.\n  Choosing between prevention and healthcare for kids is unacceptable--\nparticularly in a nation as great as ours.\n  I have spoken to many of you over the past 10 months.\n  I know that the people I have met in both political parties know--in \ntheir hearts--that we should not play games with the healthcare of our \nchildren.\n  I know that it may seem hard to oppose one's party leadership.
