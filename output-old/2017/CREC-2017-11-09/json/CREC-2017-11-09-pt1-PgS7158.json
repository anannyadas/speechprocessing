Mr. President, as Republicans consider tax proposals to \ndisproportionately benefit corporations and the wealthy, they \nsimultaneously fail to address revenue-draining loopholes that compel \nhardworking taxpayers to subsidize corporate misconduct. Today, I am \nintroducing commonsense legislation--the ``No Tax Write-Offs for \nCorporate Wrongdoers Act''--to prevent the worst corporate actors from \nwriting off their wrongdoing as simply the cost of doing business. This \nidea is commonsense. This idea is straightforward. This idea should be \nbipartisan.\n  Today's tax code allows corporations to deduct the cost of court-\nordered punitive damages as an ``ordinary'' business expense. Courts \nreserve punitive damages for only the most egregious and reckless \nmisconduct--misconduct that usually causes great harm to peoples' \nlives. For victims who have suffered at the hands of the worst \ncorporate bad actors, there is nothing ``ordinary'' about this \nloophole. Punitive damage awards are designed to punish wrongdoers for \nthe reprehensible harm they cause--to provide a deterrence to \nmisconduct. By giving corporations a deduction specifically for their \nwrongdoing, our tax code winks and nods at future wrongdoers who know \nthat they can simply write off the damages they owe for the damage they \ncause.\n  This is not a theoretical problem. In 1994, when the Exxon Valdez \nspilled 11 million gallons of oil in the Prince William Sound, \ndevastating Alaska's southern coast, it was eventually slapped with \npunitive damages of $500 million. Exxon turned around and exploited \nthis tax loophole to write off those punitive damages as an \n``ordinary'' business expense--saving the company millions of dollars \nthat could have--and should have--added to government revenues. In \n2011, two Montana teenagers died in a car crash caused by a steering \nwheel defect in the Hyundai model they were driving--a defect that \nHyundai knew about and recklessly ignored for over a decade. Although a \njudge eventually ordered Hyundai to pay $73 million in punitive \ndamages, Hyundai can lawfully write those damages off as a business \nexpense. This is just wrong.\n  The No Tax Write-Offs for Corporate Wrongdoing Act is simple and \nstraightforward, and would end this offensive loophole once and for \nall. My bill would amend the tax code to prevent the deduction of any \namount ``paid or incurred for punitive damages in connection with any \njudgment in, or settlement, any action between private parties.'' Aside \nfrom bringing our tax code in line with our most basic notions of \njustice and fair play, my bill would save American taxpayers a \nsignificant amount of money. In 2016, the Joint Committee on Taxation \nestimated that ending this punitive damages loophole would increase our \ngovernment revenues by nearly $415 million over 10 years.\n  The Senate will be talking a lot about tax reform in the coming \nweeks. The Senate majority will bend over backwards--they already are--\nto argue how important it is that we dramatically lower tax rates to \nmake our tax system more favorable to large corporations. Should we not \nalso hold these same corporations accountable when they poison our \nenvironment and harm Americans? Legislation that leaves such an \negregious loophole in place while giving companies massive tax cuts is \nnot tax reform. It is a corporate tax giveaway.\n  It should shock the conscience to know that our law effectively \ncompels hardworking taxpayers to subsidize the recklessness and bad \nbehavior of the worst corporate actors. This bill would change this \nunacceptable status-quo. I thank Senators Blumenthal, Reed, Gillibrand, \nand Hassan for cosponsoring this legislation. I urge all Senators--of \nall political ideologies--to support the No Tax Write-Offs for \nCorporate Wrongdoing Act. Protecting our constituents from corporate \nmisconduct is not a political or partisan issue. It is our job.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. LEAHY", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "Senate", "num": "183", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "S7158", "wkday": "Thursday", "day": "9", "month": "November"}, "related_bills": [{"type": "S", "context": "FIRSTPARAGRAPH", "congress": "115", "number": "2115"}, {"type": "S", "context": "OTHER", "congress": "115", "number": "2115"}], "doc_title": "STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS", "id": "CREC-2017-11-09-pt1-PgS7158"}
