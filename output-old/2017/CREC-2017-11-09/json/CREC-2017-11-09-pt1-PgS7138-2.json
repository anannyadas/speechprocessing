Madam President, only 4 days have passed since the \nterrible tragedy in Sutherland Springs occurred, and, of course, the \ngrieving and pain of the families who have lost loved ones and who had \nloved ones injured during the course of that terrible shooting \nincident--our thoughts and prayers are still with them. I am going to \nbe traveling to Sutherland Springs this weekend to offer my condolences \nand ongoing support in person. It is important that we give the \ncommunity the time and space they need to grieve.\n  By now, we all know that 26 people lost their lives during a church \nservice at the First Baptist Church. This included an unborn child. \nTwenty more were injured, and some of them still remain in critical \ncondition. What is amazing to me is that First Baptist will hold a \nchurch service this Sunday, just 7 days after a gunman stormed the \nbuilding and committed the deadliest mass shooting in Texas's history. \nWhat resilience, what incredible resolve to come together 7 days after \nthis terrible shooting and have the congregation that lost 26 of its \nmembers come together for a church service.\n  One little guy many of us will be praying for is 5-year-old Ryland \nWard. Ryland was shot four times and was partially shielded by his \nmother, Joann, who, tragically, did not survive. Ryland is fighting for \nhis life at University Hospital in San Antonio, and he remains in \ncritical condition. I know we will all continue to think of him and \npray for his recovery.\n  We continue to hear more about what led to this atrocity--a gunman \nwith a history of domestic violence, animal cruelty, and mental \nillness. Because of his troubled history, which included convictions \nfor domestic abuse in the military, he was legally prohibited from \npurchasing a firearm, but he lied about it. Unfortunately, the \nbackground check system, which is supposed to alert the dealer not to \nsell a firearm to a person with disqualifiers such as his, simply did \nnot come back at all to demonstrate that he was, in fact, disqualified \nfrom purchasing a firearm. He was legally disqualified because he had \nbeaten up his wife, had fractured the skull of his stepson, and he was \nlegally disqualified because a military court in New Mexico had handed \ndown a felony sentence for his attacking his own family. But as we know \nnow, and as I have said, that information was not uploaded by the U.S. \nAir Force or the Department of Defense in the Federal background check \ndatabase. Under the law it was supposed to be uploaded, but it wasn't. \nSo he got away with lying about his record.\n\n  That is what we have to fix. After terrible incidents like this, the \nmost common question I hear people ask or the most common statement I \nhear them say is this: We have to do something. But here that something \nwe have to do is crystal clear. Troubled individuals like this monster \nshould never have gained access to a gun. When he tried to purchase \nthem, the person who checked the Federal database should have seen his \nname and criminal convictions and said: No way, no how.\n  I have had conversations with many of our colleagues across the aisle \nand in the Chamber about this problem and what we need to do to fix it. \nNext week, I plan to introduce legislation to fix these flaws in the \nNational Instant Criminal Background Check System and to ensure that \nall Federal agencies upload required conviction records like these in \nthe NICS system as fast as possible. Clearly, that is not being done \nnow, and we must do it and do it quickly to make sure that other \npotential killers will not be sold a firearm because of the defects in \nour National Instant Criminal Background Check System. It is imperative \nthat this information be shared, that violent felons' convictions be \nuploaded, and that dangerous individuals not gain illegal access to \nfirearms. Unlike law-abiding citizens, these individuals can't be \ntrusted to do what is right because we know that in the wrong hands, \nguns can do tremendous harm.\n  I must add that in the right hands lives can be saved too. All we \nneed to do is regard the actions of Stephen Willeford. When he heard \nthe gunshots going off in the church, he grabbed his AR-15--what some \npeople call an assault rifle. It is a semiautomatic legal weapon. He is \nan NRA, or National Rifle Association, certified instructor. He took \nthat gun and shot at this killer to try to stop him from killing more \npeople, and he was successful. He wounded the killer and put himself in \nharm's way. To me, this demonstrates not only the heroism of Mr. \nWilleford, but it demonstrates another reason why law-abiding citizens \nshould be able to keep and bear arms, in the terminology of the Second \nAmendment to the U.S. Constitution. Law-abiding gun owners are not a \nthreat to the public safety. It is only so when they get in the hands \nof felons, the mentally ill, and domestic abusers, like the killer in \nSutherland Springs. So in the right hands, guns can save lives too.\n  As somebody who is a sportsman and believes in the Second Amendment \nand believes that law-abiding citizens ought to be able to keep and \nbear arms to defend their families and communities, I am proud of the \nwork that Stephen Willeford did on that terrible day. I know there are \nthose who believe that the NRA is somehow complicit in some of these \nterrible events, but I will tell you that the NRA did us all a favor by \ntraining somebody like Stephen Willeford so he was prepared on that \nhorrible day to stop the shooter before he killed more innocent people. \nI applaud him for it, and I applaud them for teaching people gun safety \nand self-defense so they can protect their families, their property, \nand their communities as well.\n  I yield the floor.", "turn": 7, "speaker": "Mr. CORNYN", "itemno": 11}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I rise today to share my strong \nsupport\n\n\nfor Steve Grasz, who has been nominated by President Trump to fill a \nvacancy on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit. The junior \nSenator from Nebraska and I asked Nebraskans to express their interest \nin this position, and we conducted a thorough process of the \napplicants. I must say that, with more than 5,700 lawyers, Nebraska \nproved itself to have a talented legal community that has demonstrated \nan unwavering dedication to the rule of law.\n  However, in our search, one candidate stood out above the rest, and \nthat was Steve Grasz. He is an outstanding Nebraskan and a talented \nlegal mind. The President agreed. That is why he accepted our \nrecommendation in August, and he nominated Steve for the Eighth \nCircuit.\n  Like so many other Nebraskans I have heard from during this process, \nthe President recognized Steve's temperament, intellect, and skill as \nworthy on the Federal bench.\n  Steve excelled in his education at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln \nand the University of Nebraska College of Law. He then built a \ndistinguished legal career, practicing appellate litigation over the \npast three decades. For 12 years, Steve served Nebraska as the chief \ndeputy attorney general. He did so with dedication to justice, \npassionately defending our citizens and upholding the laws of our \nState.\n  Steve has handled numerous constitutional litigation matters in the \nNebraska Supreme Court, the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals, and the \nU.S. Supreme Court. In doing so, he has earned the respect of the \nNebraska legal community.\n  For many years Steve has earned the Martindale-Hubbell ``AV \nPreeminent'' peer review rating, the very highest available. This peer-\nreviewed rating is based on legal knowledge and ethical standards, a \nnonpartisan litmus test.\n  Steve also serves on the executive committee of the appellate \npractice section of the Nebraska Bar Association, and he was selected \nas a fellow by the Nebraska State Bar Foundation, an honor reserved \nonly for the top lawyers in my State. Nebraskans agreed that Steve has \nthe extensive legal experience needed to serve on the Eighth Circuit. \nYet the American Bar Association has rated Steve as ``not qualified'' \nfor this position on the Federal bench.\n  As someone who spent months reviewing Steve's extraordinary \nqualifications for this judgeship, I was shocked when I heard the \nassessment. Something didn't add up.\n  But after a review of how the evaluation was conducted, things became \nmore clear. The ABA rating of Steve Grasz appears to be based on his \nwork defending Nebraska's pro-life laws as well as his personal views, \nwhich he shares with a majority of Nebraskans. Both evaluators \ndiscounted his remarkable legal career, choosing instead to focus on \ninnuendo in their report because he associates with political \norganizations they disagree with.\n  There is nothing wrong with participating in the democratic process. \nIndeed, Steve's own evaluators have done just that. Steve's first \nevaluator, Cynthia Nance, has received several awards from the \nDemocratic Party of Arkansas. His second evaluator, Laurence Pulgram, a \nSan Francisco attorney, works as a liberal activist and has donated \nthousands of dollars to the Democratic Party. Again, the fact that \nthese Americans have decided to engage in the political process is not \nshameful. They have every right to do so, just like everyone else. But \nhere is the problem. They claim to be leading an impartial evaluation \nof Steve, when in fact they are really trying to take down his \nnomination and further their own political agenda.\n  A deeper review of the ABA evaluation shows a report that is long on \nanonymous sources and short on substantiated evidence.\n  This is not the first time that the ABA has been criticized for using \nanonymous sources, either. In 2006, while discussing Vanessa Bryan's \nABA rating, the senior Senator from Connecticut stated:\n\n       I have even greater concern with the credibility of \n     anonymous sources when those sources are used as evidence for \n     a subjective characteristic such as judicial temperament. . . \n     . I urge the Senate Judiciary Committee to only consider \n     anonymous criticisms when such criticisms can be verified \n     from other sources.\n\n  Even worse, the sourced evidence the ABA produced for their report \ndoesn't hold up to scrutiny, either. One of the Nation's leading \nexperts on judicial appointments also agrees that the facts are few \nwhen it comes to Steve's ABA rating. In his examination, Ed Whelan, the \npresident of the Ethics and Public Policy Center, called the ABA \nevaluation ``feeble beyond the point of incompetence'' because it \n``selectively quotes'' portions of an article written by Grasz to \nmisrepresent his views. Whelan concludes that ``it would thus seem that \n. . . the ABA . . . is unable to distinguish between its role as \nadvocate and its role as adjudicator of the merits of judicial \nnominees.''\n  As we learned more about this evaluation process, it is clear that \nthe ABA uses its power as a reviewer of judicial nominees as a way to \nsupport its partisan agenda, instead of making a determination based on \nthe merits of judicial temperament.\n  During Steve's confirmation hearing last week, my colleagues on the \nJudiciary Committee asked good questions that brought even more details \nto light. That is how we discovered that Steve was asked a number of \ninappropriate, leading questions during his ABA evaluation. These \nquestions had no relevancy toward his ability to serve our Nation as a \njudge. He was asked for his personal opinion on social issues, \nincluding abortion, and he was later questioned about where his \nchildren went to school.\n  In response to a line of questions from the junior Senator from \nArizona, Steve explained that his ABA evaluator continued to use the \nterm ``you people'' during the interview. When Steve finally asked what \nhe meant by ``you people,'' the evaluator told him he meant \n``conservatives and Republicans.''\n  Steve also told the committee:\n\n       At least a half hour of that time was devoted to discussing \n     a white paper that I had written on the judicial selection \n     process for state judges in Nebraska. There was one paragraph \n     in that rather lengthy article [where] I had criticized the \n     oversized involvement of the American Bar Association in that \n     process, and I had mentioned some of their political \n     activities including their role in the debate over abortion \n     rights as well as Second Amendment rights of individuals.\n\n  He continued:\n\n       It seemed to be a topic of great concern to the \n     interviewer.\n\n  These tactics used by the ABA are not right. They show contempt for \nideas that do not fit the interviewer's personal beliefs and in no way \nportray an attempt to consider carefully whether or not Steve Grasz is \ncapable of being a fair judge. This wasn't an evaluation. It was a \npartisan, shameful attack. It was intended to further the political \nagenda of the two evaluators and damage Steve's sterling legal \nreputation.\n  In the days since the biased ABA rating was released, Nebraskans have \nspoken out, and I couldn't be more proud of them. In letters, online, \non Facebook, and in the pages of our State's newspapers, our citizens \nhave come to Steve's defense.\n  Richard Kopf, a senior U.S. district judge for Nebraska said he was \n``stunned'' reading the ABA assessment of Steve. The ABA interviewed \nJudge Kopf about Steve, and although he did not know Steve personally, \non two occasions he told the evaluator he believed Steve was ``well \nqualified.''\n  Judge Kopf wrote in the Omaha World-Herald:\n\n       One can only speculate, and my speculation was that Mr. \n     Grasz, who is by all accounts a brilliant and honorable \n     person, would do his best. I certainly have and had no \n     evidence to the contrary. . . . I respectfully suggest that \n     the committee got it wrong when it gave Mr. Grasz a ``not \n     qualified'' rating.\n\n  Additionally, the president of the Nebraska State Bar Association, \nTimothy Engler, quickly responded to the evaluation by noting that his \norganization did not participate in the report or the ABA's grade. Mr. \nEngler also noted that his own personal view was that he always found \nSteve ``to be professional, civil, and ethical in all respects'' and \nthat Grasz ``would have no questions regarding his judicial temperament \nas a member of the Judiciary.''\n  We received numerous letters of recommendation on Steve's behalf. \nNebraskans from across the political spectrum have pointed to Steve's \nthoughtfulness, fairmindedness, high ethical standards, and brilliant \nabilities as a jurist.\n  The respect and admiration for Steve is also bipartisan. This \nincludes former\n\n\nDemocratic Governor and U.S. Senator Ben Nelson, who wrote that Steve \nwas ``an asset to our state and Nebraskans benefitted from having such \na capable and thoughtful professional in public service. Today, he is \nunquestionably one of the foremost appellate lawyers in the state, \nmaking him an obvious choice for this seat on our federal appeals \ncourt.''\n  Debra Gilg, the former U.S. attorney for Nebraska and a Democrat \nappointed by President Obama, wrote:\n\n       Steve has always enjoyed a reputation for honesty, \n     impeccable integrity, and dedication to the rule of law. He \n     possesses an even temperament well-suited for the bench and \n     always acts with respect to all that interact with him.\n\n  Those who have known Steve his entire life have vouched for him as \nwell. For example, Bill Lydiatt of Bellevue, NE, wrote a letter to the \neditor to the Omaha World-Herald that said:\n\n       As a classmate of Grasz in Chappell, Nebraska, from \n     kindergarten through high school and as a lifelong friend, I \n     can personally vouch that Steve holds all of the attributes \n     to be a successful judge.\n\n  Furthermore, pointing to his integrity and fairness, he concluded:\n\n       I don't share all his political views, but I can say \n     without any hesitation that Steve Grasz is exactly the kind \n     of person we need as a judge and is perfectly suited to the \n     high honor of joining the 8th Circuit Court of Appeals.\n\n  In Nebraska, the truth holds more value than partisanship. Madam \nPresident, everyone serving in this Chamber swears an oath to support \nand defend the Constitution. One of the ways we do that is by \nconfirming judges who we know will faithfully honor that pledge while \nserving our Federal court system. The Constitution states that we in \nthe Senate, not the American Bar Association, are to advise and consent \nwhen it comes to judges. We have a duty to do so thoroughly, without \nbias, and through the use of all the information available to us.\n  Both the junior Senator from Nebraska and I trust Steve Grasz to \nsupport and defend the Constitution. So do those who know him best--the \npeople of Nebraska who have worked with him for nearly three decades. \nThe Senate should as well.\n  I urge the Senate Judiciary Committee to advance his nomination. The \nAmerican people deserve to have talented and fair lawyers like Steve \nGrasz on the Federal bench.\n  Thank you, Madam President.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.", "turn": 9, "speaker": "Mrs. FISCHER", "itemno": 13}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, today, as chairman of the Senate Finance \nCommittee, I am releasing a chairman's mark for the Senate version of \nthe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, legislation that is the culmination of years \nof effort to reform our Nation's Tax Code. We have been at this a long \ntime, and today marks a significant step forward in this effort. While \nwe refer to this document as a chairman's mark, it has really been a \ngroup effort, with significant input from all the Republican members of \nthe Finance Committee and great work from all of our staff. I want to \nthank everyone involved for their hard work, as well as their feedback, \nperspectives, advice, and ideas.\n  The last time Congress enacted a comprehensive overhaul of the Tax \nCode back in 1986, President Reagan famously noted that the American \npeople would finally have a tax code they could be proud of. And in \n1986, that was likely true. At that time, updates to the Tax Code were \nnecessary to keep pace with the technological and geopolitical changes \nour Nation had been facing. That sounds pretty familiar, Mr. President. \nIt is, after all, what we have been saying for the last several years. \nThe world of 1986 was vastly different from the world we live in today. \nAdvances in the past three decades have been monumental. Yet our Tax \nCode has not advanced, and it is failing us.\n  The American people have dealt with years of stagnating wages, \nsluggishness in labor markets, and weak growth in the economy. \nBusinesses are fleeing our country to find more favorable conditions in \nother countries. We have been working for years to address these issues \nand to meet the needs of the 21st-century global economy.\n  Fortunately, we now find ourselves in a position to make good on all \nof these years of hard work. A big part of that is the fact that our \ncurrent President is fully engaged on tax reform, unlike his most \nrecent predecessor. So we have been focused this year on providing \nmiddle-class tax relief, reforming the business tax system, and fixing \nour obscenely outdated international tax regime.\n  The mark we are releasing today will accomplish all of these goals \nand more. It will reduce individual rates across the board and direct \nsubstantial relief to low- and middle-income families and workers. It \nwill bring down corporate tax rates--a goal long shared by Republicans \nand Democrats--and provide businesses with new opportunities for growth \nand expansion. It will modernize our international tax system, bringing \nto an end our worldwide tax regime, a relic that should have been \nretired many years ago. We have been laser-focused on reducing taxes \nfor the middle class, and that is exactly what this bill will do.\n  Combined, these changes to our broken Tax Code in the chairman's mark \nwill give hard-working taxpayers across the country bigger paychecks \nand more opportunities. They will grow our economy, raising wages and \nimproving the standard of living for all Americans. They will once \nagain make America the best place in the world to create, grow, and \nkeep a business--where we create more jobs and sustain a vibrant, \ngrowing economy.\n  I will have more to say on the specifics of the mark in the coming \ndays. For now, I just want to give my colleagues on the Finance \nCommittee an opportunity to share their thoughts on the steps we are \ntaking today.\n  Before we get to that, I do want to acknowledge the elephants in the \nroom. Only Republicans will be standing up today to speak in favor of \nthe mark, and I expect we will hear some negative comments from our \nfriends on the other side of the aisle soon enough. On that point, I \nwill just reiterate what I have said many times in the past: Our desire \nfrom the outset of this endeavor has been to have Democrats join us in \nthis effort.\n  I have personally invited my colleagues to come to the table, to \nshare their views, and to work with us in good faith. Yet I expect that \nwe will hear a lot about supposed process fouls in the coming days. Let \nme make it clear to anyone listening: As chairman of the Senate's tax \nwriting committee, I haven't turned anyone away from the process. I \nhaven't refused to listen to anyone's ideas or suggestions. And I \ncontinue to say, with conviction, that I am still willing to have them \nonboard and hope they will be willing to get onboard and join us in \nthis effort.\n  A critical objective in the effort is to provide relief and support \nto the large swath of Americans in the middle class who have been left \nbehind, without economic gain or opportunities for growth.\n  Our tax reform efforts--represented in the chairman's mark put \nforward today--show that we are listening to those calling out for \nrelief. We have a historic opportunity to help, and that opportunity \nshould not be squandered by anyone on either side of the aisle for \ncheap political points.\n  With that, I am grateful to be a member of this body and grateful to \nbe chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, which is a very powerful \nand hard-working committee--both Republicans and Democrats. I am \ngrateful to make these remarks today.\n  I yield the floor.", "turn": 13, "speaker": "Mr. HATCH", "itemno": 17}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, the last time Congress really did the \nbig job that is before us right now was 1986. It did quite a bit to \nmodernize the Tax Code. That was 30 years ago. In the generation since, \nthe Tax Code has grown out of control. Everybody knows that. It has \nbeen a dream come true for accountants and lobbyists who make their \nliving from certain provisions of that Tax Code. But for the American \ntaxpayer, the gigantic Tax Code is not a dream, but a nightmare for \nmost Americans.\n\n\n  This has helped the powerful and the well connected, but it has hurt \nAmerican workers. It has hurt American industry, and it hurts America's \nability to compete with the rest of the world.\n  The bill unveiled today takes a giant step forward to make our Tax \nCode simpler, fairer, and more competitive. It catches us up with our \nmajor trading partners, who have been lowering business tax rates while \nwe stood still, and it keeps us uncompetitive. It will give us an \nopportunity to export more when we are competitive in the global \neconomy.\n  This bill will also help bring back jobs and create new ones. It will \nboost American wages by promoting economic growth and incentivizing \ninvestment.\n  The centerpiece of the legislation is where it ought to be--in the \ncenter of our population, middle-class America, so it has middle-class \ntax cuts. The average middle-class family of four would see a tax cut \nof more than $1,400 and an increase in the child tax credit of $650--\nabove the $1,000 that is already there per child, which would mean real \nhelp for working parents.\n  Nearly doubling the standard deduction means that many lower income \nAmericans will be removed from the tax rolls completely, and the tax \nfiling season will be much simpler for millions more.\n  Small businesses will also see significant tax relief from the rate \nreduction on the individual side but also from an innovative, new small \nbusiness income tax deduction. Two-thirds of the jobs in this country \nare created by those very same small businesses, and we ought to give \nthem some better equity with big C corporations.\n  It will provide much needed tax relief to nearly all small \nbusinesses, down to the smallest family-owned corner store and family \nfarmer.\n  Our bill recognizes the importance of small businesses in our \neconomy. After all, as I just said, they are responsible for a majority \nof those new jobs. The tax savings they receive could be spent on a new \nhire. It could be spent on giving raises to employees in those same \nsmall businesses. It could be invested in a growing company. All of \nthis adds up to Americans seeing more ``Now Hiring'' signs throughout \nour country.\n  Landmark tax relief during the Kennedy and Reagan administrations \ngrew wages, created jobs, and made the United States more competitive, \nso there is enough history behind what we are trying to do to know that \nit will accomplish the goals we are trying to accomplish.\n  Today, Congress has a golden opportunity to do, again, what was done \nin Kennedy and the Reagan years, and it has not been done for 30 years: \ntax cuts, tax simplification, and tax reform.\n  I yield the floor.", "turn": 15, "speaker": "Mr. GRASSLEY", "itemno": 19}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Today is good news for those \nsingle moms and single dads out there.\n  It is also good news for the working-class families--dual income--\nmaking around $75,000 a year, working every day, trying to make sure \nthey have a little left over for dinner out.\n  We want to say to those folks who haven't really had a raise in a \ndecade: We hear you. We feel your pain. We want to deliver to your \nAmerican family the opportunity to see more money in each paycheck. \nThis is good.\n  And for folks who are looking to start businesses, we have a \nChristmas surprise for you too.\n  We have lowered taxes on the average family about $1,500 a year--$100 \nor so a month. Here is what that means. For a family where you are in a \nsingle-parent household, you bring home about $450 a paycheck. That \ncould easily become an extra 10 percent per paycheck. That is a lot of \nmoney to a single-parent household.\n  We have also expanded the child tax credit to make sure that those \nfolks in the middle-income brackets are able to keep more of that hard-\nearned money. If there is a focus on our tax reform package, it is to \nmake sure that middle America--hard-working income earners--have a \nchance to see more money materialize in their paychecks.\n  We have also simplified the Tax Code. People say: Well, how did you \ndo that? There are seven brackets. I understand. It is simple. \nSimplification means you do not have to itemize. Said differently, 9 \nout of 10 taxpayers will be able to use the expanded standard deduction \nto figure out their tax burden, as opposed to going item by item by \nitem and understanding whether you can withdraw it or subtract it from \nyour income.\n  I had the great pleasure to be a small business owner before entering \nCongress. Many small business owners represent the backbone of our \neconomy. Most jobs created in the future will be created by a small \nbusiness owner. We are going to lower your taxes so that you can hire \nmore people and make long-term investments in building the greatest \neconomy this country has known in more than a generation.\n  This is a good day, and we have good news.", "turn": 17, "speaker": "Mr. SCOTT", "itemno": 21}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I agree with the Senator from South \nCarolina. This is, indeed, a good day for the families who will benefit \nfrom this additional money in their paycheck, from the increased \nstandard of living they will enjoy.\n  For those of us who want to see businesses come back home from \nabroad, they fled this country because we have the highest corporate \ntax rate in the world. When we say we want to reform that broken \ncorporate tax rate and to bring those businesses and that money home, \nwe join our colleagues--ranging from the Democratic leader, Senator \nSchumer, to Barack Obama in 2011, in a joint session of the U.S. \nCongress--in advocating for bringing that business rate down so that \nbusinesses will stay in America. They will hire Americans, and they \nwill improve wages for all working families.\n  I am proud to join my fellow Finance Committee colleagues on the \nfloor today to support our version of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which \nwas just released a few moments ago.\n  I congratulate Chairman Hatch for his leadership, but I am \nextraordinarily impressed with all the members of the Finance Committee \nwho worked so hard together to try to get us to where we are today. We \nplan for lower rates.\n  As you heard, we increased the standard deduction, we expanded the \nchild tax credit, and we reformed the Tax Code so that we can give \nAmericans access to more jobs and higher wages.\n  Our Democratic colleagues have said they want tax reform too. I \nmentioned Barack Obama and Chuck Schumer, our colleague from New York, \nwho repeatedly said that we should lower the corporate rate so \nbusinesses will come home, hire Americans, and help our economy grow \nhere. So we are all in agreement on that on a bipartisan basis, and \nthere is room for further agreement.\n\n  I agree with the chairman of the Finance Committee, Senator Hatch. We \ninvite our Democratic colleagues to come together and join us, \nparticularly starting on the Finance Committee on Monday.\n  If what we want is more, better paying jobs--and we do--then we have \nto focus on lowering rates on all the job creators, including small \nbusinesses, as you have heard. The framework we have developed was \ndesigned to cut taxes for middle-class families, not millionaires. It \nis to help small businesses grow and create more jobs. It is to provide \nrelief for hard-working families by increasing the standard deduction, \nas our colleague from South Carolina pointed out. One out of ten \ntaxpayers will now have to itemize deductions in order to take full \nadvantage of the law to reduce their tax burden. So it will be simpler, \neasier to comply with, and lower their tax rate, while enhancing the \nchild tax credit. These reforms will make the 1,000-page Tax Code \neasier to understand and comply with. Our efforts will simplify what \nare\n\n\nnow pages upon pages of language that only tax lawyers and lobbyists \nunderstand.\n  I look forward to continuing the important discussions when the \nSenate Finance Committee marks up and amends this proposal starting \nMonday.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I yield the floor.", "turn": 19, "speaker": "Mr. CORNYN", "itemno": 23}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, it is a good day here in the Senate because \ntoday we released our tax reform legislation, and soon we hope to have \na final bill on the President's desk.\n  When you first think about coming to Washington to serve, you dream \nabout fixing big problems and making a real difference in people's \nlives. Well, today we get to make a big difference.\n  When I look at the Chamber, I hearken back to 1986, which was the \nlast time tax reform was actually passed through the Senate and signed \ninto law by the President. Senator Hatch, the chairman of our \ncommittee, was a Member of the Senate at that time; Senator McConnell, \nthe Republican leader; Senator Grassley, whom you just heard from--they \nwere all here to vote on that. I was here as a young staffer. At that \ntime, I didn't have kids of my own, and today I am a grandfather. So a \nlot of time has passed, and tax reform is long overdue.\n  The whole point of this exercise is to give hope to future \ngenerations of Americans, to give them a better opportunity at a better \nlife, to improve their standard of living and their quality of life. In \norder for that to happen, we need to be taking the steps here and \nputting policies in place that will create the conditions that are \nfavorable to economic growth and to the creation of better paying jobs \nand higher wages.\n  Today we get to bring relief to the parents who are wondering if they \nwill be able to afford a new car that they need to fit their growing \nfamily. Today we get to bring relief to the single mom who is wondering \nhow she is going to pay the rent next month. As our colleague from \nSouth Carolina talked about, those parents and families who are \nliterally living paycheck to paycheck. Today, we get to bring relief to \nthe middle-aged couple worrying about a secure retirement, to the small \nbusiness owner who doesn't know how he will meet his tax bill and still \nmake his mortgage payment, to the family farmer who is worried that he \nwill not be able to pass down his farm to his daughter.\n  The comprehensive tax reform legislation we have introduced today \nwill provide immediate, direct relief to hard-working Americans. It \nwill immediately increase their take-home pay. It will immediately \nsimplify the Tax Code so that it is easier for Americans to figure out \nwhat benefits they qualify for so they don't have to spend a lot of \ntime and money filing their taxes.\n  That is really just the beginning. Our bill is also going to reform \nthe business side of the Tax Code to give Americans access to the jobs, \nthe wages, and the opportunities that will set them up for a secure \nfuture. We are going to make it easier for small businesses to raise \nwages and to hire new workers. We are going to end the outdated tax \nframework that is driving American companies to keep jobs and profits \noverseas, and we are going to make it easier for companies to invest in \nAmerican jobs and American workers.\n  It has been a rough few years for our economy and for the American \npeople. A lot of Americans haven't had a pay raise literally in almost \na decade. But with this tax reform legislation, we can ensure that it \ndoesn't stay that way.\n  The American people deserve a tax code that works for them and not \nagainst them, that grows their paychecks instead of shrinking them, \nthat expands their opportunities instead of eliminating them, and that \nis exactly what we are going to give them starting today.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.", "turn": 21, "speaker": "Mr. THUNE", "itemno": 25}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, today is America's lucky day. And we all \nknow what the definition of ``luck'' is--luck is when opportunity meets \npreparation. We are very lucky as a country and we are very lucky as a \nSenate that our majority leader, Mitch McConnell, was where he is and \nis where he is at the time he is. It was his vision a few years ago \nthat the tax issue was going to emerge as the central issue in the \ngrowth and development of our country and that unless we met the \nchallenges of our Tax Code, opened up opportunity for our public, and \nexpanded opportunity for our businesses, the American people could \nsuccumb to a high-tax system without productivity.\n  We also got lucky because Senator McConnell picked a man to be \nchairman of this committee--Orrin Hatch--who brought years of \nexperience in the U.S. Senate and the compassion that Orrin Hatch has \nas a Mormon and as an American to a tax code that is by no means \nsimple--it was always complex--to make it simpler and fairer, pro-\nfamily and pro-jobs.\n  Let me tell you something. There are a lot of disappointed people \noverseas right now because those who have been picking our pockets by \ninverting American corporations to foreign systems because their taxes \nwere lower than ours are out of luck. Now those people are going to be \nincentivized to come to America, to make investments in our country, to \nexpand opportunities and jobs in our country. No longer will companies \nwant to leave America; companies will invest and be more American. That \nis fantastic, and that is why this is a pro-jobs tax bill. It is going \nto create a lot of opportunity, and opportunity is what Americans want \nand what Americans need.\n  For the average American family--and let me talk about my family for \na second. I think I am pretty average. My wife and I are fortunate. We \nhave three great children and nine great grandchildren. I was lucky \nenough to have worked in a small LLC--limited liability partnership--\nreal estate brokerage company, mom-and-pop brokerage company. My wife \ntaught in public schools. Our children went to the University of \nGeorgia and to the public schools of our community. We saved for their \neducation. We did everything we could to invest in hope for them in the \nfuture, and today they are all gainfully employed. They are all happy, \nbut they are all struggling, as everybody else is, with a burdensome \ntax system, with less opportunity than we would like for them to have. \nBy simplifying the tax system, by making it fairer, as we have done \nhere, we have given more opportunity to my grandchildren, my children, \nand more opportunity to America.\n  Lastly, I want to make this point: There are only two ways to raise \ntaxes or raise revenue. One is to charge more. That means you raise \nsomebody's taxes. The other way to do it is to create opportunity. So \npeople create companies and jobs because the opportunity is there. When \nyou create opportunity and when jobs are created, revenues increase. \nWhen people do better in their jobs, their incomes go up. When \ncompanies have people who do better in their jobs, they expand. When \nthey expand, they produce more revenue that becomes taxable. So we \nraise our revenue not by lowering expectations but by raising \nopportunity for our people and for our children.\n  We are very lucky as Americans today. I am very lucky to be in this \nU.S. Senate today. We are lucky to have had leaders in place at a time \nthat was right to address our country's biggest challenge and do it the \nright way.\n  When I was in the Georgia Legislature, I sat next to an oldtime \nrural-hat politician who ran the Ways and Means Committee of the \nGeorgia Legislature. I will never forget that one day he and I were \nsitting side by side as we were listening to a gentleman make a speech \nin the well. The gentleman in the well paused a minute to try to make a \npoint, and he said: Ladies and gentlemen, let me tax your memory. And \nmy old friend, the rural-hat politician, said: Damn, I wish I had \nthought of that.\n  That is the way we have done taxes in this country for a long time--\njust taxed people's memory, tried to look for an opportunity to tax \nsomething for us. What we are doing here is we are creating \nopportunity. We are raising revenue through prosperity. Americans will \nraise revenue for their pockets first before the country gets the \nrevenue second.\n  So it is our lucky day--lucky to have good leaders, lucky to live in \nthe greatest country on the face of this Earth. And if we do our job--\nif we pass this bill before the end of this year and\n\n\nchange the Tax Code of the United States of America to a fairer, pro-\njobs, pro-family tax code--then we will have made our contribution to \nhistory at a time when it was our opportunity. I hope it will never be \nsaid that we let our country down when that opportunity was available \nto us.\n  I yield the floor.", "turn": 23, "speaker": "Mr. ISAKSON", "itemno": 27}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I want to echo the message of the Senator \nfrom Georgia. This is a terrific opportunity. This is a very big day. \nIt is a big step forward on our path to restoring the economic growth \nthat we have been waiting for all this time. I am very excited about \nthis step forward and the remainder of the process to get this done, to \nget this bill signed into law.\n  Why do we need this? We have just lived through the weakest recovery \nin American history--feeble growth, stagnant wages, and a widening gap \nbetween the wealthy and the poor. That is what has been happening for \nyears.\n  Some people say: Well, that is just the way it is. You just need to \nget used to it. That is the new normal. That is what America is about \nnow.\n  That is complete nonsense. There is nothing inevitable about the \nAmerican economy being weak and denying opportunity for the people we \nrepresent. It is a direct result of bad policy, failed policy that \nprevented us from having the recovery we would normally have after a \nrecession.\n  What was that policy? Well, we saw it. It is very clear. It is not a \nmatter of opinion, it is a matter of fact that productivity growth in \nAmerica collapsed. It is a matter of fact that investment in the kinds \nof new plants and equipment that allow for productivity to grow \ncollapsed. It is a fact that new business startups just dried up. \nPeople weren't able and willing to do it.\n  There is no mystery about why our economy was so weak for so many \nyears. We had imposed conditions that made it impossible to have the \nkind of growth that is normal. Meanwhile, what was happening in the \nrest of the world? The rest of the world was systematically making \ntheir tax codes more competitive. The countries that we compete with \naround the world, in Europe and Asia, were lowering the rates they \napply to business income, they were simplifying their codes, and they \nwere moving to international systems that made it more conducive for \nthem to generate investment into their countries, while we did nothing \nexcept let our Tax Code ossify. That is what has been happening these \nlast many years.\n  What I am excited about is that this bill fixes exactly what is \nbroken. This bill goes to exactly where the problem is and begins to \nturn this around. How do we do that? One of the things we do--a \nhallmark of this bill--is we are going to lower the cost of investing \nin the new plants and equipment that will allow American workers to \nbecome more productive. More productive workers get paid more in wages; \nthat is just a fact. That is what is going to happen as a result of \nthis bill.\n  Another thing we do in this bill is we get away from this terrible \npolicy we have that is resulting in foreign companies buying up \nAmerican companies. The way we treat income earned overseas is a \ndisaster, and we are the only country in the world that does it.\n  I think you could make a case that today the United States has what \nmight very well be the least attractive tax regime in the modern world, \nin the industrialized world. What is really exciting about this is that \nwe are going to move from this system to what just might be the best \ntax system in the industrialized world. Think about the result that is \ngoing to have. I think the result is going to be breathtaking--new \ninvestment, new businesses being launched, existing businesses growing.\n  Take foreign direct investment alone. If you think about it, we have \na global economy. Capital can move around the world with literally the \nclick of a mouse, and people make investment decisions based on the \nclimate of the place in which they are thinking about investing. When \nwe have the worst tax regime in the world, who really wants to invest \nhere? When we have the best, how are we not going to attract investment \nfrom all around the world, including very much in the United States?\n  So the changes we are making are exactly the right changes for this \nmoment. That is true in another respect, and that is, if you think \nabout where we are in this cycle, it has taken way too long to get \nhere, but the unemployment rate is quite low now. We are getting close \nto full employment. So what happens when we create the incentives for \nbusinesses to grow, to invest, for new businesses to launch, for people \nto invest in America--what happens when that occurs in an environment \nwhere the unemployment rate is very low? It sets up a bidding war for \nworkers. There is no other choice. As they grow, these businesses need \nnew employees to get the job done. They have to pay ever more because \nthey are competing with another business down the road that also wants \nto grow and also wants to invest in new plants and equipment.\n  What we are going to do is create a bidding war for workers. That \nmeans wages are going up. When wages go up, families have more take-\nhome pay. When they have more take-home pay, they have a higher \nstandard of living. This is exactly how people have a chance to live \nthe American dream, when the economy is thriving and growing at the \nrate that America used to take for granted. I am here to say that those \ndays are coming back.\n\n  We have some work to do. We are not done yet by any means, but I am \nconfident we are going to get this done and, when we do, our \nconstituents are going to live a better life as a result.\n  I yield the floor.", "turn": 25, "speaker": "Mr. TOOMEY", "itemno": 29}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I really enjoyed listening to my \ncolleague from Pennsylvania talking about this new tax reform plan that \nhas just been unveiled by the Finance Committee. He is right; this is \nreally exciting because it is an opportunity, after a lot of talk over \na lot of years, to finally fix our Tax Code.\n  Our Tax Code is broken. It is broken in a lot of different respects, \nbut one that he pointed out so well is the fact that we actually have \njobs and investment going overseas because of our Tax Code. It is the \nresponsibility of the people who are in this body and in the House and \nin the Presidency to actually fix that. No one else can do it. Workers \nin America, including in my home State of Ohio, are competing with one \nhand tied behind their back because we have a tax code that encourages \nother companies from foreign countries to come in and buy our \ncompanies, to take our business, to take our market share, to make it \nharder for U.S. workers to be able to compete and win. So I think it is \nway past time, frankly, for us to fix that.\n  People say: Well, we haven't reformed the Tax Code in 31 years and it \nis about time, and I agree with that. If we go back to the \ninternational part of our Tax Code that created a lot of these \nproblems, we have to go back to John F. Kennedy, who last reformed it. \nThat means that part of our Tax Code should qualify for AARP benefits; \nthat is how old it is. So it is time for us to fix it, and it is really \nexciting to finally have the opportunity.\n  There are three parts of this tax reform proposal, all three of which \nare really important. The first is a tax cut for the middle class. Why \nis that important? Because right now, even with the economy that is \nstarting to grow a little bit, what is happening? Wages are flat, so \nexpenses are up across the board.\n  The biggest expense, by the way, is the one the Presiding Officer has \nbeen involved with, which is healthcare. People have seen their \nhealthcare costs go up, as well as their premiums and their deductibles \nand their copays; yet their wages aren't going up, and that creates a \nmiddle-class squeeze. But it is more than healthcare. It is food. It is \nevery day purchases. It is tuition, if you are trying to send your kid \nto school. Those have skyrocketed. So let's do something to actually \ngive the family budget a little help; that is, the middle-class tax \ncuts that are in this proposal.\n  You probably saw today that the middle-class tax cut alone provides, \non average, $1,458 for every family. That is the median income family.\n  One of the reporters here in the hall asked me: Gosh, $1,500 a \nfamily--why does that matter?\n  I said: It matters a lot if you are living paycheck to paycheck. \nMaybe you\n\n\nare not, but a lot of people whom I represent are, and that $1,500 will \nhelp them to be able to make ends meet and maybe begin to save a little \nbit for vacation or retirement or for the ability to make that car \npayment. So I think this is really important.\n  I would say, though, beyond just that important middle-class tax cut, \nthere is something else that ought to be considered, which is, if we do \nthis right--the way this has been laid out by the Finance Committee--\nwhat is going to happen is we are going to help to create more jobs and \nhigher wages.\n  My colleague from Pennsylvania talked about this. With a relatively \ntight labor market, as we have more investment into these businesses, \nwhat is going to happen? Everyone says we are going to see wages go up. \nThe Congressional Budget Office, which is a nonpartisan group, and the \nJoint Committee on Taxation, also a nonpartisan group, have looked at \nall of this. They say: Yes, there is actually going to be a benefit to \nworkers if we do these business tax cuts, to be able to get the \nbusiness rate down below the average of the other industrialized \ncountries, rather than having the highest business rate in the entire \nindustrialized world, which it is now, because that is going to attract \nmore jobs and investment here and we will stop losing jobs and \ninvestment.\n  There are some economists who have looked at this, as well, and they \nagree that this is going to benefit workers. In fact, there are a \ncouple of economic studies that show that families will get an \nadditional $4,000, on average, per family. Again, we are talking about \nmiddle-class families who will get the benefits that are going to come \nfrom more investment and more jobs and higher earnings that are going \nto happen in the business world.\n  So it is not just about the middle-class tax cuts, as important as \nthey are; this is also tax reform that is going right to the bottom \nline. You will be able to figure it out. Go online, use the tax \ncalculator, and figure out what it means to you. But also remember that \nthese other reforms, in an outdated Tax Code that is just crying out \nfor reform, are going to result in additional benefits flowing to you \nand your family, as well, if we do this right, and we have to do it \nright.\n\n  There is a study that came out recently from a firm called Ernst & \nYoung. The study looked at what has been happening in America over the \npast decade or so. It said that over the last 13 years, there are 4,700 \nAmerican companies that have become foreign companies because of our \nTax Code that would still be American companies today if we put in \nplace the kind of tax reform we are talking about--20 percent rate--\nbelow that average of the other industrialized countries and this \ninternational system that allows you to be more competitive--4,700 \ncompanies. Think about that.\n  There is other data out there that says twice as many foreigners are \nbuying U.S. companies than U.S. companies are buying foreign companies. \nWhy? Because of our Tax Code. It is just true.\n  This is something that has been happening in this country, not just \nin the last couple of years but really over the last couple of decades. \nIt is time for us to catch up. America needs to get back in a \nleadership position, and if we do that, we are going to see more jobs \nand more investment coming here to this country rather than going \noverseas.\n  Finally, the third thing this does that is so important is it levels \nthe playing field internationally. Right now we have between $2.5 \ntrillion and $3 trillion of earnings--money--from American companies \nthat are trapped overseas. Those companies aren't bringing it back. \nWhy? Because of our Tax Code. This tax reform proposal actually says to \nthose companies: We want that money back here. We want you to invest in \nAmerica. We want you to create jobs here and expand plants and \nequipment; bring your intellectual property, your patents back here, \nand then send that export out from America. That will create jobs here, \nincluding good jobs in research and development.\n  That is what this proposal does as well. It levels that playing field \ninternationally to tell the foreign companies and the foreign nations \nthat are taking advantage of our current Tax Code: You know what, that \nis not going to happen anymore. That is done. We now are going to have \na competitive tax code where we are encouraging money to come here to \nthis country, and that money coming back here, invested in this \ncountry, will also raise the economic condition for the entire country. \nEconomic growth will go up, and, again, that filters down to all of us, \nincluding every family I represent.\n  That is why I am excited about this. I think it is overdue. I wish we \ncould have done this earlier, not just last year but 10 years ago or 20 \nyears ago.\n  Senator Hatch is on the floor tonight, and he has been talking about \nthis for a few decades. He has been saying that we have to fix this. He \nis now chairman of the Finance Committee. He can do it.\n  Senator McConnell is going to speak in a minute. He has talked about \nthis for a long time. We have had commissions on it. We have had \nbipartisan working groups--five of them--a year and a half ago on \nreform, and those bipartisan working groups looked at this issue. I \ncochaired one of those working groups on the international side. Guess \nwhat. On a bipartisan basis, we said: We have to have this lower tax \nrate; we have to go to this more competitive international system. Do \nmy colleagues know who the cochair of that working group was? There was \none Republican, one Democrat on all of these working groups. It was \nChuck Schumer from New York who is now a Democratic leader. So this has \nnot been a partisan issue in the past, on the international side at \nleast.\n  Let's figure out how we can come together and get Republican and \nDemocratic support to be able to tell the workers of America: You are \nno longer going to have to compete with one hand tied behind your back. \nWe are going to give you the tools to be able to be successful for you \nand your family so that you can achieve the American dream.\n  I am excited about this. Let's move forward. I look forward to the \nFinance Committee next week bringing it to the floor, and I hope we can \nhave support on both sides of the aisle to get this done.\n  I yield the floor.", "turn": 27, "speaker": "Mr. PORTMAN", "itemno": 31}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

How will these working \nfamilies improve?\n  The Presiding Officer, the Senator from Ohio, mentioned in his \nremarks that businesses will have money to invest. There will be \ncompetition for workers. And if there is competition for workers, then \nworkers are paid more. They are given better benefits. What do those \nbetter benefits and better wages mean? It means they can invest more in \ntheir family, in their children's future, and that, in turn, will \nchange their family's life for generations to come.\n  So on behalf of those working families, I echo Chairman Hatch, that \nif there is a suggestion by anyone that can make this better, I ask \nthem to bring that suggestion forward because this is not about \nRepublicans, this is not about Democrats, this is not about\n\n\nanybody in this Chamber; it is about those working families who, for \nthe last 8 years, have not done as well as the American dream would say \nthey should.\n  On behalf of those working families, I congratulate Chairman Hatch \nfor this job. I look forward to the passage of this bill, and I look \nforward to all of the benefits of this bill coming to help the families \nof this country and in my State of Louisiana.\n  Thank you.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.", "turn": 31, "speaker": "Mr. CASSIDY", "itemno": 35}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to discuss a couple of \npressing issues regarding our healthcare system and to ensure that \nAmericans are aware of some critical deadlines for their health options \nin the marketplace.\n  It is that time of year. Healthcare open enrollment has started, and \nAmericans across the country can sign up or change their healthcare \nplans to make sure they are getting a plan that works best for them and \ntheir families.\n  I have long said that the health reform law, otherwise known as \nObamaCare, is not perfect, and I have been pushing since I have been \nhere to make it work better for North Dakota families and small \nbusinesses. But there are many pieces in that healthcare law that are \nhelpful, and I wish to make sure that Americans and North Dakotans take \nadvantage during this open enrollment period.\n  Every individual and family should be able to get access to \naffordable, quality healthcare, and no one should have to go bankrupt \nto pay for healthcare for a child with a disability, a sick family \nmember, or just an emergency that you never thought could happen. That \nis why I am encouraging everyone to please make sure you explore your \noptions and sign up for healthcare coverage.\n  It is more important than ever that folks take advantage of this open \nenrollment period early because there are many changes this year that, \nunfortunately, make it more difficult for individuals and their \nfamilies to sign up for health insurance. Even if you already have a \nplan, it is worth checking out healthcare plans, as these prices change \nfrom year to year.\n  First, open enrollment today is a month and a half shorter this year \nthan it has been in the past. Open enrollment is from November 2--right \nnow--until December 15. That is just 45 days. Do not wait to check this \nout. It is best if you go today to find out if there is a better plan \nfor you or if you need to secure health insurance on the marketplace.\n  Second, the administration has significantly reduced funding for in-\nperson assistance, called navigators, who help individuals and families \nsign up for healthcare coverage. This action is leaving millions of \nAmericans and thousands of North Dakotans without the critical help \nthey need to understand their options and enroll in meaningful \nhealthcare coverage.\n  I want to make a point here. For those of us who in the past have \nalways had the option of getting healthcare coverage through an \nemployer, there is always someone in that employment office, in the \npayroll office, or in human resources who helps you through. This is \nnot unique in needing this assistance. It is not unique to the \nmarketplace. It is access and information that you have through your \nemployer, if you are getting your insurance through your employer. The \nidea was that the same opportunity for information should be made \navailable in person on the marketplace, but it is not. So we have to \ntry and fill in those gaps. Because we have these gaps, we are in many \nways seeing a number of cutbacks and a number of folks not getting \naccess to the information they need.\n  In fact, the Great Plains Tribal Chairmen's Health Board does not \nhave enough funds to operate as a navigator, and they will not be able \nto help North Dakotans sign up for coverage as they have done in \nprevious years. Another navigator in my State, Minot State University, \nhas had its Federal funds cut by over 96 percent.\n  Since 2013 the uninsured rate in North Dakota has been reduced from \n11 percent to 8 percent, in large part because of the work of these \nnavigators. The navigator grantees in my State have provided an \ninvaluable service by guiding families through the process of \ndetermining the best private health insurance coverage for them, as \nwell as through traditional Medicaid and Medicaid expansion application \nprocesses. Many North Dakotans who sign up for coverage qualify for \nFederal assistance to help afford that coverage. So it is vitally \nimportant that they understand Medicaid, that they understand Medicaid \nexpansion, and that they understand the tax implications of the plans \nthey are selecting.\n  But even those numbers that show the decrease in uninsured in North \nDakota don't tell the full story. Not only have navigators responded to \ndaily inquiries both during and outside of the open enrollment period, \nbut they have identified and responded to the challenges of increasing \nenrollment, particularly in rural and hard-to-reach areas of the State \nthat are less likely to have access to coverage through an employer.\n  Slashing funding for navigators also has implications for Indian \nCountry. The Indian Health Service has had challenges delivering \nquality care to Native Americans in my State and certainly in our \nregion. But those issues have lessened as more Native Americans have \nenrolled in traditional Medicaid, Medicaid expansion, and private \nhealth insurance, enabling these families to access quality, affordable \nhealthcare to stay healthy. Thanks to the increase of third-party \npayments, we are no longer limited to life-or-limb care at Tribal IHS \nfacilities in the Great Plains service area.\n  Adding to the turmoil of the enrollment process, the administration \nalso announced that it is cutting off Federal funding that helps make \nhealthcare affordable for families, known as cost sharing reduction \npayments. As a result, many individuals and families will see their \npremiums skyrocket by double digits. Due directly to this decision and \nthe uncertainty it has injected into our healthcare system, one insurer \nhas exited the healthcare marketplace in North Dakota and another has \nreduced its health insurance plan offerings, leaving many counties in \nmy State with only one insurer for consumers to choose from. \nIronically, North Dakota was one of the best covered States in terms of \noptions and choices. That option and that source of pride has been \ndiminished as a result of the lack of consistency with cost sharing \nreduction payments.\n  A recent report from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office said \nthat if the administration stopped paying the cost sharing reduction \npayments, as it has now done, there would be serious consequences for \nindividuals and families across the country. The report said families' \npremiums would jump about 20 percent, many families would be left \nwithout health insurance options as the lack of payment would force \nmany insurers to leave the market, and it would also add $194 billion \nto the deficit over a decade.\n  Despite these efforts to sabotage the marketplaces and jeopardize \naccess to coverage for families, we have fortunately seen a surge of \nencouraging enrollment numbers in the first week of enrollment. But the \nAmerican public deserves better, and I will do everything I can to \nensure that consumers know their options, that consumers are connected \nwith opportunities for meaningful coverage, and that they are provided \ncertainty in the future about healthcare costs.\n  On November 1, I had launched a new page on my website, \nheitkamp.senate.gov, to help provide resources and enrollment \ninformation to North Dakotans. I sincerely hope folks who are looking \nto buy health insurance on the marketplace in North Dakota take \nadvantage of that website.\n  Access to affordable quality healthcare is a must, and I am proud to \nhave worked with a group of Republican and Democratic Senators, led by \nSenators Alexander and Murray, to reach a deal to offer some immediate\n\n\nfixes to make healthcare more affordable and accessible in North Dakota \nand across the country. Our bill would specifically address many of the \nnew challenges that face folks during open enrollment.\n  The deal we unveiled last month would provide certainty for insurers \nand customers by restoring the cost sharing reduction payments for 2 \nyears and restoring Federal funding for outreach and enrollment efforts \nin States, including the navigator services that I talked about \nearlier. It incorporates an idea that I have been championing for many \nyears, which is to create a lower cost copper plan with lower premiums \nand higher deductibles to increase coverage options for young, healthy \nfamilies, where they aren't so much worried about the day-to-day costs \nof healthcare but that catastrophic event that could throw them into a \nlifetime of poverty.\n  The agreement would also provide flexibility for States to continue \nto explore their options to deliver the best healthcare options to \ntheir citizens. This recognizes that one size does not fit all and that \nwe need to have more flexibility for States to experiment and to \nprovide the kind of quality of care and the kind of care options that \nwork best for their State.\n  On top of having significant bipartisan support, there is a bonus. \nThe bonus is that CBO and the Joint Committee on Taxation estimate that \nenacting the legislation would reduce the deficit by $3.8 billion \nwithout substantially changing the number of people with health \ninsurance coverage.\n  Now Congress needs to pass our bill. I have long said there are good \nparts of the healthcare reform act and parts that need to be fixed. Our \nbipartisan deal is an important step to help families afford healthcare \ncoverage so the health reform law works better for North Dakotans.\n\n  How rare is it in this body to have this many people come together to \npropose one piece of legislation? I know that if you put this bill on \nto the floor tomorrow, it would easily pass with over 60 percent of the \nSenate. We need to get this done. We need to get it done to ensure the \nAmerican public that we are serious about responding to their concerns \nabout healthcare but that we are also serious legislators who can, in \nfact, fix the problems that we have in this country.\n  This isn't everything that we have been working on, but it certainly \nis the most important and the highest priority to pass the Murray-\nAlexander bill. But there are other proposals to improve healthcare \nthat I am working on. I recently introduced a bill to delay the health \ninsurance tax for 2 years and make coverage more affordable for the 156 \nmillion consumers across the country impacted by the fee. It would also \nmake the tax deductible moving forward, providing more certainty for \nfamilies to plan into the future.\n  Reducing the impact of the health insurance tax--a fee that directly \nimpacts the healthcare affordability for families and small \nbusinesses--has had broad, bipartisan support. In 2015 Congress passed \na 1-year delay of the fee. This delay benefited consumers, seniors, \nemployers, State employees, and Tribes. The average premium reduction \nfrom that delay of the fee was 3 percent.\n  If we think about the health insurance tax and we think about the \nsales taxes that many States enact, many States will tell you we don't \nenact sales tax on the necessities of life, whether it is food or \nwhether it is electricity. Clearly, this is a necessity of life, having \nthis health insurance. This health insurance tax is nothing more than a \nregressive sales tax on premium costs, and I believe we need to find a \nbetter and more commonsense alternative.\n  Another commonsense bill that I have introduced to help make \nhealthcare more affordable for middle-income families is a bill that \nwould address what I call the current cliff problem on premium \nassistance that many middle-class families and seniors face when they \nearn above 400 percent of the Federal poverty level, putting affordable \ncare out of reach.\n  Right now, those earning just a nominal sum over--$1 over 400 percent \nof the Federal poverty level, which is $47,550 for an individual and \n$97,200 for a family of four--are no longer eligible for any premium \nsupport to make health insurance more affordable. This perhaps is one \nof those issues that I have heard more about than almost any other \nissue in the Affordable Care Act.\n  What my bill would do is to get rid of the cliff and instead insert a \nslope. The bill would enable more young, healthy families to be able to \nobtain affordable healthcare coverage while diversifying the insurance \npools, and it would make sure seniors with high medical costs aren't \nforced to lose those hard-earned retirement savings or go without care. \nSmoothing out that cliff will make health insurance more affordable, \nwill make this bill more responsive to our middle-class taxpayers and \nmiddle-class families, and will provide some certainty for these \nfamilies as they look at the high cost of healthcare and insurance \npremiums into the future.\n  I also cosponsored a bill to provide stability in the insurance \nmarketplace by making the current reinsurance program for individual \nhealth insurance market permanent. It would be similar to the \nsuccessful programs used to lower premiums and spur competition in the \nMedicare Part D Program. This reinsurance program would provide funding \nto offset larger than expected insurance claims for health insurance \ncompanies participating in State and Federal insurance marketplaces, \nand it would encourage them to offer more plans in a greater number of \nmarkets, improving competition and driving down costs for patients and \nfamilies.\n  It is that catastrophic cost, which is unpredictable for the \nactuaries, that drives up high cost. If they know that catastrophic \ncost above a certain amount is subject to a reinsurance plan and those \ncosts are shared more broadly than just within that system, the \nhealthcare that they can provide and the insurance commissioners can \nsecure with a reasonable rate would be greatly reduced.\n  Lastly, another critical program that ensures access to coverage \nthroughout the country and in North Dakota is the Children's Health \nInsurance Program, or CHIP. I have to tell you, I know many, many \nfamilies who, without CHIP and without their ability to find that \ntemporary opportunity to use CHIP to insure their children, would be \nbankrupt today. They would have incurred healthcare bills just from a \nsimple fall off a swing set, and they would be spending a lifetime \ntrying to figure out how they are going to pay or they would be finding \ntheir way into the bankruptcy court.\n  CHIP is a program that has been used since the late 1990s, and more \nthan 2,000 North Dakota children currently rely on it for affordable \nhealthcare. It provides a critical bridge between Medicaid and private \ninsurance coverage for children. We have to act fast to reauthorize \nCHIP and let thousands of children across the country who are on CHIP \nand their families know that we care about them, that we are standing \nup for them, and that we are not going to leave them behind.\n  Unfortunately, the authorization for this critical and lifesaving \nprogram expired at the end of September. Without action from Congress, \nsome States will already run out of Federal funding before the end of \nthe year. Some already have and require emergency funding from the \nCenters for Medicare and Medicaid Services to shore up their programs \nso that they can still provide that continuous coverage while we fail \nto act here in the Congress.\n  While my State of North Dakota is not scheduled to run out of funding \nuntil April of next year, this is not a way to administer an ongoing \nand critical healthcare program. We need to get this program \nreauthorized now before it is too late and we have unnecessarily hurt \nAmerican children and have created unnecessary unpredictability for \nfamilies who need and have found some incredible benefit in covering \ntheir children with this program.\n  The Senate Finance Committee has marked up bipartisan legislation, \nthe Keep Kids' Insurance Dependable and Secure Act, to extend \nauthorization for the program for 5 years. Congress needs to act now to \nmake sure these families know their children have dependable and secure \ncoverage. No parent and no family member should have to wonder if their \nchildren will get critical care. Put yourself in their shoes.\n  Since I came to the Senate in 2013, I have said there are parts of \nthe healthcare law and the healthcare system that need improvement to \nmake sure it is working for hard-working\n\n\nNorth Dakotans and hard-working Americans. As I have outlined, these \nare some tangible, commonsense policy proposals that have strong \nbipartisan support, and we can, in fact, make this system better. We \ncan, in fact, tackle this challenge of healthcare, and then we can roll \nup our sleeves and reduce costs and make healthcare more affordable and \nless costly in this country.\n  We can do all of that. We have a country and a group of American \ncitizens who are counting on us to do our job to make sure that, into \nthe future, they will have the certainty that they need, the \npredictability that they need, to get their healthcare coverage and to \nmake sure that their families will never have to worry about having to \nfile bankruptcy because a child has fallen off of a swing set.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.", "turn": 35, "speaker": "Ms. HEITKAMP", "itemno": 40}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, next to our people, the Great Lakes are \nunquestionably Michigan's greatest resource. They are more than an \neconomic engine. They are more than a source of drinking water for 40 \nmillion people. They are more than a destination for tourists, boaters, \nand anglers from across the globe. While the Great Lakes are certainly \nall of those things, in Michigan, they are also a way of life. They \nare, quite simply, home. You cannot sit on the edge of one of our \nmassive inland seas without feeling a sense of awe and gratitude.\n  Next to me is a photo of the Straits of Mackinac, a 5-mile stretch of \nwater where Lake Michigan meets Lake Huron and where Michigan's Upper \nand Lower Peninsulas are connected by the Mackinac Bridge.\n  Unfortunately, today I cannot look out at these straits without \nfeeling a grave concern. The Straits of Mackinac are home to powerful \ncurrents. Water, at times, flows through at a volume greater than 10 \ntimes that of Niagara Falls. The currents are also unpredictable, as \nthey can flow in any direction and can change not only by the season or \neven by the day, but they can actually change by the hour.\n  The straits are also home to twin underwater oil pipelines that are \noperated by Enbridge, known as Line 5, that are now 64 years old and \ngetting older by the day. A recent study by the University of Michigan \nfound that the Straits of Mackinac are the absolute worst possible \nplace for an oilspill anywhere in the entire Great Lakes Basin.\n  Without question, there is no way that this pipeline would have been \nbuilt today, but it is there, and we need the toughest protections and \nstrictest accountability possible. To put these in place, I worked to \npass bipartisan legislation to designate the Great Lakes as an \nunusually sensitive area, which requires the highest possible operating \nstandards under Federal law.\n  Rigorous Federal oversight is critical, but pipeline owners and \noperators must do their part as well by being transparent and \nforthcoming.\n  While Enbridge assured us repeatedly that Line 5 is ``as good as \nnew,'' we found out in August that there are bandaid-sized gaps where \nprotective coatings had worn completely away and exposed the bare metal \nunderneath to the harsh underwater environment in the straits. Last \nmonth, we learned of six additional locations with damage to the \nprotective coatings, leaving areas as big as 1 square foot of exposed \nbare metal at each location. Then, on October 27, 2017, just 2 weeks \nago, Enbridge disclosed that its pipeline integrity department knew of \nthe damage that it had caused to the pipeline while conducting \nmaintenance in 2014--3 years ago.\n  I share the concerns that have been expressed by thousands of \nMichiganders who dread the worst case oilspill scenario, and I share \ntheir frustration and their anger at being misled. It is unacceptable \nthat damage to a pipeline running through the Great Lakes could go \nunreported for 3 weeks, let alone 3 years.\n  Simply put, Enbridge does not deserve our trust, and we deserve some \nanswers. This is why, earlier this week, I called on the Pipeline and \nHazardous Materials Safety Administration to exercise its oversight \nrole and conduct a thorough investigation--examine any potential safety \nor reporting violations--and assure all Michiganders of the safety and \nintegrity of Line 5, if at all possible. I also joined Senator Stabenow \nin demanding answers from Enbridge's CEO to three very critical \nquestions:\n  One, what are you doing to fix your broken reporting procedures?\n  Two, is there any other unreported damage to Line 5?\n  Three, how can we be certain that regulators are being fully informed \nby your company?\n  We need these answers, and we must get them.\n  I will never stop fighting to hold pipeline operators accountable and \nto keep our Great Lakes safe and clean. The Great Lakes are home, and I \nwill do everything that I can to protect them for generations to come.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.", "turn": 39, "speaker": "Mr. PETERS", "itemno": 45}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I want to turn to two topics today.\n  First, the good news is that all of the members of the Senate Rules \nCommittee have come together on a mandatory sexual harassment training \nresolution that has been submitted with broad support, including from \nthe two leaders and every member of the Rules Committee. I thank \nSenator Grassley for his leadership, Senator Shelby for his leadership, \nas well as Senators Capito and Cortez Masto, who were a big help.\n  We are all too aware that sexual harassment continues in our \nworkplaces. A recent study found that one in four women has been \nsexually harassed in the workplace and that three-quarters of \nindividuals who have experienced sexual harassment at work have not \nreported the incidences. Civil service is actually among the top five \nindustries with the highest sexual harassment incidences.\n  We know that it will not stop on its own, and we will not be \ncomplacent bystanders who expect workplace cultures to change on their \nown. That is why today, with a bipartisan group of 19 of our \ncolleagues, we took a major step forward with this resolution. Once it \nis adopted by the full Senate, which we hope will be shortly, this \nresolution will simply require that all Senators and staff receive \nsexual harassment training, as well as on other forms of harassment, at \nleast once every 2 years--in addition to that, 60 days after it passes.\n  What happens if Senators do not receive this training? The American \npeople will know.\n  In one part of this bill--and I appreciate the broad support from \nSenator McConnell, who has long been someone who has taken leadership \nin this area for many years, and from Senator Schumer, who has also \ntaken leadership in this area--all offices will have to certify to the \nSecretary of the Senate that they and their employees here in \nWashington, as well as those working in our home States, have, in fact, \ntaken the training and complied with the resolution. These \ncertifications will be posted online for the public to view.\n\n  I thank Senator Grassley, again, as well as Senator Shelby. Senator \nGrassley, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, was the author of \nthe Congressional Accountability Act of 1995. I want to thank as well \nSenators Cortez Masto and Capito and all the members of the Rules \nCommittee for coming together, on both sides of the aisle, on this \ncommonsense resolution.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Senate Anti-Harassment Training \nResolution of 2017. There is more work to be done with regard to the \nreporting process, and that is something we are going to be working on \nin the next few weeks through the Rules Committee, but I do want to \nthank them.\n\n\n  Senator Gillibrand has also been working in this area, and I want to \nthank her. Overall, it is a good effort in which everyone came together \nand agreed on a plan for mandatory training.\n\n\n                              Veterans Day\n\n  Mr. President, I will now turn to a completely different subject, and \nthat is the subject of Veterans Day.\n  I rise to honor and thank our veterans, servicemembers, and their \nfamilies as we celebrate our veterans on Veterans Day. These brave men \nand women represent the best among us. Whether you served 50 years ago \nor still wear the uniform today, we thank our veterans for their \nservice and sacrifice on behalf of this great Nation.\n  No matter when they served, all veterans have one thing in common: a \ndeep love of our country and a patriotism that goes beyond simply \nfeeling pride. All veterans were willing to lay down their lives in \ndefense of this Nation, and many continue to live the spirit of service \nin their communities once their time in the military is over.\n  Last week, I attended the change of command ceremony, where we \nhonored outgoing MG Richard Nash for his decades of service and saw him \npass the leadership torch to MG Jon Jensen, who was sworn in as the new \nadjutant general of Minnesota's National Guard.\n  As General Nash said earlier this year, ``Our Minnesota National \nGuard and the entire state has contributed greatly in a period of \nhistory that will be looked back upon as a remarkably important time.''\n  He continued: ``We were always ready, always there.''\n  He was right. Our servicemembers are always there for us, and, in \nturn, we must honor their service.\n  At a time marked by the volatility of our politics, our commitment to \nour servicemembers and veterans remains steadfast. We stand united \nregardless of our politics. Our veterans fought for our freedom, and we \nneed to be there for them.\n  When our servicemembers put their lives on the line to serve our \ncountry, there wasn't a waiting line. When they come home to the United \nStates of America, when they need healthcare or they need a job or they \nneed a house, there should never be a waiting line in the United States \nof America.\n  We still have a great deal of work ahead of us to honor this \ncommitment. Here is an example. Amie Muller of Woodbury, MN, enlisted \nin the Air Force in 1998. After two deployments to Balad, Iraq, where \nshe was stationed next to one of the war's most notorious toxic burn \npits, she returned home. Shortly afterward, she was diagnosed with \npancreatic cancer at age 36, half the average age for this form of \ncancer.\n  When Amie passed earlier this year, she left three small children and \nher loving husband Brian behind. Since then, I have gotten to know and \nwork with Brian. He has made one thing clear to me: We can't let these \ntoxic burn pits become another Agent Orange. So as part of Amie's \nlegacy, we are working to create a Center of Excellence within the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs to deal with the mounting evidence that \nthousands of veterans have gotten sick after being exposed to toxic \nsubstances burned in the large pits in Iraq and Afghanistan. This isn't \na partisan issue, and I am very pleased to have as a cosponsor of my \nbill Republican colleague Senator Thom Tillis of North Carolina. We \nhave been working together to get this bill passed. We are very pleased \nit was in the National Defense Authorization Act that came out of the \nSenate.\n  While our National Guard and Reserve component members often serve \nwith their Active-Duty counterparts on the exact same missions, they \nare not always ensured the same compensation and benefits for their \nservice. When they return home, our National Guard and reservists are \noften denied the education and healthcare benefits they counted on \nduring their deployments. We need to close that loophole and make sure \nthat members deployed on the same missions who take the same risks \nreceive the same benefits.\n  Just as we have made a commitment to serving our servicemembers, we \nhave made a commitment to looking out for their families. Since \nSeptember 11, 2001, the Minnesota National Guard soldiers and airmen \nhave deployed more than 26,000 times. Actually the Red Bulls, one of \nour units, is one of the longest serving units in Iraq.\n  That service can take a toll on families--especially kids. That is \nwhy it is important for students and teachers to know which students' \nparents are servicemembers so they can help make special accommodations \nlike setting up Skype during the schoolday so a young girl can talk to \nher dad who is serving abroad. That is what happens for students whose \nparents are on Active Duty in the military but not for those whose \nparents are in the Guard or Reserves. That makes no sense. Some say it \nwas just an error--some say maybe not. Whatever it is, we need to fix \nit. I am leading bipartisan legislation to make sure our Guard and \nReserve Forces and their families are treated equally.\n  When our veterans signed up to serve and defend our country, there \nwasn't a waiting line, as I noted. That is why, on this day tomorrow, \nwe will be honoring them by telling them we believe they deserve the \nbest.\n  I was reminded of that a number of years ago when I greeted one of \nthe World War II Honor Flights that was coming back filled with \nveterans from Minnesota who saw, maybe for the first time or the last \ntime, the World War II Memorial. They had gotten up incredibly early in \nthe morning, boarded a plane, spent the day, and flew back. There were \nhundreds and hundreds of family members waiting for them late at night \nin the airport terminal with balloons and signs with their names on \nthem. They got off that flight on walkers and wheelchairs, and they \ncame down to where the families were, tears running down their faces. \nIt was an amazing sight to see.\n  In typical Minnesota tradition, a polka band was playing by the \nluggage carrousel, and one of the older veterans, who I later found out \nwas in his late eighties, asked me to dance.\n  I said: Well, I would love to dance. Then the band stopped playing \nbecause it was at the end.\n  Then he said: Oh, that is OK.\n  I said: I am sorry. I will have to take a rain check.\n  I don't know why I said that to someone his age, but that is what I \nsaid.\n  Then he said: That is OK. I have a great voice.\n  He started singing that Frankie Valli song, ``You're just too good to \nbe true. Can't take my eyes off of you,'' and he danced me around and \naround that luggage carrousel.\n  As I danced with that man, I thought to myself, this is how our \nveterans should be treated every day. They should be greeted with \nballoons and signs at the airport, and they should be dancing with \ntheir Senators by the luggage carrousel.\n  That is the spirit we have to remember as we go forward into Veterans \nDay. We are reminded of the exceptional commitment and extraordinary \nservice our democracy demands of all the brave men and women who have \nstepped forward to protect it. That same democracy demands that we \nfight for our servicemembers as they fought for us. As General Nash \nsaid, they were ``always there'' for us, and we must be there for them \ntoo.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.", "turn": 43, "speaker": "Ms. KLOBUCHAR", "itemno": 49}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, as you know, I have been coming to the \nSenate floor pretty much every week for month after month to highlight \nsomeone in my State whom we call the Alaskan of the Week. It is someone \nwho does something important, either for their community or the State \nor the country, and oftentimes they don't get a lot of recognition. The \npurpose of this is to say: Look at what these people are doing for \nAlaska, for America, for their community.\n  My State is known for many things: its physical beauty, incredible \nhunting and fishing, adventuresome spirit, size--you don't want me \ngoing there. I have difficult conversations with my colleagues from \nTexas on occasion about the different sizes of our respective States, \nbut I will not go into detail\n\n\nhere. These are all things we have in Alaskan space, but the thing that \nreally makes us a great place to live is our people--strong, resilient, \nkind people all across our State who look out for each other, often in \nharsh weather conditions.\n  We are a patriotic State. I know everybody here claims that, and that \nis great. We all are.\n  Nowhere is the spirit of sacrifice and patriotism more apparent than \nin our veterans across the State. In Alaska, in Missouri--the Presiding \nOfficer's State--we are all celebrating that, and we are going to \ncelebrate that this weekend, going home for Veterans Day.\n  In Alaska, we like to talk about our veterans. We also like to talk \nabout the fact that we have more veterans per capita than any other \nState in the country. So it is a very patriotic place--full of service.\n  In every city, village, and every community across Alaska, you will \nfind proud veterans, many of them working tirelessly together to make \nsure they get the help and support that our veterans need. A lot of \ntimes that happens with the older vets--Vietnam-era vets. They come to \nmake sure the new vets get the help they need.\n  To all of them: I salute your service and your sacrifice. Thank you \nso much for all you have done and continue to do for our country. Happy \nVeterans Day to all of Alaska's veterans. I can't wait to get home to \ncelebrate in Fairbanks and Anchorage this weekend.\n  It is not just Veterans Day that is approaching in Alaska. This month \nwe are also celebrating Alaska Native Heritage Month, where there is \nmuch to celebrate. Almost 20 percent of the population of our great \nState is Alaska Natives. This is a group of people who, generation \nafter generation, have what I call a special patriotism.\n  What do I mean by that? Well, Alaska Natives serve at higher rates in \nthe military--just like the lower 48. Native Americans have higher \nrates in the military than any other ethnic group in the country. This \nhas been going on for generations--World War II, Korea, Vietnam, the \nCold War, Iraq, and Afghanistan. When you think about it, it is \nspecial.\n  Let's face it. In the forties, fifties, sixties, and seventies, even \nsometimes, unfortunately, today, the Federal Government has not always \ntreated Alaska Natives well. Yet, generation after generation, they go \noff to the front to fight for this country. It is truly a special kind \nof patriotism and a unique tribute to the Alaska Native heritage we are \nsupporting and celebrating this month.\n  I thought it was fitting today to name as our Alaskan of the Week--to \nmake it a collective tribute for all Alaska Natives who have served \ntheir country in the military, and it is thousands, to make them \ncollectively the Alaskans of the Week as we look to celebrate Veterans \nDay.\n  Mr. President, here is a little bit of history. I know you know this, \nbut a lot of Americans don't. During World War II, Alaska was the only \nState in the Union to be invaded and occupied by the Japanese, so we \nhad big military battles in the Aleutian Island chain of Alaska to \nthrow off the invaders of our American territory. Thousands of Alaska \nNatives volunteered to protect their homeland and to defend their \ncountry overseas. Across the State, whether they were in the Alaska \nTerritorial Guard, warriors overseas, code talkers who served with the \nMarines and others--they were as old as 80 and as young as 12.\n  This is a great story. It shows the warrior ethic. Alaska Native \nwomen, after the outbreak of World War II, originally enrolled in the \nAlaska Territorial Guard before they realized that women weren't \nallowed to enroll. In fact, the best sharpshooter in Alaska's \nTerritorial Guard was a woman named Laura Beltz Wright of Haycock, AK.\n  Here is how the late, great Jerome Trigg--an Alaska Native and a \nmarine--put it in 1968, at the height of the Vietnam war, when he was \ntestifying in front of the U.S. Congress on a very important piece of \nlegislation called the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act. He was the \npresident of the Arctic Native Brotherhood and, as I mentioned, a proud \nmarine.\n  In front of a bunch of Senators, he stated as follows:\n\n       We have showed our patriotism as proudly as any Americans \n     on earth. We have answered the call of duty with pride in \n     serving [our country]. We answered the call in [World War] II \n     100 percent. Every man in every village--old and young--\n     volunteered with the Alaska National Guard.\n\n  Remember, this was in 1968 that he was testifying. Then he said:\n\n       I have never heard of an Alaska Native burning the draft \n     card or burning our nation's flag.\n\n  We are patriots. That service, as I mentioned, didn't end after World \nWar II. Alaska Natives have served in every conflict--the Korean war \nand in droves during the Vietnam war.\n  I was honored to be in Southeast Alaska this past summer in a Native \nvillage called Hoonah. It is a beautiful place. There was a documentary \nI saw recently. It documented the classes in 1968 and 1969 in that \nsmall Native village in a film called ``Hunting and Wartime.'' It was \nabout how almost every single male high school student in Hoonah--every \none--went to go fight in Vietnam. That is incredible. It is special \npatriotism.\n  Let me tell you a quick, more up-to-date story. We had the Secretary \nof Interior, Ryan Zinke--a combat vet, a Navy SEAL, a heroic man \nhimself--come to Alaska this summer. I asked him to meet with a bunch \nof Alaska Native veterans, particularly our Vietnam veterans, who had \nan issue that the Department of Interior has been working on for years. \nI wanted him to hear about it firsthand.\n  It was a very touching meeting. Some in the room talked about what it \nwas like to be in their villages--places they had never left--when they \nwere 17 and 18 and 19. Then, a few days later, they were in a steamy \njungle, thousands and thousands of miles away, in Vietnam. Some talked \nabout what it was like coming back and not feeling that they had the \nsupport of their country, others talked about the difficulty of \nreadjusting to life back in Alaska after their service in Vietnam and \nsome of the discrimination they received when they came back home, but \neven though they went through this hardship, even though they went \nthrough some of these very difficult times in the late sixties and \nearly seventies, not one of them said they had made a mistake in \nserving their country. They were proud, patriotic warriors, and to this \nday that is what they are.\n\n  Secretary Zinke said, after he left that meeting, he began it as \ntheir Secretary of Interior, and he left as a brother in arms.\n  I am so honored to be able to serve these great Alaskans and to \ncelebrate them as our Alaskans of the Week, just like I know everybody \nin America is going to be proud to go home and celebrate with their \nveterans.\n  Once again, for our Alaska Native veterans, thank you for all you \nhave done for our country, and thank you for being our Alaskans of the \nWeek.\n\n\n                                 Energy\n\n  Mr. President, I just want to come down to the floor and say a few \nwords about a debate that has been going on in the Congress right now, \nand that involves the importance of more energy for the United States.\n  We had a hearing last week on the possibility of opening a very small \nportion of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge called the 1002 area--\nyou see it here in the picture--which would be a win-win-win for the \nUnited States. It would help create jobs, it would grow the economy, it \nwould increase energy security, and it would also help protect the \nglobal environment and strengthen our Nation's national security. These \nare the two issues I want to touch on this afternoon.\n  We have the highest environmental standards regarding responsible \nresource development anyplace in the world. I was actually in charge of \nthese standards as Alaska's commissioner of the Department of Natural \nResources. I could tell you, whether it was no impact exploration--what \nwe call that in Alaska--or specific requirements relating to our \nincredible species, like polar bear or caribou or mandating the best \navailable technology, we have an over 50-year record of responsible \nresource development in our State.\n  Let me just give you one example, what we call no impact exploration. \nOn the North Slope of Alaska, we only allow for exploration activities \nduring the winter months. So what does that mean? Companies actually \ncreate ice roads and ice pads, where they drive along the tundra with \nequipment and\n\n\nwith drill rigs to go explore all on ice. They do that for about 4 \nmonths during the winter, then they leave. When the spring comes, there \nis literally zero impact on the tundra--zero impact.\n  Yet some of my colleagues, particularly my colleagues on the other \nside of the aisle, have been coming down here for weeks talking about \nissues with regard to Alaska and the environment and energy. With all \ndue respect, they are using talking points that are about 40 years old.\n  When we had the hearing recently, the ranking member of the ENR \nCommittee said nothing has changed. Well, everything has changed--the \ntechnology, the high standards. The only thing that has not changed are \nsome of the talking points the other side has been using for the last \n40 years.\n  Let me just give you one example. On the bill the Energy and Natural \nResources Committee recently put up with regard to exploration in the \n1002 area--this is all of ANWR, I believe about the size of Wyoming. \nThis is the wilderness area of ANWR. This is the 1002 area, the coastal \narea of ANWR that was set aside by Congress to look at the possibility \nof exploring a very resource-rich area of the country. This red dot--\nyou can barely see it--is a surface area of 2,000 acres--2,000 acres. \nThat is what the bill would say. It would limit development of this \narea to 2,000 acres.\n  For a little perspective, Dulles airport is 12,000 acres. This would \nbe about 10 percent of Dulles airport. That is it. That is the surface \nfootprint. Yet my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have been \ncoming out and talking about millions and millions of acres, so it is \nimportant that we push back.\n  Here is the big issue for those in Congress who want to continually \nshut down resource development in Alaska that they never acknowledge: \nWhen you disallow investment in Alaska, which has the highest standards \nin the world on the environment, you don't end up protecting the \nenvironment. You just drive capital investment, exploration, and \ndevelopment activities to jurisdictions in the world with little to no \nenvironmental protection--countries like Nigeria, Venezuela, Iran, \nRussia, many of which are our geopolitical foes.\n  In conclusion, what we are looking to do on the Senate floor with \nregard to producing more energy for this country is going to help with \nregard to jobs, it is going to help with regard to energy security, it \nis going to help with regard to national security, and, yes, it is \ngoing to help with regard to protecting the global environment because \nwe have the highest standards in the world, and we do it right in \nAlaska.\n  If we are not doing it here, there will be activities in other \ncountries, other jurisdictions where they don't care about the \nenvironment the way we do. So we need to move forward on this important \nelement of the energy and natural resource bill that was introduced \ntoday in the committee. I encourage all of my colleagues to support \nthat bill.\n  I yield the floor.", "turn": 47, "speaker": "Mr. SULLIVAN", "itemno": 53}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
