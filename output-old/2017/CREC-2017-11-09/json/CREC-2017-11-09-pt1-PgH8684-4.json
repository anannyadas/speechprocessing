Mr. Speaker, today I rise to remember the life of Jack \nBeaton, a loving husband and father from Bakersfield, California.\n  Jack traveled to the Route 91 music festival with his wife, Laurie, \nto celebrate their 23rd wedding anniversary. Jack died a hero, \nshielding Laurie from the gunfire.\n  Laurie said Jack made her feel loved every single day. He was also a \nloving father to his two children. He always had a smile on his face \nand was a kid at heart.\n  Jack was known as a hard worker who was always willing to give \nsomeone a helping hand. He was the type of person who had literally \ngiven someone the shirt off his back. His children's friends said that \nhe, Jack, was a role model to them both as a father figure and as a \nbest friend.\n  I would like to extend my condolences to Jack Beaton's family and his \nfriends. Please know that the city of Las Vegas, the State of Nevada, \nand the whole country grieve with you.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. KIHUEN", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "183", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H8684", "wkday": "Thursday", "day": "9", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "HONORING THE LIFE OF JACK BEATON", "id": "CREC-2017-11-09-pt1-PgH8684-4", "title": "HONORING THE LIFE OF JACK BEATON"}
