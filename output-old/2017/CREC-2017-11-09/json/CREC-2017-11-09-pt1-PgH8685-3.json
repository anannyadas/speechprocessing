Mr. Speaker, I, too, rise to salute our veterans and \nto indicate to all of them that they are truly heroes walking amongst \nus.\n  I want to thank all of the armed servicemen and -women for their \nselfless dedication to the protection of this Nation every day, putting \non the uniform unselfishly and standing in the gap.\n  I think it is also important to note the many families who are also a \npart of this freedom.\n  And let me acknowledge the 21.6 million brave men and women who are \nveterans of our Nation's military service: 30,000 of them in the 18th \nCongressional District.\n  But I want to take a moment--and I will be speaking about this \ntomorrow and on Saturday, Veterans Day, about POWs and MIAs. I want to \nsalute Congressman Sam Johnson from Texas and Senator John McCain from \nArizona, both of whom suffered injuries, whom you can even see now in \nthe United States Congress, during their time as a POW. I honor them, \nand I hold them in high esteem.\n  And to the families of the MIAs from all of the wars, I want to say \nto them that we continue to pray for your loved ones.\n  As a sponsor of eight pieces of legislation and 35 pieces of \nlegislation that I cosponsored to make lives of veterans better, today \nI salute you and say happy Veterans Day. God bless all of you, and God \nbless this free Nation, the United States of America.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise to pay tribute to all the men and women who have \nserved in the Armed Forces of the United States and risked their lives \nto defend our freedoms and way of life.\n  Veterans are truly heroes walking among us.\n  I want to thank all of our armed serviceman and women for their \nselfless dedication to our protection every day.\n  Each Veterans Day, Americans come together to remember those who have \nserved our country around the world in the name of freedom and \ndemocracy.\n  The debt that we owe to them is immeasurable.\n  Their sacrifices, and those of their families, are freedom's \nfoundation.\n  Without the brave efforts of all the soldiers, sailors, airmen, \nmarines, Coast Guardsmen and women, and the National Guard and their \nfamilies, our country would not live so freely.\n  I offer my deepest gratitude to our nation's troops and reservists, \ntheir families, and the 21.6 million veterans, including 29,126 here in \nthe 18th Congressional District.\n  21.6 million brave men and women are veterans of our nation's \nmilitary service.\n  Nine in ten military families believe the public does not understand \nor appreciate their sacrifices.\n  We use Veterans Day to show our veterans and military families how \nimportant they are to us and how grateful we are for them each and \nevery day.\n  November is National Caregivers Month to show our caregivers how \ngrateful we are for them.\n  It is only fitting that we thank those caregivers who serve our \nmilitary today.\n  5.5 million spouses, parents, children, and other loved ones care for \nour wounded warriors and 15 percent of caregivers spend 40 plus hours a \nweek providing care for our military families.\n  As a Senior Member of the House Committees on Judiciary and Homeland \nSecurity, Ranking Member of the Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, \nHomeland Security, and Investigations, I care deeply about our \nveterans.\n  In this Congress alone, I have sponsored 8 pieces of legislation and \ncosponsored 35 pieces of legislation that will positively benefit our \nveterans and their families.\n  On the battlefield, the military pledges to leave no soldier behind.\n  As a nation, let it be our pledge that when they return home, we \nleave no veteran behind.\n  This day and every day, let us honor their service with actions that \nfulfill our commitment to our troops, their families, and our \nveterans--and that are worthy of our grateful nation.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Ms. JACKSON LEE", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "183", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H8685", "wkday": "Thursday", "day": "9", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "TRIBUTE TO VETERANS OF THE ARMED FORCES OF THE UNITED STATES", "id": "CREC-2017-11-09-pt1-PgH8685-3", "title": "TRIBUTE TO VETERANS OF THE ARMED FORCES OF THE UNITED STATES"}
