Mr. Speaker, I have been in the oil \nand gas business for many, many years, and the drilling business. I \nhave been out to drilling rigs offshore, and I have been to platforms \noffshore. I have interests, now, in several countries that do oil and \ngas, but I must vigorously and relentlessly oppose any move towards \nseismic testing or offshore drilling in the eastern Gulf of Mexico and \nalong the west coast of Florida.\n  Our west coast of Florida is highly developed with residential \ndevelopment and so are our bays. We can't tolerate the kinds of work \nboat, tank farm, and infrastructure necessary to service offshore rigs, \nbecause it is not just about the rigs.\n  This is a picture of work boats going from Grand Isle, Louisiana, out \nto the many, many rigs offshore the south Louisiana coast. This is a \npicture of work boats. This is what goes back and forth to offshore \nrigs every day.\n  Here is another one.\n  We don't have room for these things in our bays. We don't have time \nto see these things going off our coast, ruining the view that our \ntourists get.\n  Here is one last one. That is a cable tower putting down moorings, \nthe big round metal moorings that these boats tie off on. We don't have \nroom for those moorings in our rivers and bays. So, for that, I again \nwant to oppose any move towards offshore drilling in the southwest \nFlorida coast.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. FRANCIS ROONEY of Florida", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "183", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H8684", "wkday": "Thursday", "day": "9", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "OPPOSING SEISMIC TESTING AND OFFSHORE DRILLING IN GULF OF MEXICO AND WEST COAST OF FLORIDA", "id": "CREC-2017-11-09-pt1-PgH8684-3", "title": "OPPOSING SEISMIC TESTING AND OFFSHORE DRILLING IN GULF OF MEXICO AND  WEST COAST OF FLORIDA"}
