Mr. Speaker, as the House contemplates the Tax Cuts and \nJobs Act, a lot of misinformation is getting around the country on \nthat.\n  The intent here is to make the Tax Code simpler; the ability for \nAmericans to spend instead of billions of hours and billions of dollars \ncombined in dealing with their taxes, to get it down to a simple form, \nperhaps a postcard for many Americans, and the ability to weed through \ntheir taxes and get them done and put more money in their pockets.\n  What our plan does is put approximately $1,200 into the average \nmiddle-income family's pocket, leaves it there instead of taking it \nout; also, restoring more opportunity on Main Street for small \nbusinesses, medium businesses, and the jobs that we want to come back \nhome to this country, those trillions of dollars we can repatriate back \nto this country and help the middle class, help middle-income \nAmericans, help everybody to have a stronger, more vibrant economy, \nwhich helps everybody, instead of a complicated Tax Code put together \nby lobbyists.\n  We need to push forward on this and have a success for the American \npeople.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. LaMALFA", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "183", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H8666", "wkday": "Thursday", "day": "9", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "WE NEED TO PUSH FORWARD ON TAX CUTS", "id": "CREC-2017-11-09-pt1-PgH8666-2", "title": "WE NEED TO PUSH FORWARD ON TAX CUTS"}
