Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor and recognize Tolie \nBrodie Harrison who is an outstanding citizen in Nash County, North \nCarolina. Mrs. Harrison affectionately known as ``Ma Tolie'' will be \n100 years young on December 12, 2017.\n  Born in 1917 during the height of World War I, Mrs. Harrison has \ndevoted her entire life toward improving the quality of life for her \ncommunity.\n  Mrs. Harrison and her husband, Frank Barnabas Harrison, were blessed \nwith ten wonderful children. Education was important to the family. The \nHarrison's were adamant that their children would receive a proper \neducation and encouraged them to attend college. Mrs. Harrison was also \na provider and motivator by working countless hours on farms and in \ntobacco factories to keep her children enrolled in school. At age 45, \nshe was employed by Abott's Pharmaceuticals; which ensured the \nnecessary benefits to support her family.\n  Mr. Speaker, many in the Nash County community can testify to the \nhospitality and encouragement of Ma Tolie. As a strong advocate for \neducation, she would welcome new teachers to her home until they could \nfind a permanent residence. For the students; she fed them, housed \nthem, and wisely counseled them. With her many years of selfless \nservice, Mrs. Harrison has left an indelible impression on the lives \nshe touched. Throughout her life she has received many awards, \nrecognitions, and praises for her contributions.\n  It is my high honor to offer these remarks in recognition of a great \nAmerican who is an example of the highest degree of service to \nhumanity.\n\n\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. BUTTERFIELD", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 3}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "183", "extension": true, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "E1542-E1543", "wkday": "Thursday", "day": "9", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "RECOGNITION OF TOLIE BRODIE HARRISON--TRIBUTE TO HER 100TH BIRTHDAY", "id": "CREC-2017-11-09-pt1-PgE1542-3", "title": "RECOGNITION OF TOLIE BRODIE HARRISON--TRIBUTE TO HER 100TH BIRTHDAY"}
