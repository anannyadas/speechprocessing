Mr. Speaker, I rise to congratulate the Edina Girls \nTennis Team on winning the Minnesota State Championship Title.\n  The Hornets won the state finals with seven wins in seven contests. \nSophomore Nicole Copeland and Senior Sophia Reddy both beat their \nopponents in two straight matches, clinching the victory for Edina in a \ndecisive fashion.\n  This was a big year for the Hornets. Edina has won the state \nchampionship in girls tennis in 20 out of the last 21 years, a \ntremendous feat by any standard. Many of the matches in this year's \ntournament were decided by one point. They know what it's like to play \nunder pressure and still clinch a victory.\n  Mr. Speaker, the Hornets' victory is a tribute to their hard work \nthroughout the season and their ability to play under pressure. And \nmost importantly, I commend these student athletes, who have also \nexcelled in the classroom and our community.\n  Congratulations again to Coach Steve Paulsen and the Edina High \nSchool Girls Tennis Team. Their families, teachers, friends, neighbors, \nand our entire community are very proud to call them state champs.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. PAULSEN", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 3}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "183", "extension": true, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "E1543", "wkday": "Thursday", "day": "9", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "WAY TO GO EDINA TENNIS CHAMPS", "id": "CREC-2017-11-09-pt1-PgE1543-2", "title": "WAY TO GO EDINA TENNIS CHAMPS"}
