Mr. Speaker, I'd like to honor my \nconstituent and friend, Pam Testroet, as incoming President of the \nLouisiana REALTORS Association. Pam and her leadership team will \nrepresent over 13,000 REALTOR members and have proven to be exemplary \nand dedicated volunteers to the organization. Home ownership is an \nimportant goal for most Americans, and certainly for citizens of \nLouisiana. It bolsters our state and local economies and helps with job \ncreation. More importantly, home ownership is not just an aspiration \nthat is part of the American Dream; to many Louisianans, it is a dream \ncome true. REALTORS remain at the forefront and work tirelessly to help \ntheir clients achieve that dream. At a young age, Pam braved adversity \nand helped champion diversity in the historic story of Ruby Bridges. \nThis kind of example gives us all hope for a better tomorrow. Pam had \nan extensive career in the telecommunications industry before earning \nher real estate license in 2003. She is passionate about education and \nhomeownership and has served on the local, state and national level in \nvarious committees and roles. Pam is a proud REALTOR member with a \npassion for advocacy, policy, and fostering relationships to protect \nhomeowners. I look forward to working with her, the leadership, and all \nthe REALTORS in the coming year.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. GRAVES of Louisiana", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 3}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "183", "extension": true, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "E1544", "wkday": "Thursday", "day": "9", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "CONGRATULATIONS TO PAM TESTROET", "id": "CREC-2017-11-09-pt1-PgE1544-3", "title": "CONGRATULATIONS TO PAM TESTROET"}
