Mr. Speaker, I rise today in memory of 32-year-old \nDarren Drake from New Milford, New Jersey, whose promising life was cut \nshort in last month's tragic and senseless act of ISIS-inspired lone-\nwolf terror in Manhattan.\n  Darren was one of our best and brightest, and a son of New Jersey \nthrough and through. A hardworking project manager at Moody's and a \nlifelong Jets fan, Darren earned more than three degrees from New \nJersey universities. Not only was he driven and accomplished, Darren \nwas also a committed public servant, serving as president of the New \nMilford School Board.\n  Darren was beloved. It was intensely moving to see so much of the \nNorth Jersey community come together at his wake and funeral last week \nand this week.\n  To his parents, Jimmy and Barbara, and everyone whose life he \ntouched, I want to express my deepest condolences. Darren's death is \nour profound loss. He packed more into his years than most do in a \nlifetime. His life enriched our lives beyond measure.\n  No act of terror will ever be able to diminish the bright and burning \nlove he had for his home, my State, and our country. I will spend my \ndays here fighting terrorism at home and abroad in Darren's honor.\n  May God rest his soul.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. GOTTHEIMER", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "183", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H8683", "wkday": "Thursday", "day": "9", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "HONORING THE LIFE OF DARREN DRAKE", "id": "CREC-2017-11-09-pt1-PgH8683", "title": "HONORING THE LIFE OF DARREN DRAKE"}
