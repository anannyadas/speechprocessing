Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Chris VanderSlice, \nwho passed away on October 28, 2017 after a courageous four year battle \nwith leukemia. Chris was a beloved educator and leader in the West \nMichigan community--whose legacy will never be forgotten.\n   Chris, or ``Slice'' as his colleagues knew him best, was a servant \nleader with Grandville Public Schools for nearly 18 years. His career \nbegan as a teacher at Grandville's Middle School and South Elementary. \nChris was then promoted to assistant principal at Grandville High \nSchool, where he became principal in 2013.\n   A former Hope College basketball team captain, Chris brought his \ncompetitive spirit to the classroom and school district. He inspired a \nculture of ``pride and excellence,'' that influenced both students and \nteachers. After only a short time as principal, Chris implemented \nprofessional learning communities to improve teaching techniques and \naccountability.\n   Following the initial diagnosis of acute lymphoblastic leukemia in \n2013, the Grandville community quickly rallied to embrace the \nVanderSlice family. The swift response from the community is a touching \ntestament to the character of Chris, his family, and West Michigan as a \nwhole. Chris leaves behind a legacy of ``grit and perseverance''--\ncharacteristics that will continue to inspire, encourage, and forever \nimpact generations to come.\n   Mr. Speaker, Chris VanderSlice spent his life working to educate and \nbetter the students of Grandville, Michigan. It is thus fitting and \nproper that we honor him here today. I extend my deepest condolences to \nhis wife Tonya, daughters Hannah and Elizabeth, and to all who knew and \nloved Chris.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. HUIZENGA", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 3}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "183", "extension": true, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "E1541", "wkday": "Thursday", "day": "9", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "IN HONOR OF CHRIS VANDERSLICE", "id": "CREC-2017-11-09-pt1-PgE1541-3", "title": "IN HONOR OF CHRIS VANDERSLICE"}
