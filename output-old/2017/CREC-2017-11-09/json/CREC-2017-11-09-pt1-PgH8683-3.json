Mr. Speaker, study after study has shown that illegal \nvoting is extraordinarily rare and voter fraud is almost nonexistent.\n  Instead of spending taxpayer money chasing after mythical claims of \nvoter fraud, the Federal Government must address actual threats to our \nelectoral system. It is imperative that the Federal Government protect \nthe integrity of our elections, but the administration seems interested \nin only chasing voter fraud unicorns.\n  The real threats to our democracy are voter suppression, \ncybersecurity, weaknesses, and foreign meddling.\n  To protect the integrity of our elections, we must expand voting \nrights for all Americans, we must modernize our voting systems, and we \nmust appoint an independent commission to investigate foreign meddling \nin the electoral system before the 2018 Federal election.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. PAYNE", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 3}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "183", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H8683", "wkday": "Thursday", "day": "9", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "PROTECTING ELECTORAL INTEGRITY", "id": "CREC-2017-11-09-pt1-PgH8683-3", "title": null}
