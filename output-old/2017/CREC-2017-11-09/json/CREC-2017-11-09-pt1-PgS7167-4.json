{"title": "SEXUAL HARASSMENT TRAINING FOR SENATORS AND STAFF", "content": [{"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "G000386", "text": "  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I join my colleague, the ranking member \nof the Rules Committee, as she seeks unanimous consent to adopt our \nantiharassment training resolution. It is closely modeled on a Senate \nresolution I introduced 2 days ago with Senators Feinstein, Klobuchar, \nErnst, Gillibrand, and several other colleagues.\n  This resolution's adoption marks the first time that this Chamber \nrequires sexual harassment training for all Senators, staff, interns, \nand fellows.\n  I wrote legislation on this topic after contacting the Rules \nCommittee chairman last week to urge that everyone in this Chamber \nreceive antiharassment training. This measure's passage with the Rules \nCommittee chairman's support, just days after I called for the Rules \nCommittee to institute a harassment training requirement for this \nchamber, is a sign of the wonderful things we can accomplish when we \nwork together in a bipartisan way.\n  More than two decades ago, I sponsored the Congressional \nAccountability Act as a sign of our commitment to promoting fairness in \nthe workplace. This 1995 statute requires Congress to follow the same \ncivil rights, labor, workplace safety, and health laws to which other \nemployers are subject.\n  It is certainly time for us to make antiharassment training \nmandatory, but we also may want to revisit the statute to ensure that \nit is working as intended. According to the Washington Post, over 1,000 \nformer staff have contacted Congress in the last week to urge that we \nrevisit policies relating to sexual harassment, and I am fully \ncommitted to doing so.\n  The resolution we have developed would ensure that the Rules \nCommittee has the authority necessary to ensure that every Member of \nthis Chamber, every employee on the Senate payroll, and every unpaid \nSenate intern receives antiharassment training.\n  All of us work hard to ensure that our offices are professional, free \nof harassment, and places where merit is rewarded, but I think we have \nto acknowledge that in our society, despite our best efforts and \nintentions, sexual harassment remains a serious problem. We must work \ntogether to make sure that the Senate remains free from harassment.\n  It is important for every Senate office to have a consistent stance \non this particular issue. Every office should receive the same training \nso the Senate maintains a culture in which harassment is not tolerated. \nThis is a common interest we all share. The voters who sent us here \nexpect the best. We owe it to the American people to hold ourselves and \nour employees to the highest standards of conduct and professionalism.\n  I will close by again thanking Senators Klobuchar, Feinstein, Ernst, \nand others for working so closely with me on the measure's development. \nI also want to take this opportunity to thank the staff of the Senate \nChief Counsel for Employment and the Office on Compliance, who worked \nwith our offices on draft after draft of this resolution. Finally, I \nwant to thank our other cosponsors, including our majority leader and \nminority leader. I urge my colleagues to embrace a sensible approach to \npreventing sexual harassment by supporting its immediate adoption.", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. GRASSLEY", "itemno": 0}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "M000355", "text": "  Mr. McCONNELL.
