Mr. Speaker, I have a message for the liberal so-\ncalled mainstream media.\n  You are essential to democracy. You have an almost sacred \nresponsibility to inform the American people, but they don't believe \nyou anymore.\n  Your coverage of the President and conservative Republicans is now \nobviously so slanted, so biased, that you have lost your credibility; \nin fact, polls show that it is at a record low.\n  In trying to destroy this President, you are destroying yourself. Is \nthat what you want?\n  Remember the Chinese proverb: ``When you set out on a journey of \nrevenge, dig two graves.''\n  Why not trust the American people with the facts and let them make up \ntheir own minds rather than telling them what to think? I don't know of\n\n\nany other way you can restore your credibility.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. SMITH of Texas", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "183", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H8666-H8667", "wkday": "Thursday", "day": "9", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "A MESSAGE FOR THE MEDIA", "id": "CREC-2017-11-09-pt1-PgH8666-6", "title": "A MESSAGE FOR THE MEDIA"}
