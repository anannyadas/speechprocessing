Mr. Speaker, I rise today to thank Ms. Kazia Capener for \nher service to my office and the people of California's Twenty-First \nCongressional District.\n  Ms. Capener was born July 13, 1993 in Provo, Utah while her parents, \nLars and LeAnn Capener, were attending Brigham Young University. As a \nbaby, her parents moved to northern California, first to Davis then to \nRedding, where she lived until she was eight. Her family then moved \nKazia, her brother Leif, and her sister, Anja, to Aurora, Illinois \nwhere her brother Kai was born. Throughout her childhood, Ms. Capener \nwas an active tennis player and worked as a coach while in both high \nschool and college.\n  After graduating from Waubonsie Valley High School in Aurora, \nIllinois, Ms. Capener went on to attend Brigham Young University, \nIdaho, in 2011. While in college, Kazia served an eighteen-month \nmission for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Seattle, \nWashington. While in Seattle, she served as a full-time volunteer \nteaching about the church, organizing and performing community service, \nand teaching English as a second language. In 2015, Kazia studied \nabroad at Universite Paul Valery Montpellier--III, where she \nparticipated in an intensive French language immersion program in \nMontpellier, France.\n  Kazia joined my team as an Intern in my Washington, D.C. office in \nMarch 2017 and quickly became Staff Assistant a month later in April \n2017. As Staff Assistant, Ms. Capener was instrumental to my team \nthrough managing my D.C. internship program, assisting my constituents \nby planning tours in the nation's capital, and helping staff with day \nto day tasks. As a member of my team, Ms. Capener was greatly respected \nby her peers for her professionalism and dedication to her work. \nOutside of work, Kazia is an avid music lover and enjoys attending \nconcerts, videography, and learning about other cultures.\n  Ms. Capener's time with my office will come to a close November 9, \n2017 when she leaves to begin a new career as an Employment Specialist \nat the Ethiopian Community Development Council in Washington, D.C. In \nconjunction with the United States Department of State, Ms. Capener \nwill be responsible for helping refugees with special immigrant visas \nfrom all over the world create resumes, prepare for interviews, and \nultimately, find employment. She will also teach American culture \nclasses to new arrivals to help refugees integrate into their new \ncommunities.\n  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues in the United States House of \nRepresentatives to join me in commending Ms. Kazia Capener for her \npublic service to the people of California's Central Valley and wishing \nher well as she embarks on the next chapter of her life.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. VALADAO", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 3}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "183", "extension": true, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "E1545", "wkday": "Thursday", "day": "9", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "IN RECOGNITION OF MS.
