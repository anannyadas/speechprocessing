Mr. President, I want to speak about a subject that many \nSenators are aware of and should be deeply concerned about.\n  As we remember, in the early morning hours of March 3, 2016, Honduras \nlost one of its most courageous and charismatic indigenous leaders, \nBerta Caceres. Ms. Caceres was the general coordinator of the National \nCouncil of Popular and Indigenous Organizations of Honduras, COPINH. \nShe was gunned down by assassins in her home in the village of La \nEsperanza, Intibuca.\n  Berta Caceres spent her life defending indigenous rights, \nparticularly to land and natural resources. In 2015, she won the \nprestigious Goldman Environmental Prize for her outstanding activism \nand leadership. She and COPINH had been supporting land struggles \nthroughout western Honduras, and because of that--because she was \nexercising rights guaranteed by Honduran law and international law--she \nand the communities that she and COPINH supported were the frequent \ntargets of death threats.\n  In Rio Blanco, her organization and the community of Rio Blanco were \nthreatened repeatedly as they engaged in peaceful protests to protect \nthe river and their way of life from the construction of the Agua Zarca \nhydroelectric dam by DESA, a Honduran company supported by \ninternational banks.\n  It was as a result of the threats she received for supporting the Rio \nBlanco struggle that Ms. Caceres was granted precautionary measures by \nthe Inter-American Commission on Human Rights. However, the Honduran \nauthorities not only failed to protect her, they vilified her and other \nsocial activists like her.\n  Berta Caceres was an inspiration to people around the world, and her \ndeath was a terrible loss for people everywhere. As I said in this \nChamber the day after her death:\n\n       The immediate question is what President Hernandez, and his \n     government which has too often ignored or passively condoned \n     attacks against Honduran social activists, will do to support \n     an independent investigation, prosecution, and punishment of \n     those responsible for this despicable crime. And beyond that, \n     what steps will the government take to protect the many \n     others, including members of COPINH, who are in need of \n     protection, and to stand up for the rights of people like \n     Berta who risk their lives peacefully defending the \n     environment and their livelihoods.\n\n  Not surprisingly to those who are familiar with Honduran law \nenforcement, the investigation of the murder got off to a bad start. \nNot only was the crime scene at Ms. Caceres's home tampered with, the \ngovernment's first response to the killing was to attempt to falsely \npin the attack on her COPINH associates. When that went nowhere, they \nsought to intimidate the one eyewitness to the shooting, Gustavo \nCastro, a Mexican citizen who had been wounded. That also failed.\n  Thanks to intense international pressure including from the U.S. \nEmbassy, eight people were eventually arrested, including one active \nduty army officer and low-ranking employees of DESA, the hydroelectric \ncompany. This is notable, because the assassination of Berta Caceres \nwas only the latest of more than 100 reported killings of environmental \nactivists in Honduras since 2010. Since her death, there have been \nothers. Investigators for Global Witness, a widely respected human \nrights organization that documented those crimes, were subjected to \nthreats and spurious accusations by Honduran officials who sought to \ndiscredit their report. As far as I am aware, no one has been brought \nto justice for any of those crimes, and had it not been for the \ninternational outcry, there is no reason to think that Ms. Caceres's \nmurder would have been treated any differently.\n  Shortly after the murder, due to the long history of impunity for \nkillings of journalists and social activists, Ms. Caceres's family \nurged the Honduran Government to permit the Inter-American Commission \non Human Rights, IACHR, to send an independent team of legal experts to \nconduct their own investigation. Not only did the Honduran Government \nrefuse, the Public Ministry has refused to share the bulk of the \nevidence with the Caceres family's legal representatives, as required \nby Honduran law.\n  The family also asked that independent forensic experts be allowed to \nanalyze the ballistics and other evidence. The Honduran Government \nsimilarly rejected that request.\n  Like Ms. Caceres's family, I also called for an independent \ninvestigation and urged that the concession granted to DESA for the \nAgua Zarca project be abandoned. It clearly cannot coexist with the \nindigenous people of Rio Blanco who see it as a threat to their safety \nand way of life; yet while some of the international banks have \nwithdrawn, it is 20 months since the murder of Ms. Caceres, and not \nonly does DESA deny any responsibility, it refuses to cancel the \nproject.\n  After the arrests of the eight suspects, there was hope that those \nwho conceived of and paid for the assassination of Ms. Caceres would \nalso be tracked down and captured, but that did not happen. For more \nthan a year, there has been no further word from the Public Ministry \nabout the case, except that the investigation is ongoing--a familiar \nrefrain in Honduras where criminal investigations have a way of either \nnever beginning, or never ending.\n  The U.S. Embassy also repeatedly assured me and others who inquired \nthat the investigation was being handled professionally in accordance \nwith the highest standards. It now appears that was uninformed, wishful \nthinking.\n  After the Honduran Government refused to permit the IACHR to \ninvestigate, Berta Caceres's family arranged for an independent team of \ninternational human rights lawyers to conduct their own review of the \nevidence. Over a period of a year, the group, consisting of five \nexperienced lawyers from the United States, Colombia, and Guatemala, \nknown as the International Advisory Group of Experts, GAIPE, \ninterviewed witnesses and analyzed what cell phone data and other \nevidence they could obtain from the Public Ministry. While the data \nthey analyzed represented only a small fraction of what is known to \nexist, it included thousands of text messages that revealed a great \ndeal.\n  There is now little doubt about the identities of at least some of \nthe intellectual authors who conceived of and paid for the \nassassination of Berta Caceres; yet the Public Ministry has failed to \nact on this evidence, perhaps because it implicates DESA executives \nwith ties to officials in the Honduran Government.\n  As I said on October 31, 2017, when GAIPE released the report of its \ninvestigation:\n\n       [t]his damning report corroborates what many have \n     suspected--that the investigation of Berta Caceres' murder \n     has been plagued by incompetence, attempts to stonewall and \n     deflect blame to protect those who conceived of and paid for \n     this plot, and a glaring lack of political will. The Public \n     Ministry needs to fully disclose, without further delay, all \n     testimony and electronic and ballistics evidence to the \n     Caceres family's legal representatives and defendants' \n     lawyers, as required by law. The Ministry also needs to \n     ensure that every piece of evidence is properly safeguarded, \n     and to follow the evidence wherever it leads to arrest those \n     responsible. It is shameful that despite intense domestic and \n     international pressure, this horrific case has languished, \n     while those responsible have sought to derail it. And there \n     are hundreds of other Honduran social activists and \n     journalists who have been similarly threatened and killed, \n     whose cases have not even prompted investigations.\n\n  It is important to note that the GAIPE report indicates that the \nevidence not only implicates DESA executives and employees, as well as \nHonduran state agents, in the surveillance, spreading of false \ninformation, and plot to assassinate of Berta Caceres; the evidence \nalso reveals other crimes such as obstruction of justice, abuse of \nauthority, and unlawful association. The report documents the shocking \nextremes to which the company was willing to go, including murder for \nhire, in pursuit of its financial goals.\n  In addition to immediately disclosing the evidence to the Caceres \nfamily and others who are entitled to it under Honduran law, the Public \nMinistry should act on the petition of the Caceres family's legal \nrepresentatives to arrest the intellectual authors.\n  The Public Ministry should immediately ensure that all electronics \nand other evidence is adequately safeguarded to eliminate any risk of \ntampering. For whatever reason, much of the evidence is reportedly in \nthe possession of the National Directorate of Investigations and \nIntelligence, and given the history in Honduras of evidence \ndisappearing or being destroyed\n\n\nor stolen, and witnesses being intimidated and killed, securing the \nevidence in this case is imperative.\n  The Honduran Government should take whatever steps are necessary to \nprotect the leaders of COPINH, whose lives remain in jeopardy. The \ngovernment's past responses to requests for protection have ranged from \ninaction to ineffective.\n  The Agua Zarca concession and other hydro or extractive concessions \nthat were obtained without the consent of local people whose lives or \nterritory would be adversely affected should be cancelled. The Honduran \nGovernment needs to substantially reform the way it reviews and grants \nsuch concessions, which have too often been the product of corrupt \ndealings that resulted in environmental degradation, social unrest, and \nviolence.\n  The assassination of Berta Caceres, as outrageous and tragic as it \nwas, presented the Honduran Government with an opportunity to show that \njustice is possible in such cases and that even people who hold \npositions of economic or political privilege and power can be held \naccountable. Instead, we have witnessed more of the same--important \nevidence being mishandled and possibly even ignored and withheld from \nthose entitled to it. A partial investigation that resulted in the \narrest of those who reportedly carried out the crime, followed by \nmonths of silence without identifying those who were behind it. This is \nnot acceptable.\n  Over the past 2 years, President Hernandez and other top Honduran \nofficials have traveled to Washington to lobby for Honduras's share of \nU.S. funding for the Plan of the Alliance for Prosperity of the \nNorthern Triangle of Central America. Among other things, they have \nearnestly voiced their commitment to human rights and respect for civil \nsociety. They are going to find out that action, not words, are what \nmatter.\n  Over the past 2 years, the U.S. Congress has provided a total of $1.4 \nbillion to support the plan, of which a significant portion is for \nHonduras. I supported those funds because I recognize the immense \nchallenges that widespread poverty, corruption, drug trafficking, gang \nviolence, and impunity pose for those countries. These problems will \nnot be solved by building a wall along our southern border or deporting \ntens of thousands of Central Americans currently living in the United \nStates.\n  I mention this because the assassination of Berta Caceres brings U.S. \nsupport for the plan sharply into focus. Today that support is in \njeopardy.\n  It is why those responsible for her death and the killers of other \nHonduran social activists and journalists must be brought to justice.\n  It is why Agua Zarca and other such projects that do not have the \nsupport of the local population must be abandoned and replaced with an \ninclusive, transparent process that complies with international \nenvironmental and social safeguards.\n  It is why the Honduran Government must cease its attempts to \nundermine the work of the Mission to Support the Fight against \nCorruption and Impunity in Honduras, MACCIH, which has begun to \ninvestigate the link between the assassination of Berta Caceres and \ncorrupt dealings between DESA and Honduran state agents.\n  It is why the Honduran Government must finally take seriously its \nresponsibility to protect the rights of journalists, human rights \ndefenders, other social activists, COPINH, and civil society \norganizations that peacefully advocate for equitable economic \ndevelopment and access to justice.\n  Only then should we have confidence that the Honduran Government is a \npartner the United States can work with in addressing the needs and \nprotecting the rights of the Honduran people, particularly those who \nhave borne the brunt of official neglect, corruption, and violence for \nso many years.\n  Today any hope that the Honduran Government may have of continued \nU.S. assistance under the Plan of the Alliance for Prosperity will \nhinge in part on the outcome of the Caceres case, concrete actions that \ndemonstrate support for the legitimate role of civil society and the \nindependent media, and real reform of the justice system.\n  (At the request of Mr. Schumer, the following statement was ordered \nto be printed in the Record.)\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. LEAHY", "itemno": 0}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 1}], "header": {"chamber": "Senate", "num": "183", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "S7152-S7153", "wkday": "Thursday", "day": "9", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "HONDURAS", "id": "CREC-2017-11-09-pt1-PgS7152", "title": "HONDURAS"}
