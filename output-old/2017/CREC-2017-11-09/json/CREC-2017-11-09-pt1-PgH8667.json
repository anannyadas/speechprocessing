Mr. Speaker, each November, communities across the country \nobserve National Diabetes Awareness Month. We come together to educate \nour neighbors and to bring attention to the impact that diabetes has in \nthe lives of millions of Americans.\n  As a diabetic, I know the challenges faced by people with this \ncondition.\n  In 2015, diabetes was the seventh leading cause of death for \nAmericans, and diagnosis rates continue to grow each year.\n  To live a long and prosperous life with this disease, it is \nimperative that people with diabetes receive proper nutrition and \naccess to healthcare. Thanks to the Affordable Care Act, preexisting \nconditions such as diabetes are covered by health insurance. Thanks to \nSNAP, the poorest in our communities have access to nutrition.\n  ACA and SNAP are under attack, and as a member of the Diabetes Caucus \nand as your Representative in Congress, I will continue to vigorously \nprotect the ACA and fight to increase SNAP benefits for those in need.\n  My life is a living testament to the opportunities that exist when \ndiabetes is properly treated. We must ensure these opportunities are \navailable for the next generation.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Ms. ADAMS", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "183", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H8667", "wkday": "Thursday", "day": "9", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "NATIONAL DIABETES AWARENESS MONTH", "id": "CREC-2017-11-09-pt1-PgH8667", "title": "NATIONAL DIABETES AWARENESS MONTH"}
