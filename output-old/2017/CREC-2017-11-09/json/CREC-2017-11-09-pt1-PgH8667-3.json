Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Speaker, we know that, unfortunately, after 8 years of bad \neconomic policies from the Obama administration, working people did not \nreceive a pay increase. We know that we had one of the lowest labor \nparticipation rates in modern history. We know that the economy was \nlimping along at 1\\1/2\\ to 2 percent economic growth.\n  But, fortunately, Mr. Speaker, a new day has dawned and now, all of a \nsudden, we see that, with the policies of Republicans in Congress, with \nthe policies of the Trump administration, we are seeing promising \nsigns. What we are seeing all of a sudden now is 2 quarters, Mr. \nSpeaker, of 3-plus percent economic growth. This means a difference to \nworking families. They are finally seeing increases in their paychecks, \nincreases in their take-home pay.\n  That is why one of the most exciting policies that are being worked \nupon today that we hope to see soon is fundamental, pro-growth tax \nreform for the entire American economy; one that would grow our economy \nand that makes a Tax Code fairer, flatter, simpler, more competitive; \none that would lower rates for families and allow 90 percent of \nAmericans to fill out their forms on something akin to a postcard; \nsomething that would help our small businesses and entrepreneurs.\n  I look forward, Mr. Speaker, to having that legislation on the floor \nsoon. But we have legislation today that is also important to our small \nbusinesses and our entrepreneurs, H.R. 2201, by the gentleman from \nMinnesota.\n  What is so important about this legislation, Mr. Speaker, is that it \nwould allow our entrepreneurs and our small businesses to more \neffectively be able to reach out to family and friends to get the \nneeded capital to start their businesses.\n  A 2014 survey by the Kauffman Foundation found out that over 28 \npercent of startups raise their funding from their personal network. \nMr. Speaker, we have a challenge, and that is the Securities Act does \nnot clearly define what is a public offering or, conversely, a \nnonpublic offering. So this makes it very difficult for our early-stage \nentrepreneurial growth companies to go out and do any kind of private \nplacement to raise funds from friends and family.\n  Now, we know that a private placement is already something that is \nestablished in law. But what isn't established is a bright line, safe \nharbor for these business enterprises to go out and raise these funds.\n  So what we also know, unfortunately, from our Securities and Exchange \nCommission is that a registered offering is simply not economically\n\n\nfeasible for a small business, an entrepreneur, an issuer who is \nseeking to raise less than $1 million.\n  So too often, Mr. Speaker, we have a number of these enterprises \nthat, frankly, just never get jump-started because they don't have the \nopportunity for a private offering. That is why it is so important.\n  I want to thank the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Emmer) for his \nleadership in bringing this legislation to the House floor today.\n  So it is a simple piece of legislation. Again, it simply allows a \nbright line, safe harbor for very small offerings. It requires that \neach purchaser has a substantive preexisting relationship with an \nofficer, director, or shareholder of the issuer.\n  The issuer must reasonably believe that there are no more than 35 \npurchasers of the securities, and the aggregate amount of all \nsecurities sold by the issuer cannot exceed $500,000 in a 12-month \nperiod.\n  So, Mr. Speaker, we are talking about a very small portion of \nstartups, but a very vitally important section of our startups that \nneed capital.\n  Mr. Speaker, a few decades ago there was a company where a gentleman \nborrowed money from his father to import Japanese sports shoes, and he \npurchased 200 pairs of these Japanese sports shoes. He started a \nbusiness called Blue Ribbon Sports, and today we know it as Nike.\n  A few decades ago there was an investor out in Omaha, Nebraska, who \nborrowed money from seven friends and family members, including his \nsister Doris and Aunt Alice. Over the next 9 years, this initial \ninvestment grew, and this gentleman purchased something called \nBerkshire Hathaway, the textile company that has now led to the \nBerkshire Hathaway empire.\n  In 1994, there was a gentleman who took a loan from his parents, \nmoved to a two-bedroom, small apartment, and launched a company called \nAmazon.\n  We want to make sure that the next Berkshire Hathaway, the next \nAmazon get launched, and that is why it is so critical we enact H.R. \n2201.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.", "turn": 3, "speaker": "Mr. HENSARLING", "itemno": 10}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "W000187", "text": "  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such \ntime as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, H.R. 2201 would create an unnecessary and potentially \ndangerous loophole in Federal and State securities laws by allowing \ncompanies to sell unregistered securities without important safeguards \nthat normally apply to such transactions. Specifically, the bill would \nallow a company to raise up to $500,000 from 35 or fewer investors, \nsubject only to the requirement that each of these investors has a \nsubstantive preexisting relationship with the company.\n  Currently, before a company can offer or sell its securities, it must \neither register the offering with the Securities and Exchange \nCommission--that is the SEC--or qualify for at least one of several \nexisting exemptions from registration. These exemptions provide reduced \nregulatory requirements for businesses conducting the offerings, but \nare limited to investors who have the financial sophistication to \nunderstand the risks, or enough assets to bear losses without the full \nprotections of the securities laws.\n\n  Additionally, unlike H.R. 2201, these existing exemptions include \nseveral critical investor protections, such as notice to regulators, \nlimitations on advertising, and restrictions on resale. For example, \nsecurities offered pursuant to rule 506 of regulation D are restricted, \nmeaning they cannot be resold for at least a year without registering \nthem; that is, re-registering them.\n  Additionally, the re-registration exemptions available under the \ncrowdfunding rules and regulation A impose limitations on the amounts \nan individual can invest in a year, thereby placing a cap on potential \nlosses.\n  H.R. 2201's lack of basic safeguards would leave investors vulnerable \nto an array of investment scams. For example, a purchaser of securities \noffered pursuant to H.R. 2201 would be able to immediately resell the \nsecurities in secondary transactions. In the past, the failure to \nrestrict the resale of unregistered securities has exposed secondary \ninvestors to ``pump and dump'' schemes, a form of fraud that involves \nhyping up cheap junk stock in order to resell it at a higher price to \nunwitting investors.\n  Additionally, investor and consumer advocates, like Americans for \nFinancial Reform, Center for American Progress, and Public Citizen, \noppose H.R. 2201 because it would enable a particularly deceptive scam \nknown as ``affinity fraud.'' Bad actors perpetrating affinity fraud \ncould use H.R. 2201 to prey upon religious communities, ethnic groups, \nand the elderly.\n  Just a few years ago, the SEC shut down a scheme targeting the \nHispanic community in southern California. The perpetrators raised more \nthan $800,000 by representing to close friends and family members that \ntheir investment would be used to develop a financial services firm \nserving the Hispanic community.\n  The SEC found that, instead of developing the purported business, the \nscammers ``used a large part of the investors' money to engage \nunsuccessfully in high risk `day-trading' of stocks; pay personal \nliving, travel, and entertainment expenses; or make other unexplained \nexpenditures with no connection to the purported startup business \nactivities.''\n  H.R. 2201 would provide a roadmap for bad actors to similarly rip off \ninvestors. The bill's $500,000 cap on offerings does not eliminate the \nneed for robust safeguards against fraud and abuse. In fact, these \nprotections are even more important for offerings of this size, given \nthe proliferation of investment schemes in the smaller offering space.\n  The SEC has found that ``fraud in the micro cap stock markets is of \nincreasing concern to regulators, as such markets have proven to be \nfertile grounds for fraud and abuse.''\n  While $500,000 may not seem like a lot on Wall Street, for Main \nStreet Americans, losing even a fraction of that amount would destroy \nthe hope of one day retiring with dignity. Existing exemptions such as \nthose available under the SEC's regulation D, regulation A, and \ncrowdfunding rules provide ample opportunities for companies to raise \ncapital while also protecting investors.\n  H.R. 2201 would only expose hardworking Americans to a new and wholly \nunnecessary risk. For these reasons, I urge my colleagues to vote \n``no'' on H.R. 2201, and I reserve the balance of my time.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n", "turn": 4, "speaker": "Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California", "itemno": 11}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "H001036", "text": "  Mr. HENSARLING.

Mr. Speaker, while government isn't meant to create jobs, \nwith the help of the President, Congress can set Federal policies that \nestablish a pro-worker, pro-business environment that lifts people out \nof poverty, helps families, and drives our country forward.\n  One problem today that is impeding job growth is access to capital \nfor small businesses. American businessmen and -women are often unable \nto get the loans they need to start a new enterprise or to grow an \nexisting one.\n  Additionally, if a firm would like to publicly sell stock to raise \nmoney, it must register with the Securities and Exchange Commission, \nwhich costs $2.5 million, on average; an amount most small businesses \nsimply cannot afford.\n  Small and emerging businesses are a key to the economic engine in \nAmerica. The Small Business Administration found that these businesses \ncreate over half of the new jobs on an annual basis in this country. \nMore importantly, today's small businesses are tomorrow's success \nstory.\n  Just think of all the great businesses in this country that started \nwith a dream in a garage: Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, Disney, Harley-\nDavidson, and Minnesota's own Medtronic. We want to empower the \nentrepreneurs in this country to dream, innovate, and create jobs that \ngrow our economy.\n  That is why I introduced the Micro Offering Safe Harbor Act. This \nbill will make it easier for entrepreneurs and\n\n\nsmall businesses to raise money from family, friends, and their \npersonal network without running afoul of the vague and undefined \n``private offering'' safe harbor provisions in the Securities Act of \n1933.\n  Thus, the Micro Offering Safe Harbor Act helps bring clarity to \nexisting law so that our current and future job creators can easily \nraise capital within the confines of an easy-to-understand provision \nwithout the help of an expert.\n\n\n  This legislation requires three specific criteria to be met \nsimultaneously in order to trigger a safe harbor exemption for a \nsecurity offering instead of just one or more. These criteria ensure \nthat: one, each purchaser has a substantive preexisting relationship \nwith an owner; two, there are no more than 35 purchasers of securities \nfrom the issuer that are sold in reliance on the exemption during the \n12 months proceeding; and, three, the aggregate amount of all \nsecurities sold by the issuers does not exceed $500,000 during the 12-\nmonth period preceding the offering. The bill also exempts any of the \naforementioned security offerings from blue-sky laws, while maintaining \nantifraud provisions at the Federal and State level.\n  These provisions protect Americans from criminals trying to swindle \nthem out of their hard-earned money, while making capital more \naccessible to businesses by investors from around the country.\n  In fact, I will be offering an amendment to enhance these antifraud \nprovisions. This amendment, which incorporates the suggestions made by \nmy colleagues on the other side of the aisle during a legislative \nhearing in the last Congress, will ensure that individuals who have \nbeen disqualified under the ``bad actor'' disqualification standard, as \nis listed under current law, are prohibited from using the exemption \nprovided under H.R. 2201, establishing yet an additional layer of \ninvestor protection.\n  Entrepreneurs and small-business owners need access to capital in \norder to achieve the American Dream. Although small businesses \naccounted for 99.7 percent of all the businesses in the United States \nlast year, only half of them will survive longer than 5 years, \naccording to our Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n  Lack of capital or difficulty accessing capital is one of the main \ncauses of failure for many of these small businesses. A 2015 survey \nconducted by BlueVine found that 75 percent of small and emerging \nbusinessowners reported their primary source of funding comes from \ntheir own personal finances, followed by banks at 16 percent and family \nand friends at 6 percent.\n  While banks and credit unions do their best to offer the funding \nthese businesses need to grow and thrive, there are still 3 million \nfewer small business loans made annually, today, than there were before \nthe 2008 financial crisis. H.R. 2201 seeks to build off the success of \nthe Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, better known as the \nJOBS Act, and will continue to spur capital formation for the true job \ncreators and drivers of our country's economy.\n  The Micro Offering Safe Harbor Act helps small and emerging companies \nadd another tool to the toolkit, enabling them to confidently find \nalternative ways of raising these funds without having to pay for \ncostly securities experts and without the fear of lawsuits if they \noperate within these easy-to-understand parameters.\n  That is why the Micro Offering Safe Harbor Act is endorsed by the \nNational Small Business Association; the Small Business & \nEntrepreneurship Council; the National Federation of Independent \nBusiness; the Chamber of Commerce; Heritage Action; and Engine, ``The \nVoice of Startups in Government.''\n  The House approved an identical version of this legislation during \nthe 114th Congress as part of the Accelerating Access to Capital Act, \nand language similar to H.R. 2201 was included in the Financial CHOICE \nAct, which was adopted by this Chamber in June.", "turn": 8, "speaker": "Mr. EMMER", "itemno": 16}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Tom Emmer,\n     House of Representatives,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Representative Emmer: On behalf of the National Small \n     Business Association (NSBA), the nation's first small-\n     business advocacy organization, with more than 65,000 small-\n     business members representing every state and every industry \n     across the country, I commend your leadership for introducing \n     the Micro Offering Safe Harbor Act (H.R. 2201) as it will \n     have an immediate and direct impact on small businesses \n     looking to raise capital. NSBA has long supported the kind of \n     simplification this legislation would bring for small \n     businesses.\n       Capital is the lifeblood of any small business, and often \n     small-business owners need capital at various stages; some at \n     their startup and others later when they are looking to \n     expand. Despite this ongoing need, small-business lending \n     from banks has decreased over the last decade and many small \n     businesses have few options for obtaining capital. According \n     to NSBA's 2016 Year-End Economic Report, small-business \n     access to capital remains stubbornly unchanged since the \n     previous year, with just 69 percent of small firms reporting \n     they are able to get adequate financing. This drop has real-\n     world implications: 41 percent said lack of capital is \n     hindering their ability to grow their business or expand \n     operations, and 20 percent said they had to reduce the number \n     of employees as a result of tight credit.\n       Therefore, raising capital though securities is an \n     attractive alternative option for many small-business owners. \n     However, the current regulatory requirements are quite \n     onerous for small businesses, often requiring expensive \n     specialized counsel for even very small securities offerings.\n       NSBA supports this targeted legislation that creates a safe \n     harbor for small securities offerings which meet requirements \n     clearly identified in the legislation. Under the legislation, \n     these exemptions include offerings in which each purchaser \n     has a substantive pre-existing relationship with the owners, \n     where the issuer has less than 35 purchasers utilizing the \n     exemption in the preceding 12 month period, or where the \n     total amount raised during the preceding 12 month period is \n     less than $500,000. By creating three safe harbor exemptions \n     for ``non-public offerings,'' businesses can operate with \n     clarity and a clear conscience knowing that they would be \n     exempted from registering with the Securities and Exchange \n     Commission (SEC). Additionally, the legislation also exempts \n     transactions meeting the specified requirements from state \n     registration requirements, commonly referred to as ``blue sky \n     laws.''\n       Raising capital for small businesses from friends and \n     family already takes place on a regular basis, except those \n     transactions often lack the legal protections and structure \n     of securities law. In addition to expanding access to capital \n     for small businesses, this legislation will bring those \n     transactions under a recognized legal framework, and make \n     resolving disputes that arise much more efficient. Finally, \n     bringing these existing transactions under an existing legal \n     framework will provide a sound legal basis for subsequent \n     larger offerings requiring registration with the SEC.\n       Access to capital continues to be one of the most pressing \n     issues facing the small-business community. All small \n     businesses need an injection of capital at one point or \n     another, unfortunately in the past several years it has \n     become difficult for small businesses to get the funds they \n     need to grow and expand. NSBA is pleased to support the Micro \n     Offering Safe Harbor Act as it will help small businesses \n     around the country expand and create new jobs in their \n     communities.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Todd McCracken,\n     President & CEO.", "turn": 11, "speaker": "Mr. EMMER", "itemno": 19}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                                  ____\n\n                                                  Small Business &\n\n\n                                     Entrepreneurship Council,\n\n                                     Vienna, VA, October 10, 2017.\n     Hon.

Even for small securities \n     offerings, compliance and navigating the rules are very \n     expensive. H.R. 2201 is a needed solution that makes smart \n     changes to existing law, providing certainty and an effective \n     option for small businesses that need to raise capital.\n       H.R. 2201 would exempt from registration requirements with \n     the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) offerings made \n     only to the entrepreneur's friends and family, to less than \n     35 purchasers, and when $500,000 or less is raised. The \n     offering would be exempt from state registration and \n     qualification rules, thus reducing costs and complexity. H.R. \n     2201 would appropriately scale SEC rules and regulatory \n     compliance for our nation's small businesses, which in turn \n     will provide another practical option for entrepreneurs to \n     raise the capital they need to start or grow their firms.\n       The United States has much work to do when it comes to \n     fostering capital formation and encouraging investment and \n     entrepreneurship. The Micro Offering Safe Harbor Act is a \n     smart solution that will help many entrepreneurs successfully \n     start and grow their businesses.

Maxine Waters,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on Financial Services, House of \n         Representatives, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Hensarling and Ranking Member Waters: The \n     U.S. Chamber of Commerce strongly supports several bills the \n     Committee is scheduled to markup on October 11, 2017. The \n     Chamber appreciates the Committee's ongoing work to enhance \n     capital formation, hold regulators accountable, and reduce \n     red tape burdens upon American businesses and consumers. The \n     Chamber supports the following bills.\n       H.R. 477, the ``Small Business Mergers, Acquisitions, \n     Sales, and Brokerage Simplification Act of 2017,'' would \n     simplify Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) \n     registration requirements for certain mergers and \n     acquisitions (M&A) brokers who perform services related to \n     the transfer of ownership of smaller private companies. The \n     legislation properly balances regulatory relief for brokers \n     and businesses involved in such transactions with important \n     investor protections to prevent abuse. H.R. 477 would require \n     disclosure of relevant information to investors and would not \n     exempt M&A brokers from existing rules designed to prevent \n     those who violate the law from continuing to work in the \n     securities business.\n       H.R. 1116, the ``Taking Account of Institutions with Low \n     Operation Risk (TAILOR) Act of 2017,'' would direct federal \n     banking regulators to scale rulemakings in order to properly \n     reflect the various risk profiles of financial institutions. \n     One of the unfortunate developments in recent years has been \n     ``one size fits all'' regulation in the banking sector. This \n     legislation would ensure that community and regional \n     financial institutions are not forced to comply with \n     regulatory regimes more suited for global, interconnected \n     institutions.\n       H.R. 1585, the ``Fair Investment Opportunities for \n     Professional Experts Act,'' would expand the definition of \n     ``accredited investor'' under securities laws by allowing \n     those who can demonstrate relative education or work \n     expertise to invest in certain private offerings, regardless \n     of their income or net worth. In addition to providing Main \n     Street households with greater opportunities to build wealth, \n     H.R. 1585 would expand the pool of capital available to \n     private businesses.\n       H.R. 1645, the ``Fostering Innovation Act of 2017,'' would \n     extend the Sarbanes-Oxley 404(b) internal controls exemption \n     for certain emerging growth companies (EGCs) from five years \n     to ten. This change would prevent the premature phase out of \n     one of the more popular provisions of the 2012 Jumpstart our \n     Business Startups (``JOBS'') Act, and would provide a further \n     incentive for companies to enter public markets.\n       H.R. 2201, the ``Micro Offering Safe Harbor Act,'' would \n     provide a means for businesses to solicit and raise limited \n     amounts of capital without running afoul of securities laws. \n     Private businesses would be permitted to seek community-based \n     financing of up to $500,000 per year in order to expand or \n     hire new employees. Importantly, the bill includes a number \n     of robust investor protections that would help prevent fraud \n     and abuse in the market.\n       H.R. 2396, the ``Privacy Notification Technical \n     Clarification Act,'' would amend the 1999 Gramm-Leach-Bliley \n     Act by clarifying that financial institutions are only \n     required to send customers annual privacy notifications if \n     there have been changes in the institution's privacy \n     policies. It also clarifies that such notices need not be \n     physically provided to a customer if they are made available \n     online at the customer's request. These provisions would save \n     costs for consumers and mitigate confusion related to privacy \n     notices.\n       H.R. 2706, the ``Financial Institution Customer Protection \n     Act of 2017,'' would help prevent another ``Operation \n     Chokepoint'' by prohibiting federal agencies from directing a \n     financial institution to terminate an account without a \n     material, documented reason for doing so. This bill would \n     ensure that agencies do not unjustifiably discriminate \n     against certain industries. The bill would also clarify \n     liability under the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, \n     and Enforcement Act. A House investigation of Operation Choke \n     Point revealed the Obama administration Department Of Justice \n     had radically and inappropriately reinterpreted the law.\n       H.R. 3299, the ``Protecting Consumers Access to Credit Act \n     of 2017,'' would codify the ``valid-when-made'' doctrine, \n     which states that the characteristics of a loan are valid at \n     origination, and are not unenforceable when assigned to \n     another party. The recent Second Circuit decision in the \n     Madden vs. Midland Funding, LLC case has undermined this \n     doctrine and threatens to impose a chilling effect on credit \n     markets nationwide. H.R. 3299 would restore the longstanding \n     ``valid-when-made'' legal principle and protect consumers and \n     businesses that rely on robust credit markets.\n       H.R. 3312, the ``Systemic Risk Designation Improvement Act \n     of 2017,'' would replace Dodd-Frank's arbitrary asset \n     threshold for labeling a bank ``systemically important'' with \n     a multi-factor, tailored assessment that considers size, \n     interconnectedness, substitutability, complexity, and cross-\n     jurisdictional. Mid-size and regionals banks do not generate \n     systemic risk and are critical to small business lending. By \n     tailoring regulation and rejecting a one-size-fits-all \n     approach, H.R. 3312 would promote Main Street access to \n     credit and unlock economic growth.\n       H.R. 3857, the ``Protecting Advice for Small Savers (PASS) \n     Act of 2017,'' would repeal the misguided ``fiduciary rule'' \n     issued by the Department of Labor (DOL) in 2016. The DOL rule \n     was built upon a fundamentally flawed and theoretical \n     analysis that has been refuted by real life experience. A \n     recent Chamber survey demonstrated the harm that DOL's rule \n     is already inflicting upon investors, and we have long called \n     for the SEC to assert its jurisdiction regarding standards of \n     conduct for broker-dealers and investment advisers. H.R. 3857 \n     would rightly direct SEC to craft a rulemaking under the \n     securities laws to protect investors and preserve access to \n     investment choice.\n       H.R. 3903, the ``Encouraging Public Offerings Act of \n     2017,'' would allow any company--regardless of size or EGC \n     status--to take advantage of the popular provisions under \n     Title I of the 2012 JOBS Act, which include allowing \n     investors to submit confidential draft registration \n     statements with the SEC and to ``test the waters'' before \n     filing an IPO. Title I of the JOBS Act has proven to be a \n     true policy success, and Congress and the SEC should continue \n     to explore how more companies can take advantage of its \n     provisions.\n       H.R. 3911, the ``Risk-Based Credit Examinations Act of \n     2017,'' would authorize the SEC to utilize `risk-based' \n     examinations of Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating \n     Organizations (NRSROs), which would allow the SEC to focus \n     its limited resources and prioritize its examination agenda, \n     while reducing unnecessary compliance burdens on regulated \n     entities.\n       H.R. 3948, the ``Protection of Source Code Act,'' would \n     amend the Securities Act of 1933 to require that the SEC \n     actually issue a subpoena before requiring a person or entity \n     to produce trading ``source code.'' Source code is the \n     intellectual property of certain market participants, and \n     there is no reason for the SEC to put into place a broad \n     collection mechanism for such sensitive information. This \n     legislation is necessary after past attempts by the Commodity \n     Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) to collect source code \n     without a subpoena.\n       H.R. 3972, the ``Family Office Technical Correction Act of \n     2017,'' would provide certainty for ``family offices'' \n     defined under securities laws by clarifying that such offices \n     are accredited investors. This bill would preserve the \n     ability of family offices to invest in certain private \n     offerings and help them remain an important source of capital \n     for growing businesses.\n       H.R. 3973, the ``Market Data Protection Act of 2017,'' \n     would delay any reporting to the consolidated audit trail \n     (CAT) until the SEC, Financial Industry Regulatory Authority \n     (FINRA), and CAT operators develop sufficient cybersecurity \n     protocols to protect the information that is set to be \n     collected under the CAT. Recent cyberattacks have \n     demonstrated that vulnerabilities exist within our capital \n     markets, and H.R. 3973 would help safeguard the personal and \n     sensitive information of market participants. The SEC should \n     also explore alternatives to using personally-identifiable \n     information as part of its data collection efforts under the ", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 21}, {"kind": "title", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "     CAT.\n       Collectively, these bills would modernize capital markets, \n     preserve consumer choice and access to credit, and require \n     more transparency and accountability of the federal financial \n     regulators.

Maxine Waters,\n     Ranking Member, House Committee on Financial Services, House \n         of Representatives, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Hensarling and Ranking Member Waters: On \n     behalf of Engine and our community of startups, \n     entrepreneurs, investors, and innovators, I write to express \n     support for several bills scheduled for consideration before \n     the House Committee on Financial Services tomorrow. \n     Specifically, Engine reiterates its support for H.R. 2201, \n     the ``Micro Offering Safe Harbor Act,'' which will facilitate \n     capital access for promising startups.\n       Engine is a nonprofit and advocacy group that supports \n     high-growth, high-tech startups through research, advocacy, \n     and policy analysis. We work to foster and promote forward-\n     looking government policies and a regulatory environment in \n     which entrepreneurs can launch innovative, new companies that \n     grow and thrive. Through conversations with diverse startups \n     across the country, we know that capital access remains a top \n     challenge in getting a business off the ground.\n       A large portion of startups rely on small, nonpublic \n     offerings (also known as a ``private placements''), such as a \n     ``friends and family'' round, to raise seed capital. In fact, \n     a 2014 survey by the Kauffman Foundation found that over 28 \n     percent of startups raised some amount of funding from their \n     personal network. However, the Securities Act does not \n     clearly define what constitutes a public offering, or \n     conversely, a nonpublic offering, making it easy for early \n     stage companies to unintentionally run afoul of the law when \n     doing a private placement.\n       H.R. 2201 would create three bright line safe harbor \n     exemptions for non-public offerings. Under the legislation, \n     offerings would be exempt from registration with the \n     Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) if each purchaser \n     has a substantive pre-existing relationship with the issuer, \n     there are 35 or fewer purchasers, or the amount being raised \n     does not exceed $500,000. These exemptions would bring much \n     needed clarity for startups and ensure that a company doing a \n     small, private placement is not forced to complete burdensome \n     paperwork or spend precious resources on an expensive lawyer \n     in order to comply with ambiguous regulatory requirements.\n       Finally, H.R. 2201 would exempt these micro-offerings from \n     state blue sky registration and qualification laws, \n     decreasing the regulatory complexity for startups doing a \n     small raise.\n       Engine appreciates the Committee's consideration of this \n     bill and its continued work on capital access issues for \n     emerging firms. We look forward to further engagement with \n     the bills' sponsors and Committee members on these important \n     issues.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Evan Engstrom,\n                                               Executive Director.\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 24}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "W000187", "text": "  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California.

Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.\n  I want to begin, Mr. Speaker, by responding to the gentleman from \nTexas, who began this debate by saying how this was a continuation of \nan ongoing effort by Republicans to promote progrowth tax reform in \nparticular.\n  I want to be very clear, Mr. Speaker. The proposal that is currently \nbefore this House with respect to the tax changes is a tax scam. It is \nnot a tax plan. It is a scam. It gives $1.5 trillion in tax cuts to the \nwealthiest Americans, the biggest corporations, and the millionaires \nand billionaires. It increases taxes on tens of millions of middle \nclass families. It pays for this big gift back to corporations and \nbillionaires and millionaires by deep cuts in Medicare, Medicaid, \ninfrastructure spending, education--the things that actually create \njobs.\n  It creates additional incentives to ship American jobs overseas, \ncreates incentives for American companies to take jobs here and ship \nthem overseas, not to keep them here in our own country. It is another \nmaybe more robust example of trickle-down economics. It has failed \nbefore. It will fail again.\n  The American people might have the benefit of understanding this more \ncompletely if there were actually a process where this was debated, \nwitnesses testified, and experts came in to talk about the implications \nof this. But this is being done in the dark of night, at the speed of \nlight so the American people won't find out what is about to happen to \nthem. So the idea of describing this as progrowth in this context, both \nwith the provisions and the process, seems, to me, laughable.\n  Let me just give the American people a couple of examples:\n  It denies individuals the right to deduct State and local taxes but \npreserves that right for corporations;\n  It denies the worker who is forced to leave his home and move because \nhis employer is moving--either do that or he loses his job--from \ndeducting the cost of moving, but it preserves the right of a company \nwho is offshoring jobs overseas to take a deduction for the cost of \nmoving those American jobs overseas.\n  Those are just two examples. So this isn't a progrowth tax policy. \nThis is trickle-down economics designed to let the people at the very \ntop hold onto more of their money and corporations to keep more of \ntheir profits in the hope that it will trickle down to the rest of the \nAmerican people.\n  It doesn't work. It doesn't represent a progrowth tax policy. It is a \ntax scam, and so I want to just correct the record, Mr. Speaker, with \nall due respect to the gentleman from Texas.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise, in addition to that, to express my strong \nopposition to H.R. 2201, the Micro Offering Safe Harbor Act.\n  In light of the devastating 2008 financial crisis and the regulatory \nweaknesses revealed by the Wells Fargo and Equifax scandals, we should \nbe considering legislation that will bolster consumer and investor \nprotections; but today, instead, we are considering H.R. 2201, which \nwill enable abusive financial practices.\n  Generally, a company that seeks to make public offerings must \nregister them with the Securities and Exchange Commission or must fit \ninto one of several exceptions that are designed to balance investor \nprotections with regulatory burdens on smaller companies. This \nlegislation would allow so-called microcap offerings, offerings valued \nat $500,000 or less in a single year to be sold to 35 or fewer \ninvestors, subject only to the requirement that each investor have a \nsubstantive preexisting relationship with the company.\n  Despite the similarity of these provisions to some restrictions \ncurrently imposed on unregistered security offerings, H.R. 2201 omits \nseveral critical investor protections that are characteristic of \nexisting exemptions. In particular, microcap offerings would be exempt \nfrom important regulatory protections set up in the 1933 Securities \nAct, including registration, disclosure, and fraud protections.\n  Oversight in the smaller offering space such as the one proposed in \nH.R. 2201 is important because the SEC has found fraud in the microcap \nstock markets is of increasing concern to regulators, as such markets \nhave proven to be fertile grounds for fraud and abuse.\n  Without core protections, H.R. 2201 would leave investors vulnerable \nto an array of investment scams and abuses, with unsophisticated \ninvestors particularly at risk. For example, the bill has no \nrestriction on resale. In the past, failure to restrict the resale of \nunregistered securities has exposed secondary investors to fraudulent \npump-and-dump schemes, as the gentlewoman from California mentioned.\n  Additionally, groups like Americans for Financial Reform, Center for \nAmerican Progress, and Public Citizen oppose H.R. 2201 because it would \nenable a type of investment scam known as affinity fraud. In these \nschemes, scam artists prey upon members of identifiable groups, such as \nethnic or religious communities or the elderly, often by enlisting \nrespected community or religious members to help convince victims that \na dubious investment is legitimate. The proliferation of affinity fraud \nin low-income communities demonstrates that H.R. 2201's preexisting \nrelationship requirement would not provide safeguards against such \nabuse.\n\n\n  Given existing exemptions for smaller companies would provide ample \nopportunity for companies to raise capital while also protecting \ninvestors, H.R. 2201 is, at best, unnecessary. This bill would simply \ncreate a loophole that undermines protections against the kind of \nfinancial abuses and recklessness that we have already seen damage our \nfinancial system and hurt people.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose H.R. 2201.\n  I thank the gentlewoman again for yielding.", "turn": 13, "speaker": "Mr. CICILLINE", "itemno": 26}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "H001036", "text": "  Mr. HENSARLING.

Nothing in it impacts the SEC's ability to \npursue civil actions against issuers who engage in fraud under section \n17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933. It is just a red herring.

I also want to thank the gentleman from \nMinnesota (Mr. Emmer) for taking a lead on this important legislation.\n  As an elected official, I have the opportunity to interact with \nindividuals across my district who strive to create new or expand \nexisting small businesses. These are folks who work hard to provide for \ntheir families and serve as the backbones of their communities.\n  Unfortunately, for many entrepreneurs, overregulation has stifled \ntheir ability to innovate and grow. The National Federation of \nIndependent Business published a recent study showing that 30 percent \nof small business respondents cited taxes, regulations, and red tape as \ntheir most significant business problem.\n  While certain sectors are reaping the benefits of a strong economy, \nthe reality is that startups and small businesses are sitting on the \nsidelines with limited access to credit. It is something I hear about \nfrom businessmen and -women every single day, be they bankers, \nretailers, farmers, doctors, and every profession in between.\n  We also know that many startups and businesses have historically \nturned to local financial institutions for initial financing. In the \nyears after passage of Dodd-Frank, small bank lending is down \ndramatically, leaving many commercial customers scrambling to find \nother forms of reasonably priced financing.\n  Across the board, we are enabling a burdensome system that penalizes \nentrepreneurship. We need to reverse course if we want to see a \nresurgence of small business creation and growth.\n  H.R. 2201 is commonsense legislation that seeks to reverse one \nimpediment to entrepreneurship. Mr. Emmer's bill offers a thoughtful \napproach to a problem that has hindered and, in some cases, prevented \nsmall offerings across the Nation. It will appropriately scale Federal \nrules and regulatory compliance and will allow small businesses to \naccess the capital necessary for growth.\n  More specifically, this legislation will exempt certain nonpublic \nmicro offerings from the SEC requirements. The bill features guardrails \nthat allow for investor protection and subjects any and all exempted \nmicro offerings to the full suite of Federal and State antifraud laws.\n  The result will be a less burdensome regulation that stifles \ninnovation and increases access to capital for startups and small \nbusinesses that comply with the parameters included in the bill. This \nbill is about Main Street, about the small-business men and women in \neach of our districts.\n  Mr. Speaker, I want to again thank and applaud the gentleman from \nMinnesota for his hard work on this legislation, and I ask my \ncolleagues to join me in voting in favor of the legislation.", "turn": 15, "speaker": "Mr. LUETKEMEYER", "itemno": 28}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "W000187", "text": "  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California.

Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such \ntime as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, we have laid out this morning exactly how vulnerable \ngroups and individuals can be taken advantage of with legislation like \nthis. I don't know exactly where this legislation originated, but I can \nalmost guarantee you that we are creating opportunities for individuals \nwho don't have the best interest of our constituents at heart to \nliterally get small groups together, 35, I guess, or less, and sell \nthem on ideas where they are raising funds that probably will not \nresult in profits as expected by those who are investing in these \nschemes.\n\n\n  No, there are no protections. There is no notice. The SEC will not \nknow when and where these schemes are arising. So I would say to my \ncolleagues on the opposite side of the aisle: When are we going to act \nas if we have the best interests of our constituents at heart? When are \nwe going to be about protecting consumers rather than opening up \nopportunities for them to be the victims of fraud?\n  We have fraudulent schemes that are directed at the most vulnerable \npeople. I know where those people who are organizing these schemes will \ngo. They will go to our churches where well-meaning ministers and \nparishioners will be taken advantage of.\n  In these vulnerable communities that are always taken advantage of, \nwe have people who are the victims of payday loans where they are \npaying 400 percent for moneys that they are borrowing when they are \ndesperate in between paychecks. We have rent-to-own schemes. We have \nall kinds of schemes where these convenience stores, in places where we \nhave food deserts, are charging extremely high prices for food that is \nbasically being sold for regular, ordinary, good prices in other \ncommunities.\n  In some communities, even in California, the gas taxes are rising. We \nhave the rental market that is going off the scale all over this \ncountry with people not being able to afford a decent lease or a decent \nrental space, and so here we are just opening up another opportunity \nfor folks to be ripped off.\n  It is going to happen; I can guarantee you that. When you have \nsomething like this that is passed by the Congress of the United \nStates, it is going to be taken advantage of, and the way that this is \nconstructed, it almost begs to be taken advantage of.\n  So do you know what happens when this kind of thing takes place and \nMembers of Congress put their reputations on passing this kind of \nlegislation? When the rip-offs start and people are harmed a few years \nlater, then they are going to come back with legislation talking about \nhow they are correcting the fraud and the rip-offs that we caused in \nthe first place.\n  When is this going to stop? We have a Consumer Financial Protection \nBureau that is struggling every day to protect our consumers. Prior to \nDodd-Frank, we had our oversight agencies with the responsibility of \nprotecting consumers, but they didn't have any real protection. So \nDodd-Frank reforms helped to create opportunities for Members of \nCongress to be able to protect their consumers and not to be involved \nin these kinds of schemes.\n  But the opposite side of the aisle has spent an inordinate amount of \ntime trying to kill off the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and \nthey have done it in so many ways. Not only do they come up with \namendments time and time again to try and shut down the Consumer \nFinancial Protection Bureau, they treat the Director of the Consumer \nFinancial Protection Bureau so badly that they almost deny him the \nopportunity to come before our committee and to be heard.\n  So I don't know whose side legislators are on who create this kind of \ncrap. I don't understand why it is deemed to be important to open up \nthe opportunity for schemes and to not give the SEC the ability to know \nwhen they are getting started, to have the\n\n\nkind of disclosures, and to have the kind of oversight that would \nprotect the most vulnerable people in our society.\n  Mr. Speaker, yes, this legislation will probably pass today. The \nRepublicans have the majority votes in this Congress, and I suppose \nthey are going to get all of their people to vote for this bill that is \ngoing to rip off some of their constituents, and, again, we won't be \nable to stop it because, again, they have the majority votes.\n  But I want the people of this country to know and understand what is \nhappening, who is doing it to them, and why they are having a difficult \ntime. At a time when the rental market is going off the scale and they \ncan't afford to pay the first and the last month's rent to get into a \nplace, I want them to know who is creating the difficulties in their \nlives when their jobs have not increased their pay, they are still \ntrying to have a decent quality of life for their families, despite the \nfact that the pay does not match the job that they are doing, and they \nhaven't had the pay increases.\n  When are we going to show that we stand up for the least of these? \nWhen your churches get ripped off--and we are working on some of those \nschemes now where, even with the responsibilities that the SEC has, we \nhave people who are getting ripped off, and here we come with another \npiece of legislation. Then what we do is we shade it in terms of this \nis for small business development. Then we hear from the opposite side \nabout all the other companies who started as little-bitty companies in \ntheir garage. Well, they all started without this bill. They didn't \nneed this bill to start.\n  So why are you doing this? Yeah, you are right; there are a lot of \ncompanies, and you have named them, particularly in the high tech \nindustries that started, and they had some of their own money to get \nstarted with, and maybe the family helped them, I don't know, but they \ndidn't have this legislation. They didn't need this legislation. Nobody \nneeds this legislation.\n  This legislation is harmful, and I would ask my colleagues to vote \nagainst the bill. If there are any Members on the opposite side of the \naisle who really are concerned about their constituents, I would ask \nthem to defy their leadership and vote against this bill.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.", "turn": 18, "speaker": "Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California", "itemno": 31}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "H001036", "text": "  Mr. HENSARLING.

Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such \ntime as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, by allowing entities to sell unregistered securities \nbased solely on a preexisting relationship with the investor, H.R. 2201 \nwould create a road map for affinity fraud.\n  Affinity fraud is a type of investment scam where swindlers prey upon \nmembers of identifiable groups such as ethnic or religious communities \nor the elderly. Often, affinity fraudsters take advantage of \npreexisting relationships to engender trust and convince victims that a \ndubious investment is legitimate.\n  The Securities and Exchange Commission has found that such frauds \npose heightened risks to investors because they can be difficult for \nregulators or law enforcement officials to detect, particularly where \nthe fraudsters have used respected community or religious leaders to \nconvince others to join the investment.\n  The following cases represent a sampling of recent affinity fraud \nactions from around the United States.\n  In August, 2013, the SEC halted an offering fraud scheme where Steven \nBruce Heinz, a Utah resident purporting to be an investment adviser, \nsold phony investment contracts to more than 15 of his former clients, \nfamily members, and friends. According to the SEC's complaint, Heinz \nraised $4 million in investor funds he used to engage in high-risk \ntrading of future contracts and to pay his own personal expenses such \nas family vacations to Mexico and a $600,000 loan.\n  Among the investors taken in by Heinz scam was ``the recent widow of \na church associate of Heinz who invested with Heinz after he \nvolunteered to assist her with her finances and investments after her \nspouse died.''\n  In 2012, the SEC stopped a $7.5 million fraud operation targeting the \nPersian-Jewish community in Los Angeles. The SEC's assistant regional \ndirector stated that Shervin Neman ``deceived members of his own \ncommunity to raise money in this fraudulent Ponzi scheme. By exploiting \ninvestors' trust in him, Neman was continually able to raise more money \nto pay back existing investors and finance an extravagant lifestyle.''\n  According to the SEC's complaint, among other things, Neman spent \ninvestor funds to pay for his wedding and honeymoon, his wife's \nengagement ring, luxury cars, and VIP tickets to entertainment venues.\n  In 2015, the SEC permanently barred John Allan Russell from the \nsecurities industry after Russell pled guilty to securities fraud in \nColorado State court. The SEC's administrative law judge found that \nRussell obtained almost $300,000 by selling debt securities to an \nelderly victim who suffered from dementia and Alzheimer's disease. The \nALJ also determined that ``Russell's scheme may have involved affinity \nfraud because the misconduct began a few years after the victim acted \nas Russell's godfather at his baptism.''\n  These cases demonstrate that H.R. 2201's preexisting relationship \nrequirement would not provide any meaningful deterrent against abuse. \nOn the contrary, it would encourage opportunistic conduct targeting \ncommunities.\n\n\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in voting ``no'' for \nthis bill.\n  Given all that the SEC is able to do, they can't keep up with these \nschemes, and now you are going to open up the door for them to have to \nwrestle with trying to help people who are victims of these kinds of \nschemes.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.", "turn": 21, "speaker": "Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California", "itemno": 34}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "H001036", "text": "  Mr. HENSARLING.

Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such \ntime as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, the North American Securities Administrators Association \nsent this letter of concern. They said that H.R. 2201 would result in \nan overly broad Federal exemption that would allow public solicitation \nand sales to any investor, regardless of sophistication or financial \nwherewithal, subject only to the requirement that there be a previously \nexisting relationship, a standard that is not difficult to establish.\n  In practical terms, this means that Main Street investors could be \nsolicited and sold up to $500,000 in private security by bad actors, \nincluding persons having been convicted of crimes or subject to one or \nmore previous State enforcement actions, without any disclosure to the \ninvestor and without any notice to State or Federal regulators.\n  There is no valid basis for Congress to prevent State officials \ncharged with protecting their constituents from making decisions about \npurely local or regional issues that would rely on the exemption \nestablished by H.R. 2201.\n  Further, preemption of State review or even notification for the type \nof small, localized offerings contemplated by H.R. 2201 would \neffectively handcuff the regulators best positioned to oversee such \nofferings.\n  Public Citizen said this bill ``would permit small offerings with no \ninvestor protections, such as notice of the offerings.

Paul Ryan,\n     Speaker, House of Representatives,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Nancy Pelosi,\n     Democratic Leader, House of Representatives,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Speaker Ryan and Leader Pelosi: On behalf of the North \n     American Securities Administrators Association (``NASAA''), I \n     write to express concern and raise specific objections to \n     certain provisions of H.R. 2201, The Micro-Offering Safe \n     Harbor Act, which is scheduled to be considered by the House \n     of Representatives this week. The legislation would amend \n     securities laws in ways that could be profoundly detrimental \n     to investors, and detract from the viability of the \n     marketplace for offerings from new or smaller issuers that \n     are compliant with securities law.\n       The Micro-Offering Safe Harbor Act amends Section 4 of the \n     Securities Act of 1933 to create a new exemption from \n     registration. To qualify for the exemption, an offering would \n     have to meet certain criteria regarding the number of \n     purchasers, their relationship to the issuer, and the amount \n     of capital raised. However, as more fully discussed below, \n     the legislation fails to include critical investor protection \n     measures and would preempt state regulatory authority.\n       State securities regulators understand the need of small \n     businesses to efficiently raise capital and the role strong \n     investor protection plays in facilitating this goal. \n     Unfortunately, the changes embodied in H.R. 2201, while well \n     intended, are ill-advised and potentially quite dangerous. \n     For example, unregistered securities purchased under the \n     exemption established by H.R. 2201 would not be \n     ``restricted,'' and could thus be sold immediately, exposing \n     investors to classic ``pump and dump'' schemes. Furthermore, \n     NASAA is aware of no evidence to support the proposition that \n     Congress should create a ``safe harbor'' to permit \n     unregistered securities offerings to be offered and sold, \n     including through general solicitation, regardless of \n     investor sophistication or financial wherewithal. Even as the \n     bill stands to introduce new and totally unnecessary risk \n     into securities markets--failing to even disqualify ``bad \n     actors'' from these markets--the goal of the legislation \n     remains unclear and its necessity is, at best, not well-\n     established. It is clear, however, from the terms of the \n     exemption, and its failure to impose even the modicum of \n     regulatory oversight that exists for similar ``private'' \n     offerings under SEC Regulation D Rule 506, that offerings \n     made under the new exemption are likely to be \n     disproportionately risky and illiquid. This fact alone should \n     be cause for concern by Congress.\n       Beyond stark new risks to investors, this legislation \n     threatens to jeopardize the continued viability of \n     established markets geared to smaller issuers, many of which \n     operate lawfully within existing federal and state securities \n     laws. Such markets include securities sold pursuant to SEC \n     Rule 506, new federal exemptions established by the JOBS Act, \n     and exemptions adopted in many states to permit intrastate \n     crowdfunding. Without effective investor protection measures \n     a potential effect of H.R. 2201 could be to cause investors \n     to abandon the markets for smaller issues.\n       In closing, NASAA reiterates strong opposition to the \n     preemption of state registration and notice filing authority \n     in H.R. 2201. There is no valid basis for Congress to prevent \n     states from making decisions about the local or regional \n     issues that H.R. 2201 seeks to encourage. Failure to register \n     or at the very least, to notice file with state regulators \n     results in unknown sales, by unknown actors of unknown \n     enterprises and result in no gatekeeper function to protect \n     retail investors whose only source of recourse for fraudulent \n     sales are the state securities regulators. At a minimum H.R. \n     2201 should:\n       1) Include bad actor disqualifications;\n       2) Establish a holding period to reduce the likelihood of \n     ``pump and dump'' schemes;\n       3) Provide at least a notice filing with state regulators \n     so that in the event of a fraudulent offering, state \n     regulators can begin an investigation to try and protect \n     retail investors;\n       4) Limit the sale amount to retail investors so that \n     investors are not ``encouraged'' to place all their eggs in \n     one basket; and\n       5) Prohibit or restrict general solicitation of what are \n     clearly high risk securities.\n       Thank you for your consideration of NASAA's views.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Joseph P. Borg,\n                                       NASAA President and Alabama\n                                              Securities Director.\n\n", "turn": 24, "speaker": "Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California", "itemno": 37}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                                  ____\n                                               Public Citizen,\n\n                                                 November 7, 2017.\n     Hon.

HR 2201 will be considered under \n     regular order.\n\n\n           H.R. 2148, Clarifying Commercial Real Estate Loans\n\n       This bill would reduce the capital requirements for High \n     Volatility Commercial Real Estate (HVCRE). During the recent \n     financial crisis, this sector caused major losses, especially \n     at smaller banks. The U.S. Government Accountability Office \n     (GAO) found that failures of small banks ``were largely \n     driven by credit losses on commercial real estate (CRE) \n     loans, particularly loans secured by real estate to finance \n     land development and construction.'' Further, this sector has \n     grown rapidly in recent years, raising further concerns about \n     prudential lending standards. We must assure that this type \n     of lending remains properly capitalized to prevent against \n     failures that could become economic contagions.\n\n\n               H.R. 2201, Micro Offering Safe Harbor Act\n\n       This bill removes basic protections from offering \n     securities provided that the purchasers have a preexisting \n     relationship with an officer, director, or shareholder with \n     10 percent or more of the shares of the issuer, and the \n     aggregate amount of all securities sold by the issuer does \n     not exceed $500,000 during a 12-month period. This would \n     permit small offerings with no investor protections, such as \n     a notice of the offering. It will enable a type of affinity \n     fraud, where the seller can unload dubious securities \n     provided there is some relationship between seller and \n     purchaser. The bill assumes that a pre-existing relationship \n     will deter abuse, which is a tenuous foundation, at best. \n     Further, the relationship can begin with the offer. The bill \n     says the relationship must only exist before the purchase. \n     Finally, the bill pre-empts state regulatory oversight. \n     Removing supervisors closest to potential problems is unwise \n     and leaves small investors exposed to exploitation.\n\n\n         H.R. 3911, Risk-Based Credit Examinations Act of 2017\n\n       This bill would allow the Securities and Exchange \n     Commission (SEC's) Office of Credit Ratings (OCR) to reduce \n     its oversight of nationally recognized statistical rating \n     organizations (NRSROs), also known as credit rating agencies. \n     Credit rating agencies essentially sold their high marks to \n     large banks that were securitizing loans, a major factor \n     leading to the financial crash of 2008. In response to the \n     inflated credit ratings for otherwise toxic securitizations, \n     Congress mandated creation of the OCR and directed it to \n     conduct annual examinations of each NRSRO and make its \n     reports public. It must examine eight areas: (i) whether the \n     NRSRO conducts business in accordance with its policies, \n     procedures, and rating methodologies; (ii) the management of \n     conflicts of interest by the NRSRO; (iii) the implementation \n     of ethics policies by the NRSRO; (iv) the internal \n     supervisory controls of the NRSRO; (v) the governance of the \n     NRSRO; (vi) the activities of the Designated Compliance \n     Officer (DCO) of the NRSRO; (vii) the processing of \n     complaints by the NRSRO; and (viii) the policies of the NRSRO \n     governing the post-employment activities of its former \n     personnel. This bill would allow the SEC to reduce these \n     categories of inspection to save staff resources. The answer \n     is not to reduce inspections, but to increase the funding for \n     the SEC.\n       These bills fail to advance investor interests or the \n     safety of the market.

This \n     legislation would allow micro offerings to be sold to \n     financially unsophisticated and lower income investors, \n     provided only that the investors have a ``pre-existing \n     relationship'' with an officer, director, or major \n     shareholder of the issuer. These conditions alone do not \n     represent any protection for investors, nor do they guarantee \n     access to minimum essential information to evaluate a private \n     offering and make an informed decision about it.\n       H.R. 2201 would dismantle the protections afforded to \n     small-dollar-amount investors by the Securities Act of 1933. \n     Those protections include some minimal disclosures, \n     transparency standards, and access to the information \n     necessary to evaluate potentially risky and illiquid private \n     offerings. The legislation would also eliminate restrictions \n     on rapid sale of the securities, exposing investors in the \n     small offerings market to potential ``pump and dump'' \n     schemes.\n       As the state securities administrators (NASAA) point out in \n     their opposition letter to this bill, H.R. 2201 also \n     obstructs primary regulators by preempting state regulatory \n     authorities. This legislation does not include any: limits on \n     purchaser sophistication (e.g. the securities could be sold \n     to non-accredited investors), measures to prevent offerings \n     by bad actors, restrictions on secondary sales, or \n     prohibition on general solicitation.

Common sense is \nnot to place vulnerable people in a position where they are going to \nget ripped off.\n  Mr. Speaker, H.R. 2201 is a harmful bill that would simply serve as \nan invitation for investment scams.

Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.\n  Mr. Speaker, as always, I listen very carefully to my friend, the \nranking member. I know that she started off her closing remarks by \nsaying: We don't need this bill, H.R. 2201, because the big banks can \nloan to the small businesses.\n  Well, that is fascinating to me, Mr. Speaker, because of the Dodd-\nFrank Act, which she so jealously supports, all of a sudden, the risk-\nbased capital standards say that the banks have to reserve more for \nsmall business loans than they do for sovereign debt and municipal \ndebt.\n  So all of a sudden, it is because of Dodd-Frank. In addition, we know \nthat the ranking member supports the Federal Reserve policy of paying \ninterest on excess reserves where the Federal Reserve takes taxpayer \nmoney to pay the big banks not to loan money. So if the ranking member \nwas curious why the big banks aren't loaning to the small businesses, \nwhich they aren't--and prior to the Trump administration, we know that \nsmall business lending by banks was at a 25-year low--it is the very \nreason, Mr. Speaker, that we need the bill, the legislation of the \ngentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Emmer) so that we can unlock this.\n  Again, there is no surprise why, after 8 years of Obamanomics and the \nthinking from my friends on the other side of the aisle, small \nbusinesses have languished and why the economy has dropped down to a \n1\\1/2\\ to 2 percent GDP growth. In fact, I think President Obama is one \nof the few Presidents in American history never to enjoy a year of 3 \npercent economic growth.\n  Now, he may personally have enjoyed it, but the American people \ndidn't, Mr. Speaker. But the good news is that there is a change in \nadministration and a change of attitude. That is why it is so important \nthat we be able to get capital to our entrepreneurs, to our small \nbusinesses. Let them thrive again on Main Street.\n  We hear so often the ranking member decry Wall Street. We are talking \nabout offerings of a half a million dollars. No on in Wall Street would \ntouch that with a 10-foot pole. This is about Main Street, not Wall \nStreet, Mr. Speaker.\n  It is interesting, as I listen to my friend, the ranking member, \ndecry the fact that someone might be able to raise capital under this \nparticular set of circumstances. Well, I have a news flash for all my \ncolleagues. Already the SEC can grant a private offering for exactly \nthe set of circumstances that my friend, the gentleman from Minnesota, \nputs into his bill. All the gentleman is doing is creating a bright \nline, safe harbor, so that the next Nike or the next Amazon isn't \nstopped from launching their enterprise by having to spend a million \ndollars on lawyers and accountants trying to navigate this uncertain \nmurky labyrinth of SEC waters trying to determine what is a private \noffering and what is a public offering. That is all he is doing.\n  Again, this is already legal. It simply is discretionary to decide \nwhat is a private offering and what is a public offering by the \nSecurities and Exchange Commission.\n  We now, Mr. Speaker, have had two quarters of 3-plus percent economic \ngrowth. We are seeing working Americans. We are seeing their paychecks \nincrease yet again. We are seeing hope and resilience in the American \nDream yet again, but we have so much more work to do, and that is why \nH.R. 2201 is so critical.\n  It takes small businesses today to be the big businesses of tomorrow. \nThey are the creators. They are the job engine of America. They are the \ndrivers of increased paychecks, greater economic opportunity, and a \nbigger, bolder American Dream.
