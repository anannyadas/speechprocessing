Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to an \neducator par excellence, university administrator, trailblazer and \ncommunity servant, Dr. Jacqueline Bolden Beck, who died on Tuesday, \nOctober 31, 2017, at the age of 86.\n  Dr. Beck was born and raised in Gulfport, Mississippi. After \ncompleting her high school education, she went on to Dullard University \nwhere she graduated as an honor student receiving a Bachelor of Science \ndegree in Nursing in 1955. She continued her education at the Indiana \nUniversity, where she received her Master of Science degree in Nursing \nin 1958. Later, Dr. Beck would complete her Ph.D. studies at the \nUniversity of Florida earning a Doctorate of Education in Curriculum \nand Instruction in 1976.\n  Dr. Beck and her late husband, Dr. James Beck who she married in \n1957, both joined the faculty at Florida A&M University (FAMU) in 1958. \nShe rose quickly through the faculty ranks, first as an instructor, \nthen Assistant Professor, followed by Associate Professor and Acting \nDean of the School of Nursing.\n  In 1978, FAMU's former president, Walter L. Smith, Ph.D., entrusted \nBeck with developing the proposal that led to the creation of the \nSchool of Allied Health Sciences in 1982. Beck served as the founding \ndean of the School of Allied Health Sciences until 2000.\n  During her time as Dean, the School of Allied Health Sciences \nreceived more than $13 million in extramural funding from Federal, \nState, and local agencies. The school evolved from two divisions, the \nDivision of Medical Records Administration and Physical Therapy to five \ndivisions, offering bachelor's degrees in cardiopulmonary science, \nhealthcare management, health information management, occupational \ntherapy and physical therapy and a master's in physical therapy by \n2000. Additionally, the school's programs were all accredited by their \nrespective accrediting bodies and were sought after by students from \nacross the country.\n  Upon her retirement as Dean, Dr. Beck was appointed to the rank of \nProfessor Emeritus. To commemorate her many contributions and \ndedication to the University, in 2007, the building that houses FAMU's \nAllied Health Sciences programs (Lewis-Beck Building) was named in her \nhonor along with the late nursing school dean Margaret Lewis, Ph.D.\n  She served on numerous boards and commissions including the Pew \nHealth Professions Commission, Board of Directors of ASAHP, Board \nMember of the National Society of Allied Health, College of Health \nDeans Group, Board of the National Society of Allied Health Journal and \nas a member of the State-Wide Allied Health Articulation Task Force, \nappointed by the Florida Commissioner of Education.\n  Dr. Beck was the recipient of the Cultural Pluralism Award by the \nAssociation of School of Allied Health Professions and in 2005, she was \nawarded the Honorary Doctorate of Humane Letters from the State \nUniversity of New York, Down State. Dr. Beck was also very active in \nthe Tallahassee community where she served in many organizations and on \nthe boards of numerous community service groups.\n  Throughout the ensuing decades of her life and career, she fashioned \na powerful place in higher education and influenced the thinking of \ngenerations of young people. Driven by an enormous heart and keen \nintellect, Dr. Beck worked her entire life to give the opportunity of \neducation to young people who had the will to cease it.\n  Mr. Speaker, with an unwavering dedication, strong values, and an \navid pursuit of ``leveling the playing field'' in higher education, Dr. \nBeck made a tremendous impact in her community, the state of Florida, \nand the nation. We must honor her life and legacy by keeping hers a \ntorch kept lit.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. LAWSON of Florida", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 3}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "183", "extension": true, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "E1543", "wkday": "Thursday", "day": "9", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "IN MEMORY OF DR.
