Mr. President, this has been another important week \nhere in the Senate. We are moving forward on multiple aspects of the \nPresident's agenda.\n  Later today, the Senate Finance Committee will release its plan for \ntax reform. I will have more to say on this in a moment, but I would \nonce again like to commend Chairman Hatch for his leadership to get us \nto this point.\n  The Senate is also focusing on confirming the President's nominees so \nthey can finally get to work. We have built strong momentum from last \nweek, when we confirmed four circuit court nominees. This week we have \nconfirmed nominees for the Department of Defense, the Department of \nJustice, and the National Labor Relations Board.\n  Soon we will also confirm the head of a critical office at the EPA. \nWilliam Wehrum will put his experience to good use as Assistant \nAdministrator for the EPA's Office of Air and Radiation. This office is \none of the EPA's most important but, unfortunately, under the Obama \nadministration, was also among the offices with the most significant \noverreach. Obviously it was in desperate need of new leadership from \nsomeone who understands how to implement clean air policies in a \nbalanced way. That is William Wehrum. I look forward to advancing his \nnomination shortly.\n  Confirming President Trump's talented nominees to the Federal \nGovernment will continue to be a priority of this Senate, and I look \nforward to working with my colleagues to get this done.\n\n\n                               Tax Reform\n\n  Now on another matter, Mr. President, today Chairman Hatch will lay \nout his legislative proposal for tax reform. It is the product of a lot \nof hard work, dozens of hearings, and member input, and I look forward \nto its release later today.\n  The release of this plan is another critical step toward providing \nrelief to the middle class. Once it is unveiled,\n\n\nthe proposal will go through regular order in the committee. Senators \non both sides will have the opportunity to offer amendments and work \ntogether to help hard-working families all across our country.\n  This is our once-in-a-generation opportunity to lower taxes and shift \nthe economy into high gear. In fact, tax reform represents the single \nmost important thing we can do to spur growth and to help American \nfamilies. With this tax reform plan, the American people will know that \nrelief is on the way. For you and your family, we want to make taxes \nlower, simpler, and fairer. For small businesses, we want to make it \neasier to navigate the Tax Code, grow, and hire workers. And for all \nbusinesses, we want to make it an easy decision for them to bring \ninvestment and jobs home and to keep them here.\n  As the Finance Committee continues to work on tax reform, both \nRepublicans and Democrats will have the chance to offer their own ideas \nto make the bill better. I certainly hope they take it. The process \nisn't behind closed doors; it is out in the open for everyone to see \nand for everyone to take part.\n  The House Ways and Means Committee is expected to finish their work \non their legislative proposal soon. Under Chairman Brady's leadership, \nthey have put a lot of good work into this.\n  I look forward to continuing to work with colleagues in both the \nHouse and the Senate, along with President Trump and his team, on our \nmutual tax reform goals. Our main goal is this--this is what it is all \nabout--we want to take more money out of Washington's pockets and put \nmore money in the pockets of the middle class.\n  In addition to the great work being done by Chairman Hatch in the \nFinance Committee, the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, \nunder the leadership of Chairman Murkowski, is taking important steps \nas well. The recent budget resolution gave the committee instructions \nto generate $1 billion of new revenue for the Federal Government. The \ncommittee has now unveiled legislation to do just that by further \ndeveloping the oil and gas potential in Alaska in an environmentally \nresponsible way. Their good efforts can produce important benefits to \nboth the people of Alaska and to our entire country. I commend Chairman \nMurkowski for her efforts to support our Nation's energy security. This \nplan is a limited, responsible effort that can result in new jobs, a \nstrong source of energy, and a boost to our economy, all while being \nresponsible stewards of Alaska's environment. I look forward to the \ncommittee reporting this legislation next week as well.\n  The Senate has many important items before it.

Mr. President, later today the Senate Republicans will \nrelease their version of the tax bill. The bill will not include a \nsingle idea of Democrats in the Senate. Not a single Democrat has had \nany input into this bill. It was constructed entirely behind closed \ndoors by the majority party, who have no intention of negotiating with \nDemocrats because they locked themselves into a partisan process that \nonly requires a majority vote.\n  They are trying to rush it through this Chamber with reckless speed. \nWhy? Because my friends on the other side know that the longer their \nbill is out there for the public to see, the less the public likes it. \nTheir only hopes of passing it are to rush it through before anyone can \ngrapple with the stunning hypocrisy at the center of their plan.\n  The Republican majority has repeatedly promised a middle-class tax \nbill, but instead, they have concocted a bill grounded in tax cuts for \nbig corporations and the very rich. They actually hurt middle-class \npeople because they need to give those big breaks for the wealthiest.\n  While promising that their plan gives ``everyone a tax cut''--that is \nwhat Speaker Ryan said again today--multiple independent analyses \nconclude that the House Republican tax plan would increase taxes on \nmillions of middle-class families, contrary to what Republicans \npromised and what Donald Trump has promised. They said: No middle-class \npeople will get an increase. This is aimed at helping the middle class.\n  But the vast majority of the help goes to the wealthiest and biggest \ncorporations. A New York Times analysis found that next year the House \nRepublican plan would cause taxes to go up on one-third of all middle-\nclass families. By 2026 taxes will go up on nearly half of all middle-\nclass families.\n  So even if you come from a State with a lower tax rate--a red State--\nit is probably a good bet that a quarter of the middle-class families \nwill get a tax increase. I think the lowest I saw was 17 percent for \nWest Virginia.\n  So this hurts middle-class people, and it hurts certain middle-class \npeople much more than others--people who have student loans, people who \nhave high medical expenses, people who come from States where there are \nlarge property taxes, people who have big mortgages. These are middle-\nclass people. They should not get a tax increase.\n  Mark Mazer, director of the independent Tax Policy Center, said:\n\n       You could create a plan that just cuts taxes for middle-\n     class people. That's not what this is.\n\n  That is him, not me. It is what Republicans promised people.\n  Now, we will see what the Senate comes up with today. But several \nRepublican Senators have already confirmed that the Senate bill has the \nsame structure as the House bill, and, in at least one way, we know it \nis worse for middle-class families than the House bill because the \nHouse bill will reduce the value of State and local deductions by 70 \npercent, while the Senate bill eliminates it entirely. My friend from \nOhio, Senator Portman, confirmed that a few days ago on FOX Business.\n  This should be a three-alarm fire for every House Republican in \nCalifornia, New York, New Jersey, Virginia, Washington, Illinois, \nColorado, and Minnesota. Senate Republicans are telling House \nRepublicans there will be no compromise on State and local \ndeductibility. It is full repeal or bust because Senate Republicans \nneed the revenue raised by ending this popular middle-class deduction.\n  There are several deficit hawks in the Senate. We have stricter \nbudget rules for reconciliation. If the Senate tax plan includes cuts \nto the corporate rate, the pass-through rate, and on upper tax \nbrackets--which dramatically increase the deficit--they will need the \nrevenue from the full repeal of State and local to make the numbers \nwork.\n  So I say to every one of my Republican colleagues in the House who \ncomes from a suburban district: This bill could be your political doom. \nDon't let the special interests, don't let the party leadership push \nyou into doing something that is bad for so many of your constituents. \nYou will pay a price.\n  House Republicans should kill the bill now if they want to have any \nhope of stopping the full repeal of the State and local deduction. They \ncan't hide behind the so-called compromise in the House bill. It is \nnothing more than a temporary fig leaf for full and permanent repeal.\n  As I said, if House Republicans don't kill it now, it will come back \nto haunt them. The overwhelming Democratic turnout in suburban \ndistricts in Virginia, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania should send shivers \ndown the spine of House Republicans who represent those districts. \nVoting to repeal the State and local deduction--walloping the middle-\nclass and upper middle-class suburbs--would be political suicide, all \nthis to bow down to the special big interests of large corporations.\n  Even with the compromise, the House numbers are devastating. \nRepresentative MacArthur said he was shown information that shows the \ncompromise is good for his district, and he went from a no to a \n``leans'' yes, according to POLITICO.\n  Representative MacArthur, go look at the real numbers.\n\n\n  Forty-three percent of taxpayers in Representative MacArthur's \ndistrict take the State and local deduction, for an average of $11,987 \nper deduction. Over half of the value of these deductions is not the \nproperty tax at all. It is State and local income taxes, which will be \ntaken away under the plan.\n  Then, according to IRS data, there are a good number for whom the \nproperty taxes are over $10,000, meaning the compromise still wouldn't \nhelp them. So I would not, if I were Representative MacArthur, listen \nto the numbers the Republican leadership is giving him. I would do my \nown independent analysis because I believe he would find them to be a \nlot worse than what the leadership is telling him.\n  I say to my other Republican colleagues: Don't fall for those quick \nnumbers. Go do your own looking at this. It is a lot worse than your \nleadership is telling you.\n  One final point here on taxes, for some reason the conventional \nwisdom on the Republican side is that because of the stunning depth of \ntheir losses in the recent elections, there is even a greater need to \npass the tax plan. We have to do this or we will fall apart, they said. \nIt makes no sense. They are misreading the public.\n  Ed Gillespie, for all of his divisive ads, also ran a traditional \nestablishment campaign. The linchpin of his campaign was the $1,000 tax \ncut for everybody. It got him nowhere. Exit polls from the Virginia \nelection showed that the No. 1 issue on voters' minds was healthcare, \nand they voted overwhelmingly Democratic. Yet, amazingly, Republicans \nmay repeal the individual mandate as part of their tax bill. How do \nthey think that is going to fly?\n  Despite the spin from Republican leaders, passing this plan will not \nhelp Republicans climb out of the hole they are in. It will bury them \ndeeper. Maybe if they pass the bill, they will not say they are in \ndisarray for the moment, but already this bill has had a miserable \nrollout. You know that when a party rolls out their No. 1 legislative \nplan, there should be trumpets and bands, but the public knows already \nthat the bill favors the wealthy. The public knows that middle-class \npeople get a tax increase.\n  So at best, the rollout of this bill has been mixed. I would say it \nhas been negative, and the American people agree because many more \npeople are against this bill than are for it, according to all of the \npolls. Passing a partisan tax plan that favors the wealthy and raises \ntaxes on millions of middle-class and upper middle-class families in \nthe suburbs is no political cure. It is political poison.\n  The real way to win back the esteem of the American people would be \nto put partisanship aside, put a giant tax cut for the wealthy on the \nshelf, and come work with Democrats on real bipartisan reform.\n  Mr. President, I would also like to just announce my strong \nopposition to Mr. Wehrum to the EPA's Office of Air and Radiation.\n  While working in senior roles at the Office during the Bush \nadministration, Mr. Wehrum led the efforts to weaken clean air \nprotections. During his tenure, courts ruled that the Agency violated \nthe Clean Air Act 30 times. Mr. Wehrum represented industry clients \nagainst the EPA 31 times since 2008.\n  He does not deserve to be in this position. Anyone who cares about \nthe lungs of their children should not want Mr. Wehrum in that \nposition. I hope we will get some bipartisan support to reject this \nreally awful nomination.\n  I yield the floor.", "turn": 6, "speaker": "Mr. SCHUMER", "itemno": 10}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Delaware.", "turn": 7, "speaker": "The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore", "itemno": 11}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "C000174", "text": "  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I want to continue to share with our \ncolleagues the reasons I oppose the nomination of Bill Wehrum to be \nEPA's Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation. Throughout his \ncareer, Mr. Wehrum has clearly shown he is dismissive of the science \nthat is the core of EPA's actions to protect public health. Nothing \nduring this confirmation process has convinced me that Mr. Wehrum's \napproach will change going forward.\n  I have said this before, and I will say it again because it makes Mr. \nWehrum's priorities clear, our courts have overturned regulations that \nMr. Wehrum helped craft while at EPA a staggering 27 times. That is 27 \ntimes that the courts determined the rules Mr. Wehrum put in place did \nnot follow the law or did not adequately protect public safety--27 \ntimes.\n  In one of those instances, the courts faulted EPA's lack of action to \nreduce mercury and toxic air pollution emissions from electric \npowerplants.\n  I have worked on controlling mercury pollution since I became a \nMember of this body 17 years ago, so I would like to spend some time \ntalking about this issue, mercury.\n  Much of our country's ongoing efforts to clean up air pollution hinge \non making sure every State plays by the rules and does their fair share \nto reduce air pollution. That includes dangerous toxic pollution like \nmercury. Toxic air pollution gets into the air we breathe, gets into \nthe food we eat, builds up in our bodies without our knowledge and can \nlead to cancer, to mental impairment, and even to death.\n  Unfortunately, Mr. Wehrum has spent much of his career fighting to \ndismantle the Federal environmental protections on which any State--my \nState, your State, so many other States--depends in order to clean up \ntoxic air pollution.\n  Twenty-seven is also the number of years ago that President George \nHerbert Walker Bush signed the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 into \nlaw. Nearly three decades ago, Congress had enough scientific data to \nknow that mercury and other air toxics, such as lead and arsenic, were \nhazardous air pollutants that harmed people's health and, as a result, \nshould be regulated by the EPA.\n  The lawmakers--including myself--who sent the Clean Air Act \nAmendments of 1990 to the desk of a Republican President thought that \nthe Nation's largest emitters of mercury and air toxics would soon be \nrequired to do their part and clean up. Unfortunately, it took 22 \nadditional years for the EPA to issue the Mercury and Air Toxic Rule, \nwhich finally, 5 years ago, called for reducing mercury and other air \ntoxics from coal-fired plants, our Nation's largest source of mercury \nemissions.\n  The EPA modeled the rule after successful steps that States across \nour country had already taken. The Agency required coal plants to \ninstall existing affordable technology that could reduce mercury and \ntoxic emissions by 90 percent.\n  Today our Nation's power utilities are meeting the mercury and air \ntoxics standards--they are meeting it--and electricity prices have not \ngone up; they have gone down. Some of you might find that hard to \nbelieve, but it is true. They have actually gone down.\n  You might ask why it took the EPA 22 years to address our Nation's \nlargest source of mercury and air toxics emissions. That is a fair \nquestion. The answer, in part, is that Mr. Wehrum was working at the \nEPA and had the responsibility to assume this life-enhancing--if not \nlifesaving--task, a responsibility, sadly, he largely chose to ignore.\n  In the early 2000s, under Mr. Wehrum's leadership, the EPA decided to \ntake a detour when it came to regulating mercury and air toxics from \npowerplants. Mr. Wehrum refused to follow the recommendation from the \nNational Academy of Sciences and instead reversed an earlier EPA \ndecision. He determined it was neither appropriate nor necessary to \nregulate powerplants under the air toxics section of the Clean Air Act. \nInstead, he chose a different path, helping to write a rule allowing \npowerplants to pollute more and for a longer time under a mercury cap-\nand-trade program.\n  In his push to make regulations on mercury emissions less protective, \nMr. Wehrum promulgated a rule that industry not only supported but \nhelped to write. In January 2004, the Washington Post reported that \nlanguage written for industry by Mr. Wehrum's old law firm--Latham & \nWatkins--appeared word for word in the proposed rule published in the \nFederal Register--word for word.\n  The story reported that ``a side-by-side comparison of one of the \nthree proposed rules and the memorandums prepared by Latham & Watkins \nshows that at least a dozen paragraphs were lifted, sometimes verbatim, \nfrom the industry suggestions.''\n  After Mr. Wehrum's mercury rule was finalized, the Federal courts \nfound that EPA had exaggerated the rule's benefits and, as a result, \nthe rule was\n\n\noverturned. In fact, the EPA lost so badly that the deciding judge said \nthat under the leadership of Mr. Wehrum, the Agency deployed ``the \nlogic of the Queen of Hearts, substituting the EPA's desires for the \nplain text of the law.''\n  So EPA had to start all over again because Mr. Wehrum ignored science \nand deferred to industry. What makes that delay process so egregious is \nthat our Nation's children were exposed to toxic air emissions from \npowerplants for an additional decade for no good reason.\n  In 2011, the Obama administration finally issued a new rule--the \nmercury and air toxic standard rule--that protects our children, \nprotects our health, and protects our lakes and our rivers. What is \nmore, industry is easily able to meet the rule's targets, and our \nNation is already seeing the benefits, but these health benefits do not \nseem to matter to Mr. Wehrum, who is still fighting for delays in \nmercury and air toxic emission reductions.\n  In fact, while representing his industry clients, he has supported a \nlawsuit against the mercury and air toxic rule. Under his leadership, \nMr. Wehrum's law firm has been arguing that it is not ``appropriate and \nnecessary'' for the EPA to regulate mercury and other air toxic \nemissions. Not appropriate and necessary? That is what he says.\n  When I asked Mr. Wehrum about his time at the EPA and his work to \ndelay mercury regulations, he was elusive. He seemed to have a \nselective memory with respect to the actions he did or did not take \nwhen he last served at the EPA.\n  When I asked him if he would commit not to weaken the mercury and air \ntoxic rule if confirmed, he basically refused to answer. However, to \nhis colleagues, he is very clear regarding his thoughts on the mercury \nand air toxic rule. In a trade press article published just 1 year ago, \nMr. Wehrum said: ``From our perspective, it's a regulation that made no \nsense and wasn't justified.''\n  Mr. Wehrum believes there is no justification for EPA to regulate the \nlargest source of mercury and air toxic pollution--pollution that \npediatricians tell us damage children's brains and could affect up to \n600,000 newborns every year--600,000 newborns every year.\n  Mr. Wehrum believes there is no justification for EPA to regulate the \nlargest source of mercury and air toxics pollution--pollution that \nsettles in our lakes, our rivers, streams, accumulates in our fish, and \nmakes them too dangerous to eat.\n  Mr. Wehrum believes there is no justification for EPA to regulate the \nlargest source of mercury and air toxics pollution, even though power \ncompanies have already bought, paid for, and installed the control \ntechnology on all powerplants without hiking electricity rates.\n  This information should be quite concerning to all of us, to all of \nour colleagues--I don't care where we come from--especially those who \nhave supported the mercury and air toxic rule, as many of us have.\n  If confirmed, Mr. Wehrum would be part of the review of the mercury \nand air toxic rule that Mr. Pruitt promises to undertake. Think about \nthat.\n  This is just one of the many clear examples in which Mr. Wehrum \ncontinues to support polluters over science and doctors, even going so \nfar as to give polluters the pen to write the regulations they would \nhave to follow. Unfortunately, there are many more.\n  Mr. Wehrum also spearheaded regulations when he was last at EPA that \nweakened air protections for national parks. The courts threw out those \nefforts to weaken the so-called regional haze rule, compelling the \nObama administration to clean up his mess and provide this protection \nfor iconic parks like the Grand Canyon and the Great Smoky Mountains \nNational Park because, again, Mr. Wehrum did not follow science or the \nlaw.\n  Nonetheless, Mr. Wehrum continues to pursue ongoing litigation \nagainst EPA's efforts to reduce national park pollution. Last year, Mr. \nWehrum declared in an article: ``EPA used the regional haze programs to \nimpose very stringent, and from our perspective, unwarranted emissions \nrequirements.''\n  Mr. Wehrum also has a long history of ignoring climate change science \nand the laws that regulate carbon emissions. While at the EPA, Mr. \nWehrum was critical of the Agency's decision to deny the State of \nCalifornia a waiver to impose stricter vehicle standards to reduce \ngreenhouse gas emissions as well as costs for consumers. Mr. Wehrum \npersonally pushed for this action against recommendations of the career \nstaff who did not believe the George W. Bush administration political \nappointee had a legal basis to deny California's request.\n  I am here today to remind Mr. Wehrum and all those who continue to \ndelay action to control greenhouse gas emissions under the premise that \nmore information about how the climate is changing or whether or not \nhuman beings are exacerbating the effects of climate change--the facts \nare in. The science is clear.\n  Even if he doesn't want to believe the numbers and the data--Mr. \nWehrum lives in Delaware, as do I. We run races together, sometimes \nride the same trains back and forth between Wilmington and Washington. \nHowever, in the State in which we both reside, for us, the effects of \nclimate change are evident. In our State, we are the Nation's lowest \nlying State. Parts of our State are sinking while at the same time the \nwaters are rising along our shores.\n  By his own admission, while at the EPA, Mr. Wehrum provided support \nto the government litigation team in a famous case: Massachusetts v. \nEPA. That team argued that greenhouse gases are not pollutants that \ncould be regulated under the Clean Air Act. It is not just me who \ndisagreed with Mr. Wehrum in this instance, the Supreme Court of the \nUnited States disagreed as well.\n  Unfortunately, Mr. Wehrum's views on climate change seem to be the \nsame as they were 15 years ago. Despite the Supreme Court's ruling in \nMassachusetts v. EPA, which affirmed EPA's authority to regulate \ngreenhouse gases under the Clean Air Act, Mr. Wehrum insisted in 2013 \nthat he ``continues to believe, that Congress never intended the EPA to \naddress an issue such as climate change under the Clean Air Act.''\n  In his nomination hearing before the EPW Committee, Mr. Wehrum \nclaimed that the climate is changing, but much is unknown--much is \nunknown--about why and how fast those changes are occurring.\n  I could go on for a while, as you can imagine, but suffice it to say, \nthese views of Mr. Wehrum are not just curious, they are dangerous. \nThey are dangerous. Ignoring environmental health science just because \nyou would rather not put protections in place hurts all of us in the \nend but especially the most vulnerable among us. Mr. Wehrum's time at \nEPA is at odds with the public health mission of that Agency.\n  All of the failed regulations Mr. Wehrum worked on created greater \nuncertainty for business and left the lives of the most vulnerable \npopulations at risk.\n  I would like to close by reflecting on why I think today's vote is so \nimportant. My wife Martha and I go to a Presbyterian Church in \nWilmington most Sundays. Earlier this year, on an especially lovely \nspring morning--a morning I had gone out for a run--we joined our \ncongregation in singing a number of hymns, and one of them began with \nthese words:\n\n     For the beauty of the Earth,\n     For the glory of the skies,\n     For the love which from our birth\n     Over and around us lies,\n     Lord of all, to Thee we raise\n     This our hymn of grateful praise.\n\n  It is a powerful passage, and we should let these words really and \ntruly resonate, especially on this morning.\n  Scripture reminds us repeatedly to love our neighbors as ourselves. \nWe know that and call that the Golden Rule. It appears in every major \nreligion in the world--I don't care if you are Christian, Jewish, \nMuslim, Hindu, Buddhist. I don't care what your faith is, there is a \nGolden Rule in your Sacred Scriptures. In our faith, we call it the \nGolden Rule.\n\n  Also found in those pages is another sacred obligation that we are to \nserve as stewards of this planet to which we have been entrusted, and \nwe have a moral obligation to do so. I know a great many of our \ncolleagues here in the Senate agree that we have a responsibility to \ncare for the world around us and the people who live in it. Most \nAmericans believe that. We all have an obligation to protect the health \nof our children and our families\n\n\nand the world in which we live. We have an obligation to ensure that we \nhave clean air to breathe--perhaps the most basic, most important right \nof all. For me, this is not only my responsibility as a parent and as \nan official elected to serve the people of Delaware; it is a moral \nimperative, a moral calling.\n  Americans deserve EPA leaders who believe in sound science. Americans \nneed EPA leaders who will listen to the medical experts when it comes \nto our health and who will be able to strike a balance that ensures \nboth a cleaner environment and a stronger economy--something we have \ndone for the past 27 years since the adoption of the Clean Air Act \nAmendments of 1990.\n  Moving forward with this nominee and thus allowing him to execute his \nextreme agenda once again at the EPA, especially when we have seen how \npoorly he handled that authority before, would be, in my mind, simply \nirresponsible. I do not believe Mr. Wehrum is the right fit for this \nposition. I encourage my colleagues, Democrat and Republican, to vote \nno on his nomination to be EPA's Assistant Administrator for Air.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that prior to the vote on \nconfirmation on the Wehrum nomination, there be an additional 2 minutes \nof debate, equally divided.", "turn": 8, "speaker": "Mr. CARPER", "itemno": 12}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Strange).

He is another conflict-ridden, climate-dismissing \nTrump nominee who has made a career of putting corporate profits ahead \nof hard-working families who depend on the EPA to have their backs.\n  Some of my Republican colleagues have argued that Mr. Wehrum has \nextensive experience serving at the EPA under the Bush administration, \nand that is true. Let's take a look at his experience. Mr. Wehrum \nfought to keep States from setting their own higher vehicle emissions \nstandards in order to try to keep the air cleaner. He played a key role \nin the Bush administration's insistence that the EPA has no \nresponsibility to combat climate change--a view that the Supreme Court \nrejected in 2007 in Massachusetts v. EPA. When the Bush EPA was \nrequired by law to propose a rule limiting mercury emissions from \npowerplants, Mr. Wehrum's influence helped tilt the rule to benefit big \ncoal. In fact, several paragraphs of the proposed rule were lifted \nverbatim from memos provided by the same pro-coal lobbying firm that \nMr. Wehrum had worked at before joining the EPA.\n  The egregious inadequacy of the proposed rule and its blatant \ndisregard for rulemaking processes led to 8 years of unnecessary delay \nin limiting toxic mercury emissions. There were 8 additional years of \nan estimated 130,000 asthma attacks, 8 years of 11,000 premature \ndeaths--all potentially avoidable if Mr. Wehrum and his colleagues had \njust listened to the science and made the protection of human life more \nimportant than the protection of corporate interests.\n  During his tenure at the EPA, looking out for big corporate polluters \nwas standard practice for Mr. Wehrum. In 27 separate cases--27 cases--\nFederal courts found that the regulations that Mr. Wehrum helped write \ncontradicted or violated the Clean Air Act and failed to protect public \nhealth.\n  Mr. Wehrum has a lot of experience--the weak-kneed experience of \nsomeone kissing up to big corporate interests.\n  In reflecting on his time at the EPA, Mr. Wehrum said: ``I'm a much \nbetter lawyer now than when I first joined the agency. To really get to \nknow how the agency works and how it ticks, I think that is very \nvaluable.''\n  Yes, valuable, sure, but valuable for whom? Valuable for small towns \nacross America that desperately need more champions fighting in their \ncorner? Valuable for our coastal communities and farmers dealing with \nthe tangible effects of climate change? No. He meant valuable for his \nown bank account.\n  Mr. Wehrum describes his time working at the EPA as being ``very \nvaluable'' because it allowed him to ``be effective in generating \nbusiness and clients.''\n  I guess he thinks this latest trip through the revolving door will be \neven better for helping him drum up business from future polluters.\n  And why wouldn't he? Since leaving the EPA in 2007, Mr. Wehrum has \nbeen one of the go-to lawyers for big corporate polluters looking to \nget off easy or to save a buck at the public's expense. In at least 31 \nlawsuits against the EPA, Mr. Wehrum has fought to diminish Federal \nclimate policy, to roll back limits on toxic mercury emissions, and to \nundermine public health protections. From what I can tell, not once has \nhe chosen to use his valuable experience at the EPA to fight for \nstronger clean air protections that benefit our children and our \nseniors who suffer the most from toxic emissions.\n  When deciding whether someone is qualified for public service, sure, \nexperience matters. But it matters who you fight for--whether it is a \nlawyer before the courts or as a senior appointee in the \nadministration. It matters whether you have a demonstrated commitment \nto serving the public interest or the narrow corporate interests of \nrich companies.\n  Mr. Wehrum is not a person who fights for the moms and dads who know \nthe terror of a child having an asthma attack. He is not a person who \nfights for the low-income and often minority communities that are \nliterally choking under a cloud of industry toxins. He is not a person \nwho fights for our communities that are suffering from the growing \nimpact of climate change. No, he is a person who does the lucrative \nbidding of corporate DC insiders, both in government and outside \ngovernment, and then he leaves American families to just suffer the \nconsequences.\n  This administration, this Republican Congress, and nominees like Mr. \nWehrum are experts at ignoring the facts, but they can't change those \nfacts. Our planet is getting hotter. Our seas are rising at an alarming \nrate. Our coasts and islands are threatened by devastating storms. Our \nfarms and forests are threatened by droughts and wildfires that are \nbecoming so common across this country that they barely even make the \nevening news.\n  The effects of man-made climate change are all around us. Things will \nonly get worse if we don't do something about it. We should never hand \nour government over to wealthy and powerful companies that put their \nown profits ahead of people. We certainly shouldn't put someone in \ncharge of our clean air program that will not put the health, the \nsafety, and the future of the American people ahead of short-term \ncorporate profits.\n  Make no mistake, President Trump wants a fight. Administrator Pruitt \nwants a fight. William Wehrum wants a fight. And we will give them that \nfight because the American people will fight to protect the health of \nour children and our grandchildren, to build a clean energy economy, \nand to safeguard the future of our planet.\n  The American people deserve someone who will fight in their corner, \nand that is not William Wehrum.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.", "turn": 10, "speaker": "Ms. WARREN", "itemno": 14}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, it has been a sorry spectacle for \nAmericans to witness what the polluting industries are doing, with the \nfull connivance of the Trump administration,\n\n\nto the Environmental Protection Agency--an Agency that enjoys broad \npopularity among the American people but is obviously a thorn in the \nside of big polluters who make very big campaign contributions and \ntherefore have inordinately big influence here in Congress.\n  The creep show parade of nominees to the offices responsible for \nprotecting the public's health at EPA is nothing short of astounding. \nIt is an array of cranks, charlatans, hacks, lobbyists, and toadies in \nreally unprecedented measure in the history of our country. It seems \nthat at this point the key and only credential for appointment to the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency is that you are reliably pro-industry \nand reliably anti-public health.\n  We are facing a nomination for one of these characters, whose name is \nWilliam Wehrum. He was previously nominated to the EPA Office of Air \nand Radiation in 2006, but even back then, his record was such a \nscandal that the White House withdrew his nomination. Now, that was \n2006. That was before Citizens United. That was before the flood of \npolitical power to the big polluting industries. Now, on this new \npolitical field, he is back, he is just as bad, and there is no hint \nthat the Trump administration has any intention of withdrawing his \nnomination. He has a real problem dealing with environmental issues, \nand I think it relates to his record.\n  In recent years, Mr. Wehrum has represented industry in 39 Federal \nappellate cases opposing cleaner air protection. He is 39 to 0 in terms \nof taking the side of industry against clean air protections, and 31 of \nthose cases involved lawsuits against EPA. So he will now be defending \nand judging cases of the type that he brought against the EPA on behalf \nof industry. Again, not one of those cases argued for better clean air \nprotections. Many of them questioned air toxic standards that had been \nestablished by EPA. Some of the lawsuits were against rules that had to \nbe rewritten by the Obama administration when EPA failed to follow the \nClean Air Act, when a rule was thrown out by the courts for failing to \nbe true to the law. So this is not a great moment for the integrity of \ngovernment in this particular case.\n  When we asked Mr. Wehrum questions--for instance, I asked him about \ncarbon dioxide's role in the observable effects of climate change, and \nhe replied: ``The degree to which manmade [greenhouse gas] emissions \nare contributing to climate change has not been conclusively \ndetermined.''\n  That entire sentence hangs on one word: ``conclusively.'' So if 999 \nscientists said that this is indeed conclusive but you had 1 outlier--1 \nagainst 999--then you could argue that the degree to which manmade \ngreenhouse gas emissions are contributing to climate change has not \nbeen conclusively determined. But in the world in which Mr. Wehrum is \ngoing to be making decisions, that is not a relevant standard. That is \na standard that comes from the climate-denial talking points; it is not \na standard that arises from the law or from the way administrative \nagencies are required to review scientific evidence.\n  The distinguished Presiding Officer was an attorney general and knows \nvery well that the standard for getting scientific evidence admitted in \na court proceeding is whether it is accurate to a reasonable degree of \ncertainty. There is no standard that it has to be conclusive; that is \nan imaginary prop of the fossil fuel industry to be able to address the \nfact that it is virtually unanimous science against them and there are \nonly a few payroll scientists floating around to keep it from being \nconclusive.\n  To a reasonable degree of scientific certainty, are manmade \ngreenhouse gas emissions contributing to climate change? Without a \ndoubt. Indeed, NOAA and EPA have concluded that ``carbon dioxide is the \nprimary greenhouse gas that is contributing to recent climate change.'' \nThat is it. And rules at an administrative agency have to pass the test \nof being based on substantial evidence, as the Presiding Officer knows, \nand not being arbitrary or capricious. In any rational world, it would \nbe arbitrary and capricious to deny the vast weight of science because \nit is not 100 percent conclusive. Nobody makes decisions on that basis \nin real life.\n  This, right in this individual's testimony, is a direct echo of \nfossil fuel industry talking points, fossil fuel industry propaganda, \nand it is a preview of coming attractions as to whose message he will \nbe mouthing in a position of public responsibility.\n  Similarly, I asked him about ozone. One of the goals of the Clean Air \nAct itself is to set standards for how much ozone there can be in the \nair. This makes a big difference to Rhode Island because Rhode Island \nis a downwind State from most of the industrial and powerplant \nemissions through the Ohio Valley, in the Midwest, and through West \nVirginia. We actually have ozone alert days in Rhode Island--ozone \nalert days, when you drive in in the morning and the drive-time radio \nis warning you that this is not a good day to be outside. It looks \nsunny. Ozone is transparent. It looks fine. It is usually warm because \nozone is propagated in warm air. So on a warm, sunny day, you are \ndriving in, it looks as if everything is fine, and you are warned that \nthe elderly, small children, and people who have breathing difficulties \nor disabilities should stay indoors. That is the price Rhode Islanders \nare asked to pay for this ozone pollution we have to live with--stay \nindoors.\n  Ozone standards have been in place at EPA for 45 years. For 45 years, \nEPA has regulated ozone. What did Wehrum answer when I asked him about \nozone? ``I am not familiar with the current science on the health \neffects of ozone, so I cannot comment on your question as to the \nappropriate level of the standard.'' Really? He wants to run this \noffice--the office which has been handling ozone regulation for 45 \nyears--and he is not familiar with the current science on the health \neffects of ozone? I think he is quite familiar with the current science \non ozone, and in this position, he is going to be looking for ways to \nget around that science to help the ozone-emitting clients of his \nprivate practice.\n  I asked him about the endangerment finding. The background of the \nendangerment finding is this: In Massachusetts v. Environmental \nProtection Agency, the Supreme Court of the United States decided that \ncarbon pollution was, in fact, a pollutant under the Clean Air Act. \nThey decided that in the Supreme Court, and that is now the law of the \nland.\n  Then, pursuant to that Supreme Court determination, the EPA had to \ntake a look at whether it is a dangerous pollutant. And they did. Their \ndetermination as to whether it is a dangerous pollutant is called an \nendangerment finding. Sure enough, EPA found that carbon dioxide being \nemitted by these fossil fuel plants is, in fact, a danger to present \nand future Americans, to this generation and to generations to come.\n  Mr. Pruitt, who is one of the slyer rascals around out there, said in \nthe Environment and Public Works Committee that he would not contest or \nseek to review the endangerment finding. There is an obvious reason why \nsomebody who is completely in tow to the fossil fuel industry would not \nwish to revisit the endangerment finding; that is, because you would \ndrop an avalanche of scientific fact on your own head. You would be \nobliged to put the phony little scrapes of climate denial that the \nfossil fuel industry funds and propagates through a whole bunch of \nfront groups up against the real science that is agreed to by \nessentially every legitimate scientific organization in America, that \nis taught at every American State university in all 50 of our States, \nthat has formed the basis of our Defense Department's Quadrennial \nDefense Review pointing out that climate change is a catalyst of \nconflict and a national security risk, and that is recognized and \ntracked by the National Laboratories of the United States that we fund.\n  Up against the phony-baloney nonsense that is propagated by the \nfossil fuel industry, that is a rout. Of course, the last thing the \nfossil fuel industry wants is a fair contest in a fair and factual \nforum between the real science and their phony science denial. So, of \ncourse, Pruitt doesn't want to kick that fight off, and, therefore, he \nis now stuck with the endangerment finding.\n  I asked Mr. Wehrum about the endangerment finding, since it is a \nfinding related to greenhouse gases, which are subject to the Clean Air \nAct, which would be his responsibility in\n\n\nthis position at EPA. He said: I currently do not have a view on the \nendangerment finding.\n  I bet he had a view when he was being paid by the Rubber \nManufacturers Association to consider emissions of carbon dioxide; I \nbet he had a view when he was being paid by the American Forest & Paper \nAssociation; and I am pretty sure he had a view when he was being paid \nby the American Petroleum Institute. So this new, sudden absence of a \nview seems improbable in the extreme. It looks like the best thing he \ncan say to not have to admit the real science, knowing perfectly well \nthat if he actually tried to deny it, that same avalanche of real \nscience would fall around his head.\n  In some respects, it is tragic that we are now in a situation in \nwhich an agency of the U.S. Government has been handed over to the \npolluters lock, stock, and barrel. They have been given absolute sway \nto drive an industry agenda through the Agency that is supposed to be \nprotecting us.\n  In the balance of Pruitt and all of his little minions in this creep \nshow array of appointees, all you can expect from them is the industry \npoint of view, as close as they can deliver it, without stepping on any \nof the factual or legal traps that will snap shut on them if they go a \nlittle bit too far and actually step into a forum like a courtroom or a \ncontested proceeding where they are obliged to be under oath, where \nthere is a prospect of discovery, and where you have to meet the proper \nstandards for administrative rulemaking, such as based on ``substantial \nevidence'' or not ``arbitrary and capricious.''\n  There have been two recent descriptions that have come out that put \nthe climate change problem into perspective. The first is the ``U.S. \nGlobal Change Research Program Climate Science Special Report,'' which \nis part of the ``National Climate Assessment'' that Congress mandated \nsome years ago. The best scientists from 13 different agencies got \ntogether, and over many, many months they put together a comprehensive \nreview of the science and of what is going on. The opening sentence is: \n``The climate of the United States is strongly connected to the \nchanging global climate.''\n  A little sidebar on that--what is happening on climate change in the \nUnited States is strongly connected to the change in global climate. \nWhen you dump carbon emissions into the atmosphere, it is not just our \natmosphere; it is everybody's atmosphere. When China or Russia or India \ndump carbon emissions into the atmosphere, they are not just hurting \ntheir atmosphere; they are hurting our common atmosphere of the planet.\n  A little trick that Administrator Pruitt has developed is--in \ncalculating the harms of climate change--to look only at U.S. emissions \nand look only at U.S. effects.\n  If you have an international problem, as our scientists say, strongly \nconnected to the change in global climate, what happens when you look \nonly at the American effects and look only at the American emissions? \nWhat that means is that when you are scoring the harm of climate \nchange, you are cutting it down to a mere fraction of what actually \nexists. You are cutting out the harm that other nations cause to us \nwith their emissions, scrubbing it right off the books, and you are \nscrubbing off the harm that our emissions do to other nations, \nscrubbing it right off the books. It doesn't change the harm, of \ncourse; it just tweaks the accounting with a piece of rhetorical \ntrickery to help the fossil fuel industry not have to be accountable \nfor the actual harm it causes. That is what we have learned to expect \nfrom the EPA--nothing about the actual harm that climate change causes \nbut accounting trickery to try to dial the number down so that a huge \nmajority fraction of the harm never even gets counted.\n  ``This assessment concludes, based on extensive evidence, that it is \nextremely likely''--which is the highest level of scientific \ncertainty--``that human activities, especially emissions of greenhouse \ngases, are the dominant cause of the observed warming since the mid-\n20th century.''\n  It goes on. It is not only that the evidence entirely shows ``that it \nis extremely likely that human activities, especially emissions of \ngreenhouse gases, are the dominant cause,'' but when you look at what \nthe alternatives might be, here is what the next sentence says: ``For \nthe warming over the last century, there is no convincing alternative \nexplanation supported by the extent of the observational evidence.''\n  Not only is there an avalanche of evidence supporting the \ndetermination that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases are \ncausing the climate change we have observed, but when you look to see, \nwell, maybe there is another explanation, there is none, zero. It does \nnot exist. Why not? Because it has never been real--the phony science \non the other side. It has always been propaganda. That is why it is \nfeatured on talk shows instead of peer-reviewed scientific \npublications. That is why it comes through phony industry front groups \nlike the George C. Marshall Institute rather than real scientific \norganizations. We have known that for a long time.\n  I see that another speaker has come to the floor. Let me conclude \nwith the recent statement, just in the last few days, of the Pontifical \nAcademy of Sciences. One of the strongest voices for addressing climate \nchange has been Pope Francis. Pope Francis not only sees it as a real \nproblem for our planet and for our care of God's creation, but he also \nsees it as a justice issue, as a moral issue. The wealthier societies \nare degrading the quality of life in poorer societies, shifting costs \nand harm to them, which they are much more vulnerable to than we are, \nin a cocoon of wealth and air conditioning and supermarkets and all of \nthat. He has been a remarkable voice for this.\n  One of the things he did was to set up this panel to take a look at \nclimate change and what it means for the planet. The document is called \n``Declaration of the Health of People, Health of Planet and Our \nResponsibility Climate Change, Air Pollution and Health Workshop.''\n  Here is its opening statement, which it calls the ``Statement of the \nProblem.'' ``With unchecked climate change and air pollution, the very \nfabric of life on Earth, including that of humans, is at grave risk.''\n  If you align the science that comes through the ``National Climate \nAssessment'' and align the universities of our great country, the \nnational labs of our great country, the military experts in this area \nin our great country, and now this international body pulled together \nby Pope Francis, they all come to the same place. It is just here in \nCongress, where the fossil fuel industry, through massive amounts of \npolitical spending, has shut down responsible conversation about this \nproblem that there is any window for climate denial to creep back in--\nand, of course, the ability of this administration, in tow to the \nfossil fuel industry, to stick climate-denying fossil fuel operatives \ninto positions of public responsibility. This is a disgrace. The fact \nthat this body cannot stand up to them, cannot find patently \nconflicted, patently unqualified nominations to be beyond the pale for \nus is a terrible testament as to how the power of the fossil fuel \nindustry has corrupted our ability to perform our function in the \nSenate.\n  With that, I yield the floor.", "turn": 14, "speaker": "Mr. WHITEHOUSE", "itemno": 18}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Rhode Island, \nSenator Whitehouse, for his leadership. He has never given up on this, \nand he will never give up. We have many important issues ahead, one of \nwhich I am going to address--climate change--about this nominee and the \nfact that every country in the world now, including Nicaragua and \nSyria, have pledged to be part of this international climate change \nagreement, which is so important for reducing greenhouse gases. I thank \nSenator Whitehouse for carrying the torch on this for so long.\n  I join him today in rising to speak about the nominee who the Senate \nis currently considering to lead the Environmental Protection Agency's \nOffice of Air and Radiation. If confirmed, Mr. William Wehrum will be \ntasked with carrying out and managing critical Agency functions related \nto controlling airborne pollution, improving air quality, monitoring \ngreenhouse gases, and overseeing energy efficiency standards.\n  By the way, I was always proud that the first bill I introduced to \nthe U.S. Senate when I got here was a bill with Olympia Snowe, who is \nmy Republican mentor. That bill required the Agency to start collecting \ndata on greenhouse\n\n\ngas emissions. I take this very personally. The Agency ended up \ndeciding to do it itself, as Senator Whitehouse is aware. But it was my \nfirst bill, and I decided that was a good first bill. It was \nbipartisan, and it got to the core of this issue that our country needs \nto take responsibility, that we need to work with the rest of the \nworld. But most importantly, this is a long-term issue, shared by my \nbusinesses in Minnesota, shared by everyone from hunters to \nsnowmobilers, to ice skaters in our State--the concern of our changing \nclimate and the effect it will have on our way of life.\n  There are two specific issues that Mr. Wehrum will be involved in \ndirecting from the EPA that I wish to discuss: first, the renewable \nfuel standards and, then, circle back to this issue of climate change.\n  Minnesota's agriculture is very important to me. We are the fifth \nbiggest ag State in the country. It is why I sought a seat on the \nSenate Agriculture Committee and why I have consistently pushed for a \nstrong renewable standard. I believe we should be working in this body \nto help the farmers and the workers of the Midwest, not the oil sheikhs \nof the Middle East.\n  Recently, I led a letter with Senator Chuck Grassley, which was \nsigned by 38 Senators, calling on Administrator Pruitt to ensure that \nthe final rule for 2018 and 2019 sets blending targets that promote \ngrowth in the biofuel sector and in our economy.\n  The final rule for 2017 followed congressional intent and required a \nrecord amount of biofuel to be mixed into our transportation fuel \nsupply. The final rule this year should do the same. Reducing the blend \ntargets of advanced biofuels could shortchange the growth of clean \nenergy innovation and stifle the growth of the market for new biofuels.\n  So far the response from the administration in backing off these \nplans, thanks to Senator Grassley's leadership, has been encouraging, \nbut the proof will be in the pudding when the rule is released before \nthe end of the month. I appreciate the work of Senator Grassley, \nSenator Ernst, Senator Thune, and Senator Durbin--who is here with us \nright now in the Chamber--and others who have worked on this Renewable \nFuel Standard, as well as my colleague Senator Franken.\n  Renewable fuels have become a homegrown economic generator for our \ncountry. They reduce the environmental impact of our transportation and \nenergy sectors and cut our reliance on foreign oil. Every time a new \nstudy is released on this subject, I become more and more convinced \nthat investments in renewable fuels are investments in our economy and \nin the health of rural America.\n  Last year, a study conducted by ABF Economics showed that the ethanol \nindustry generated $7.37 billion in gross sales in 2015 for Minnesota \nbusinesses and $1.6 billion in income for Minnesota households. Here is \na big one: The ethanol industry also supports over 18,000 full-time \njobs in Minnesota. I see the Presiding Officer is from the State of \nAlaska. Just as he knows that the oil industry is important in our \nState, the ethanol industry is important in the Midwest, and I believe \nthey can both coexist.\n  Just last weekend, I visited the Green Plains ethanol plant in \nMinnesota to see one of the operations behind these impressive figures \nand meet firsthand with some of the 60 people who are employed there. \nOne of the things I heard while in Fairmont was how policy instability \nand delays have chilled investment over the years. Delays in releasing \nthe RFS rule in previous years has undercut the Green Plains' ability \nto acquire necessary investments and create new employment \nopportunities. The need for stable policy and the forward-looking \nadministration of the RFS is key to providing certainty for producers, \nemployees, and manufacturers, while unlocking billions of dollars of \ninvestment in the biofuel sector.\n  We have to continue to build on the progress we have made of \nexpanding production capacity more than threefold since 2005 with \nbiodiesel, cellulosic ethanol, recycled waste, and other advanced \nbiofuels. This is no longer some kind of a niche industry. This is 10 \npercent of our fuel supply. That is why I am concerned with some of the \nstatements that Mr. Wehrum has made and some of the clients he has \nrepresented in lawsuits against the EPA, many of whom sought to \nundermine and weaken the RFS.\n  He was the counsel of record in several challenges to the RFS, \nincluding the E15 waiver, which allows for blends of up to 15 percent \nof ethanol in gasoline, something Senator Thune and I have worked on. \nYet most concerning was his role in a 2015 challenge to the requirement \nthat diesel fuel sold in my State of Minnesota contain at least 10 \npercent of biodiesel, or B10.\n  Let me say that this kind of principle and this policy were supported \nby Democratic, Republican, and Independent Governors in Minnesota--from \nTim Pawlenty to Jesse Ventura to Mark Dayton. My State has been a \nleader when it comes to the use of renewable fuels. We were the first \nState in the Nation to pass a biodiesel blending law and the first \nState in the Nation to require gasoline to be blended with 10 percent \nof ethanol. We continue to be a national leader in the use of E85.\n  In 2008 the State legislature amended the Minnesota mandate--that is \nwhen Tim Pawlenty was Governor--to gradually step up the required \nbiodiesel blend from 2 percent to 5 percent and eventually to 20 \npercent from 2012 to 2018. Now, according to the statute, the B10 \nmandate will double to B20 starting on May 1, 2018. With bipartisan \nsupport and individual State responsibility, it is something that our \nState did because we knew it could work.\n  Despite Mr. Wehrum's best efforts, the U.S. district court upheld \nMinnesota's mandate on renewable biodiesel, which has been in the best \ninterest of rural economies and consumers. These advances are going to \nhelp ag producers and rural manufacturing plants do even more for the \nregional economy. The further ethanol and biodiesel take us the less \ndependent we will be on foreign oil and the less of an impact our \ntransportation and energy sectors will have on the environment.\n  I have already discussed the climate change issue, and I see that \nSenator Durbin is here.\n  Again, I will just reiterate that I am a former prosecutor. I believe \nin evidence, and every week seems to bring fresh evidence of the damage \nthat climate change is already causing. Minnesota may be miles away \nfrom the rising oceans, but the impacts are no less of a real threat to \nmy State. I did not like Mr. Wehrum's answers that he gave to these \nquestions during his hearing before the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee, especially when I asked if he believed that human activities \nwere the main driver of climate change and his response was: ``I \nbelieve that's an open question.''\n  I do not think this nominee should be running this part of the \nAgency, and we cannot sit back and ignore the evidence. We need to wake \nup, take action, and turn the corner on the devastating effects of \nclimate change before it is too late.\n  I yield the floor.", "turn": 16, "speaker": "Ms. KLOBUCHAR", "itemno": 20}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sullivan).

We owe him \nand all of our Nation's veterans and their families our profound \ngratitude and respect for their courage, sacrifices, and\n\n\nthe hardships they endured for all of us.\n  Senator McCain endured more than 5\\1/2\\ years of torture as a \nprisoner of war during the Vietnam conflict. When he finally came home, \nJohn McCain found another way to serve our Nation with honor. We thank \nhim for that.\n  Mr. President, this week, the Congress dedicated a commemorative \nchair to honor all Americans ever held as prisoners of war and to honor \nthe more than 83,000 servicemembers who remain missing in action.\n  The antique, empty chair will stand in Emancipation Hall in the \nCapitol as a solemn reminder of the servicemembers who were missing for \nyears in captivity and those who remain missing today.\n  Mr. President, as we prepare to celebrate this Veterans Day, I want \nto tell you about another veteran, another patriot, who was also a \nprisoner of war. His war was World War II.\n  Like Senator McCain, he survived, came home, married, raised a \nfamily, and spent decades in public service. His name is Richard \nLockhart. Everybody calls him Dick Lockhart. He is 93 years old, almost \n94. He is a lobbyist in Springfield, IL, the capital of my State and my \nhometown.\n  Dick Lockhart does not represent the big, monied interests. He \nrepresents the little guys--the nonprofit groups, the public workers, \nthe mental health providers and the families who need them, among \nothers.\n  He is the senior practicing lobbyist in Illinois, maybe in all of \nAmerica. He will be giving up that title soon because, on December 31, \nDick Lockhart is retiring at the age of 93 from the firm he founded 60 \nyears ago. He is not stepping down because he is tired. He still works \n7 days a week, most weeks. He is still physically strong and is as \nsharp as a tack mentally. No, Dick Lockhart is retiring because there \nare other things to do, he says. He wants to travel more and write the \nbook that he has always wanted to write and explain to ordinary \ncitizens how to make their government work better.\n  Dick's life would make a fascinating book, itself.\n  Born in Ohio in 1924 as an only child, his family moved to Indiana \nwhen he was young. The Great Depression hit the Lockhart family hard. \nDick's dad lost his job. Sometimes the electricity was shut off at home \nfor nonpayment. The family never owned a car, never took a vacation, \nand never ate a meal in a restaurant. Dick delivered newspapers and \nworked as a soda jerk during high school to help pay for expenses.\n  He was a student at Purdue University when Japan bombed Pearl Harbor. \nExactly 1 year later, on December 7, 1942, he enlisted in the U.S. Army \ninfantry.\n  He was assigned to the Army's 106th Division, the Golden Lions. In \nOctober of 1944, the 106th shipped out to England. In early December \nthey arrived in a quiet area of southeastern Belgium, near the German \nborder. Military higher-ups assured the men of the 106th to expect an \nuneventful few weeks and that Germany would probably surrender before \nChristmas.\n  History had another plan.\n  In the predawn hours of December 16, German forces launched their \nlast major offensive of the war, the Battle of the Bulge. The U.S. \nforces were outnumbered. Lockhart's regiment, the 423rd, fought for \ndays. Finally--out of food, out of water, and out of ammunition--they \nsurrendered.\n  In all, some 8,000 U.S. soldiers were captured at the Battle of the \nBulge.\n  They were packed into railroad boxcars, crammed in so tightly that \nsoldiers had to take turns sitting and standing. After 2 days of being \nin those boxcars, they arrived at a prisoner-of-war camp in Germany, \nknown as Stalag IX-B.\n  Camp life was brutal. Medical care was nonexistent. Men died every \nday. Meals consisted of only thin ``grass soup.'' On one bitterly cold \nday, Dick Lockhart was beaten savagely by a German prison guard. \nDecades later, he still experiences back pain from that beating.\n  One memory still haunts him.\n  One day, the prison guards demanded that any Jewish prisoners of war \nidentify themselves. For several hours, no one stepped forward. After \nmore threats, Jewish American soldiers began to step forward, \napparently thinking that their U.S. citizenship would protect them. \nThey were wrong. They were shipped off to a notorious hard-labor camp \nin another part of Germany.\n  On January 20, 1945, Dick Lockhart turned 21 while a prisoner of war \nin Stalag IX-B.\n  On April 2, 1945, American soldiers liberated the camp, Dick \nLockhart, and the other prisoners. The Army sent Dick Lockhart home on \na 60-day furlough with instructions to get some rest and to gain back \nsome of the weight that he had lost in the prisoner-of-war camp.\n  He arrived home in Fort Wayne. He knocked at the door and was stunned \nto see a stranger open it. Months before, his parents had received a \ncable that read that their only child was missing in the war and was \npresumed dead. His mother, overcome with grief, went to Ohio to stay \nwith her family. His father moved away to look for another factory job. \nFortunately, they left forwarding addresses, and Dick found them soon \nand was reunited with his parents.\n  A month later, while Dick was still on leave, Germany surrendered. \nThe war in Europe was finally over.\n  Dick had always loved Chicago. So he decided to use his GI bill to go \nto Northwestern University. He became involved in reform politics in \nChicago--a battle of a different sort. He married and had two children, \na son and a daughter.\n  In 1958 he founded his own lobbying firm to try to advance democracy \nthrough good policies and laws rather than through tanks and bombs.\n  He is honest, hard-working, modest, empathetic, and always an \noptimist. He has earned the respect of both sides of the aisle for \ndecades of ethical and professional service in the Illinois General \nAssembly. Laws he has helped to pass have made life better for \ncountless people in my home State. In recognition of that fact, the \nIllinois General Assembly recently voted to celebrate December 31, \nwhich will be Dick's last day on the job, as Richard ``Dick'' Lockhart \nDay in the State of Illinois--a well-deserved honor.\n  Five weeks after Dick Lockhart and others were captured, American \nforces won the Battle of the Bulge, liberated Belgium, and sent the \nGerman occupying troops back to Germany.\n  Two years ago, as part of the 70th anniversary of that event, Dick \nLockhart returned to Belgium. The children and grandchildren of the \nBelgians who had been liberated from Nazi occupation greeted him like a \nhero. He was honored by the nation's King and Queen in a castle--royal \ntreatment that he and all of the American soldiers richly deserved.\n  When Dick speaks about his experience as a soldier, he is never the \nhero of any story. He reserves that role for the young men who didn't \ncome home.\n  He says: ``There is an inscription in a World War II cemetery that \nreads, `When you go home, tell them of us and say that for your \ntomorrow, we gave our today.' ''\n  At the risk of contradicting my old friend, I have to say that Dick \nLockhart is, indeed, an American hero.\n  This Veterans Day, we say to him and to all of the American veterans: \nThank you for your service. Thank you for our freedom. Thank you for \nall of the tomorrows you purchased for us with your courage and \nsacrifice.\n\n\n                               healthcare\n\n  Mr. President, in 2010, Congress passed the Affordable Care Act with \none main goal in mind--to help more Americans get quality, affordable \nhealth insurance. And it worked.\n  Since the law took effect, more than 20 million previously uninsured \nAmericans have gained health coverage, including 1 million in Illinois.\n  For the first time ever, our Nation's uninsured rate is below 10 \npercent. Insurers can no longer deny coverage due to a preexisting \ncondition, charge sky-high premiums for being a woman or having a \nhealth history, or impose annual or lifetime caps on your benefits.\n  Young people can stay on their parents' plans until age 26, and we \nextended the life of Medicare by a decade. These are real improvements \nthat are saving lives.\n  Was the law perfect? No. But did it accomplish its primary goal of \nensuring that more Americans could obtain healthcare--regardless of \ntheir income, gender, or medical history? Yes, it did.\n\n\n  None of that has mattered to President Trump, who has spent the past \n10 months orchestrating a deliberate campaign to sabotage healthcare \nfor tens of millions of American families.\n  From his first day in office, President Trump directed Federal \nagencies not to enforce the law. He cut the open enrollment sign-up \nperiod in half. He yanked advertisements and slashed outreach and \nenrollment assistance funding.\n  And he terminated the cost-sharing reduction subsidies that keep \ncosts down for 7 million Americans. As a result, individual market \npremiums will increase 20 percent next year alone.\n  President Trump has done everything within his power to sabotage and \nundermine this law.\n  Despite President Trump's repeated attempts at repeal and sabotage, \nthe Affordable Care Act is still the law of the land, and that means \nthat quality, affordable healthcare options are available.\n  And we are right in the midst of Open Enrollment. Starting last \nweek--on November 1--Americans who purchased their health plans in the \nindividual marketplace began signing up for health insurance that \ncovers them next year, in 2018. But you only have 6 weeks to sign up. \nOpen enrollment began November 1, and ends on December 15.\n  This is your opportunity to buy insurance that covers important \nhealth benefits--hospitalizations, prescription drugs, doctor visits, \nmaternity/newborn care, mental health and substance abuse treatment.\n  And there is financial assistance to help you buy these plans. In \nfact, 8 out of 10 people who purchase health insurance in the \nindividual market are eligible to receive tax credits that help make \nthat insurance more affordable.\n  In Illinois, about 350,000 people purchase their health insurance in \nthe individual market, and nearly 300,000 of them are eligible for tax \ncredits that will ensure their health plan premiums are below $100 per \nmonth.\n  So, despite the frenzy in Washington over healthcare: health \ninsurance under the ACA is open for business, and the time to sign up \nis now. Visit www.healthcare.gov or call 1-800-318-2596. I would \nencourage everyone to sign up early. Don't wait unitl the last minute.\n  Speaking of waiting until the last minute, I remain dismayed that \nthis Republican-controlled Congress has failed to reauthorize two \nincredibly important Federal healthcare programs--the Children's Health \nInsurance Program and the community health centers program.\n  Nationwide, 27 million people receive care from community health \ncenters. And 9 million children and pregnant women get their healthcare \nthrough the CHIP program, including more than 330,000 kids in Illinois.\n  Because of congressional inaction, funding for these two programs \nexpired over a month ago, on October 1. And what have Republican \nleaders in the Senate done over the past month, while funding has \nlapsed for children, pregnant women, and our Nation's health clinics?\n  Well, they passed a budget resolution making it easier to give huge \ntax cuts to wealthy individuals and big businesses. That is right. \nWhile States and health centers are struggling to figure out how to \nkeep their programs operating, while families are worrying about when \ntheir health coverage may run out, congressional Republicans are \nfocused on tax breaks for the rich.\n  Facing this funding uncertainty, States and community health centers \nare trying to figure out how to keep their programs and clinics \noperating. Ten States--plus the District of Columbia--will run out of \nCHIP funding in the next month or so.\n  For example, later this month, the State of Colorado is planning to \nsend health coverage termination letters to lower income families. The \nletter reads, in part: ``You are receiving this letter because members \nof your household are enrolled in the [Children's Health Insurance \nProgram] . . . If Congress does not renew federal funding, CHIP in \nColorado will end on January 31, 2018 . . . there is no guarantee that \nthey will.''\n  Imagine how terrifying it would be to receive this letter, to learn \nthat your child is about to lose their health insurance coverage \nbecause Congress is preoccupied with tax breaks for the rich.\n  It is beyond unacceptable that congressional Republicans abdicated \ntheir responsibility to reauthorize these critical health programs.\n  If we truly want to help the communities and people we serve, let's \nquickly reauthorize funding for children's health care and for \ncommunity health centers.\n  And remember, if you need health insurance next year, you have until \nDecember 15 to sign up. Don't miss your chance.\n\n\n               Protecting Our Students and Taxpayers Act\n\n  Mr. President, last week, I reintroduced the Protecting Our Students \nand Taxpayers, or POST, Act. I was pleased to be joined by Senators \nReed, Blumenthal, Carper, Murphy, and Warren in the Senate and by \nRepresentative Steve Cohen in the House.\n  Since 1992, Federal law has required for-profit schools to derive a \nportion of revenue from non-Federal sources. This was meant to keep \nfor-profit schools, which in general rely much more heavily on Federal \ndollars than traditional schools, from being completely dependent on \nFederal taxpayers to keep their doors open.\n  Originally, these schools had to receive at least 15 percent of their \nrevenue from non-Federal sources. In 1998, the threshold was lowered to \nonly 10 percent, creating today's so-called 90/10 rule. Think about \nthat. Mr. President, $9 out of every $10 these schools take in can come \nfrom U.S. taxpayers. But it gets worse.\n  Only Department of Education Federal student aid dollars are counted \nas Federal funds. A loophole in the law excludes billions in Department \nof Veterans Affairs GI bill education benefits and Department of \nDefense Tuition Assistance, (TA), funds from being counted as Federal \nrevenue. It means, by recruiting veterans and servicemembers, for-\nprofit colleges can actually receive more than 90 percent of their \nrevenue from Federal funds and still comply with the law. This powerful \nincentive makes our men and women in uniform targets for predatory for-\nprofit colleges.\n  I have told these stories before, but I think they bear repeating. I \nhave told the story of two former military recruiters at a for-profit \ncollege in Illinois. They were told their job was above all to put \n``butts in classes,'' that they should dig deep into the personal lives \nof their recruits to find their ``pain point.'' If a prospective \nstudent was out of work, recruiters were encouraged to say things like, \n``How do you think your wife feels about being married to someone \nunemployed?''\n  Entrance requirements were low--it didn't matter how long a student \nstayed as long as it was long enough for the school to receive the GI \nbill dollars.\n  There is Paul Fajardo, a marine veteran who served in Afghanistan. He \nused his GI bill benefits to enroll at the now-defunct Corinthian \nColleges and had to live out of his car when his school lost its \neligibility to receive GI bill benefits. He told the LA Times that \nCorinthian recruited him and other veterans because ``they knew it was \na guaranteed paycheck.''\n  There is James Long, who suffered a brain injury when an artillery \nshell hit his Humvee in Iraq. He used military benefits to enroll at \nAshford University after being heavily recruited. He told Bloomberg \nNews that he knows he is enrolled at Ashford, but can't remember what \ncourses he is enrolled in.\n  These veterans were nothing more than ATMs for these for-profit \ncolleges intent on pocketing their hard-earned education benefits.\n  And in 2016, for-profit colleges pocketed 34 percent of all GI bill \nbenefits--$1.7 billion--and 44 percent of all Department of Defense \nTuition Assistance funds--$220 million. Mr. President, $2 billion that \nthese for-profit colleges were able to count as non-Federal revenue. \nNon-Federal?\n  The last time I checked, the Department of Veterans Affairs was part \nof the Federal Government, and the money it spends--whether on \nveterans' healthcare or housing or education--comes from U.S. \ntaxpayers.\n  When asked in writing during his confirmation process whether GI bill \nfunds are Federal funds, VA Secretary David Shulkin answered simply, \n``Yes.''\n  And the last time I checked, the Department of Defense was part of \nthe\n\n\nFederal Government, and the money it spends--whether on planes or bombs \nor servicemembers' education--comes from U.S. taxpayers.\n  When I asked Secretary Mattis if Department of Defense Tuition \nAssistance funds are indeed Federal funds, he responded, ``Yes . . . \nthese benefits are Federal funds.'' Seems like commonsense. Yet the law \ndoesn't see it that way.\n  That is why my colleagues and I have introduced the POST Act. Our \nbill will close this ridiculous loophole. It will count all Federal \neducation benefits as Federal revenue and take the targets off the \nbacks of veterans and servicemembers. The bill also reduces the Federal \nrevenue limit to the original 85 percent.\n  Our legislation is supported by, among others, Student Veterans of \nAmerica, the Military Officers Association of America, Paralyzed \nVeterans of America, and the National Association for College Admission \nCounseling.\n  Last year, in response to a request from Senator Carper and me, the \nDepartment of Education publicly released Federal revenue data for the \nfirst time that included VA and DOD benefits. The data showed that 186 \nfor-profit institutions received more than 90 percent of their revenue \nwhen these additional Federal education benefits were included. Mr. \nPresident, 563 institutions received more than 85 percent of their \nrevenue from Federal taxpayers when all Federal sources were included.\n  I was disappointed that when the Department released its 90/10 \ncalculations this year, Secretary DeVos did not continue the practice \nof releasing calculations that included VA and DOD funds, though maybe \nthat shouldn't be surprising. After all, unlike Secretaries Shulkin and \nMattis, Secretary DeVos has refused, when asked, to acknowledge the \nobvious--that VA and DOD education funds are indeed Federal funds or \nsupport closing the loophole.\n  But I am confident that the American people will see the current 90/\n10 rule for what it is--a loophole that makes no sense and that puts \nthose who have served our country at risk.\n  This week, on the eve of Veterans Day, I will stand with my friend--\nSenator Carper of Delaware--as he reintroduces the Military and \nVeterans Education Protection Act. This bill also closes the 90/10 \nloophole, but leaves the Federal revenue limit at 90 percent. It is a \nstep in the right direction, and that is why I support it.\n  I hope our colleagues will consider supporting one or both of these \ncommonsense proposals.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.", "turn": 20, "speaker": "Mr. DURBIN", "itemno": 24}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Thank you, Mr. President.\n\n\n                          Republican Tax Plan\n\n  I come to the floor to speak right now because I know our colleagues \nare trying to move forward next week on some various proposals that are \npart of the tax package. I am very concerned and remain very concerned \nabout the measures within the policy that raise taxes on middle-class \nfamilies because I don't think we should be passing a tax bill that \nraises taxes on middle-class families. For me, in Washington, \nobviously, it is a big concern. We don't have an income tax. They are \ngetting rid of our local deductions that are so meaningful to us.\n  Literally, we have done calculations--and I know there will be \ncalculations in other States--that show you are literally raising taxes \non middle-class families to give a tax break to corporations that, in \nsome cases, aren't asking for them or certainly are not paying that \ncorporate rate today.\n  I think we can do better than these policies. I certainly think we \ncan do better than the policies that are going to be before the Energy \nCommittee next week, if the information we are hearing now or getting \nword of is that my colleague on the Energy Committee, the Senator from \nAlaska, is going to propose literally getting rid of\n\n\nthe wildlife refuge as a refuge and basically the purposes for the \nrefuge and instead saying that drilling would happen and thereby \ndestroy the refuge.\n  I know today there are going to be scientists from across the country \nwho are going to give word and testament to the fact that it is too \ndangerous to have drilling in the same place as a wildlife refuge, that \nthey cannot coexist, that it will destroy the refuge. Apparently, that \nis what my colleague from Alaska already believes because she is now \ngoing to say that to do drilling, you have to change the status of the \nrefuge.\n  I definitely believe there are much better ways in America to get \nrevenue than basically destroying the wildlife habitat of caribou and \nof Arctic wildlife that is so treasured in the United States of \nAmerica.\n  I certainly think there are better ways to do it than raising taxes \non middle-class families, in both my State and your State that don't \nhave an income tax and would rather continue to have the deductibility. \nI hope our colleagues will look at both of these ideas and go back to \nthe drawing board. It is not where we need to be. We need to be \nprotecting things that are so near and dear to us.\n  We definitely don't need to fund tax breaks for millionaires by \ndestroying wildlife habitat. Instead, we should be going back to the \ndrawing board on things that are going to help our economy grow in the \nfuture.\n  I hope the public is well aware that this is kind of dark-of-night \ntactics, where they want us to leave town on Thursday night only to \ncome back on Monday and start in on a tax policy we haven't even seen. \nWe haven't even seen the language yet.\n  I think we can do better than to have a rush-rush approach to give \ntax breaks to corporations and certainly not do it on the backs of \nworking-class families in America--taking away from them viable \ndeductions for education, for housing, for property taxes, for \nexpenditures that they make. We can do better than to leave here and \ncome back on Monday to rush-rush a tax break for corporations while \nraising taxes on middle-class families and destroying a wildlife refuge \nthat scientists say is so important to our ecology to keep.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  I yield the floor.\n", "turn": 36, "speaker": "Ms. CANTWELL", "itemno": 47}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 48}], "header": {"chamber": "Senate", "num": "183", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "S7125-S7136", "wkday": "Thursday", "day": "9", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "EXECUTIVE SESSION", "id": "CREC-2017-11-09-pt1-PgS7125-7", "title": "EXECUTIVE SESSION"}
