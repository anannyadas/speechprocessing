May our veterans make us mindful of the price of our \nfreedom.\n  Lord, infuse us with a spirit of gratitude for those who have offered \ntheir lives on the field of battle that we might live in peace. Let not \none of our veterans feel forgotten, neglected, or unappreciated. May \nthey know by experience the deep and enduring gratitude of a grateful \nnation.\n  Lord, You know the burdens that many of our veterans must bear. Some \nfeel isolated and alone; others feel misunderstood. Bring physical, \nemotional, and spiritual healing to their lives, providing them with \nthe wisdom to trust You with their future.\n  Lord, we ask Your particular blessings upon the Senators who in \nmilitary service have sacrificially given their time, comfort, \nstrength, ambition, and health. Reward them one hundredfold for their \nsacrifice and service, blessing them more than they can ask or imagine.\n  We pray in Your merciful Name. Amen.\n", "kind": "Unknown", "speaker": "Unknown", "itemno": 0, "turn": -1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 1}], "header": {"chamber": "Senate", "num": "183", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "S7125", "wkday": "Thursday", "day": "9", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "PRAYER", "id": "CREC-2017-11-09-pt1-PgS7125-2", "title": "PRAYER"}
