Madam President, I rise today to voice my strong support \nfor the nomination of Derek Kan to be Under Secretary for \nTransportation Policy at the Department of Transportation. The Commerce \nCommittee held a hearing on his nomination on June 8, 2017, and \nreported his nomination favorably out of Committee on June 29, 2017, by \nvoice vote.\n  It is now November 9--over 4 months since the nomination was reported \nout of Committee. This noncontroversial, well-qualified nominee has \nbeen languishing in the Senate for far too long. It is truly \nunfortunate that we have to go through the cloture process on this \nparticular nominee, who is well known to many of us in the Senate due \nto his previous work as a Senate staffer.\n  To illustrate how noncontroversial and well-qualified this nominee \nis, less than 2 years ago, Mr. Kan was confirmed by voice vote in the \nSenate to be a director on the Amtrak Board of Directors. The only \nthing that has changed in the 2 years since Mr. Kan was previously \nconfirmed is that some on the Democratic side have decided to hold this \nnomination hostage, as well as the nomination of Ronald Batory to be \nAdministrator of the Federal Railroad Administration--a very important \nposition, I might add--and the nomination of Adam Sullivan to be \nAssistant Secretary of Transportation for legislative affairs, pending \nassurances that the Trump administration will approve and fund the \nmultibillion dollar Gateway project in New York and New Jersey. While \nno one questions the importance of this corridor, there are many other \nimportant projects that are also awaiting approval and funding at the \nDepartment. No project should get to cut the line based on the \nmachinations of a handful of our Democratic colleagues.\n  As I mentioned, Mr. Kan previously served as a director on the Amtrak \nBoard of Directors, and before that, he served as a general manager for \nLyft, the transportation network company. Earlier in his career, he \nserved as a staffer to the Republican leader and as chief economist for \nthe Senate Republican Policy Committee. Before becoming a Hill staffer, \nMr. Kan served as a Presidential Management Fellow at the White House \nOffice of Management and Budget.\n  Once confirmed, Mr. Kan will be Transportation Secretary Elaine \nChao's chief policy adviser on legislative and regulatory matters \nacross all modes of transportation at the Department. With the \nambitious agenda that\n\n\nhas been laid out before the Department under the Trump administration, \nI believe Mr. Kan will be well positioned to address the many \nchallenges before the agency, including approving and funding important \nprojects.\n  Now that we have had to go through this multimonth process to have a \ncloture vote--again, the vote was just recorded; it was 87 to 9--I urge \nmy colleagues to support his nomination to be Under Secretary for \nTransportation Policy at the Department of Transportation. Getting \nthese important positions staffed and filled is long overdue, and it is \nhigh time the games and politics that are being played with these \nnominations come to an end.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.", "turn": 2, "speaker": "Mr. THUNE", "itemno": 3}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
