Mr. Speaker, November is Diabetes Awareness Month.\n  Over 30 million children and adults, including myself, suffer from \ndiabetes. Another 84 million have prediabetes, and 90 percent of them \ndon't even know it.\n  Diabetes can cause stroke, blindness, kidney disease, heart disease, \nloss of toes, feet, or even legs.\n  In addition to the personal toll this disease takes on the lives of \nthose affected, healthcare costs for diabetic patients are 2.3 times \ngreater than for those without diabetes. This awful disease costs the \nhealthcare system an estimated $322 billion.\n  Rates of diabetes have risen dramatically, unfortunately, in recent \nyears. We must do something to stop it. The U.S. Congress is working \ntowards that end.\n  I was proud to have worked on the 21st Century Cures Act, which \ninvests in research for a cure. The bill streamlines the FDA approval \nprocess and provides more money for research to the NIH.\n  There is much more we can do, Mr. Speaker, to tackle this serious \npublic health issue.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. BILIRAKIS", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "183", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H8667", "wkday": "Thursday", "day": "9", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "NOVEMBER IS DIABETES AWARENESS MONTH", "id": "CREC-2017-11-09-pt1-PgH8667-2", "title": "NOVEMBER IS DIABETES AWARENESS MONTH"}
