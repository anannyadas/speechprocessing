Mr. Speaker, I rise today to introduce \nthe Current Employee Representation Act with Congressman Bradley Byrne \nof Alabama and Congressman Joe Wilson of South Carolina. The Current \nEmployee Representation Act would provide union members more \nrepresentation as their views may differ from decisions made decades \nago especially in the rapidly modernizing workforce of today. This \nlegislation also gives union employees more power to be heard and hold \nthe higher-up decision makers within unions more accountable to the \nrank and file.\n  The United States is seeing shifts every day towards a more modern \nworkforce. Many current employees are locked into old and outdated \nunion contracts, approved long before they were hired. All employees \ndeserve a voice that is reflective of today's workplace. They should be \ngiven options and a voice in the structure of their workplace, and not \nbe subject to the same union practices of the past. This legislation \naims to allow new employees an option to elect new union \nrepresentation. And if they deem the union unnecessary, it would give \nemployees the right to decertify and represent themselves. Why should \noutdated union agreements set the rules for the 21st-century economy?\n  I thank my colleagues who have already supported this legislation and \nlook forward to working with them to see this and other modern \nworkforce policies advance in this chamber.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. FRANCIS ROONEY of Florida", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 3}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "183", "extension": true, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "E1544", "wkday": "Thursday", "day": "9", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "INTRODUCTION OF THE CURRENT EMPLOYEE REPRESENTATION ACT", "id": "CREC-2017-11-09-pt1-PgE1544", "title": "INTRODUCTION OF THE CURRENT EMPLOYEE REPRESENTATION ACT"}
