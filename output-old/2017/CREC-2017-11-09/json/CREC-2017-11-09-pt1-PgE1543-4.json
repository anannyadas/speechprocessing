Mr. Speaker, I rise to celebrate the career of U.S. \nCapitol Police Sergeant Joel Hobbs, who is retiring in November after \ntwenty-seven years with the force.\n  Since 2014, Sergeant Hobbs has served in the Criminal Investigations \nSection. He was responsible for supervising investigations for criminal \noffenses occurring on Capitol Grounds, such as assaults, stolen \nproperty, thefts, and fraud, among other offenses.\n  Prior to his promotion to Sergeant, Sergeant Hobbs served over 20 \nyears on the Patrol Division. The Patrol Division is responsible for \nproviding police services on a 24-hour basis, and security services \ndesigned to protect Congress, its employees, visitors, and property \nunder the jurisdiction of Congress. As a Patrol Division Officer, Hobbs \nbecame recognized as a subject matter expert in areas involving arrest \nprocedures, crime scene search, report writing, among other areas.\n  Sergeant Hobbs has accumulated numerous awards and recognitions from \nUSCP and the Congressional Community throughout his career. As an \nofficer and supervisor, Sergeant Hobbs has embraced every assignment \ngiven to him, and has had a positive impact everywhere he has been.\n  The U.S. Capitol Police play an extraordinarily important and often-\noverlooked role in the functioning of our nation's democracy. Without \nthe safe and secure space they provide, lawmakers would be unable to \nconduct the American people's work and carry out our functions under \nthe Constitution. All of us who serve in Congress hold the U.S. Capitol \nPolice and its personnel in high esteem, and we are grateful for those \nwho put on its uniform every day.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me in thanking Sergeant Joel Hobbs for \nhis almost three decades of service to the U.S. Capitol Police, to the \nCongress of the United States, and to\n\n\nour nation. I wish him all the best in his retirement.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. HARPER", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 3}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "183", "extension": true, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "E1543-E1544", "wkday": "Thursday", "day": "9", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "CELEBRATING THE CAREER OF U.S. CAPITOL POLICE SERGEANT JOEL HOBBS", "id": "CREC-2017-11-09-pt1-PgE1543-4", "title": "CELEBRATING THE CAREER OF U.S. CAPITOL POLICE SERGEANT JOEL HOBBS"}
