On Thursday, the House \nwill meet at 9 a.m. for legislative business.\n  Mr. Speaker, the House will consider a number of suspensions next \nweek, a complete list of which will be announced by close of business \ntomorrow.\n  In addition, the House will consider the conference report to \naccompany H.R. 2810, the Fiscal Year 2018 National Defense \nAuthorization Act. This bipartisan agreement will strengthen our \nmilitary, give our men and women in uniform a 2.4 percent pay raise, \nand ensure America's fighting forces have the resources they need to \nsecure peace both at home and abroad.\n  I want to thank Chairman Thornberry and the entire House Committee on \nArmed Services for their hard work on this important bill.\n  Mr. Speaker, the House should also look forward to voting on the most \nsignificant tax reform in over three decades, H.R. 1, the Tax Cuts and \nJobs Act, sponsored by Representative Kevin Brady.\n  America is among the highest taxed nations in the developed world. \nAmericans pay more in taxes than we spend on housing, clothing, and \nfood, combined.\n  Our current Tax Code is almost 2,600 pages long, with an additional \n70,000 pages of forms and other regulations. That is just unacceptable.\n  We want to see economic growth in this country. Instead of ``closed \nfor business'' signs, we want to see ``now hiring'' signs.\n  We want to double the standard deduction.\n  What does that mean?\n  It means, for every American, the first $12,000 of income for an \nindividual is tax free; for a couple, that is $24,000 tax free.\n  We want to simplify the Tax Code so you can file it in minutes--\ninstead of spending weeks--on a form the size of a postcard.\n  We want to bring back the trillions of dollars of American wealth \nthat is forced to sit overseas, have it come back to America and invest \nin Americans.\n  That is what voting for the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act will accomplish. \nThat is why I look forward to the House passing this critical bill \nwithout delay.\n  Lastly, Mr. Speaker, additional legislative items are possible in the \nHouse.

Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  Mr. Speaker, I am a little confused that the gentleman is not \nenthusiastic about this bill. I have read what some people on the other \nside of the aisle have said about this bill. I heard one phrase that \nthe gentleman recently used about the middle class. I would just \ncaution my friend in inferring anything negative to the middle class \nwith this bill because there were some on the other side of the aisle \nthat made some comments.\n  Like most things we say, we get fact-checked. The Washington Post, to \na few Senators and my own Senator from California, tried to claim this \nwas poor for the middle class.\n  Do you know what happened?\n  She did not receive one Pinocchio, she did not receive two \nPinocchios, and she did not even receive three Pinocchios. She received \nfour Pinocchios on that statement. That is the most Pinocchios you can \nget.\n  Mr. Speaker, if I may, I wanted to do the research. I wanted to look. \nIs this tax bill good for all of America? Especially because I want the \ngentleman to be enthusiastic about it, I looked at Maryland's Fifth \nDistrict. Now here are just a few facts:\n  Currently, in the Fifth Congressional District of Maryland, 47 \npercent of the filers take the standard deduction. So not only will \nthey be better off, it will actually double, and they will see the \nincrease in their pay on day one, January 1.\n  Another 11 percent have itemized deductions. They will no longer with \nour new higher standard deduction, so they will also save more money, \nnot to mention the time and confusion by not having to itemize. That \nmeans, before we even look at lowering tax rates, 58 percent of my \nfriend's district is better off on day one.\n  Now, how about the median family of four?\n  A median family of four in Maryland's Fifth Congressional District \nearns $123,000. For the 20 percent of those families that don't itemize \ntoday, they will receive a tax cut of $5,000. For the 80 percent who \nare itemizing today, they will get, on average, $2,200 in a tax cut.\n  But those are not the only people I am worried about. How about the \nsingle mother who is earning $30,000 in your district?\n  Well, she will no longer have to pay any tax under this plan. In \nfact, she will receive a refund of about $500 to $700.\n  How about the small business, the entrepreneur, the factory creating \njobs?\n  The small-business owner making about $400,000 in Maryland's Fifth \nCongressional District will see a savings of nearly $19,000.\n  So what I am confused about is: How can't you be excited about this \nbill?\n  In short, Mr. Speaker, to the people not just in my friend's \ndistrict, but all of America, let me state this: under our plan, the \naverage family of four earning $55,000 a year will not pay any tax.\n  For so many days and so many years, I have heard from the other side \nof the aisle and my friend talking about the middle class. We have a \nbill that is on the floor that is going to help the middle class, the \nsingle mother not to pay any tax and getting money back; the median \nfamily there getting $5,000 back; the small business getting 19--I \ndon't know how much more we have to do to get my friend excited, but \nnext week he will have the opportunity.", "turn": 7, "speaker": "Mr. McCARTHY", "itemno": 8}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "H000874", "text": "  Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, a lot more is the answer.\n  Why is the NFIB, Mr. Speaker, against this bill if it is so good for \nsmall business? Why is the AARP against this bill if it is so good for \nsmall business? Why is the Peter G. Peterson Foundation, which is \nworried about the national debt, against it?\n  Mr. Speaker, since I have been here, my Republican friends have been \ntalking about we have got to balance the budget. The President said he \nis going to balance the budget in 9 years. That was hooey.\n  Our Republican friends have said they are going to balance the \nbudget. They said it in the Price budget. They said it in the Ryan \nbudget. The budget deficit keeps getting bigger, and they have been in \ncharge of economic policy for a long time.\n  The fact of the matter is, Mr. Speaker, I have got a list of 50 \ngroups that are against this bill because they think it hurts both the \ndebt and middle-income people.\n  The distribution, according not to fact-checkers but the Joint \nCommittee on Taxation, $1 trillion of the tax cuts go to business, $230 \nbillion to individuals, and $170 billion on estates essentially. Now, \nthat doesn't add up to the $1.7 or $1.8 trillion that has been computed \nto be the deficit created--the additional debt--by this bill.\n  In fact, that is why this bill is being rewritten right now. I \nguarantee my friend--and he can call me this next week--that the bill \nthat was introduced last Thursday will not look like the bill that we \nwill consider on the floor. It won't.\n\n  It won't because, first of all, the debt is a problem for, \napparently, some people. It is a big problem for me. We ought to pay \nfor what we buy. That is what the chairman of the Ways and Means \nCommittee, Mr. Camp, did: a bill that was paid for--an honest bill that \nwas paid for, as was the 1986 tax reform bill. It did not add to the \ndebt.\n  This adds an extraordinary amount to the debt. As a matter of fact, \nit adds in one fell swoop the debt that was created on the Reagan \nadministration approximately $1.7 trillion. It is being rewritten now.\n  My presumption is, as we have done 49 times this year, that this bill \nwill be presented under a closed rule in a transparent Congress, where \neverybody's views are going to be considered. I stand here and say that \nthe gentleman is not going to bring this bill to the floor with an open \nrule where amendments can be offered, where people can discuss options, \nand we can see what the ramifications are to middle class taxpayers.\n  The Joint Committee on Taxation also pointed out that, of this \nfigure, individuals are going to get a tax cut of\n\n\nwhich Mr. Ryan talks about of $1,182--a typical family, he refers to \nthem--but that figure will start to go down in 2019 and will go down \nfurther in 2020 so that it is a bait-and-switch. You get it up front, \nbut we are going to take it away.\n  In the Ways and Means Committee, one of the reasons, Mr. Speaker, I \ntell the majority that I am not very enthusiastic is because they \nasked: Do we also do this for businesses? Do we also do it for the \nestate tax? Do we also do it for the wealthy?\n  The answer to that question is no. Only the middle-income worker has \ntheir tax cut reduced over the next 5 years, but not so with business, \nnot so with the wealthiest taxpayers in America, and not so, obviously, \nwith the estate tax. So that, I can tell the gentleman, is why I am not \nnearly as enthusiastic about it as some others would be.\n  We limit State and local tax deductions, which the middle class \ntakes. We limit the mortgage interest deduction used by homeowners. We \neliminate the student loan deduction and we eliminate the medical \nexpense deduction. So if you have a major medical expense, you are \ngoing to lose under this bill.\n  It eliminates the deduction for moving expenses if your employer \nwants you to go more than 50 miles from your home. It eliminates the \ndeduction for the adoption tax credit. That could be a credit of \n$13,570 per eligible child that you will lose. It eliminates the \ndeduction for teachers that helps them purchase pencils, papers, \nrulers, and other materials for students.\n  It eliminates the deduction for dependent care assistance--a \nsubstantial challenge for many of our families in America. It eliminate \npersonal exemptions, which Americans can currently deduct for \nthemselves, a spouse and dependents that grows to the size of the \nfamily. If you have a large family, you lose under this bill. If you \nhave one child, the majority leader may be right. When you get to two \nchildren, three children, and four children with no deductions, you are \ngoing to lose under this bill. That is why I am not very enthusiastic \nabout it.\n  I tell this leader, Mr. Speaker, perhaps the changes will make me \nmore enthusiastic. Perhaps there will be a recognition that this is not \nthe bill that is going to do what it is purported to do.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman.", "turn": 8, "speaker": "Mr. HOYER", "itemno": 9}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "M001165", "text": "  Mr. McCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  I just caution the gentleman on some of the things that he says \nbecause I do not want him to end up with any Pinocchios. The gentleman \nknows my fondness for him. Just today in The Washington Post we had a \njoint editorial about our trip down to Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, \nand to the Keys in Florida.\n  The one thing I do want to say to the gentleman is I know he \nmentioned a few people in the very beginning, NFIB, whether they \nsupport the bill or not, I say: Just stay tuned.\n  When the gentleman talks about will there be changes in the bill, \nthis is the process. When you go through committee, do you not want to \nhave the committee to have input?\n  So there will be some changes. Substantially? No. But I do want to \nalso advise my good friend--maybe I could refer the gentleman to clause \n5(a) of rule XXI of the House Rules. That will tell my friend how a \nbill comes to the floor coming out of the Ways and Means Committee when \nit deals with taxes.\n  Now, I know the gentleman talks about debt. I know the gentleman \nbrought up teachers, that it is a $250 tax credit. The only concern I \nhave is that it is only in Washington that they could be opposed to a \nbill because they think we are eliminating a $250 tax deduction while \nwe are giving somebody $12,000 more tax free. There is a lot more there \ngoing around, and I think that is a much bigger gift. If you ask the \nAmerican public what they wanted, I will guarantee you which side they \nwould pick.\n  Now, the gentleman talks about debt--and I have great respect for my \nfriend--but just a few weeks ago, the gentleman voted for a budget that \ncalled to raise taxes by $3.9 trillion. That same budget would also \nincrease the deficit by $6.8 trillion--that is not what the gentleman \nsaid on the floor; that is what he did on the floor--over 10 years. It \nassumed a $764 billion deficit in 2027.\n  Now, we had a budget on our side. A budget lays out the framework for \nthe future. The Republican budget resulted in a $197 billion surplus in \n2027 and a $2.6 trillion deficit over 10 years. So I am concerned about \nthe budget, and my votes show that. I want to put us on a path where we \nbalance.\n  We had this debate just a couple weeks ago, and that debate set up \nthe mechanism to go to tax. And the one thing I have learned time and \nagain--and my friend and I have had this discussion--we have got to \nprotect the entitlements for the future, but we know that is what is \ngoing to break us if we don't do something about it.\n  We have got to grow the economy. As we have watched the history of \nAmerica, every generation has improved on the generation before it. But \n75 percent of Americans believe this generation will not.\n  Why?\n  Because of the last 10 years. It has been our lowest growth that we \nhave seen in decades. We have always averaged more than 3 percent GDP, \nbut we didn't then. We have just gone through two quarters at 3 percent \nwhere we had five hurricanes.\n  I watched the Atlanta Fed look at this and say that we could be above \n4 percent.\n  Do you know what opportunities we have?\n  So it just won't be the Maryland Fifth District that is getting that \nmoney back or the small businesses that are hiring more with that \n$19,000.\n  But imagine what that family will do with that $5,000. They will get \nto determine that. They will buy more than just a pencil. They will \ninvest in their kids' future.\n  So I think that it is an opportunity for all of us to come together, \nput people before politics, and let's make sure this bill goes out in a \nvery strong vote.", "turn": 9, "speaker": "Mr. McCARTHY", "itemno": 10}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "H000874", "text": "  Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his remarks.\n  Mr. Speaker, I heard almost word for word the majority party intone \nthat vision and prediction when we passed the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts--\nalmost word for word. That economic policy stayed in place until 2009.\n  Why?\n  Because the Republicans controlled the House, the Senate, and the \nPresidency.\n\n\n  And what did it bring us?\n  An almost Hoover-like depression. Not quite, because when we came \ninto office, we invested in bringing back a declining economy.\n  Mr. Speaker, the majority leader didn't respond when I said the \ngrowth of jobs was better in 2016, under Barack Obama, than it has been \nunder Donald Trump.\n  We are going to have an opportunity to debate this bill, but I will \ntell my friend, when he says this is the process, the process is going \nto be that the chairman of the committee will come in with a major \namendment to this bill that none of us on this side will have seen, and \nthe bill will be brought to the floor next week.\n  My friend, the majority leader--and I want to say something: he is my \nfriend, and we do cooperate on a positive fashion--and I disagree \nstrongly on this issue. I am against the creation of debt.\n  He mentions the budget. Okay. That is a fair point. But I have been \npretty consistent throughout my career to join with the Peterson \nFoundation that says we have got to get a handle on this debt. We have \na growing economy and 4.4 percent unemployment. The stock market is \ngoing up.\n  So what do we have here?\n  An extraordinary stimulus bill with $1.5 trillion, $1.6 trillion, \n$1.7 trillion, $1.8 trillion of debt, presumably, as the majority \nleader admits, to stimulate the economy. Very frankly, if Democrats \nwere doing this, we would be savaged by the other side.\n  We will debate this, and we will look forward to seeing how the bill \nis going to be when it comes to the floor. Hopefully, we might get the \nmanager's amendment, or, better said, the chairman's amendment, prior \nto its coming to the floor. I would hope we would have, at least, maybe \neven 48 or 24 hours' notice of what that amendment is going to look \nlike so that not only\n\n\nwe, but the American people, who will have no opportunity to come in \nand give their opinions or testify, at least they will know what we are \nvoting on. We will try to make sure they know.\n  One other issue I would like to speak about, Mr. Speaker, before we \nend, and that is the request that the President of the United States \nmade to us.\n  He talked about the order issued by President Obama dealing with \nchildhood arrivals who came here as minors, not on their own volition, \ncalled DACA, or Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals. There were a \nnumber of Republicans who had a press conference today, and they said \nwe ought to pass that bill before the end of this year. I urge the \nmajority leader to pass this bill by the end of next week, before the \nThanksgiving break.\n  This, Mr. Speaker, I believe is an issue on which, as Mr. Barton \nsaid, who is one of the senior Members on the Republican side of the \naisle, if it is brought to the floor, it would have over 300 votes.\n  Representative Barton said that, not me. I said that last week. I am \nglad that Mr. Barton agrees with me.\n  We need to take care of this issue at the request of the President of \nthe United States, who said: I love these kids. He didn't follow that \nwith: I am not going to send them out of the country. What he said was \nthat they were not protected the proper way and asked the Congress to \ntake care of this.\n  I have urged the majority leader, Mr. Speaker, for the last 2 months, \nto bring this to the floor. I know that a task force has been \nappointed. I don't know that the task force has reached a conclusion, \nbut I would urge the majority leader and Speaker Ryan, who urged the \nPresident not to rescind the protection of these young people, urged \nhim not to rescind President Obama's order. But when he did, the \nPresident said: I am going to do it because it wasn't done properly. It \nis the Congress' responsibility.\n  Mr. Leader, I would urge you to bring to the floor the Dream Act, \nwhich is the manifestation of the response to that. There are other \noptions as well. We understand that. But something ought to be brought \nto the floor so that these young people are not twisting in the wind \nthrough Thanksgiving and Christmas. This is the country they know. This \nis the country in which they have been brought up.\n  When Rush Limbaugh says, ``We are not going to send these kids \nhome,'' I can't believe that any of us on this floor are going to vote \nto send these young people home. We need legislation to pass to protect \nthem and to give them the confidence.\n  There is a wonderful editorial--I urge all of you to read it--from \nBob Gates, our former Secretary of Defense under both Presidents Bush \nand Obama. He wrote an editorial about the thousands of, essentially, \nDACA children, young people, who have served in our Armed Forces \nvaliantly. As a matter of fact, he said the attrition rate is a lot \nless with DACA-protected individuals than it is with others.\n  Bob Gates is right. We ought to act. President Trump, in this \ninstance, is right. It is our responsibility. We ought to act. Fred \nUpton said that today in the press conference. Joe Barton said that in \nthe press conference. The gentleman from Washington State, who led the \npress conference, said that.\n  Mr. Leader, this is an issue I think on which we agree. The tax bill \nis going to be an issue on which we are in contention. Let's give the \nAmerican people another example, as we have in the past, of a place \nwhere we can work together, get something constructive and positive \ndone for our country and for these young people.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield to my friend.", "turn": 10, "speaker": "Mr. HOYER", "itemno": 11}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "M001165", "text": "  Mr. McCARTHY.

For the 58th time since the election a year \nago, the stock market broke a record. Business confidence is at an all-\ntime high.\n  Most of that is happening because America has the anticipation of us \npassing a tax bill. That is why I think this is a moment that will be \nsignificant for every Member.\n  They will look back on their vote for next week as one of the most \nimportant votes they would ever take. What is the future you want to \nhave for your children; what is the opportunity you want to give them?\n  Did you put the rhetoric aside; did you look at the bill based on \nconstitutionality; did you look at the bill based upon your own \nconstituents?\n  Take your partisan hat off, and when you look at that at the end of \nthe day, if it empowers your small businesses, if it gives every \nAmerican more money in their own pocket, if the projections are that it \nis going to grow the economy, do what is right.

We will not \npay it off.\n  When you speak on this floor and say it is an immoral act to put our \nchildren more deeply into debt, if you believe that, you will not be \nable to vote for this bill.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n", "turn": 12, "speaker": "Mr. HOYER", "itemno": 13}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 14}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "183", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H8679-H8682", "wkday": "Thursday", "day": "9", "month": "November"}, "related_bills": [{"type": "HR", "context": "FIRSTPARAGRAPH", "congress": "115", "number": "1"}, {"type": "HR", "context": "OTHER", "congress": "115", "number": "1"}, {"type": "HR", "context": "FIRSTPARAGRAPH", "congress": "115", "number": "2810"}, {"type": "HR", "context": "OTHER", "congress": "115", "number": "2810"}], "doc_title": "LEGISLATIVE PROGRAM", "id": "CREC-2017-11-09-pt1-PgH8679-2"}
