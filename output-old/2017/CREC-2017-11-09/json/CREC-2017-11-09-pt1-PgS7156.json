{"title": "PETITIONS AND MEMORIALS", "content": [{"text": "  The following petition or memorial was laid before the Senate and was \nreferred or ordered to lie on the table as indicated:\n\n       POM-137. A resolution adopted by the Senate of the State of \n     California relative to women's reproductive health; to the \n     Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n                        Senate Resolution No. 12\n\n       Whereas, January 22, 2017, marks the 44th anniversary of \n     the United States Supreme Court's landmark decision in Roe v. \n     Wade, which affirmed that every woman has a fundamental right \n     to control her own reproductive decisions and to decide \n     whether to end or to continue pregnancy, and is an occasion \n     deserving of celebration; and\n       Whereas, Roe v. Wade has been the cornerstone of women's \n     ability to control their reproductive lives, allowing every \n     woman in the United States the right to decide when, if, and \n     with whom to have children, and how many children to have; \n     and\n       Whereas, Women's ability to control their reproductive \n     lives has helped and facilitated their participation in the \n     economic and social life of our nation; and\n       Whereas, Roe v. Wade has drastically reduced the maternal \n     mortality rate for women terminating their pregnancies in the \n     United States. In the years prior to the decision, illegal \n     abortion accounted for approximately 17 percent of all \n     reported deaths attributable to pregnancy and childbirth, and \n     many women were severely injured as a result of ``back \n     alley'' abortion procedures; and\n       Whereas, Interference with a woman's right to choose causes \n     women to be forced into illegal and dangerous abortions, as \n     they often were in the United States before the Roe v. Wade \n     decision. Many women are forced to make these decisions today \n     in countries where abortion is illegal and where the unsafe \n     methods of illegal abortion lead to 13 percent of global \n     maternal deaths annually, or eight maternal deaths every \n     hour. Many survivors of an illegal abortion suffer serious \n     and often permanent injuries; and\n       Whereas, Roe v. Wade continues to protect the health and \n     freedom of women throughout the United States; and\n       Whereas, Roe v. Wade is in serious jeopardy due to \n     President-elect Donald J. Trump's stated intention to \n     nominate United States Supreme Court justices hostile to \n     women's right to choose; and\n       Whereas, The State of California stands in strong support \n     of every woman's fundamental right, as confirmed in Roe v. \n     Wade, to make her own decisions regarding her pregnancy; now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate of the State of California, That the \n     Senate urges the President of the United States and the \n     United States Congress to express their support for a woman's \n     fundamental right to control her own reproductive decisions, \n     as well as their support for access to comprehensive \n     reproductive health care, including the services provided by \n     Planned Parenthood; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Secretary of the Senate transmit copies \n     of this resolution to the President and Vice President of the \n     United States, to the Speaker of the House of \n     Representatives, to the Majority Leader of the Senate, to \n     each Senator and Representative from California in the \n     Congress of the United States, and to the author for \n     appropriate distribution.\n", "kind": "Unknown", "speaker": "Unknown", "itemno": 0, "turn": -1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 1}], "header": {"chamber": "Senate", "num": "183", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "S7156", "wkday": "Thursday", "day": "9", "month": "November"}, "related_bills": [{"type": "SRES", "context": "HEADERLINE", "congress": "115", "number": "12"}, {"type": "SRES", "context": "OTHER", "congress": "115", "number": "12"}], "doc_title": "PETITIONS AND MEMORIALS", "id": "CREC-2017-11-09-pt1-PgS7156"}
