Mr. Speaker, with Veterans Day approaching, I want to \nrecognize the life, service, and heroism of Jack Henley from Hamilton, \nMontana.\n  Jack was on the front lines in the Second World War. During the \nbattle in the Philippines, he led a squad of men through heavy fire to \nfill a gap in the line, without losing a single man. He twice reentered \nthe field of fire to save the lives of two wounded men.\n  For his actions, Jack earned the Silver Star and the Purple Heart. He \nreenlisted in 1948, training troops for the Korean war. Jack continued \nto serve in the Army Reserve until 1984.\n  During his 28 years of service, he was awarded 18 medals and \ndecorations. His name is included in the Hall of Valor here in \nWashington, D.C.\n\n\n  I am proud to have this man as a fellow Montanan, and I am honored to \nrecognize his extraordinary life. May we always remember Jack's story \nand those of all our Nation's veterans.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. GIANFORTE", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "183", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H8682-H8683", "wkday": "Thursday", "day": "9", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "HONORING THE LIFE, SERVICE, AND HEROISM OF JACK HENLEY", "id": "CREC-2017-11-09-pt1-PgH8682", "title": "HONORING THE LIFE, SERVICE, AND HEROISM OF JACK HENLEY"}
