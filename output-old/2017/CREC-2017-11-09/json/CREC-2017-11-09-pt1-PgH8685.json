Mr. Speaker, the simple truth is that the rich are getting \nricher in degrees unparalleled in human history in this country, the \npoor are getting poorer, and the middle class are getting crushed.\n  And now our Republican colleagues have offered a proposal to the \nCongress of the United States to make it worse. The fact is that, under \nthe Republican tax bill, the upper 1 percent will be getting a $1.7 \ntrillion tax deduction. At the same time, independent reports tell us \nthe middle class will be getting--millions of them--will be getting an \nincrease in their taxes, and we will be passing on $1.5 trillion in \ndebt to our children and our children's children.\n  Mr. Speaker, this tax bill is a scam. It is traditional old-fashioned \ntrickle-down economics that has never worked and has been the ruination \nof every great economy in every great country in the world. We have to \noppose it and stop them from succeeding in this tax scam.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. NOLAN", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 3}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "183", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H8685", "wkday": "Thursday", "day": "9", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "OPPOSE THE TAX BILL", "id": "CREC-2017-11-09-pt1-PgH8685", "title": null}
