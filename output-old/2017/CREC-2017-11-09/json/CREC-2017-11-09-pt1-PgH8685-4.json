Mr. Speaker, I just want to start out echoing what my \nfriend, Congressman Rick Nolan, was saying: We should not be about the \nrich getting richer.\n  There are different strategies to try to accomplish fairness in a \nfree country. If it is truly free, people are going to have to have the \nopportunity to fail as well as succeed. The only other alternative is \nthe government kills any incentives to be more productive and just \nsays: We are going to flatline everybody across the board, no matter \nhow much you produce.\n  We have seen, over and over throughout history, that never works. \nIncome redistribution never works. You kill the incentives. And, as I \nwas told back in the summer of 1973, in an exchange program at the \nSoviet Union, by a bunch of farmers who were sitting in the shade mid-\nmorning in the middle of the summer, I asked--and I tried to use my \nbest Russian: When do you work out in the field? I couldn't tell what \nwas cultivated and what wasn't. It all looked terrible.\n  They all laughed. I thought maybe I had translated something wrong. \nBut one of the farmers, in Russian, said: I make the same number of \nrubles if I am out there in the field, or in the Sun, or here in the \nshade, so I am here in the shade. That is why socialism doesn't work.\n  So there have been many different strategies that have been utilized\n\n\nthroughout this Nation's history, and throughout the history of the \nworld, to try to create--sometimes it is not an effort to create \nfairness in this country. It has normally been, thank God. But under \nthe Obama administration's efforts to redistribute income, it brought \nabout, for the first time in our Nation's history, that the top 1 \npercent of our Nation made 95 percent of the income.\n  I just was staggered. But that happened under the Obama \nadministration. And, obviously, that tells us that the strategy for \nencouraging success, financial success, was an abysmal failure. Under \nthe 8 years of Commander in Chief Obama, as he commanded over the \neconomy, he made sure--I don't think it was intentional--but his \nefforts made sure that the very richest in the country became much \nricher and the rest of the country suffered.\n  And those on food stamps skyrocketed to the highest level ever. I \nthink over 50 million. We had 95 million Americans, for the first time \nin our history, who got so tired of applying for jobs, unsuccessfully, \nthey quit even applying.\n  And so how does the Obama administration respond? They responded by \nnot counting those 95 million in the unemployed numbers because they \nwere no longer looking for jobs. The economy, it really hasn't \nrecovered. People have been flatlined, or less, when adjusted for the \nlittle inflation we have had.\n  So it is time to try something different than the Obama efforts that \nput 95 percent of the Nation's income in the top 1 percent's pockets. \nWe are already seeing that change, and I am hoping that our efforts, \nespecially in creating tax cuts, will cause the economy to just \nskyrocket, the way it did after the 30 percent tax cut kicked in under \nPresident Reagan by 1983.\n  I do want to touch on something that came out in the last week. This \narticle from The Hill says: ``Early Comey draft accused Clinton of \ngross negligence on emails.'' It turns out--we find out now--that FBI \nDirector Comey started drafting months before Hillary Clinton was \ninterviewed, and months before discussion with Cheryl Mills and the \nother potential targets of the criminal investigation over the \ndestruction of Hillary Clinton's emails.\n  It should have been obstruction of justice. That is not gross \nnegligence when you tell somebody to go destroy your phone with a \nhammer, and you have them use BleachBit to take out everything in your \nphone or in your computer. That is not gross negligence, that is \nintentional obstruction of justice, when you know that there is a \nsubpoena after the things you are destroying.\n  But FBI Director Comey decided to play politics instead of law and \norder. Maybe that would make a good new series on television or \nNetflix--not ``House of Cards,'' but ``House of Injustice''--where we \nplay politics with justice, instead of trying to do justice, trying to \nfulfill the oath to pursue justice.\n  In any event, he had ``gross negligence,'' as the term he attributed \nto Hillary Clinton, in that first draft. But, apparently, when he \nrealized that gross negligence would be a crime, he eliminated what \nwould clearly have been a complete accusation of a crime having been \ncommitted by Hillary Clinton.\n  So, interesting, just more information coming out about why James \nComey should not--well, he should be considered someone worthy of \ninvestigation himself. He admitted to leaking information in order to \nmanipulate the Justice Department, not by being up front and \nrecommending a special counsel--oh, no. He wanted to create a special \ncounsel, just like he did when he told John Ashcroft to recuse himself.\n  Ashcroft, obviously, not knowing what Comey had in mind, but he was \ngoing to appoint his child's godfather to be special counsel--Patrick \nFitzgerald--and let him go on a witch hunt trying to get Karl Rove or \nVice President Cheney--unsuccessful. So he manipulates and creates a \ncase against Scooter Libby, so he could at least have a scalp to show \nfor the millions and millions of dollars that were wasted.\n  But from Comey's standpoint, his child's godfather made a lot of \nmoney, and Comey got to lash out at the Bush administration, so \nprobably from their standpoint it worked out real well.\n  But it also points to the fact that since James Comey has been \ninvolved up to his eyeballs in what is going on as FBI Director, \nwhoever were to be special counsel, if anyone, they would need to be \nsomeone who is not close friends with James Comey. And, as Comey \napparently pointed out to the Washingtonian, when they were doing a big \narticle on him back in 2013, basically, Bob Mueller--if the world were \non fire, Bob Mueller would be the one standing there with him to defend \nhim at the end.\n\n  So, clearly, Mueller, if he were interested in ethics, would have \nrefused--and actually interested in following the law himself--he would \nhave refused to be appointed special counsel. But we now know that \nsince Mueller, as FBI Director, was involved in the investigation of \nRussia's efforts to gain United States uranium, to try to corner the \nmarket on uranium, and they were apparently committing crimes in their \nefforts paying bribes, whatever is necessary, to try to acquire United \nStates uranium, the investigation went on apparently for 3 or 4 years, \nas an undercover person.\n  Well, Mueller and the U.S. attorney in charge of the investigation, \nnamed Rod Rosenstein, actually the guy who appointed Mueller to be \nspecial counsel, they ended up ensuring that the records of that long-\nterm investigation would be sealed, and they even went to court and got \na court order to seal it.\n  And whose name was on the motion to seal those documents? Rod \nRosenstein. He did have a deputy sign on his behalf, but Rod Rosenstein \nwas sealing the records so people couldn't know that Russia was \ncommitting crimes while they were trying to acquire U.S. uranium.\n\n\n  If people saw that the FBI and the Justice Department knew that \nRussia was committing crimes, paying bribes trying to acquire U.S. \nuranium, then they would have been complicit with the effort to approve \nthe sale of uranium to a country that was committing crimes to get it. \nIf they had not approved that, then it is doubtful that the Clintons \nwould have struck the megamillions Russian lottery the way they did, \nand their foundation.\n  So the last two people in the country that should have been involved \nin an investigation into potential Russian collusion should be a person \nnamed Rod Rosenstein and another person named Robert Mueller.\n  I have great respect for his valiant service to our country in \nVietnam. This isn't about Vietnam. This is about manipulating the \njustice system. It is about sealing an ongoing investigation that \nshowed crimes being committed to put our national security at risk, and \nnot speaking up against the sale of 20, 25 percent or so of America's \nuranium to an entity that would provide it to Russia.\n  We now know that that uranium did not stay in the United States, as \nsome had said. Well, when you are going to sell uranium to people who \nhave been paying bribes, acting illegally, is it any surprise that if \nthey are willing to violate the law, that they would be willing to \nviolate the terms of an agreement or other laws regarding that uranium?\n  So I am still hoping--and, yes, I believe in prayer, so I am hoping \nand praying that justice will be done, that those who should not be \ninvestigating will step out of the picture or be forced to step out of \nthe picture, and we can have a fair investigation into potential \ncrimes.\n  Another very important piece of information that has come out about \nthe shooter in the Sutherland Springs massacre has been this scream, \nthis cry for more gun control, and that is immediately after we had a \nradical Islamist terrorist screaming ``Allahu Akbar.'' Even on FOX they \nsaid that means ``praise be to God.'' No. It means ``praise be to \nAllah.''\n  If you want to look for ``praise be to God,'' you can look for \nsomebody to actually say in English, ``Praise be to God;'' or you could \nlook on top of the Washington Monument, where American leaders had \ninscriptions on all four sides of the metal capstone on top of the \nWashington Monument; but on the side facing the U.S. Capitol, they had \ninscribed in Latin, ``Laus Deo,'' meaning ``praise be to God;'' not \n``praise be to Allah,'' but ``praise be to God.''\n\n\n  The reason they had ``Praise be to God'' facing the Capitol is that \nthis is east of the Washington Monument, and what they aspired to have \nwas the first rays of God's sun every morning striking ``Praise be to \nGod,'' enlightening those words before anything else in our Nation's \nCapital was lit; ``Praise be to God,'' then the rest of the Capital \nCity would be lit. That is why it is there.\n  It turns out that the New York killer, the radical Islamist, he came \nto the U.S. under the diversity visa lottery program that was started \nbecause apparently some Senators and a few Democratic House Members \nbelieved that we were having too many Hispanics come in and we were not \nhaving enough Irish come in. So they created this program so immigrants \nlike Irish, who were not being properly represented in the numbers, \ncould have a chance to come into the U.S. the way so many Hispanics \nwere.\n  Well, I didn't think we cared about national origin that we needed a \nspecial program to give some other countries a chance that Hispanic \ncountries would not have, but apparently some thought that was going to \nbe appropriate.\n  It is high time to get rid of the program. We have known for years \nterrorists have been trying to win the lottery, and terrorists have won \nthe lottery.\n  My friend, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Bob Goodlatte, \nhad a terrific op-ed in The Hill, entitled: ``Visa lottery program is \ntoo much of a gamble for our nation and needs to end.''\n  Republicans in the House voted to end the diversity visa lottery back \nin 2005. The Senate wouldn't take it up. Senators were still there that \nhelped start the program, like Senator Schumer. Then Democrats had the \nmajority for the next 4 years after 2006. They certainly weren't going \nto end the diversity visa lottery program. They are the ones who wanted \nit.\n  Then, in 2012, in the session after we got the majority back, we \nvoted again to end the lottery, but the Senate, again, wouldn't take it \nup.\n  In the last session, we didn't get it voted out, but I am grateful to \nthe chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Bob Goodlatte, for pushing, as \nhe has, and I am hoping we can get that bill to the floor that will \nallow us to end it.\n  In that op-ed, Chairman Goodlatte says: ``The visa lottery, which was \nenacted 10 years prior to 9/11, is foolish in the age in which we live. \nThose in the world who wish us harm can easily engage in this \nstatistical gamble with nothing to lose. The Office of the Inspector \nGeneral at the State Department has found that it poses significant \nnational security risks. In fact, Saipov``--the New York City radical \nIslamic terrorist--'' is the fifth person who has been accused or \nconvicted in connection with terrorism plots to have come here through \nthe visa lottery.\n  ``In another instance, Hesham Hadayet, an Egyptian terrorist who \nkilled two and wounded several others at Los Angeles International \nAirport on July 4, 2002, was a lawful permanent resident who received \nhis green card through the program''--the diversity visa lottery \nprogram--``since his wife was a visa lottery winner.''\n  So this Egyptian terrorist was a lottery winner, or his wife was, and \nthe two people who he killed in L.A. Airport and those he wounded were \nthe losers of that lottery.\n  Chairman Goodlatte goes on to say: ``Additionally, in August of 2002, \nPakistan national Imran Mandhai pleaded guilty to conspiring to wage \njihad by plotting to destroy electrical power stations, the Israeli \nconsulate, and other south Florida targets. He entered the United \nStates with his parents, who had won the visa lottery, in 1998.\n\n  ``Similarly, in August 2002, two diversity lottery winners from \nMorocco--Ahmed Hannan and Karim Koubriti--were indicted as members of \nan alleged terrorist `sleeper' cell in Michigan. In June 2003, a jury \nconvicted Koubriti of conspiring to provide material support or \nresources to terrorists, and Hannan of possessing false documents.''\n  So visa lottery applicants, some of them--many of them submit several \napplications under different names in order to increase their chances \nof winning the visa lottery.\n  Chairman Goodlatte continues: ``And marriage fraud is rampant in the \nprogram. `Pop-up' spouses often appear in between the time that the \napplicant registers for the lottery and the time when the applicant is \ninterviewed by the State Department. These `spouses' pay the applicant \nin order to be part of the applicant's green card winnings.''\n  Winnings from the visa lottery.\n  Chairman Goodlatte continues: ``The United States has the most \ngenerous immigration system in the world, admitting more than 1 million \nlegal immigrants each year.''\n  There is no country in the world that allows that many people to come \ninto their country legally. We are far from being the largest country \neither geographically or population-wise, yet we are the most generous \ncountry in the world in allowing people into our country legally.\n  Chairman Goodlatte goes on: ``Eliminating the visa lottery does not \nnegate our Nation's generosity, but makes our immigration system \nsmarter and safer for the age in which we live. Our immigration policy \nshould be based primarily on our national needs, security, and \neconomics, as opposed to an arbitrary system. The visa lottery is too \nmuch of a gamble for our Nation to make with today's ongoing threat of \nterrorism and must come to an end.''\n  There is no other country in the world that is so stupid regarding \nits own national security and national interests that it allows a \nlottery to determine who would get a visa to come into their country. \nIt, hopefully, will be ending soon.\n  That is why there was this article in The Daily Caller: ``GOP \nSenators Distance Themselves from Diversity Visa Program They Helped \nCreate.''\n  There are some who helped create the diversity visa lottery program \nin the Senate who are saying: You know what? Maybe it is time to get \nrid of it.\n  I hope we will.\n  Yesterday, though, in the House Judiciary Committee, we did have a \nbill come up. It is being urged by law enforcement, Federal law \nenforcement, by the Justice Department, FBI, the National Security \nAdministration, CIA, our intelligence folks. They are saying: We have \ngot to have this 702 program reauthorized that will end on December 31 \nof this year.\n  Well, we know that the system has been abused. We were assured when I \nwas here early on in Congress that: Gee, just reauthorize this, because \nthere are no Americans who are going to be harmed by allowing these \nwarrantless wiretapping situations. The only way an American could be \ncaught up in this wiretapping would be if they are talking to a known \nforeign terrorist or a member of a known foreign terrorist \norganization.\n  So that gave me some security. And back then--some years back when we \nwere authorizing the program, I said to my friends that were against \nthe program because they were afraid an American would be caught up: \nWell, if they are afraid of being caught up in this wiretapping or this \ntapping into phone calls, then just make sure that their foreign \nterrorist friends call them on somebody else's phone.\n  That was glibly said. Little did I know that it is not just known \nforeign terrorists and it is not members of known terrorist \norganizations; it has gotten so far afield that even if a Member of \nCongress has an innocent visit with a diplomat or an ambassador from a \nforeign country, that can be--and apparently, we are told, has been--\nused to listen in and monitor conversations. But we were assured there \nis a great safeguard, because if an American is picked up under this \nmonitoring of foreign terrorists, then the American name will be masked \nso nobody will know who it was.\n  So through the Fourth Amendment, we will protect them from having a \nwarrantless search of a conversation without a warrant from a judge, \nwhich requires that they are proving probable cause to believe that the \nindividual is involved in a crime, has committed a crime. And then with \nthat probable cause being proved--as a judge, I signed felony warrants \nfor searches, for seizures, for arrests, but you had to have probable \ncause.\n\n\n  But you had to have probable cause. This allows them to grab those \nconversations without probable cause.\n  So with all that we have begun to learn, and especially when we found \nout how liberal the Obama administration was with unmasking American\n\n\nnames and that we had people who have shown themselves to be extremely \npolitical in their decisions and activities, even being willing to go \non Sunday morning television shows six times in 1 day and lie \nintentionally to the American public about the Benghazi matter, that \nthat same political person would be unmasking American names right and \nleft, and although I know there is one Republican who said, ``Oh, I \ntalked to her, and I'm convinced that she's fine,'' well, I am not. We \nneed that being thoroughly investigated, as well as the other \nunmaskings being properly and thoroughly investigated by people who are \nnot so gullible.\n  This is serious stuff. When we in Congress allowed this loophole \naround the Fourth Amendment requirement for warrants in order to seize \nor obtain evidence, we anticipated that it would be carefully and \nstrictly adhered to. And then we see the unmasking has been so \nliberally done, and there certainly seems to be a prima facie \nindication, when you look at who unmasked and the people who were \nunmasked, that you have one political party in power investigating \ntheir political opponent for political gain. And, once again, thank God \nit didn't end up the way they hoped.\n  But this is still quite serious, and that is why I applauded my \nfriend, another fellow felony judge in our background. Former Judge Ted \nPoe and Zoe Lofgren from California, Democrat, had a good amendment in \nmy opinion, and it was going to require that before law enforcement--\nonce they obtained these American names and numbers, well, law \nenforcement, apparently, once they have obtained these American names \nand numbers and phone numbers and conversations, and obtained them \nwithout probable cause in compliance with the Fourth Amendment, there \nare countless numbers of queries being made into the database on that \nindividual or on the phone number just doing phishing expeditions, and \nthen, if they find something, seeing if they can use that information \nto help prosecute them on another matter. Those are truly phishing \nexpeditions. They should not be allowed without a warrant.\n  Okay. We will say you obtained the information legally, even though \nyou did it in violation of the Fourth Amendment. But if you are going \nto go back and research that database, you should have probable cause \nbefore you start being allowed to basically listen in on conversations \nor follow up on all kinds of activity that was gathered without any \nprobable cause.\n  This is what the government does that the Founders were afraid of. \nThey didn't know that there would be cell phones some day or the highly \ntechnically proficient ability to communicate we have now. But they \nknew that mankind would not change. It has not changed. There has \nalways been evil. There will always be evil in this world, and we have \nto guard against becoming part of the problem when we are in the \ngovernment.\n  The Founders' safeguards, all of those amendments, basically, were \nsafeguards, whether it was the First, Second, Fourth, Fifth, Eighth, \nTenth, I mean, those are critically important--Sixth Amendment. Those \nare all important to preserving our rights. So I was saddened that that \namendment failed: 12 voting for it, 21 voting against it.\n  I appreciate the chairman and the ranking member, Mr. Conyers, \nagreeing to an amendment that Mr. Cicilline made, my Democratic friend. \nAnd, in fact, I had an identical amendment I was going to make, except \nmine added two other safeguards, two other laws.\n  My friend and neighbor--office neighbor, that is--agreed to accept my \nfriendly amendment, to add those other two laws, to ensure that when \nthe U.S. Government went after and examined and queried this 702 \nmaterial--the warrantless wiretapping, as The Hill calls it--that these \nlaws would apply to those queries to hopefully increase the concern by \nthose making the queries that they could be punished.\n  But this article goes on and says: ``The current law allows Federal \ninvestigators to search collected data belonging to American citizens, \nan authority critics say circumvents Fourth Amendment protections \nagainst unlawful search and seizure.\n  ``The Liberty Act would require criminal investigators to obtain a \ncourt order before viewing the content of any American's communications \ncollected under the NSA program--but would not require a warrant to \nsearch the database in the first place.''\n  So the Liberty Act it is referring to actually was used as the \namendment to that bill.\n  Anyway, I know Mr. Conyers is quoted in the article, saying: ``We \nhave been assured in explicit terms that if we adopt this amendment \ntoday''--talking about the Poe-Lofgren amendment--``leadership will not \npermit this bill to proceed to the House floor.''\n  And that was also a concern mentioned by our friend from New York, \nJerry Nadler.\n  But I would submit that we should not be afraid of Republican \nleadership doing the wrong thing. At least, it doesn't hurt, I guess, \nto have a healthy fear because that certainly has happened. But we \nstill ought to be pushing to do everything we can to ensure that the \nU.S. Constitution is properly followed and we don't continue to have \nloopholes around it.\n  So that is an ongoing fight, and the Senate has got to take it up. \nBut there are concerns that the Senate is just going to rubberstamp \nwhat the NSA wants. They are not going to have any of the safeguards \nthat we put in the bill as it is already, which I still don't feel is \nenough, and that is why I voted against it, as did the man who sits \nnext to me in the Judiciary Committee, Jim Jordan. Andy Biggs voted \nagainst it as well.\n  So there were a number of us who voted against the bill because the \nproper protections, in our opinion, are not there. We have just got to \ncontinue to advocate for that.\n  I also want to mention a bit of fake news that came from the \nHuffington Post.\n\n  I have met Ms. Huffington. She could not have been more congenial. \nWhen I was at ABC, going to be on the Stephanopoulos show Sunday \nmorning, she was a delight to talk to, but the stuff coming out of her \npublication sometimes is rather astounding.\n  We had a debate in the Natural Resources Committee. We were voting on \nsome bills, and a comment I made that was not necessarily central to \nthe discussion but I thought might be interesting--I mean, if they \nwould look at my full comments and comments I have made and continue to \nmake, as I have said before, British Petroleum should never have been \nallowed to keep operating their drilling platform in the Gulf of Mexico \ncalled Deepwater Horizon. They had hundreds of egregious safety \nviolations when other companies had one or two.\n  The only reason we can find that the Obama administration allowed \nBritish Petroleum to continue to drill with such egregious safety \nviolations, with such complete, utter disregard for the safety and \nwell-being of those on the platform and of wildlife in the Gulf of \nMexico and those bordering the Gulf of Mexico, all we can find is they \nwere about to come out and endorse the President's cap-and-trade \nprogram, something that Speaker Pelosi desperately wanted.\n  I had read an article that indicated they even had BP representatives \nin the office of Senator John Kerry trying to work out when they would \ndo the big rollout of this big oil company that was going to support \ncap-and-trade. Basically, they would have an inside deal and would have \nmade billions of dollars that other oil companies would not have made \nbecause they didn't have the inside track like the Obama administration \nwas going to give BP.\n  But that is when the Deepwater Horizon blew, from what I understood, \nand so that is why the Obama administration was so slow to respond. \nThey kept hoping this was going to go away and it wasn't going to be as \nserious, because BP was assuring them: Oh, it's not that bad. We have \ngot it under control.\n  They didn't have it under control. They should never have been \nallowed to have been drilling when that blowout occurred. It did have \nan adverse effect on the Gulf. It did have a very adverse effect on so \nmany things.\n  But the comment that the Huffington Post wanted to create some fake \nnews, latched onto, is I was really upset and concerned about the \ndamage that BP had caused.\n  I have to go back and look. It wasn't that long after this happened, \nbut I\n\n\ndrove hundreds of miles along the beach, and I kept getting out with my \nhigh-def camera expecting to be able to find a lot of oil on the \nbeaches. I know I had read and seen there was a spot south of New \nOrleans, and, apparently, I didn't start close enough to that.\n  I understood it was really ruining the beaches of Florida, and I went \nalong the Miracle Coast and along the Mississippi and Alabama coast \nthere. Everywhere I went, I would maybe find a few drops of oil like we \nhave on our Texas beaches quite often, but it is just a drop or two \nhere or there. I was going: Where's all the oil?\n  Everybody said: Well, it is, like, 5, 10 miles up the coast.\n  So I kept going up, looking for this big oil spill on the beach. And \nI knew there were people who were undertaking heroic efforts, you know. \nI had seen those on the news. I had talked to people who were doing it.\n  Kevin Costner had a great idea, it appeared, for sopping up the oil \nto keep it from getting to the coast. So there were Herculean efforts \nbeing made to stop the oil. But there should have been more oil on the \nbeach.\n  So they want to make it sound like I am just oblivious to any oil \never coming ashore because I did say what is absolutely true, that it \nis amazing the way nature seems to take care of problems, and we know \nthat because there is ongoing oil seepage every day.\n  I don't want oil on our beaches. I hate oil on the beaches.\n\n\n  Really, it is infuriating when you are walking along the beach and \nyou step on an oil bubble and then you have to spend a bunch of time \ntrying to get that oil off your foot, even a small drop. But you could \ngo to southern California, off the coast, and find drops of oil here \nand there from natural seepage.\n  The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, you can go to \ntheir website, and they talk about natural oil seeps. They said: ``A \n2003 report from the National Research Council estimates that, on \naverage, approximately 160,000 tonnes''--and it is spelled t-o-n-n-e-s; \napparently metric tons--``of petroleum enter North American waters \nthrough natural seeps each year.''\n  Apparently, 1 ton is about 7.33 barrels per ton, or 307.86 U.S. \ngallons per metric ton. So if you multiplied 307--or 308, if you want \nto round it; multiply 160,000 tons by 308, then you could get an idea \nof how many gallons of oil seep out just through cracks in the Earth's \nsurface and come up through the waters.\n  They are hard to find, although sometimes you can see them from \nsatellites or from aircraft. You can see the oil shimmering on top of \nthe water since it is lighter than water. It floats up through the \nseawater and comes to the surface.\n  Anyway, just more fake news trying to create a big deal where there \nwasn't any. But you can go online to Woods Hole Oceanographic \nInstitution. They have a good article on the natural oil seeps. It \nsays: ``As much as one-half of the oil that enters the coastal \nenvironment comes from natural seeps of oil and natural gas. These \ngeologic features are known to occur in clusters around the world, such \nas off the southern coast of California and in the Gulf of Mexico, but \nare still relatively unstudied. In recent years, advances in remote \nsensing have enabled more accurate detection and estimates of natural \noil flows into the ocean.\n  ``In locations where seeps are found, oil flows slowly up through \nnetworks of cracks, forming springs of hydrocarbon similar to the La \nBrae tar pits on land. Lighter compounds rise buoyantly to the water's \nsurface and evaporate or become entrained in ocean currents; others \nfall the seafloor and collect over hundreds or thousands of years.''\n  So if you multiply 308 times 160 tons, and then multiply that times \nthousands of years, you will get an idea as to how much natural seepage \nthere has been of crude oil into the ocean.\n  But at least the Huffington Post article points out that--and this \nwas from the Deepwater Horizon blowout--``About 24 percent is believed \nto have evaporated or dissolved. The remaining 35 percent was \n`naturally dispersed' or persisted in the environment.'' And it says \nonly ``41 percent was directly or chemically recovered, burned or \nskimmed.''\n  So they only got 41 percent. That is pretty good. It is not good \nenough. We need to be better at doing that. But it really is amazing \nhow nature seems to respond to catastrophes, but we are supposed to \ntend the garden, and that means we do the best we can to keep the \ngarden clean.\n  Mr. Speaker, I want to return to the issue about the shooting down in \nSutherland Springs. The President, I think, appropriately pointed out \nwhen he was asked about it. He said: I think that mental health is your \nproblem here.\n  People are screaming for more gun control. Yet every time it seems \nthat more gun control is pled for, our people that mean well stand up \nand scream: Oh, you got to do something. I don't care if it is wrong. \nJust do something.\n  Well, it may be well-intended, but that is extremely foolish. You can \ndo more harm by doing something even if it is wrong. It is often \ntragedies that lead to the worst legislation because people in Congress \nfeel like we have got to do something. We have got to do something \nquick, even if it is wrong, so that the American people think we are \ndealing with it.\n  Jefferson was not at the Constitutional Convention, but I understand \nhe suggested that potentially a good amendment would be that you could \nnot pass a bill here in Congress until it had been on file for a year.\n  Obviously, that has never made its way into the law, but some of our \nworst legislation comes too quick as an overreaction to some tragedy, \nsome failure when we don't have adequate time to see what would be the \nbest thing to do.\n  As it turns out in the Texas shooting, the gun laws were entirely \nadequate to prevent that from happening, but for those who put their \nfaith in the government keeping us protected, which our Founders did \nnot do--that is why we have a Second Amendment--you have to look no \nfurther than this tragic massacre to understand the government is not \nlikely going to be there to protect you.\n  It turns out the shooter, a man full of evil, was convicted of a \ncrime that should have prevented him from even having a gun. Yet the \nAir Force failed to get the conviction into the databank so that when \nsearches were done, background checks didn't pick it up.\n  So when the government fails, the Founders expected that by having a \nSecond Amendment where, not the military of the United States, but \nactually militia groups that form up, they would be able to have \nweapons. Those were rank and file citizens who were not hired by the \ngovernment. They were simple citizens of the United States who would \nrespond to suppress any outrage that the government might try to \nimpose.\n  That is what happened when Patrick Henry got 5,000 people to come out \nwhen the British Government, that was the law of the land, started \ngoing through their homes and taking whatever they wanted.\n  They responded with guns, citizens coming out of their homes. No, I \nam not advocating for those who want to create more fake news. I am not \nadvocating for a revolution. We have, fortunately, a Constitution in \nplace that they didn't have in 1775, that allows us to fix things \nwithout having to have a revolution.\n  But the answer is not more gun control laws. This guy was full of \nevil. He had mental health problems. The system should have prevented \nhim from having a gun. The laws that were in place should have \nprevented that, and I am grateful that the State of Texas did its part.\n\n  He applied for a concealed carry permit, and even though the Air \nForce conviction wasn't there, there was enough evidence to prevent him \nfrom getting a concealed carry permit in the State of Texas. But the \nother laws, where the Federal Government is supposed to protect us, \nfailed to work because the government often fails to do its job.\n  The thing that really, to me, became an outrage--and it is something \nthat our Founders feared perhaps more than anything else when they were \ntrying to set up a good governing document--was persecution of \nChristians. That is why so many people came to this country in its \nearliest days.\n  Christians were being persecuted, as has happened for over 2,000 \nyears. They thought if they came to America and\n\n\nthey could have a country where they could be free to practice their \nChristian beliefs without government prosecuting and persecuting them, \nthat it would be just a little slice of heaven on Earth, as much as you \ncould get while there is still so much evil in the world.\n  Now, as this country, led by its Supreme Court, others like the ACLU, \nand Freedom From Religion groups, they--we have already been told, you \ncan't mention God. You can't pray. You can't mention your religion. \nWell, that is certainly not what was the feeling of those who were the \npredominant Founders and those who made the best improvements in \nAmerica.\n  It was a Great Awakening, a huge revival in America. Before the mid-\n1700s, so much of the country turned to God, had Christian beliefs, \nBiblical beliefs, and their children--children like Sam Adams--grew up \nhaving such profound faith in God, profound faith in the Bible.\n  I was looking down the hall in what is right below the rotunda and \none of the signs up there mentioned Sam Adams. Sam Adams was called the \nFather of the American Revolution. He was a product of the Great \nAwakening in the 1700s.\n  He was so moral. I guess many people knew that he knew how to make \ngood beer. But he also had profound belief in the Bible, in God, in \nnature's God, and that is what drove him to push for a country where \nthere could be equality; where people could practice their religious \nbeliefs, whether they were atheists, Buddhists, Confucianists, Orthodox \nJews, Muslim, only so long as they did not believe that their religion \nshould overtake and supplant the U.S. Constitution, which is what \nradical Islamists believe.\n  We have now come to a place where Christians are being so vilified \nand belittled and besmirched that this country is beginning to look \nlike the places that the Christians that fled to America had to leave \nto avoid persecution.\n  So we get these Twitter comments that say--an article from the \nHuffington Post, naturally--playing up the ridicule of Christians.\n  One tweet from Rosanne Cash says: ``They were in a church that was \nfull of prayers. They need a government that will enable commonsense \ngun laws.''\n  Karen Tulmulty said: ``Thoughts and prayers for people who were mowed \ndown in a church sounds especially hollow.''\n  Michael McKean said: ``They were in church. They had the prayers shot \nright out of them. Maybe try something else.''\n  Keith Olbermann said: `` `Thoughts and prayers' again . . . idiot? \nThese people were in CHURCH. They WERE praying.''\n  Katie Mack said: ``At this point, `thoughts and prayers' just means \n`shut up and take it.'''\n\n\n  Wil Wheaton said: ``The murdered victims were in a church. If prayers \ndid anything, they would still be alive, you worthless sack of'' S-dot-\ndot-dot.\n  Chris Evangelista: ``They were already in a church . . . it's almost \nlike prayers do absolutely nothing and actual reform is needed.''\n  Marina Sirtis said: ``To all those asking for thoughts and prayers \nfor the victims . . . it seems that your direct line to God is not \nworking.''\n  Josh Gad: ``Terror attack that kills six gets travel bans same day. \nDeadliest mass shooting and deadliest church shooting ever get prayers \nand too soon to talk.''\n  Roxane Gay: ``After a mass shooting in a church, the phrase `thoughts \nand prayers' from the mouths of useless politicians becomes even more \nasinine.''\n  Robert McNamara: ``We need more than prayers. . . . Today's victims \nwere at church praying. We need sensible gun regulation and a ban on \nAR-15 weapons.''\n  By the way, if there were a ban on AR-15s, then the shooter would \nhave been allowed to continue shooting, and he probably would have \nkilled everybody in the church because the guy that stopped him, thank \nGod, had an AR-15 that he used to shoot him and get the carnage to \nstop.\n  Sara Bonaccori says: ``Clearly your prayers aren't working if a mass \nshooting can take place in a church. Maybe we can try a legislative \nsolution now?''\n  Mr. Speaker, it just goes on and on belittling Christians and \nbelittling people who believe in the power of prayer.\n  Then we had an article from The Hill today. Representative Jared \nHuffman in a news interview says that he thinks there is too much \nreligion in politics. Huffman told The Washington Post that he has for \nyears not answered questionnaires that ask him about religious beliefs \ninstead putting: unspecified or none of your business. I don't believe \nin religious tests.\n  I don't either. Although if somebody says they are a Christian and \nthey come before our committee and they keep making a big deal about \nhow I am a Christian, then, as we know even in court, credibility is \nalways an issue. If you say under oath you are one thing and it turns \nout you are not, then you are not really a Christian, you don't have \nChristian beliefs, and that is worth knowing.\n  You say you are a Christian? What does that mean? I will not hesitate \nto ask that if it is going to reflect not on their religious beliefs. I \nam not going to hold those against anybody. But if you say you are one \nthing and you are lying, that is important to find out.\n  Anyway, more of the same. There is a great article in National Review \nby David French, dated November 6: ``In the Face of Evil, Prayer Is the \nMost Rational and Effective Response.''\n  He points out that: ``While I disagree with atheists, my quarrel \nright now isn't with their disbelief, it's with their choosing this \nmoment to not only mock Christians but to also display their ignorance \nof basic Christian theology.\n  ``You see, the presence of evil--especially the increasing presence \nof evil--demands a prayerful response. Scripture is full of examples of \nGod's people crying out to Him in great distress. Jesus cried out to \nGod in His great distress. Time and again God responds in ways that \nbring healing and restoration to broken people and broken nations. He \nalways responds in some way--often not the way we ask or demand.''\n  If He were to intervene and stop all evil, then it means we become \nrobots; we don't have free choice. We become basically robots. As any \nparent knows, you can order your child to love you or to hug you, but \nthere is nothing that means more to your heart and soul than a sweet, \nlittle child running up to you voluntarily, throwing their arms around \nyou, and saying, ``I love you, Daddy'' from the heart.\n  If we have a Heavenly parent, doesn't it make sense that that \nHeavenly parent would want us free to choose to love the Heavenly \nparent?\n  The article says: ``Progressives always respond to mass shootings \nwith a series of proposals that wouldn't have stopped the mass \nshooting.''\n  Mr. Speaker, it is happening again. It is happening again. This \nshooter in Sutherland Springs, Texas, could not have lawfully possessed \nhis weapons, but he ignored existing gun laws. So who follows the laws \nif you pass laws to take away guns? The honest people, the ones who are \nvictims in a shooting like this. That is who follows.\n  There are laws in Texas that enable a church to be a gun-free zone, \nand apparently too many people assume every church is gun-free. If \nsomeone had had a gun in that church, there would not have been 25 \npeople killed.\n  So, Mr. Speaker, my thoughts and prayers are with the country, and I \nhope and pray others will join.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n", "turn": 1, "speaker": "Mr. GOHMERT", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "183", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H8685-H8690", "wkday": "Thursday", "day": "9", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "ISSUES OF THE DAY", "id": "CREC-2017-11-09-pt1-PgH8685-4", "title": "ISSUES OF THE DAY"}
