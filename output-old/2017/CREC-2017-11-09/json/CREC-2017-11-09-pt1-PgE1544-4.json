Mr. Speaker, I offer congratulations to the Wayzata High \nSchool Boys Soccer team on winning the Minnesota State Championship \nTitle.\n  The Trojans topped off their incredible 20-0-2 season by coming home \nwith the state championship trophy. It is inspiring to see a team that \nshows up with their best every day, and consistently comes out on top. \nAfter losing in the championship last year, they came back stronger \nthan ever to win the state title in 2017.\n  After a scoreless first half, sophomore Patrick Weah netted a goal \nthat eventually decided the match. The Wayzata keeper, Daniel Weshons \ndelivered a shutout after facing thirteen shots. Just before the \nbuzzer, Ethan Wagner put a second goal in the net to secure Wayzata's \nvictory.\n  Mr. Speaker, the championship title earned by the Trojans shows how \nhard work throughout the season and the ability to play under pressure \nalways pays off. These outstanding student-athletes have lived up to \ntheir obligations in the classroom and in the community.\n  Congratulations again to the players, coaches, and parents of the \nWayzata High School Boys Soccer team on becoming state champs. Go \nTrojans.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. PAULSEN", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 3}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "183", "extension": true, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "E1544", "wkday": "Thursday", "day": "9", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "WAYZATA SOCCER CHAMPS", "id": "CREC-2017-11-09-pt1-PgE1544-4", "title": "WAYZATA SOCCER CHAMPS"}
