Mr. Speaker, I rise today to oppose the Republican tax \nplan and to highlight another devastating proposal in it.\n  The Republican tax plan proposes to eliminate the medical expense \ndeduction. Eliminating this deduction could raise taxes on nearly 9 \nmillion people, including cancer patients and their families, seniors, \nand those with disabilities and chronic health plans.\n  Currently, people with high healthcare costs can deduct medical \nexpenses that exceed 10 percent of their total income. Let me give you \nan example.\n  If you are a retiree living in southern California suffering from \nmultiple sclerosis and you live on $75,000 a year annual pension, you \ncould write off $70,000 a year in medical expenses, giving that person \na tax break of about $20,000. Removing the itemized medical deduction \nwould spell financial disaster for that person.\n  Now, half of those claiming the deduction have an income below \n$50,000 per year. So just think about how devastating losing this \ndeduction will be.\n  I can't stand idly by while my Republican colleagues put forth a tax \nplan that takes money from the sickest and neediest among us in order \nto give tax cuts to corporations and the top 1 percent of earners. This \nis a bad bill.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Ms. BARRAGAN", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "183", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H8683", "wkday": "Thursday", "day": "9", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "OPPOSING REPUBLICAN TAX PLAN", "id": "CREC-2017-11-09-pt1-PgH8683-5", "title": "OPPOSING REPUBLICAN TAX PLAN"}
