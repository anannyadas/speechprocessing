And thank you \n     so much for your longstanding support of this project. You \n     have been a true soldier in the Eisenhower memorial army in \n     helping to get us here today.\n       I know I speak for all gathered for this memorable event, \n     when I say it is great to be here today.\n       First, let us reflect for a moment about a few members of \n     the Greatest Generation who brought us to this place today. \n     Ted Stevens and Dan Inouye--two giants in the Senate, who \n     authored the legislation to create the Eisenhower memorial.\n       When Ted and Danny started us down this path, it was both \n     an honor and privilege for me, a new senator from Kansas, to \n     be asked to help memorialize our most famous Kansan, Dwight \n     David Eisenhower.\n       Then there is our Chairman Emeritus, Rocco Siciliano, \n     another WWII veteran. For over a decade, Rocco led our \n     efforts. He did so with the qualities that made him \n     successful in government and the private sector: integrity \n     and inclusion.\n       When Rocco called me and said it was time to pass the \n     leadership torch--and would I agree to succeed him as \n     Chairman? I said, it would be an honor, but there was a \n     qualification:\n       I called another World War II vet, a great American who \n     fought for our country on the battlefield, in the House, in \n     the Senate, and on the campaign trail as our Republican \n     nominee for president, another really great Kansan, Bob Dole, \n     who also played a key role in making the World War II \n     Memorial a reality.\n       I said, ``Bob, I can't do this without you.'' And as he has \n     always done when his country called, he said, ``Pat, Ike is \n     my hero: I'm in.''\n       Ladies and gentlemen, I am not sure we would be standing \n     here today without the support of Bob Dole who stepped in as \n     Finance Chairman of the memorial. He called all the former \n     Presidents and Vice Presidents, and asked them to come on \n     board. And not one of them said, ``No.''\n       We were hoping Bob could join us today, he is watching on \n     C-Span, but please join me in thanking him for his lifelong \n     commitment and service to our nation and to this project. \n     Bob, thank you.\n       And I know we would not be standing here today without the \n     support and vision of the Eisenhower family. Their commitment \n     to making sure this memorial appropriately captured their \n     grandfather, as both General and President, has ensured \n     generations of Americans will know his legacy.\n       Being an Eisenhower fan is something of a tradition in the \n     Roberts family. In 1952, when I was just fifteen years old, I \n     was with my dad, Wes Roberts, at the Republican National \n     Convention in Chicago. I watched Ike receive the nomination \n     on the first ballot to be our party's candidate for President \n     of the United States.\n       Later, during his inauguration, I met President Eisenhower. \n     When he entered the room, whether you immediately saw him or \n     not, everyone knew it--with that ruddy face and great smile. \n     He had that special charisma.\n       And when I shook his hand that day, I never dreamed I would \n     be here this day leading the effort for his memorial on the \n     National Mall.\n       After all these years, Why do we ``Still Like Ike?'' If he \n     had done nothing else in life, his service as Supreme Allied \n     Commander, savior of western democracy, should earn him the \n     respect and admiration of every human being whose life, peace \n     and prosperity that victory made possible.\n       But it isn't just the magnitude of his service that we \n     revere. It is the manner in which he served. The quiet \n     humility. The strength and resolve. The man was so humble \n     that upon the surrender of the German Army, his message back \n     to Washington simply said, ``Mission Accomplished.''\n       Ike may not have coined the phrase, ``speak softly and \n     carry a big stick'' but he did embody it. It was not \n     necessary for him to raise his voice or wave his arms to \n     project strength. Those were the tactics of his adversaries.\n       He spoke quietly. He did not make idle threats. Yet, when \n     he did speak the force of his words was clear.\n       The story of Dwight David Eisenhower is the story of \n     America. His ascendency parallels America's. At the end of \n     the 19th century, Eisenhower was still a young man in\n\n\n     Kansas, and America was a young democracy--isolated and \n     protected by two vast oceans.\n       Over the course of his career, America matured both \n     politically and culturally, like that young man who left \n     Abilene, Kansas, to go to West Point.\n       By the time Eisenhower retired from public life, the United \n     States was the leader of the free world and at the summit of \n     historic prosperity and peace.\n       It has taken a long time for the historians to discover and \n     figure out Eisenhower's greatness. President Eisenhower \n     anticipated problems and averted them before they ever became \n     a crisis. His steady hand, his quiet strategy, didn't draw \n     attention like the administrations that followed him.\n       Now, six decades later, for that kind of unique leadership, \n     he is considered one of our greatest presidents, which is why \n     we are here today.\n       Like Lincoln, he came from very humble origins. He never \n     forgot the hometown that made him, and famously said, ``The \n     proudest thing I can claim is that I am from Abilene'' (June \n     22, 1945, Abilene, Kansas).\n       He saw the promise that America holds for everyone and the \n     reciprocal responsibility to serve the country that offered \n     him so much.\n       Ike's values were America's values--strength, humility, \n     discipline, integrity.\n       Now, we live in an era where it can seem those things no \n     longer matter.\n       But they do.\n       We wouldn't be where we are today without them.\n       We are here today to ensure Ike's place in American and \n     world history, for his achievements both as Supreme Allied \n     Commander Europe and as the 34th President of the United \n     States.\n       When asked about his legacy, Eisenhower responded, ``The \n     United States never lost a soldier or a foot of ground in my \n     administration. We kept the peace. People asked how it \n     happened--by God, it didn't just happen, I'll tell you \n     that.''\n       We build this memorial today not only to honor a single \n     person, but as a symbol for all generations of the greatness \n     of America and what our values have made possible at home and \n     abroad.\n       Lest anyone forget what can be achieved in the land of the \n     free and the home of the brave, let them come here and \n     understand what Eisenhower, and America, have done. And what \n     they, in turn, can do for themselves and for our nation's \n     future.\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "The RECORDER", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 3}], "header": {"chamber": "Senate", "num": "183", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "S7154-S7155", "wkday": "Thursday", "day": "9", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "EISENHOWER MEMORIAL GROUNDBREAKING", "id": "CREC-2017-11-09-pt1-PgS7154", "title": "EISENHOWER MEMORIAL GROUNDBREAKING"}
