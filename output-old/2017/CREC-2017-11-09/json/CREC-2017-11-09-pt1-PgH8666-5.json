Mr. Speaker, on behalf of my family and staff, I want \nto salute and commemorate the veterans of the U.S. Virgin Islands and \nthroughout the United States on this Veterans Day.\n  The Virgin Islands along with the other territories send more men and \nwomen per capita to serve in the U.S. military than anywhere else in \nthis Nation.\n  I would like to personally recognize Task Force Alpha on St. Croix, \nTask Force Bravo on St. Thomas, and St. John Responders.\n  On Veterans Day, we salute the men and women who have proudly worn \nthe uniform and the families who have served alongside them. We affirm \nour sacred duty as citizens to express our enduring gratitude, both in \nwords and actions, for their service.\n  As part of Veterans Day this year in the Virgin Islands, we will be \nhonoring female veterans in the territory. Being honored as parade \nmarshal and guest speaker on the island of St. Croix is Major Kathleen \nParris; on St. Thomas, Sergeant First Class Laurel Maloon-Francis, \nserving as parade marshal; and serving as guest speaker on the island \nof St. Thomas will be former military spouse, Monique Y.
