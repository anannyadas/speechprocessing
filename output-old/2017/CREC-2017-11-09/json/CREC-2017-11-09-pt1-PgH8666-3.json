Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to the Tax \nCuts and Jobs Act, also known as the ``Trick Trick Trick Act.''\n  This bill, Mr. Speaker, includes a $1.5 trillion cut to Medicare and \nMedicaid, raises taxes on middle-income families, and gives the biggest \ntax cuts to corporations and the wealthiest Americans.\n  This bill eliminates personal deductions for medical expenses, \ncreating further hardship for people facing illnesses; eliminates \ndeductions for State and local income taxes, resulting in higher taxes \nfor people who can't afford it; and eliminates deductions for interest \npaid on student loans, making quality education less accessible.\n  Proponents of the bill, Mr. Speaker, will have you believe that these \ntax cuts will benefit working families, grow our economy, and decrease \nthe Federal deficit. That is fake news. This bill does nothing more \nthan destroy the hopes and dreams of middle Americans seeking a stable \ncareer, a fulfilled life, and a brighter future.\n  The American people deserve better. I remain willing and able to work \nacross party lines to achieve responsible tax reform.\n  I say to my Republican colleagues: Do not pass this bill as a \nRepublican bill. It must be bipartisan. If you do it, you will regret \nit.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. BUTTERFIELD", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "183", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H8666", "wkday": "Thursday", "day": "9", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "THE TRICK TRICK TRICK ACT", "id": "CREC-2017-11-09-pt1-PgH8666-3", "title": "THE TRICK TRICK TRICK ACT"}
