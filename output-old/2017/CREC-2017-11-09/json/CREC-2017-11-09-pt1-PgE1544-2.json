Mr. Speaker, women represent the fastest growing \npopulation in the veteran community. The Department of Veterans' \nAffairs reports that in 2016 women accounted for nearly 10 percent of \nthe veteran population. This percentage will only increase in future \nyears. It is vital that we ensure women veterans receive quality care \nin a safe and dignified environment, as well as in a timely manner.\n  According to the Government Accountability Office, the Veterans \nHealth Administration does not have data and performance measures to \ndetermine women veterans' accessibility to gender-specific care \ndelivered through certain community care programs. GAO also reports \nthat VHA does not have accurate or complete data regarding VA medical \ncenters' compliance with environment of care standards for women \nveterans. Medical centers must conduct regular inspections and report \ninstances of noncompliance, but sometimes these cases are not reported \nto VHA.\n  Therefore, I am introducing the Improving Oversight of Women \nVeterans' Care Act. This legislation will enhance the monitoring needed \nfor effective oversight of women veterans' healthcare in and out of the \nDepartment of Veterans' Affairs. To accomplish this goal, the bill will \nrequire VA to report to Congress on women veterans' accessibility to \ngender-specific healthcare in any community of care program and require \nVA medical facilities to report to the Secretary on their compliance \nand noncompliance with quality care standards.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. CORREA", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 3}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "183", "extension": true, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "E1544", "wkday": "Thursday", "day": "9", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "INTRODUCTION OF THE IMPROVING OVERSIGHT OF WOMEN VETERANS' CARE ACT", "id": "CREC-2017-11-09-pt1-PgE1544-2", "title": "INTRODUCTION OF THE IMPROVING OVERSIGHT OF WOMEN VETERANS' CARE ACT"}
