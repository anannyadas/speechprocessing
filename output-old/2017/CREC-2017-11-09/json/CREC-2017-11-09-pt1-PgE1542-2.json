Mr Speaker, I rise today in recognition of the new Town \nHall in Plymouth, Massachusetts.\n  On November 12th, America's hometown will be celebrating its \ncommunity with the opening of the new Plymouth Town Hall. This event \nwill be marked by a walk from the old Town Hall to the new Town Hall \nwith everyone who contributed to this new landmark.\n  Construction on the new Town Hall began just two years ago, in the \nfall of 2015. I commend the town leadership and the residents of \nPlymouth for their collaboration on this community project. This would \nnot have been possible without the dedication of all of those who were \ninvolved, from the over 40 volunteers who helped generate support for \nthe project over local coffee and tea events, to the residents who \nadvocated for the project at Town Meeting, to the many involved in the \nconstruction and restoration efforts. The level of planning and \noutreach involved in this project serves as a powerful example of how \nlocal government working together with community members can be a \ntremendous success.\n  This project involved the restoration of the historic 1820 \nCourthouse. The Community Preservation Committee worked with a \nhistorical restoration team and many volunteers to return this building \nto its original glory. The centuries-old judge's bench in the \ncourthouse is now set to be the new location for selectmen's meetings. \nAmong the many 1800s-era pieces incorporated into the newly renovated \nbuilding is its American Eagle Weathervane, which traveled aboard the \nferry to Nantucket to be restored.\n  Located at 26 Court Street in the heart of downtown Plymouth, this \nTown Hall will be a centerpiece for the town, including during the \n400th anniversary of Plymouth just a few years away, in 2020.\n  Mr Speaker, I am proud to recognize the celebration of the new \nPlymouth Town Hall and the dedication of the entire Plymouth community.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. KEATING", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 3}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "183", "extension": true, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "E1542", "wkday": "Thursday", "day": "9", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "IN RECOGNITION OF THE NEW PLYMOUTH TOWN HALL", "id": "CREC-2017-11-09-pt1-PgE1542-2", "title": "IN RECOGNITION OF THE NEW PLYMOUTH TOWN HALL"}
