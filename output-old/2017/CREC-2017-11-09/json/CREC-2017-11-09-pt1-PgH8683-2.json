Mr. Speaker, tomorrow marks the 242nd \nbirthday of the U.S. Marine Corps.\n  In today's own unpredictable world, the Marines are as important and \nessential now as ever before.\n  I am proud to have a member of the Marine Corps serving in my \nWashington office as a legislative fellow. Paul Camacho achieved the \nrank of staff sergeant during his service from 2000 to 2008. He is a \nnative of Philadelphia and served as a field artillery cannoneer.\n  At one point, Paul was the youngest marine in the entire Marine \nCorps, an achievement that is celebrated each year during cake-cutting \nceremonies.\n  To Paul and all those who are part of ``The Few. The Proud. The \nMarines,'' I say happy birthday and thank you for your service. Thank \nyou to all who have served in one of the most respected fighting forces \nin the world.\n  Mr. Speaker, it was President Ronald Reagan who said ``some people \nspend an entire lifetime wondering if they made a difference in the \nworld. But, the Marines don't have that problem.''\n  Happy birthday.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "183", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H8683", "wkday": "Thursday", "day": "9", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "HAPPY 242ND BIRTHDAY TO THE UNITED STATES MARINE CORPS", "id": "CREC-2017-11-09-pt1-PgH8683-2", "title": "HAPPY 242ND BIRTHDAY TO THE UNITED STATES MARINE CORPS"}
