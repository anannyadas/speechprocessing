May our Nation be faithful to those still with us, \nproviding whatever their needs may be after they gave years of their \nlives in service to our country rather than dedicated to personal gain. \nThey are an inspiration to us, and we should not forget nor neglect our \nresponsibility to them.\n  As the Nation pauses to show its respect, may we be forever grateful \nfor the blessings You have bestowed upon the United States of America. \nMay our Nation continue to be a beacon of hope for the world, and may \nall we do be for Your greater honor and glory.\n  Amen.\n", "kind": "Unknown", "speaker": "Unknown", "itemno": 0, "turn": -1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 1}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "183", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H8665", "wkday": "Thursday", "day": "9", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "PRAYER", "id": "CREC-2017-11-09-pt1-PgH8665-2", "title": "PRAYER"}
