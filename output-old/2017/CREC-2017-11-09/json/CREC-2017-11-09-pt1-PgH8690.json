Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the Speaker for recognizing \nme and indicating that I can speak for an hour. We get caught up in so \nmany issues here that we sometimes don't explore them in depth, and \nwith 1 hour, I plan to look in depth first at the President's trade \npolicy toward China, and then toward the Republican tax bill.\n  The President is meeting again with President Xi from China. They \nwill put out a beautiful joint statement, they will pose for \nphotographs, and there will even be a business deal or two to announce.\n\n\n  These are the two largest economies in the world. They involve tens \nof trillions of dollars. So every month, a few big things happen that \nare bad, and one or two big things happen that are good. There is \nalways a particular business deal that you can package and wrap as a \nphoto op.\n  But the fact is that we have to look at the overall trading \nrelationship. The trading relationship is this: we run hundreds of \nbillions of dollars of trade deficit, and every billion dollars of \ntrade deficit cost us 10,000 jobs.\n\n  So let's look at what has happened while President Trump has been in \noffice. We look each month at our trade and goods with the People's \nRepublic of China, and we start with a deficit of just a bit over $22 \nbillion, and for the most recent statistics available, August of this \nyear, we are up to almost $35 billion.\n  What is interesting about this chart is that every month Trump has \nbeen in office, our trade deficit with China has grown. Now, he can say \nthat he doesn't have the power to do anything about that; he just wants \nto be a pretend President, a pretense President, a posing President. He \ncan pose for a picture, but he doesn't have the authority to do \nanything.\n  That is completely wrong. Look at section 338 of the Tariff Act of \n1930, and you will see that the President acting alone could eliminate \nthis deficit by imposing tariffs on Chinese goods now. But he won't do \nthat because his plan--and what he has done over the last 2 years is he \ncampaigns like he is Bernie Sanders at least on these issues, and he \ngoverns like he is from Goldman Sachs which, of course, many of his \nadvisers actually are.\n  Even after the campaign was over in November of last year, the \ncampaign continues, and he continues to pretend to be in favor of the \ntrade policies associated with Bernie Sanders and others, and he \ncontinues to govern in the interests of Goldman Sachs.\n  Now, this chart does not reflect services because services trade \nbetween the United States and China is not available on a monthly \nbasis, but the trend would be exactly the same: huge growth in the \ndeficit month after month after month after month--February, March, \nApril, May, June, July, and August of this year--and likely to continue \nfor the other months that the President continues to serve and the \nstatistics become available.\n  Now, we are told perhaps that it is okay to give away all these \nAmerican jobs because we would need Chinese help to deal with North \nKorea. Let's see how that is working out. The President, prior to this \ntrip, had met with President Xi twice, and now we have a third meeting.\n  After those first two meetings, North Korea explodes a hydrogen bomb \nand tests a missile capable of reaching major cities in the mainland of \nthe United States all with the acquiescence of the Chinese Government. \nSo whether you are concerned with our national security or whether you \nare concerned with jobs and trade policy, we can no longer have a \nPresident who poses and pretends and ignores the statutory authority \nthat he has on laws that have been on the books since the 1930s.\n  Now let's talk about the Republican tax bill. This is a bill which \nwill raise taxes on millions of middle class families. Now, it gets \nworse in a few years. There is a bit of a bait-and-switch. They will \nwant to tell you: Just look at how this bill will affect your tax \nreturn in 2019.\n  If you plan to still be alive in 2027, take a look at the effect it \nis going to have then.\n  Let's look at middle class families--not the poorest 20 percent in \nour country, not the richest 20 percent--that middle 60 percent. \nRoughly 30 percent of those families in the middle class are going to \nsee a tax increase on their 2027 tax return, and that tax increase is \ncalculated at an average of $1,300 per family.\n  Let's look at the individual provisions to see how fair they are to \nmiddle class families. First, right off the bat, they take away the \npersonal exemption which, on next year's tax return, the first year \nthat this new bill would be effective, is worth $4,150 per person in \nyour family. That is nearly $21,000 for a family like mine of five.\n  They take away $21,000 of deductions even from the poorest families \nin America and from every middle class family as well. Now, they say \nthey are going to replace that with a child tax credit. But if your \nchildren are over age 16, that credit is limited to a few hundred \ndollars next year, and then they make it zero 5 years from now. So if \nyour kids are going to turn age 17 sometime in the next 5 years, they \nhave got your name on this bill.\n  They also do increase the standard deduction. But tens of millions of \nAmericans don't even take the standard deduction. They choose to \nitemize their deduction.\n  So one replacement is inapplicable in a few years to kids of a few \nyears old, and the other is inapplicable to the millions of families \nthat don't itemize their deductions. But even if it is applicable to \nyou, you are losing for a family of five $2,100 roughly. What about a \nfamily of six, a family of seven, a family of eight? Another $4,150 per \nchild, and they replace it with an increase in the standard deduction \nof $1,200 and a per-child credit of $600 or $300 or absolutely zero if \nyour kids are over age 16 and it is a few years from now.\n  Next, let's talk about moving expenses. The current code says that if \nyou are working at a factory, it closes down, and it is moving 100 \nmiles, 300 miles away, and you have to move your home, if you have to \nfind a new home to live in, you get to deduct your moving expense. They \ntake that away. But what do they leave? If you own a factory, you shut \nit down, and you move it to China, then all of the moving expenses are \ntax deductible.\n\n\n  Don't let them tell you they are taking away the moving expense \ndeduction. Sure, they are taking it away from individuals and \nemployees, but they are leaving the moving tax deduction for those who \nare moving their factories to China.\n  Of course, they take away the student loan debt interest deduction. \nIf you are investing in yourself, in a family member, or in education, \nthe interest deduction is wiped off your tax return. But if you are \ninvesting in a Chinese factory, the deductions are there for you. They \nare not anti-investment. They are just anti-investment in the skills \nand capacity of American workers.\n  Next is the medical deduction. There is a deduction for medical \nexpenses. It is available only to a few families with particularly \nlarge medical needs. You don't get the medical deduction unless your \nun-reimbursed medical expenses--thanks to the Affordable Care Act, most \npeople have at least decent insurance. You still have some medical \nexpenses that are out-of-pocket, but if your out-of-pocket medical \nexpenses exceed 10 percent of your income, then to the extent of that \nexcess, you can take a deduction.\n  If your out-of-pocket, uncovered medical expenses are 13 percent of \nyour income, you can deduct the 3 percent. That is not overly generous. \nIt is not even applicable to most families.\n  Who needs it?\n  People with disabilities, families with children with special needs, \nand people with cancer and other severe diagnoses. That is who they \ntarget.\n  They say: Well, if you make some money, and then you have to spend it \ndealing with medical services, dealing with therapies for special needs \nchildren, for disabled, for people with cancer. Well, just because you \ndon't have the money because you had to spend it on medical services \ndoesn't mean we can't tax you on the money. And they do.\n  Well, there is another group of people who are unlucky enough to have \nextraordinary expenses, and that is casualty losses. If you have a \nsmall fire or some small casualty, you are not going to get a \ndeduction. The deduction applies only when your casualty losses exceed \n10 percent of your income, and then only to the extent that they exceed \n10 percent of your income.\n  We have had the wildfires in my State of California, not to mention \nthe hurricanes in the Caribbean, and there are people who are going to \nsay: Well, thank God that if the disaster had to hit our community, it \nhit us in 2017, because our casualty losses are deductible.\n  But what about the next disaster?\n  People with uninsured, out-of-pocket losses exceeding 10 percent of \ntheir income will not get a deduction.\n  Here is the Republican response: Look, if it is an enormous disaster \nthat happens to take your house and the\n\n\nCNN cameras are there, then your congressional delegation can come beg \nfor a special tax rule for those affected by that disaster.\n  Well, first, what if your home burns down and CNN isn't there? It is \nnot part of an enormous disaster? It is just something that hits you \nand a couple of neighborhoods?\n  You will never get a special tax provision. We are not going to write \none for three or four people, or 30 or 40 people, or 80 or 90 people \naffected by a small brush fire.\n  But what if you are part of the next enormous catastrophe?\n  Your congressional delegation will be here, having to decide whether \nto bargain to give you a chance to take the same deduction that has \nbeen in the Tax Code since the 1950s, or whether to bargain to try to \nget disaster relief to rebuild the infrastructure and the public assets \nin your community.\n  Your congressional delegation probably doesn't have enough clout to \ndo both. So which are they going to do?\n  It is clearly wrong and unfair to tax people on that portion of their \nincome that they have to use to deal with a truly extraordinary \ncasualty loss.\n  But there is another provision. This one hasn't been talked about \nmuch. That is the way in which they index Tax Code provisions for \ninflation.\n  There are some of the provisions they don't index at all. So they say \nthat you can take your property tax deduction and itemize it--only the \nportion up to $10,000. Well, $10,000 sounds like a lot of money, but \nthey don't index it.\n  So what about 10 years from now? What about 20 years from now?\n  You say: Well, I won't be in my house 20 years from now.\n  Yes, but the person you sell your house to will be there. If they \nsay, ``My God, all the prices are higher, all the wages are higher, all \nthe taxes are higher,'' that $10,000 limit on property taxes means, ``I \ncan't deduct but half my property tax bill.'' That will be factored \ninto the price of your house.\n  As to the things affecting home ownership, no indexing. Everything \nthat looks big now gets smaller and smaller every year as a result of \ninflation. Oh, by the way, this tax bill is going to cause more \ninflation.\n  There are other provisions where they say they are keeping the \nindexing, but they change from CPI indexing to chained CPI indexing.\n  What does that mean?\n  It is a system for indexing the brackets less than what would be if \njust look at the Consumer Price Index.\n  You say: I am only going to be in the 25 percent bracket under this \nbill. As I get raises to just compensate me for inflation, I will still \njust be in the 25 percent.\n  No, you won't. If you are fortunate, your employer will adjust your \nwages for real inflation, but the brackets are only going to increase \nfor chained CPI.\n  We take away the State and local tax deduction. First, this is a \ndeparture, as other provisions are, from the concept that we should tax \npeople based on their ability to pay. If you make a certain salary \nan 10 percent of it is taken out and used by your local and State \ngovernments, then your ability to pay is the 90 percent of your salary \nyou get to keep.\n\n  But they don't want to tax you on what you keep after State and local \ntaxes. They want to tax you on the money that has already been spent on \ntaxes.\n  The effect of this is not just on the middle class families who are \ngoing to lose a tax deduction on their return and be taxed unfairly. If \nyou read what is put out by the rightwing think tanks, they say: We \nknow why we are pushing this State and local tax elimination. Because \nthat will create a political atmosphere where States like California \nand New York and New Jersey will slash the amount of money that they \nspend on things like public safety and education.\n  We won't just be affecting the people who are not taking the tax \ndeduction. We will be turning to poorer families and lower middle class \nfamilies who depend upon public schools, and it will just cause a \npolitical situation where less money is spent on local education.\n  So this doesn't just affect those who it affects on their tax return. \nThis affects everyone who lives in the community.\n  As I have alluded to before, they take away a big chunk of the home \nmortgage deduction, particularly to the person you would sell your \nhouse to later. If you sell your house--and God knows what the \ninflation rate may be. It may be significant. It may be $500,000, which \ndoesn't sound like a whole lot of money then, even though it does sound \nlike a big chunk of money now. I remember when $50,000 for a home was \nthought to be a very high price. Anyway, the home mortgage deduction is \nlimited for that buyer to $500,000 of mortgage. The property tax is \nlimited to $10,000 of property tax.\n  What effect is this going to have on the ability to sell your home, \nwhich, in many parts of the country, is your whole nest egg?\n  People pay a big mortgage payment every month and they have equity in \ntheir home. Maybe they can retire because they have got 20, 25 percent \nequity in their home.\n  Well, yesterday, before the Financial Services Committee, we had Mark \nZandi testify, who is one of the leading economists in this country, \nthe head of the economics operation at Moody's Analytics. He said that \nin major metropolitan areas, like the one I represent, we are going to \nsee a double-digit decline in home values as a result of this bill. A \nlot of that is the limit on home mortgage deduction and the property \ntax. There are other elements of this bill that also adversely affect \nhome prices. A double-digit decline.\n  Then what does that do to the community?\n  You may say: I don't own a home. I just work at a restaurant. I live \nin an apartment.\n  Who is going to come to that restaurant and how big are they going to \ntip if they have just gone to Zillow and seen the value of their home \nand they have seen a double-digit decline?\n  The whole community.\n  This affects people from the New York metro area, the Philly metro \narea, Los Angeles, San Diego, and Orange County in California.\n  You are sucking money out of the local economy and giving it to the \nFederal Government by taking away the State and local property tax \ndeduction. You are then slashing the value of homes with a double-digit \ndecline.\n  What money is going to be in circulation to buy goods and services to \nsupport the entire regional economy?\n  This is going to hit like a hurricane in areas of the country that \ndid not experience one.\n  My party is so focused on the great unfairness of this bill and the \nfact that it provides the bulk of its benefits to the top 5 percent and \neven the top 1 percent. That fact is hidden by the anomaly that most of \nthe economic projections of this bill don't even look at the repeal of \nthe estate tax. They only look at the income tax provisions. You can't \njust exclude a whole chunk of this tax bill in analyzing it.\n  We, as a party, are so focused on the huge unfairness that we almost \ndon't want to talk about the effect it will have on the overall \nnational economy. This isn't just an unfair bill. That isn't just a \nbill that enriches the rich. This is a deficit-exploding, outsource-\npromoting, job-killing, growth-reducing disaster for our Nation's \neconomy.\n  You want to know the effect of huge tax cuts on an economy?\n  Look at Kansas. They slashed their taxes and now a Republican \nlegislature is reversing it because of what that has done to tax \nreceipts and to the Kansas economy.\n  Let's take a look and see what effect this is likely to have at the \nnational level. I turn to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, \nwhere they say that this tax cut is an ineffective way to spur economic \ngrowth and is likely to harm the economy if it adds to the deficit.\n  Well, what is the plan in the budget Republicans all voted for?\n  To deliberately use this tax cut to increase the deficit by $1.5 \ntrillion. But the Congressional Budget Office, under the Republican \nadministration of this House and of this Congress, says it is going to \ndo $1.7 trillion. They say: Well, let's look at it more dynamically.\n  If you look more dynamically, it is going to increase the deficit by \n$2 trillion or $2.5 trillion, because it raises interest rates; it \nencourages offshore initial investment, stripping economic growth out \nof the United States, and for a host of reasons I will get to.\n  The more you look at the tax cut, the more apparent it is that it \nwill cut\n\n\neconomic growth and increase the deficit by even more than the $1.7 \ntrillion that the Congressional Budget Office, during Republican \ncontrol of Congress, is currently estimating.\n  Why is this?\n  Well, first, because incentives to invest in the Tax Code have little \nor no effect on privatization, according to a Congressional Research \nService report. The empirical evidence in numerous report shows that \nthe 2003 tax cuts had little impact on investment or employment.\n\n\n  Now, I speak with a little bit of experience here because I lived 20 \nyears of my life in the tax world, most of it right at the intersection \nof investment and tax law.\n  I sat with families and charged them a large amount per hour to \ndescribe what the latest tax law said and what effect it would have on \ndifferent investments. And my experience as a CPA and tax attorney and \ncertified tax law specialist by my State bar was identical to that of \nWarren Buffett, who said:\n\n       I have worked with investors for 60 years, and I have yet \n     to see anyone, not even when capital gains rates were 39.9 \n     percent or when they were 15 percent, as they are now, I have \n     never seen anyone shy away from a sensible investment because \n     of the tax rate on the potential gain. People invest to make \n     money, and potential taxes have never scared them off.\n\n  Now, that is why, when you look at the effect of this bill, you come \nto the conclusion, as the Congressional Budget Office did in looking at \nthe Bush tax cuts and whether to extend them or allow them to expire, \nthat, if you have taxes and you use that money to pay the deficit, that \ndoes more to help the economy. It is more important to fight the \ndeficit than it is to tell various families, often at the very high \nend, that they get a tax cut.\n  Well, let's look at American economic history. I designed this chart \nhere, and I focused it only after the 1986 tax cut for which Ronald \nReagan is famous. There were many things about our economy back in the \nearly 1980s, in the 1970s, and in the 1960s that aren't relevant today. \nWe didn't have the trade policies back in the 1970s that we have today.\n  So we look at the Ronald Reagan 1986 tax policy as slightly adjusted \nby George H.W. Bush. We look at the policies that we had--I know the \n1986 tax law. You think, well, that must have affected 1986. No, it \nreally became effective in 1988. So you look at 1988 to 1993 and you \nsee that we have economic growth of 2.67 percent.\n  Then, in 1994, you see the effect of the Clinton tax policies adopted \nin 1993, and we see economic growth of well over 4 percent. And these \nfigures here are real economic growth per year adjusted for inflation, \n4.4 percent.\n  So then George W. Bush gets elected, and starting in 2001, his tax \npolicies are adopted by this Congress and enacted into law, and we see \nthat economic growth is only 1.7 percent.\n  Now, those Bush tax policies continued in force until 2013 because \nDemocrats allowed them to stay in force until we finally adopted Obama \ntax policies, effective in 2013. Those policies continue to be in force \nright up to today.\n  The most recent statistics we have are up through September 30 of \nthis year. The economic growth under those policies has been 2.22 \npercent.\n  So what we have seen here is that, when we adopt Republican economic \npolicies and they become effective, we have substantially lower \neconomic growth than when we adopt Democratic tax policies and when \nDemocrats actually pass those policies and have the guts to pass those \npolicies and put them into law.\n  So you have got to admire the Republican Party. They are able to get \nMember after Member after Member to say, without any proof, that \ntrickle-down economics works, that if you just cut taxes, you somehow \nhelp the economy.\n  It doesn't matter if you can line up 100 Members to say the same \nfalsehood at the same lectern in the same congressional Hall on the \nsame House floor. What matters is the real history. And the real \nhistory is that the higher rates imposed under Democratic \nadministrations have not just led to higher tax revenues, they have led \nto higher rates of economic growth.\n  Well, why is this?\n  Well, first, and perhaps most important, is having money available \nfor business investment. There is a pool of savings capital available \nin our markets and in our economy, and the Republican proposal would \ncome in and scoop $1.2 trillion of that--take it out of the markets, \ntake it out of the banks where it could be lent to small businesses, \ntake it out of the bond markets where it can be used for expansions by \nbig business--and just use it to pay for the tax cuts.\n  No wonder tax cuts that increase deficits hurt business investment \nand hurt the economy.\n  But there is more. We then add to our national debt, and the national \ndebt is forever. Not only do we have the increase in the debt of $1.5 \ntrillion to $1.7 trillion, but that debt will be here not just 10 years \nfrom now; it is there forever. Your great-grandchildren are going to be \npaying interest on that debt.\n  Then we have the international impact. You see, their proposal \nprovides for a zero percent U.S. tax on any money made by any factory \nas long as you move that factory abroad. If the wage rates are too high \nin China, you can put it in Vietnam.\n  Now, in addition to saying you move your factory abroad, you pay zero \ntax on all the manufacturing profits because that manufacturing is \nbeing done abroad, we encourage moving the factory abroad. The work is \nbeing done abroad. We don't tax it.\n  But in addition, what is an area of economic activity where Americans \nexcel? It is the creation of intellectual property.\n  Well, manufacturing might be done abroad; the design, the patents, \nthe copyrights, the trade names, the marketing plans, the trade \nsecrets, the intellectual property is created here. Under this bill, \nnot only the profit you make on the foreign factory, but the profit you \nmake from all that intellectual property can pay almost a zero percent \nAmerican tax if you just take that patent and put it in a file in the \nCayman Islands.\n  Now, I don't want to say that our current system for taxing \ninternational transactions is anything that we can be proud of. The \npresent system, if you make money in a U.S. factory, there is a tax of \n35 percent; you make it in a foreign factory, we also have a tax of 35 \npercent, but you can defer it. So, right now, if you are just trying to \ndecide where to put the factory, you have got a tax in the United \nStates that you actually have to pay and a tax on a factory abroad that \nyou will pay eventually.\n\n  Well, what do they do? That take that 35 percent ``eventually'' tax \nand turn it into a zero percent ``forever'' tax. How much more \nincentive could they provide to move American factories overseas?\n  Now, the present system also has a problem in that you can defer tax \nonly on the money you keep offshore. So their solution is to say, well, \nbring it onshore. We will provide a little tiny tax on it, and then all \nthe money you made overseas the last 10 or 20 years, no U.S. tax, and \nat least the money gets repatriated.\n  Democrats are anxious to work with Republicans on repatriation. They \ncould probably get a more Republican plan adopted than one that I would \nendorse in this speech, but why not tax the unrepatriated money? That \nway we would be saying, bring that money back or don't bring it back, \nyou pay the same tax, so you might as well bring it back.\n  What we can also do is move to worldwide unitary apportionment: \neliminate all the tax gains, and most of them are international; \neliminate all the reasons to move factories abroad and generate another \n$1 trillion every 10 years for our Treasury. That is the system that we \nought to be moving to.\n  I am not here to say our present system is wonderful. I am here to \nsay that we should not adopt a Republican system because it moves us \neven further away from what would be a fair system that would not \nencourage offshoring.\n  Another way in which we are affected internationally is that this tax \nbill would change currency values, change the exchange rate between the \neuro, the yen, the Chinese currency, and other currencies around the \nworld in a way that will encourage Americans to import and discourage \nthose abroad from buying our products--just another economic harm.\n\n\n  Another economic harm is touted by the conservative supporters of \nthis policy. They say that by cutting taxes, we will get the Federal \nGovernment and State and local governments to spend less money on \ninfrastructure and education. Well, if you want to ask what is it that \nmakes a country wealthier than others, it is, first and foremost, the \neducation of its workers, and then, second, the infrastructure that is \navailable to productive activity.\n  In addition, as I mentioned before, they are going to cut the value \nof homes nationwide, most pronounced in the major metropolitan areas. \nWhat does that do to middle class spending, which drives our economy? \nIt drives that middle class spending down. Who is going to go out to a \nrestaurant if you have just been told that you have had a double-digit \ndecline in the value of your home?\n  This bill will also cause higher interest rates because the Federal \nGovernment is going to be borrowing another $1.5 trillion to $1.7 \ntrillion.\n  Now, so there is a difference between me and my party leadership. \nThey say that the main reason to vote against this bill is that it is \nunfair by giving huge tax breaks to the top 1 percent and increasing \ntaxes for millions of American families. I say you should vote against \nthis bill because it is a deficit-exploding, outsourcing-promoting, \njob-killing, economic growth-depressing bill. But I think we will \nagree, whether you vote against this bill because it is unfair or you \nvote against this bill because it is bad for our economy, you will be \nperforming an important service to our country.\n  Let me not neglect the fact that if you vote--that the bill isn't \ntotally without being useful to somebody. It will reduce taxes for the \nDonald Trump family by over $1 billion in estate tax and tens of \nmillions of dollars in income tax.\n  Maybe that is not enough for you. Look at what it will do for the \nKoch brothers--far more than it will do for the Trump family. So if \nthat is important to you, if that is the result you want to achieve, \nthen vote for the bill.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n", "turn": 1, "speaker": "Mr. SHERMAN", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "183", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H8690-H8694", "wkday": "Thursday", "day": "9", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "TAX REFORM", "id": "CREC-2017-11-09-pt1-PgH8690", "title": "TAX REFORM"}
