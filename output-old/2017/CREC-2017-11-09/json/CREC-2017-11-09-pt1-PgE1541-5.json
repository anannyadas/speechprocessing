Mr. Speaker, I rise today on behalf of an organization \nthat displays the unique beauty of my district around the entire world. \nThe Monterey County Film Commission has served my district on the \ncentral coast of California by inspiring, facilitating, and assisting \nin the production of media that highlights the pristine beauty, and \nunique culture of our community. This year, the Monterey County Film \nCommission celebrates its thirtieth anniversary. Since its inception, \nthe Commission has helped attract and assist in the production of \nhundreds of movies, television shows, commercials, documentaries and \nstill photography productions. Thanks to the work of the Commission, \nour community has benefited from over one hundred million dollars in \ndirect financial impact in our local communities.\n   The Commission serves as a liaison for movie producers, government \nentities and local businesses. It provides substantial information \nabout our Monterey County, and straightforward guidelines for filming \nprocedures that facilitate the development of successful media \nproductions. The Commission also serves our community by highlighting \nhighly desirable Monterey County locations through domestic and \ninternational tradeshows, sales trips and direct public advertising \ncampaigns. Beyond this, the Commission also contributes to growing the \nnext generation of young filmmakers, and is crucial in our communities' \neffort to create opportunity for creative-minded young people to find \nsuccess pursuing their passion.\n   I would also note that the Monterey Peninsula has been, and remains, \nhome to many prominent actors including Clint Eastwood and Betty White. \nClint Eastwood came to Carmel to film Play Misty for Me, and later \nbecome Mayor of Carmel. The Peninsula has hosted stars such as Marilyn \nMonroe and Barbara Stanwyck in Clash by Night. Over the years, the \nCentral Coast of California has attracted over two hundred films, \nhundreds of television programs and countless magazine ads. Most \nrecently, my district played home to the highly successful and \ncritically acclaimed HBO series Big Little Lies, filmed on the Monterey \nPeninsula, largely in Monterey and Pacific Grove.\n   The hard work of the staff and Board of Directors of the Monterey \nCounty Film Commission continues to provide our community and our \ncountry with great films and TV shows filmed in our beautiful district. \nMr. Speaker, it is my pleasure to recognize the dedication and hard \nwork the Monterey County Film Commission has given to the Central Coast \nand the entire State of California. I ask my distinguished colleagues \nto join me in recognizing the Monterey County Film Commission as an \nintegral part of our community.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. PANETTA", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 3}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "183", "extension": true, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "E1541", "wkday": "Thursday", "day": "9", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "HONORING THE MONTEREY COUNTY FILM COMMISSION", "id": "CREC-2017-11-09-pt1-PgE1541-5", "title": "HONORING THE MONTEREY COUNTY FILM COMMISSION"}
