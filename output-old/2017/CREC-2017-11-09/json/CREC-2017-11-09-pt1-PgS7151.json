I was joined by realtors and local \nelected officials to talk about how the GOP tax plan would hurt \nfamilies in my home State of Illinois. The families in the 6th \nCongressional District would be hit especially hard since they are in \nthe 12th highest district in terms of the benefit received from the \nState and local tax deduction--a deduction that is gutted in the \nRepublican House tax plan.\n  Republicans released this plan last Thursday, have been marking it up \nin committee this week, with the plan to have it on the House floor \nnext week.\n  It is already clear that this partisan plan does nothing more than \ndouble-down on some of the most damaging ideas from the framework \ncongressional Republicans and the White House released in September--\nand the bill gets worse the closer you look.\n  The House Republican bill would bankroll massive tax cuts for the \nwealthy few and the largest corporations on the backs of hard-working \nfamilies in Illinois and across the country.\n  The bill eliminates some of the most vital tax breaks for people in \nIllinois--making it so that struggling seniors no longer will be able \nto deduct costly out-of-pocket medical expenses and that the 1.5 \nmillion Illinoisans with Federal student loan debt will no longer be \nable to deduct the interest paid on those loans.\n  Congressional Republicans didn't stop at eliminating deductions for \nmedical expenses and student loan interest.\n  Republicans want to take away one of the most valuable deductions for \nworking families in this State--the State and local tax deduction.\n  Eliminating this deduction to fund a massive tax cuts for \ncorporations and the ultrawealthy was a centerpiece of the Framework \nRepublicans released earlier this year--a move that would raise taxes \non one-third of all taxpayers.\n  After strong opposition within their ranks for eliminating the State \nand local tax deduction, the House Republican plan released last week \nproposes a ``compromise'' to obtain the support of congressional \nRepublicans that represent States like Illinois.\n  This so-called compromise eliminates the tax deduction for State and \nlocal income taxes, and caps the deduction for property taxes, so \ninstead of eliminating the deduction altogether, they just gut it. If \nyou ask me, that is no compromise at all.\n  The result is still the same: middle-income families would still be \ndouble taxed when it comes to income, sales, and some property taxes--\nonce by the Federal Government and again by the State.\n  This would make it more expensive for families to fund services at \nthe local level like the local schools, police and fire departments, \nand local roads and bridges.\n  Make no mistake, in Illinois--the State with the fifth highest number \nof taxpayers claiming the State and local tax deduction--would be hit \nespecially hard. Nearly 2 million Illinoisans--roughly one-third of \ntaxpayers in the State--claimed more than $24 billion in State and \nlocal tax deductions in 2015 alone.\n  If Republicans are successful in eliminating or gutting this \ndeduction, it will mean a tax hike for working families across \nIllinois.\n  If completely eliminated, a family of four living in a place like \nCrystal Lake making around $76,000 per year would pay more than $1,400 \nmore in taxes each year.\n  And what do Republicans do with the money from raising taxes on one-\nthird of middle-income families in Illinois? They give the ultrawealthy \nand the largest corporations a tax cut.\n  That is just plain wrong.\n  I urge House Republicans to oppose any tax plan that would raise \ntaxes on middle-income families by gutting the State and local tax \ndeduction in order to give cuts to the largest corporations and richest \n1 percent.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. DURBIN", "itemno": 0}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 1}], "header": {"chamber": "Senate", "num": "183", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "S7151", "wkday": "Thursday", "day": "9", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "REPUBLICAN TAX PLAN", "id": "CREC-2017-11-09-pt1-PgS7151", "title": "REPUBLICAN TAX PLAN"}
