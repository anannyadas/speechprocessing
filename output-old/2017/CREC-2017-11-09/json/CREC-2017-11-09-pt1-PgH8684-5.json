Mr. Speaker, as a nation, we find ourselves in seemingly \nuncertain times: instability in North Korea, terrorism throughout the \nworld, and divisiveness on so many fronts. Yet across our Nation, young \nmen and women continue to step up to serve when their country needs \nthem most. They serve our great Nation willingly, honorably, and \nwithout bias.\n  In the 1940s, when an unprecedented attack on American soil led us \ninto the Second World War, our brave men and women in uniform stood up \nto defend our Nation.\n  In the 1950s, when our country faced the spread of communism to \nKorea, it was our veterans who were there.\n  In the 1960s and 1970s, when the United States was brought into the \nwar in Vietnam, knowing there would be no hero's welcome when they came \nhome, our men and women were steadfast.\n\n\n  In the first Gulf War, Operation Enduring Freedom, Operation Iraqi \nFreedom, and the many missions they have faced in the past two decades, \nour soldiers, sailors, airmen, marines, and coastguardsmen have \ndefended our great Nation from those who wish to do us harm.\n  On this Veterans Day, I submit to our men and women: Your service is \nnot over and your mission is not complete. Now, more than ever, your \ncountry needs you. Stand up. Tell your story. The next generation needs \nto hear from you. We are forever grateful for your service.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. BERGMAN", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "183", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H8684-H8685", "wkday": "Thursday", "day": "9", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "FOREVER GRATEFUL FOR OUR VETERANS", "id": "CREC-2017-11-09-pt1-PgH8684-5", "title": "FOREVER GRATEFUL FOR OUR VETERANS"}
