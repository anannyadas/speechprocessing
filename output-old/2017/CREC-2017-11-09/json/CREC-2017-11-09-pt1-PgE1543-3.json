Mr. Speaker, currently, spouses and dependent children of \nactive-duty servicemembers may be buried in a VA national cemetery if \npredeceased by the servicemember. However, if the spouse or dependent \nchild passes away before the servicemember, current law does not \nexplicitly authorize their burial.\n  Since becoming aware of this gap in their burial authority, the \nNational Cemetery Administration has been processing requests for \nburial of spouses and eligible dependent children of active duty \nservicemembers in a VA national cemetery on case-by-case basis, using a \ndesignation of discretionary authority.\n  Today, I am introducing the Servicemember Family Burial Benefits Act \nto address the ability of the Department of Veterans' Affairs to bury \nan active-duty servicemember's loved ones if they pass away before the \nservicemember. My legislation will allow active duty servicemembers to \nbury their spouse or eligible dependent child, if they choose, in a VA \nnational cemetery and authorize VA to provide headstones and markers \nfor spouses and eligible dependent children. Finally, the language will \nallow state and tribal veterans cemeteries to provide this benefit in \nthe same manner as VA national cemeteries. This legislation will allow \nactive duty servicemembers the opportunity to choose to bury their \nloved one, lost while the servicemember is serving our nation, in a VA \nnational cemetery. At their own time of need, servicemembers will have \nthe option to be buried in a national cemetery with their loved ones.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. CORREA", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 3}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "183", "extension": true, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "E1543", "wkday": "Thursday", "day": "9", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "SERVICEMEMBER FAMILY BURIAL ACT", "id": "CREC-2017-11-09-pt1-PgE1543-3", "title": "SERVICEMEMBER FAMILY BURIAL ACT"}
