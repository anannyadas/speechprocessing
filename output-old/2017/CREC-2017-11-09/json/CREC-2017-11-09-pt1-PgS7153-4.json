{"content": [{"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "C000141", "text": "  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, this Saturday is Veterans Day. On this \n11th day of the 11th month each year, we pause to honor and pay tribute \nto our veterans and the countless sacrifices they have made to serve \nour country. We also honor their families, who have endured extended \nabsences and profound personal challenges as they have watched those \nmost precious to them put themselves in harm's way. In that spirit of \ngratitude, I want to recognize some of Maryland's bravest and finest \nservicemembers who have given the last full measure of devotion to our \nNation.\n  Sgt. Eric M. Houck, 25, died from gunshot wounds in the Peka Valley \nof\n\n\nthe Nangarhar Province in Afghanistan this past June. Sergeant Houck, \nwho began his military career as a private and rose to the rank of \nsergeant in just 3 years, was an avid sports fan. His father called \nEric his best friend and said that his family, particularly his two \nyoung children, were everything to him. He was only 1 month shy of \nreturning home.\n  Navy PO1 Xavier Martin, age 24, died aboard the USS Fitzgerald during \nits tragic collision off the coast of Japan in June. Petty Officer \nMartin was an exemplary sailor and the youngest petty officer with a \nrank of first class aboard the USS Fitzgera1d. He was so well-loved, \nmore than 100 friends and family traveled from around the country and \nthe globe to attend his funeral.\n  U.S. Air Force pilot and Annapolis native Eric Schultz was killed in \nan aircraft crash in early September. Lieutenant Colonel Schultz was a \ncombat veteran and an exceptionally talented Air Force test pilot with \nmore than 2,000 hours of flying. He held six degrees, including a Ph.D. \nin aerospace engineering, but was described by friends and family as \nthe most humble man they have ever known. ``If you met him in a social \nenvironment, you would never know he was a Ph.D. or a pilot,'' his \nfather said.\n  Timothy Eckels and Kevin Bushell were among the sailors killed during \nthe collision of the USS John McCain in August. Information System \nTechnician 2nd Class Eckels was a graduate of Manchester Valley High \nSchool and was described as being ``known for making everyone better by \nhis presence'' and a true pleasure to be around. He was just 23 years \nold. Electronics Technician 2nd Class Bushell was not much older, at \nonly 26, and a talented technician for the Navy. He proudly served for \n7 years.\n  There are many other Marylanders, many other families, who have \nsuffered unfathomable loss and injury, and all of them deserve our \ncollective and eternal gratitude.\n  They also deserve to have the many promises we have made kept. They \ndeserve the job training, education assistance, and housing benefits \nthey have earned. They deserve every tool and resource they need to \nsucceed both professionally and personally once they return home. They \ndeserve leaders who consider their sacrifice every day, not only on \nVeterans Day.\n  Let us honor our veterans in ways that are truly befitting their \nservice: by vowing to protect the benefits they have earned. By \npledging to remain grateful for their service and concerned for their \nneeds every day, not only on this day and, perhaps most critically of \nall, by recommitting ourselves to the causes for which they served.\n  Today, I salute every man and woman who has put on a uniform and \nhumbly thank every one of their families for braving the worst fears \nand the toughest challenges in service to our Nation.\n  (At the request of Mr. Schumer, the following statement was ordered \nto be printed in the Record.)", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. CARDIN", "itemno": 0}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "T000464", "text": " Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, today I wish to honor the prisoners \nof war and those missing in action and commemorate the empty chair that \nwas placed in Emancipation Hall this Veterans Day week.\n  I want to thank Montana veteran Ed Saunders for contributing his \nthoughts to today's Congressional Record:\n\n       The greatest tragedy befalling an American serviceman or \n     woman is not that they may be killed or left missing-in-\n     action: that is the greatest sacrifice on the altar of \n     freedom.\n       The greatest tragedy is that America's finest in uniform \n     may be forgotten . . . forgotten in life and in forgotten in \n     death by the very same nation whose constitution, freedoms, \n     and way of life, they defend.\n       The United States of America cannot and must not leave any \n     serviceman or woman behind in body, in spirit, or in memory.\n       If we cannot bring home the revered mortal remains of those \n     who died, who are missing, or who remain unaccounted for, \n     then we have an enduring responsibility to ensure their \n     memory remains forever etched in these hallowed halls.\n\n  This chair is more than a symbol. It is a memory of their service and \nsacrifice for this great Nation. It is a lasting reminder that we have \nan obligation to fulfill our promise to our Nation's veterans and their \nfamilies when they return from war--and when they tragically don't.\n  We, as a nation, must redouble our commitment to that cause and work \nrelentlessly every day toward fulfilling that promise.\n  I want to thank every servicemember in attendance, your families, the \nfamilies of the fallen and missing in action, and those who remember \nthem.\n  Thank you, and God Bless America.\n", "turn": 1, "speaker": "Mr. TESTER", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "Senate", "num": "183", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "S7153-S7154", "wkday": "Thursday", "day": "9", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "VETERANS DAY", "id": "CREC-2017-11-09-pt1-PgS7153-4", "title": "VETERANS DAY"}
