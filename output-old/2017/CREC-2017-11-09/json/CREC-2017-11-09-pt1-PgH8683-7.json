Mr. Speaker: ``Let us strive to bind up our Nation's \nwounds, to care for him who have borne the battle, his widow, and his \norphan.''\n  Those words were declared by President Abraham Lincoln at his second \ninaugural address where he set out our Nation's obligation to our \nveterans.\n  On the eve of Veterans Day, I rise to honor our heroes, the men and \nwomen who served our Nation, and remind us of our responsibility to \nthose, our veterans.\n  Now, in my district, on the central coast of California, nearly \n30,000 veterans live in that area, an area imbued with military \nhistory, from the former Fort Ord to the many military installations \nthat are on Active Duty now, to the men and women who have served in \nour community and kept the security of our country safe.\n  It has been those servicemembers and their families who have not only \nserved, but stayed in our community, who have fulfilled that obligation \nby serving those who served us. Now we have a healthcare clinic, the \nVA-DOD General Gurley health clinic; we have the Central Coast Veterans \nCemetery; we have the Veterans Transition Center; and we have a \nVeterans Treatment Court.\n  On this Veterans Day, we not only want to thank our veterans for \ntheir service, but we recommit ourselves to serving those who served \nus.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. PANETTA", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "183", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H8683-H8684", "wkday": "Thursday", "day": "9", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "HONORING OUR NATION'S VETERANS", "id": "CREC-2017-11-09-pt1-PgH8683-7", "title": "HONORING OUR NATION'S VETERANS"}
