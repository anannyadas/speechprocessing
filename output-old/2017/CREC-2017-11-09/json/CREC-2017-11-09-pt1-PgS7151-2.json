Mr. President, I want to take a few minutes to thank \nJudge Ann Claire Williams for her extraordinary service to our country. \nAfter serving nearly two decades on the Seventh U.S. Circuit Court of \nAppeals in Chicago, Judge Williams announced she would be retiring from \nthe judiciary later this year.\n  Ann Claire Williams is a trailblazer. She is the first African \nAmerican to serve on the Seventh U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals--an \naccomplishment that one judge called: ``the desegregation of the 7th \nCircuit.'' This was just another in a series of firsts for Judge \nWilliams. She was one of the first two African-American women to clerk \nfor judges on the Seventh Circuit. In 1985, Judge Williams became the \nfirst African American woman to become a U.S. District Court judge for \nthe Northern District of Illinois. She served as chair of the Court \nAdministration and Case Management Committee of the United States \nJudicial Conference--making her the first African American chair of a \nJudicial Conference committee. Judge Williams also became the first \nAfrican American president of the Federal Judges Association. Simply \nput, almost every step of her career has broken new ground.\n  Born in Detroit, MI, Ann Claire Williams began her career as a third \ngrade music teacher after graduating from Wayne State University with a \nbachelor's degree in elementary education and master's degree from the \nUniversity of Michigan in guidance and counseling. Inspired by the \ntelevision show ``Perry Mason'' the only lawyer she knew growing up--\nand a competitive spirit, Ann decided to attend law school. She chose \nthe University of Notre Dame and the rest is history--or more \nappropriately, the rest of her career made history.\n  Judge Williams has been the recipient of numerous honors and awards. \nHere are just a few: Chicago Lawyer 2000 Person of the Year; the \nArabella Babb Mansfield Award from the National Association of Women \nLawyers; the National Bar Association's Gertrude E. Rush Award; the \nAmerican Bar Association's Margaret Brent Women Lawyers of Achievement \nAward; Chicago Inn of Court's Joel M. Flaum Award; American Judicature \nSociety's Edward J. Devitt Distinguished Service to Justice Award; the \nBlack Women Lawyers' Association of Greater Chicago's Pioneer Award; \nthe Leadership Institute for Women of Color Attorneys, Inc.'s Breaking \nthe Glass Ceiling Award; and was recognized by Newsweek Daily Beast as \none of 2012's 150 Fearless Women in the World.\n  Judge Williams has always been proud of breaking barriers and her \nhistory of firsts, but she doesn't want to be the last. Throughout her \ncareer, she has been committed to training young lawyers. As a founding \nmember of the Black Women Lawyers in Chicago, Judge Williams uses her \nstory to inspire the next generation--and makes clear through her \nexperiences that young women today can follow the path she paved to \nreach the top of their fields. She also serves as chairwoman of the \nJust The Beginning Foundation to help guide more minority law students \ninto the legal profession. Under Judge Williams' leadership, the \norganization has grown to include programs for students in high school \nand middle school across the country. For all her achievements, it is \nher commitment to the future that is truly inspiring.\n  Recently, Judge Williams said.\n\n       You want to be nourished by people that understand your \n     story and your experience. But once you're nourished that \n     means you have to go out and deal with the broader world.\n\n  Well, Judge Williams has done just that. She serves on the board of \nEqual Justice Works, a nonprofit dedicated to creating a just society \nby training lawyers committed to working in the public interest, and \ndespite her busy schedule, she has made time to travel to Ghana, \nRwanda, Liberia, and Uganda to train judges and attorneys.\n  Judge Williams' career is groundbreaking, and she is a role model for \ncountless young women of color--and an inspiration to the rest of us. I \nam proud to call her a friend.\n  I want to congratulate Judge Williams on an outstanding career and \nthank her for all she has done--and all she will continue to do. The \ncountry is grateful for her service. I wish her and her family all the \nbest in her next chapter.\n\n\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. DURBIN", "itemno": 0}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 1}], "header": {"chamber": "Senate", "num": "183", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "S7151-S7152", "wkday": "Thursday", "day": "9", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "TRIBUTE TO ANN CLAIRE WILLIAMS", "id": "CREC-2017-11-09-pt1-PgS7151-2", "title": "TRIBUTE TO ANN CLAIRE WILLIAMS"}
