Mr. Speaker, as Members of Congress we know well, \nperhaps better than most, how blessed our nation is to have in reserve \nsuch exceptional young men and women who will go on to become leaders \nin their local communities, states, and the nation in the areas of \nbusiness, education, government, philanthropy, the arts and culture, \nand the military.\n  We know this because we see them and benefit from their contributions \nevery day. Many of them work for us in our offices as junior staff \nmembers, congressional fellows, or interns and they do amazing work for \nand on behalf of the constituents we are privileged to represent.\n  Mr. Speaker, I believe there is no higher calling than the call to \nserve a cause larger than ourselves. That is why I ran for public \noffice. I was inspired to serve by President Kennedy who said, ``Ask \nnot what your country can do for you, ask what you can do for your \ncountry,'' and by the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. who said:\n  ``Everybody can be great because anybody can serve. . . . You only \nneed a heart full of grace. A soul generated by love.''\n  By this measure, there are several other great young men and women \nwho served as volunteers this year in my offices. They may toil in \nobscurity but their contributions to the constituents we serve are \ndeeply appreciated. That is why today I rise to pay tribute to two \nextraordinary young persons for their service to my constituents in the \n18th Congressional District of Texas and to the American people. They \nare: Shannon O'Quinn from Texas Tech University; and Lauren Butia from \nThe Madeira School.\n  Mr. Speaker, the energy, intelligence, and idealism these wonderful \nyoung people brought to my office and those interning in the offices of \nmy colleagues help keep our democracy vibrant. The insights, skills, \nand knowledge of the governmental process they gain from their \nexperiences will last a lifetime and prove invaluable to them as they \ngo about making their mark in this world.\n  Because of persons like Shannon and Lauren the future of our country \nis bright and its best days lie ahead. I wish them well.\n  Mr. Speaker, I am grateful that such thoughtful, committed young men \nand women can be found working in my office, those of my colleagues, \nand in every community in America. Their good works will keep America \ngreat, good, and forever young.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Ms. JACKSON LEE", "itemno": 5}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 6}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "183", "extension": true, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "E1542", "wkday": "Thursday", "day": "9", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "TRIBUTE TO YOUNG STAFF MEMBERS FOR THEIR CONTRIBUTIONS ON BEHALF OF THE PEOPLE OF THE 18TH CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT OF TEXAS AND THE UNITED STATES", "id": "CREC-2017-11-09-pt1-PgE1542", "title": null}
