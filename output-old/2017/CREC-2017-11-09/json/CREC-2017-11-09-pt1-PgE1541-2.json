Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of the long and \ndistinguished career of Barbara C. Higgens on the occasion of her \nretirement. After 19 years of dedication and commitment, she is \nstepping down as CEO of Plumbing Manufacturers International (PMI).\n   Since its founding in 1998, Ms. Higgens has nurtured and grown PMI's \nvisibility and influence within the United States and abroad. Ms. \nHiggens revamped the organization from her kitchen table as its first \nemployee. She went on to hire dedicated professional staff and \nsignificantly enhanced the association's advocacy, technical, water \nconservation, environmental, and trade initiatives. Today, PMI is the \nnation's leading plumbing manufacturing trade association representing \n90 percent of all the plumbing fixtures and fittings sold in the United \nStates.\n   Under her leadership, PMI has grown into an advocate for water-\nefficient products meeting high safety and performance standards. She \nwas instrumental in the introduction and passage of a federal \nnationwide law to reduce lead in plumbing products, known as the \nReduction of Lead in Drinking Water Act, which was designed to \nsafeguard all Americans.\n   Mr. Speaker, please join me in celebrating this special occasion and \nwishing Barbara Higgens every happiness in her well-deserved \nretirement.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. ROSKAM", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 3}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "183", "extension": true, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "E1541", "wkday": "Thursday", "day": "9", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "HONORING BARBARA HIGGENS", "id": "CREC-2017-11-09-pt1-PgE1541-2", "title": "HONORING BARBARA HIGGENS"}
