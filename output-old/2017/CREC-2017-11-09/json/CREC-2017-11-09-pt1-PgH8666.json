Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of every \nimmigrant who has been granted temporary protective status in my \ndistrict and across the Nation. We have nearly 23,000 in Maryland, the \nsixth highest in the country, and 4,000 in my district, one of the top \nfive districts in the country.\n  Many people with TPS fled countries such as Haiti, El Salvador, \nSomalia, and Syria, ravaged by armed conflict or environmental \ndisasters. For over 20 years, they have raised their families here in \nthe United States. They are our neighbors and our coworkers. Their kids \nattend our schools. TPS holders have been woven into the fabric of our \ncommunities.\n  Earlier this week, those from Nicaragua were told they will be \ndeported. Those from Honduras are next. Deporting people and giving \nthem mere months to pack their bags after 20 years in the United States \nis cruel and isn't who we are as Americans.\n  Mr. Speaker, as the Trump administration puts the lives of thousands \nin legal limbo, I urge my colleagues to ensure TPS holders can stay and \npursue an earned path to citizenship.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. BROWN of Maryland", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "183", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H8666", "wkday": "Thursday", "day": "9", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "SUPPORTING IMMIGRANTS GRANTED TEMPORARY PROTECTED STATUS", "id": "CREC-2017-11-09-pt1-PgH8666", "title": "SUPPORTING IMMIGRANTS GRANTED TEMPORARY PROTECTED STATUS"}
