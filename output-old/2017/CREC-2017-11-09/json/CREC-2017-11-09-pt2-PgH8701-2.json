We \n     found that climate instability will lead to instability in \n     geopolitics and impact American military operations around \n     the world.''.\n       (6) The Office of the Director of National Intelligence \n     (ODNI) has stated: ``Many countries will encounter climate-\n     induced disruptions--such as weather-related disasters, \n     drought, famine, or damage to infrastructure--that stress \n     their capacity to respond, cope with, or adapt. Climate-\n     related impacts will also contribute to increased migration, \n     which can be particularly disruptive if, for example, demand \n     for food and shelter outstrips the resources available to \n     assist those in need.''.\n       (7) The Government Accountability Office (GAO) has stated: \n     ``DOD links changes in precipitation patterns with potential \n     climate change impacts such as changes in the number of \n     consecutive days of high or low precipitation as well as \n     increases in the extent and duration of droughts, with an \n     associated increase in the risk of wildfire. . . this may \n     result in mission vulnerabilities such as reduced live-fire \n     training due to drought and increased wildfire risk.''.\n       (8) A three-foot rise in sea levels will threaten the \n     operations of more than 128 United States military sites, and \n     it is possible that many of these at-risk bases could be \n     submerged in the coming years.\n       (9) As global temperatures rise, droughts and famines can \n     lead to more failed states, which are breeding grounds of \n     extremist and terrorist organizations.\n       (10) In the Marshall Islands, an Air Force radar \n     installation built on an atoll at a cost of $1,000,000,000 is \n     projected to be underwater within two decades.\n       (11) In the western United States, drought has amplified \n     the threat of wildfires, and floods have damaged roads, \n     runways, and buildings on military bases.\n       (12) In the Arctic, the combination of melting sea ice, \n     thawing permafrost, and sea-level rise is eroding shorelines, \n     which is damaging radar and communication installations, \n     runways, seawalls, and training areas.\n       (13) In the Yukon Training Area, units conducting artillery \n     training accidentally started a wildfire despite observing \n     the necessary practices during red flag warning conditions.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) climate change is a direct threat to the national \n     security of the United States and is impacting stability in \n     areas of the world both where the United States Armed Forces \n     are operating today, and where strategic implications for \n     future conflict exist;\n       (2) there are complexities in quantifying the cost of \n     climate change on mission resiliency, but the Department of \n     Defense must ensure that it is prepared to conduct operations \n     both today and in the future and that it is prepared to \n     address the effects of a changing climate on threat \n     assessments, resources, and readiness; and\n       (3) military installations must be able to effectively \n     prepare to mitigate climate damage in their master planning \n     and infrastructure planning and design, so that they might \n     best consider the weather and natural resources most \n     pertinent to them.\n       (c) Report.--\n       (1) Report required.--Not later than one year after the \n     date of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Defense \n     shall submit to the Committees on Armed Services of the \n     Senate and the House of Representatives a report on \n     vulnerabilities to military installations and combatant \n     commander requirements resulting from climate change over the \n     next 20 years.\n       (2) Elements.--The report on vulnerabilities to military \n     installations and combatant commander requirements required \n     by paragraph (1) shall include the following:\n       (A) A list of the ten most vulnerable military \n     installations within each service based on the effects of \n     rising sea tides, increased flooding, drought, \n     desertification, wildfires, thawing permafrost, and any other \n     categories the Secretary determines necessary.\n       (B) An overview of mitigations that may be necessary to \n     ensure the continued operational viability and to increase \n     the resiliency of the identified vulnerable military \n     installations and the cost of such mitigations.\n       (C) A discussion of the climate-change related effects on \n     the Department, including the increase in the frequency of \n     humanitarian assistance and disaster relief missions and the \n     theater campaign plans, contingency plans, and global posture \n     of the combatant commanders.\n       (D) An overview of mitigations that may be necessary to \n     ensure mission resiliency and the cost of such mitigations.\n       (3) Form.--The report required under paragraph (1) shall be \n     submitted in unclassified form, but may contain a classified \n     annex.\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 195}, {"kind": "title", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "     SEC. 336.

progression, promotion \n     policies, and a perceived lack of opportunity for schooling \n     and broadening assignments.\n       (2) An analysis of the extent to which current personnel \n     policies inhibit the professional development of officers.\n       (3) An analysis of the impact that increased flexibility in \n     promotion, assignments, and career length would have on \n     officer competency in their military occupational \n     specialties.\n       (4) An analysis of the efficacy of officer talent \n     management systems currently used by the military \n     departments.\n       (5) An analysis of the benefits and limitations of the \n     current promotion timelines and the ``up-or-out'' system \n     required by policy and law.\n       (6) An analysis

advanced degrees, broadening \n     assignments, and non-traditional career patterns.\n       (7) The utility and feasibility of creating new competitive \n     categories or an independent career and promotion path for \n     officers in low-density military occupational specialties.\n       (8) An analysis of how best to encourage and facilitate the \n     recruitment and retention of officers with technical \n     expertise.\n       (9) The utility and feasibility of encouraging officers to \n     pursue careers of lengths that vary from the traditional 20-\n     year military career and the mechanisms that could be \n     employed to encourage officers to pursue these varying career \n     lengths.\n       (10) An analysis of what actions have been or could be \n     taken within current statutory authority to address officer \n     management challenges.\n       (11) An analysis of what actions can be taken by the Armed \n     Forces to change the institutional culture

SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING AIRCRAFT CARRIERS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Naval aviation was born in the United States when \n     Eugene Ely launched from the deck of a United States Navy \n     ship on November 14, 1910, in a Curtiss Model D.\n       (2) In 1915, Cpt. Henry C. Mustin made the first catapult \n     launch aboard a ship underway in a Curtiss Model AB-2, \n     beginning a century of technological advancements that have \n     led to today's Electromagnetic Aircraft Launch System.\n       (3) In 1924, Lt. Dixie Kiefer made the first night catapult \n     launch in a Vought UO-1 in San Diego harbor.\n       (4) The first nuclear-powered aircraft carrier, USS \n     Enterprise (CVN 65), was commissioned in 1961, ushering in a \n     new era of the world's most dominant and capable warships.\n       (5) In 2013, aircraft carrier USS George Washington (CVN \n     73) provided humanitarian assistance, medical supplies, food, \n     and water to the victims in the Republic of the Philippines \n     of Super Typhoon Haiyan, once again demonstrating the \n     versatility of aircraft carriers for combat, diplomatic, and \n     humanitarian operations.\n       (6) In 2017, the first of the next generation of aircraft \n     carriers, USS Gerald R. Ford (CVN 78), was commissioned, \n     marking a continuation of the innovative naval aviation \n     spirit, technological advancement, and war fighting \n     capabilities of aircraft carriers.\n       (7) For over 70 years, aircraft carriers have been employed \n     in every major and many smaller conflicts, including World \n     War II, Korea, Vietnam, Grenada, Lebanon, Libya, Operation \n     Desert Storm, Afghanistan, Iraq, and the fight against \n     terrorism.\n       (8) The United States Navy's aircraft carriers are a \n     cornerstone of the Nation's ability to project its power and \n     strength.\n       (9) When aircraft carriers sail the globe they are a \n     statement of national purpose and a symbol of the Nation's \n     industrial strength, competitive edge, and economic \n     prosperity.\n       (10) Aircraft carriers are 4.5 acres of sovereign United \n     States territory enabling the Nation to reduce its dependency \n     on other nations while it pursues its national security \n     interests.\n       (11) Aircraft carriers enable the United States Armed \n     Forces to carry out operations from international waters, \n     often obviating the need to obtain fly-over rights and land-\n     base rights from other nations.\n       (12) Aircraft carriers are modern, mobile United States \n     military bases complete with airfield, hospital, and \n     communications systems from which the United States can \n     strike at its enemies.\n       (13) Over 90 percent of world trade is moved by sea, \n     including much of the world's gas and oil supply, and \n     aircraft carriers patrol vital regions of the world to keep \n     shipping lanes open and protect the interests of the United \n     States and its allies.\n       (14) There are more than 2,450 companies in 48 States and \n     over 364 congressional districts, and more than 13,100 \n     shipbuilders, who proudly contribute to the construction and \n     maintenance of these complex and technologically advanced \n     ships.\n       (15) Thousands of members of the United States Armed Forces \n     have served the Nation aboard aircraft carriers in war, \n     peace, and times of crisis.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) United States aircraft carriers are premier sea-based \n     power projection platforms and have served the Nation's \n     interests in times of war and peace, adapting to the \n     immediate and ever-changing nature of the world for over 90 \n     years; and\n       (2) aircraft carrier contributions and heritage should be \n     celebrated.\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 938}, {"kind": "title", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "     SEC. 1086.

SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING WORLD WAR I.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The United States declared war against Germany on April \n     6, 1917, to redress wrongs, including Germany's resumption of \n     unrestricted submarine warfare, violation of United States \n     neutrality, meddling in Mexican affairs, and denial of \n     freedom of the seas to nonbelligerent nations.\n       (2) The United States associated itself with the allied \n     powers of the United Kingdom and its Commonwealth, France and \n     its colonies, Russia, Italy, and Japan to defeat the German \n     Empire.\n       (3) The United States Army, consisting of the Regular Army, \n     National Guard, and Reserve Corps, with the addition of \n     volunteers and the draftees of the National Army, underwent a \n     transformation from a frontier constabulary and coastal \n     defense force to a modern land warfare force.\n       (4) Early 20th century military and technological advances \n     resulted in the incorporation of motor transport, aviation, \n     anti-aircraft artillery, tanks, chemical weapons, submarines \n     and anti-submarine warfare, underwater mines, and other \n     innovations into the military arsenal of the United States.\n       (5) The need to quickly build a military strength of four \n     million soldiers and half a million sailors required the \n     mobilization of the human resources of the United States, \n     during which members of diverse ethnic groups, races, and \n     creeds, both native-born and immigrant, forged a new American \n     identity.\n       (6) The United States Army maintained its defense of \n     American seacoasts, southern border, and overseas \n     possessions, while the Army American Expeditionary Forces \n     arrived in Europe in June 1917 and deployed for combat \n     operations in October.\n       (7) By the end of World War I, almost 2,000,000 members of \n     the Army served overseas in the American Expeditionary \n     Forces.\n       (8) During World War I, the United States Navy increased in \n     strength from approximately 67,000 sailors and marines to \n     approximately 500,000 sailors and marines by the war's end, \n     and the size of the Navy increased from around 200 ships at \n     the outbreak of war in Europe in 1914, to 342 vessels by the \n     time the United States entered the war, and 774 vessels by \n     the day of the Armistice\n       (9) The Navy operated in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, \n     and the North and Mediterranean Seas in cooperation with \n     allied navies.\n       (10) The Navy began the fight against the German U-boat \n     menace by first dispatching 34 destroyers stationed \n     specifically for such purpose, which by war's end grew to 110 \n     total destroyers\n       (11) Navy vessels escorted troop transports carrying \n     1,250,000 passengers and escorted supply transports carrying \n     27 percent of all cargo shipped to Europe.\n       (12) The Navy deployed five batteries of large-caliber \n     battleship guns mounted on railroad trains to France for \n     service as long-range artillery for the Army.\n       (13) The United States Coast Guard transferred to the \n     operational control of the Navy and augmented that service \n     with officers and sailors, vessels of all types, and shore \n     stations.\n       (14) The United States Marine Corps, with an eventual \n     wartime strength of 53,000 officers and men, detached the 5th \n     and 6th regiments and a machine gun battalion to constitute \n     an infantry brigade integrated into the Army's 2d Division \n     for service in France.\n       (15) On July 4, 1917, Colonel Charles E. Stanton, one of \n     the officers on the staff of General John Pershing, commander \n     of the American Expeditionary Forces in Europe, famously \n     announced the commitment of the United States to the fight \n     when Colonel Stanton proclaimed upon his arrival in France, \n     ``Lafayette, we are here!''.\n       (16) Whereas the American Expeditionary Forces formed three \n     field armies, nine corps and 43 divisions, plus various units \n     of the Services of Supply.\n       (17) The American Expeditionary Forces suffered 255,000 \n     casualties and over 50,000 non-battle casualties while \n     participating in 13 named campaigns in World War I.\n       (18) Participation in World War I resulted in the \n     completion of a period of reform and professionalism that \n     transformed the Armed Forces from a small dispersed \n     organization to a modern industrialized fighting force \n     capable of global reach and influence.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--Congress--\n       (1) honors the memory of the fallen heroes who wore the \n     uniform of the United States Armed Forces during World War I;\n       (2) commends the Unites States Armed Forces for preserving \n     and protecting the interests of the United States during \n     World War I;\n       (3) commends the brave members of the United States Armed \n     Forces for their courage while preserving the founding \n     principles of the United States at home and abroad during \n     World War I;\n       (4) commends the brave members of the United States Armed \n     Forces for preserving and protecting the sea lanes of \n     commerce and communications during World War I that ensured \n     the continued prosperity of the United States;\n       (5) celebrates and congratulates the United States Army, \n     Navy, Marine Corps, Air Force, and Coast Guard during the \n     commemoration of the centennial of World War I for a job well \n     done; and\n       (6) calls on all people of the United States to join in the \n     commemoration of the centennial of World War I in events \n     throughout the United States and overseas.\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 961}, {"kind": "title", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "     SEC. 1096.

and\n       (C) improving the agility and flexibility of partners and \n     allies to address threats across the full spectrum of \n     domains.\n       (5) A strong NATO alliance is the cornerstone of \n     transatlantic security cooperation and the guarantor of peace \n     and stability in Europe.\n       (6) The steps taken at the NATO 2014 Wales Summit and the \n     NATO 2016 Warsaw Summit, including the adoption and \n     implementation of the Readiness Action Plan (RAP), the \n     formation of the Very High Joint Readiness Force (VJTF), the \n     Enhanced Forward Presence (EFP) multinational battalions \n     deployed to Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and Poland, and the \n     Tailored Forward Presence in Romania and Bulgaria, have \n     strengthened NATO readiness and collective defense.\n       (7) Montenegro's accession into NATO is a strong step \n     toward strengthening the alliance, enhancing security and \n     stability in Southeastern Europe, and reaffirming NATO's \n     commitment to an ``Open Door'' policy.\n       (8) Cooperation with non-NATO allies and members of the \n     Partnership for Peace program enhances security and stability \n     in Europe.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the United States should support a Europe whole, free, \n     and at peace and the sovereign right of all European states \n     to pursue integration into the Euro-Atlantic community \n     through institutions such as NATO and the European Union;\n       (2) the United States should develop and implement a policy \n     and strategy backed by all elements of United States power to \n     deter and, if necessary, defeat Russian aggression, which \n     will require--\n       (A) enhancing United States military capability and \n     capacity in Europe, including strong consideration of \n     investments in increased permanently-stationed and continued \n     rotational forces as well as the facilities and \n     infrastructure necessary to support United States presence \n     and training with its allies and partners; and\n       (B) strengthening United States capability and capacity to \n     counter malign Russian influence, including Russian hybrid \n     warfare operations short of traditional armed conflict, \n     malicious Russian cyber activities, and Russia's use of \n     misinformation, disinformation, and propaganda;\n       (3) investments that support the security and stability of \n     Europe, including the EDI, and support to European countries \n     in further developing their security capabilities, are in the \n     long-term national security interests of the United States, \n     and as such, funds for such efforts should be included in the \n     President's base budget request for the Department of Defense \n     in order to fully support United States combat capability in \n     Europe, facilitate efficient planning and execution, and \n     ensure budgetary transparency;\n       (4) the United States should maintain an ironclad \n     commitment to its obligations under Article 5 of the North \n     Atlantic Treaty, which declares that an ``armed attack \n     against one or more [NATO allies] shall be considered an \n     attack against them all'';\n       (5) while NATO allies have made progress toward high levels \n     of defense spending, it is important that all NATO allies \n     fulfill their commitments to levels and composition of \n     defense expenditures as agreed upon at the NATO 2014 Wales \n     Summit and NATO 2016 Warsaw Summit in order to uphold their \n     obligations under Article 3 of the North Atlantic Treaty to \n     ``maintain and develop their individual and collective \n     capacity to resist armed attack'';\n       (6) NATO allies should continue to coordinate defense \n     investments to both improve deterrence against Russian \n     aggression and more appropriately balance defense spending \n     across the alliance; and\n       (7) because the NATO alliance defends not only the common \n     security of the United States and its NATO allies, but our \n     common values as well, it is essential that all NATO allies \n     uphold their obligations under the North Atlantic Treaty to \n     ``safeguard the freedom, common heritage and civilization of \n     their peoples, founded on the principles of democracy, \n     individual liberty and the rule of law''.\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 1071}, {"kind": "title", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "     SEC. 1234.

Therefore, deterrence \n     and defence, based on an appropriate mix of nuclear, \n     conventional, and missile defence capabilities, remains a \n     core element of our overall strategy. . . The fundamental \n     purpose of NATO's nuclear capability is to preserve peace, \n     prevent coercion, and deter aggression. Nuclear weapons are \n     unique. Any employment of nuclear weapons against NATO would \n     fundamentally alter the nature of a conflict. The \n     circumstances in which NATO might have to use nuclear weapons \n     are extremely remote'';\n       (B) with respect to the nature of the nuclear deterrence \n     posture of NATO, ``NATO must continue to adapt its strategy \n     in line with trends in the security environment-including \n     with respect to capabilities and other measures required-to \n     ensure that NATO's overall deterrence and defence posture is \n     capable of addressing potential adversaries' doctrine and \n     capabilities, and that it remains credible, flexible, \n     resilient, and adaptable.''; and\n       (C) with respect to the importance of contributions to the \n     nuclear deterrence mission from across the NATO alliance, \n     ``The strategic forces of the Alliance, particularly those of \n     the United States, are the supreme guarantee of the security \n     of the Allies. The independent strategic nuclear forces of \n     the United Kingdom and France have a deterrent role of their \n     own and contribute to the overall security of the Alliance. \n     These Allies' separate centres of decision-making contribute \n     to deterrence by complicating the calculations of potential \n     adversaries. NATO's nuclear deterrence posture also relies, \n     in part, on United States' nuclear weapons forward-deployed \n     in Europe and on capabilities and infrastructure provided by \n     Allies concerned. These Allies will ensure that all \n     components of NATO's nuclear deterrent remain safe, secure, \n     and effective. That requires sustained leadership focus and \n     institutional excellence for the nuclear deterrence mission \n     and planning guidance aligned with 21st century requirements. \n     The Alliance will ensure the broadest possible participation \n     of Allies concerned in their agreed nuclear burden-sharing \n     arrangements.''.\n       (3) Secretary of Defense James Mattis, in response to the \n     advance policy questions for his Senate confirmation hearing \n     on January 12, 2017, stated that--\n       (A) ``NATO's nuclear deterrence posture relies in part on \n     U.S. nuclear weapons forward-deployed in Europe and on \n     capabilities and infrastructure provided by NATO allies. \n     These capabilities include dual-capable aircraft that \n     contribute to current burden-sharing arrangements within \n     NATO. In general, we must take care to maintain this \n     particular capability, and to modernize it appropriately and \n     in a timely fashion.''; and\n       (B) the role of the nuclear weapons of the United States is \n     ``to deter nuclear war and to serve as last resort weapons of \n     self-defense. In this sense, U.S. nuclear weapons are \n     fundamental to our nation's security and have historically \n     provided a deterrent against aggression and security \n     assurance to U.S. allies. A robust, flexible, and survivable \n     U.S. nuclear arsenal underpins the U.S. ability to deploy \n     conventional forces worldwide.''.\n       (4) On March 28, 2017, General Curtis Scaparrotti, \n     Commander of the United States European Command and the \n     Supreme Allied Commander, Europe, testified to the Committee \n     on Armed Services of the House of Representatives that ``NATO \n     and U.S. nuclear forces continue to be a vital component of \n     our deterrence. Our modernization efforts are crucial; we \n     must preserve a ready, credible, and safe nuclear \n     capability.''.\n       (5) The Russian Federation is currently undergoing \n     significant modernization and recapitalization of all three \n     legs of its nuclear triad, continues to field and modernize a \n     large variety of non-strategic nuclear weapons, and is \n     developing and deploying new and unique nuclear capabilities.\n       (6) Russia remains in violation of the INF Treaty due to \n     the development, testing, and, most recently, the operational \n     deployment of ground-launched cruise missiles in violation of \n     the INF Treaty.\n       (7) On March 28, 2017, General Paul Selva, Vice Chairman of \n     the Joint Chiefs of Staff, described the security \n     consequences of the deployment of such INF Treaty-violating \n     missiles, testifying to the Committee on Armed Services of \n     the House of Representatives that ``our assessment of the \n     impact is that it more threatens NATO and infrastructure \n     within the European continent than any other...area of the \n     world that we have national interests in or alliance \n     interests in.''.\n       (8) On March 28, 2017, General Curtis Scaparrotti, in \n     testimony before the Committee on Armed Services of the House \n     of Representatives, responded to a question asking if Russia \n     intends to return to compliance with the INF Treaty by \n     stating, ``I don't have any indication that they will at this \n     time.''.\n       (9) Rhetoric from Russian officials has demonstrated that \n     Moscow has sought to leverage its nuclear arsenal to threaten \n     and intimidate\n\n\n     neighboring countries, including members of NATO, as was the \n     case when the Russian Ambassador to Denmark stated, ``Danish \n     warships will be targets for Russian nuclear missiles'' in \n     response to Denmark's potential cooperation in the NATO \n     missile defense system.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the nuclear and conventional deterrence capabilities of \n     NATO are of critical importance to the security of the United \n     States and of the NATO alliance, and must continue to adapt \n     to the changed security environment in Europe;\n       (2) the ability of the United States to forward-deploy \n     dual-capable aircraft and nuclear weapons, and of select \n     members of NATO to participate in the nuclear deterrence \n     mission of NATO by hosting forward-deployed nuclear weapons \n     of the United States or operating dual-capable aircraft, is \n     central to the credibility of the nuclear deterrence and \n     defense posture of NATO;\n       (3) the strategic forces of the United States, the \n     independent nuclear forces of the United Kingdom and the \n     French Republic, and the dual-capable aircraft operated by \n     the United States and other members of NATO constitute \n     foundational elements of the nuclear deterrence and defense \n     posture of NATO;\n       (4) NATO should modernize its nuclear-related \n     infrastructure to ensure the highest-level of safety and \n     security;\n       (5) effective deterrence requires NATO to conduct nuclear \n     planning and exercises aligned with 21st century requirements \n     and modernize nuclear-related capabilities and \n     infrastructure, including dual-capable aircraft, command and \n     control networks, and facilities; and\n       (6) to ensure the continued credibility of the deterrence \n     and defense posture of NATO, the planned completion of F-35A \n     aircraft development and testing, as well as the delivery of \n     such aircraft to members of NATO, must not be delayed.\n       (c) INF Treaty Defined.--In this section, the term ``INF \n     Treaty'' means the Treaty Between the United States of \n     America and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics on the \n     Elimination of Their Intermediate-Range and Shorter-Range \n     Missiles, commonly referred to as the ``Intermediate- Range \n     Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty'', signed at Washington December \n     8, 1987, and entered into force June 1, 1988.\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 1077}, {"kind": "title", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "     SEC. 1237.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The 2014, 2015, and 2016 Department of State reports \n     entitled, ``Adherence to and Compliance with Arms Control, \n     Nonproliferation, and Disarmament Agreements and \n     Commitments'', all stated that the United States has \n     determined that ``the Russian Federation is in violation of \n     its obligations under the INF Treaty\n\n\n     not to possess, produce, or flight-test a ground-launched \n     cruise missile (GLCM) with a range capability of 500 km to \n     5,500 km, or to possess or produce launchers of such \n     missiles''.\n       (2) The 2016 report also noted that ``the cruise missile \n     developed by Russia meets the INF Treaty definition of a \n     ground-launched cruise missile with a range capability of 500 \n     km to 5,500 km, and as such, all missiles of that type, and \n     all launchers of the type used or tested to launch such a \n     missile, are prohibited under the provisions of the INF \n     Treaty''.\n       (3) Potential consistency and compliance concerns regarding \n     the INF Treaty noncompliant GLCM have existed since 2008, \n     were not officially raised with the Russian Federation until \n     2013, and were not briefed to the North Atlantic Treaty \n     Organization (NATO) until January 2014.\n       (4) The United States Government is aware of other \n     consistency and compliance concerns regarding Russia actions \n     vis-a-vis its INF Treaty obligations.\n       (5) Since 2013, senior United States officials, including \n     the President, the Secretary of State, and the Chairman of \n     the Joint Chiefs of Staff, have raised Russian noncompliance \n     with the INF Treaty to their counterparts, but no progress \n     has been made in bringing the Russian Federation back into \n     compliance with the INF Treaty.\n       (6) In April 2014, General Breedlove, the Supreme Allied \n     Commander Europe, correctly stated, ``A weapon capability \n     that violates the INF, that is introduced into the greater \n     European land mass, is absolutely a tool that will have to be \n     dealt with . . . It can't go unanswered.''.\n       (7) The Department of Defense in its September 2013 report, \n     Report on Conventional Prompt Global Strike Options if Exempt \n     from the Restrictions of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear \n     Forces Treaty Between the United States of America and the \n     Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, stated that it has \n     multiple validated military requirement gaps due to the \n     prohibitions imposed on the United States as a result of its \n     compliance with the INF Treaty.\n       (8) It is not in the national security interests of the \n     United States to be unilaterally legally prohibited from \n     developing dual-capable ground-launched cruise missiles with \n     ranges between 500 and 5,500 kilometers, while Russia makes \n     advances in developing and fielding this class of weapon \n     systems, and such unilateral limitation cannot be allowed to \n     continue indefinitely.\n       (9) Admiral Harry Harris, Jr., Commander of the United \n     States Pacific Command, testified before the Senate Armed \n     Services Committee on April 27, 2017, that ``[W]e're in a \n     multi-polar world where we have a lot of countries who are \n     developing these weapons, including China, that I worry \n     about. And I worry about their DF-21 and DF-26 missile \n     programs, their anti-carrier ballistic missile programs, if \n     you will. INF doesn't address missiles launched from ships or \n     airplanes, but it focuses on those land-based systems. I \n     think there's goodness in the INF treaty, anything you can do \n     to limit nuclear weapons writ-large is generally good. But \n     the aspects of the INF Treaty that limit our ability to \n     counter Chinese and other countries' land-based missiles, I \n     think, is problematic.''.\n       (10) A material breach of the INF Treaty by the Russian \n     Federation affords the United States the right to invoke \n     legal countermeasures which include suspension of the treaty \n     in whole or in part.\n       (11) Article XV of the INF Treaty provides that ``Each \n     Party shall, in exercising its national sovereignty, have the \n     right to withdraw from this Treaty if it decides that \n     extraordinary events related to the subject matter of this \n     Treaty have jeopardized its supreme interests.''.\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 1087}, {"kind": "title", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "     SEC. 1243.

More than half of \n     NNSA's approximately 6,000 real property assets are over 40 \n     years old, and nearly 30 percent date back to the Manhattan \n     Project era. Many of the enterprise's critical utility, \n     safety, and support systems are failing at an increasing and \n     unpredictable rate, which poses both programmatic and safety \n     risk.''; and\n       (ii) ``I can think of no greater threat to the nuclear \n     security enterprise than the state of NNSA's \n     infrastructure.'';\n       (B) the President and Chief Executive Officer of \n     Consolidated Nuclear Security, Morgan Smith, said, ``Many key \n     facilities at both [Pantex and Y-12] were constructed in the \n     1940s and were intended to operate for as little as one \n     decade. Many facilities and their supporting infrastructure \n     have exceeded or far exceeded their expected life, and major \n     systems within the facilities are beginning to fail.''; and\n       (C) the Director of Los Alamos National Laboratory, Dr. \n     Charlie McMillan, said, ``One of the things that keeps me up \n     at night is the realization that essential capabilities are \n     held at risk by the possibility of such failures; in many \n     cases, our enterprise has a single point of failure.''.\n       (2) In a letter sent on December 23, 2015, by the Secretary \n     of Energy, Ernest Moniz, to the Director of the Office of \n     Management and Budget, Shaun Donovan, the Secretary said, ``A \n     majority of the National Nuclear Security Administration's \n     (NNSA) facilities and systems are well beyond end-of-life.... \n     Infrastructure problems such as falling ceilings are \n     increasing in frequency and severity, unacceptably risking \n     the safety and security of both personnel and material at \n     NNSA facilities, as well as in some instances, potential \n     offsite risks. The entire complex could be placed at risk if \n     there is a single failure where a single point would disrupt \n     a critical link in infrastructure.''.\n       (3) The Nuclear Posture Review published in April 2010 \n     stated that ``In order to sustain a safe, secure, and \n     effective U.S. nuclear stockpile as long as nuclear weapons \n     exist, the United States must possess a modern physical \n     infrastructure.... Today's nuclear complex, however, has \n     fallen into neglect. Although substantial science, \n     technology, and engineering investments were made over the \n     last decade under the auspices of the Stockpile Stewardship \n     Program, the complex still includes many oversized and \n     costly-to maintain facilities built during the 1940s and \n     1950s. Some facilities needed for working with plutonium and \n     uranium date back to the Manhattan Project. Safety, security, \n     and environmental issues associated with these aging \n     facilities are mounting, as are the costs of addressing \n     them.''.\n       (4) In 2009, the bipartisan Congressional Commission on the \n     Strategic Posture of the United States established by section \n     1062 of the National Defense Authorization for Fiscal Year \n     2008 (Public Law 110-181; 122 Stat. 319) stated, with regards \n     to key production facilities, that ``existing facilities are \n     genuinely decrepit and are maintained in a safe and secure \n     manner only at high cost''.\n       (5) Previous efforts to address the deferred maintenance \n     and repair challenges within the nuclear security enterprise, \n     such as the Facilities Infrastructure and Recapitalization \n     Program and the recent halt in the growth of backlog metrics, \n     are laudable but insufficient for the magnitude of the \n     problem.\n       (6) Recent figures provided by the Administrator for \n     Nuclear Security estimate the backlog of deferred maintenance \n     and repair needs of the nuclear security enterprise to be \n     approximately $3,700,000,000.\n       (b) Infrastructure Modernization Initiative.--\n       (1) Establishment.--Not later than 30 days after the date \n     of the enactment of this Act, the Administrator for Nuclear \n     Security shall establish and carry out a program, to be known \n     as the ``Infrastructure Modernization Initiative'', to reduce \n     the backlog of deferred maintenance and repair needs of the \n     nuclear security enterprise (as defined in section 4002(6) of \n     the Atomic Energy Defense Act (50 U.S.C. 2501(6))). In \n     carrying out that program, the Administrator shall establish \n     and execute infrastructure modernization milestones that \n     reduce the deferred maintenance and repair needs of the \n     nuclear security enterprise by not less than 30 percent by \n     2025.\n       (2) Authorities.--\n       (A) Process.--\n       (i) In general.--The Secretary of Energy shall provide to \n     the Administrator a process that will enhance or streamline \n     the ability of the Administrator to carry out the program \n     under paragraph (1) in an efficient and effective manner, \n     including with respect to--\n\n       (I) the demolition or construction of non-nuclear \n     facilities of the Administration that have a total estimated \n     project cost of less than $100,000,000; and\n       (II) the decontamination, decommissioning, and demolition \n     (to be performed in accordance with applicable health and \n     safety standards used by the Defense Environmental Cleanup \n     Program) of process-contaminated facilities of the \n     Administration that have a total estimated project cost of \n     less than $50,000,000.\n\n       (ii) Funding.--Clause (i) may be carried out using amounts \n     authorized to be appropriated for fiscal year 2018 or any \n     subsequent fiscal year.\n       (B) Application of certain requirements.--For purposes of \n     the Management Procedures Memorandum 2015-01 of the Office of \n     Management and Budget, or a successor memorandum, in carrying \n     out the program under paragraph (1), the Administrator may--\n       (i) perform new construction during a fiscal year that \n     differs from the fiscal year of corresponding facility \n     demolition;\n       (ii) perform demolition of different facility category \n     codes and have that demolition credit count towards the \n     construction of new facilities with a different facility \n     category code; and\n       (iii) have the net reduction in infrastructure footprint \n     for the five fiscal years prior to the date of the enactment \n     of this Act, and the demolition during the five fiscal years \n     following such date of enactment, considered as a factor for \n     the purpose of meeting the intent of such memorandum.\n       (3) Initial plan.--Not later than March 1, 2018, the \n     Administrator shall submit to the congressional defense \n     committees an initial plan to carry out the program under \n     paragraph (1) to achieve the goal specified in such \n     paragraph.

NUCLEAR WARHEAD DESIGN COMPETITION.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) In January 2016, the co-chairs of a congressionally \n     mandated study panel from the National Academies of Science \n     testified to the following before the Committee on Armed \n     Services of the House of Representatives:\n       (A) ``The National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) \n     complex must engage in robust design competitions in order to \n     exercise the design and production skills that underpin \n     stockpile stewardship and are necessary to meet evolving \n     threats.''.\n\n\n       (B) ``To exercise the full set of design skills necessary \n     for an effective nuclear deterrent, the NNSA should develop \n     and conduct the first in what the committee envisions to be a \n     series of design competitions that integrate the full end-to-\n     end process from novel design conception through engineering, \n     building, and non-nuclear testing of a prototype.''.\n       (2) In March 2016 testimony before the Committee on Armed \n     Services of the House of Representatives regarding a December \n     2016 Defense Science Board report entitled, ``Seven Defense \n     Priorities for the New Administration'', members of that \n     Board said the following:\n       (A) ``A key contributor to nuclear deterrence is the \n     continuous, adaptable exercise of the development, design, \n     and production functions for nuclear weapons in both the DOD \n     and DOE.... Yet the DOE laboratories and DOD contractor \n     community have done little integrated design and development \n     work outside of life extension for 25 years, let alone \n     concept development that could serve as a hedge to \n     surprise.''.\n       (B) ``The Defense Science Board believes that the triad's \n     complementary features remain robust tenets for the design of \n     a future force. Replacing our current, aging force is \n     essential, but not sufficient in the more complex nuclear \n     environment we now face to provide the adaptability or \n     flexibility to confidently hold at risk what adversaries \n     value. In particular, if the threat evolves in ways that \n     favorably change the cost/benefit calculus in the view of an \n     adversary's leadership, then we should be in a position to \n     quickly restore a credible deterrence posture.''.\n       (3) In a memorandum dated May 9, 2014, then-Secretary of \n     Energy Ernie Moniz said the following:\n       (A) ``If nuclear military capabilities are to provide \n     deterrence for the nation they need to be relevant to the \n     emerging global strategic environment. The current stockpile \n     was designed to meet the needs of a bipolar world with roots \n     in the Cold War era. A more complex, chaotic, and dynamic \n     security environment is emerging. In order to uphold the \n     Department's mission to ensure an effective nuclear \n     deterrent.... we must ensure our nuclear capabilities meet \n     the challenges of known and potential geopolitical and \n     technological trends. Therefore we must look ahead, using the \n     expertise of our laboratories, to how the capabilities that \n     may be employed by other nations could impact deterrence over \n     the next several decades.''.\n       (B) ``We must challenge our thinking about our programs of \n     record in order to permit foresighted actions that may \n     reduce, in the coming decades, the chances for surprise and \n     that buttress deterrence.''.\n       (b) Design Competition.--\n       (1) In general.--In accordance with paragraph (2), the \n     Administrator for Nuclear Security, in coordination with the \n     Chairman of the Nuclear Weapons Council, shall carry out a \n     new and comprehensive design competition for a nuclear \n     warhead that could be employed on ballistic missiles of the \n     United States by 2030. Such competition shall--\n       (A) examine options for warhead design and related delivery \n     system requirements in the 2030s, including--\n       (i) life extension of existing weapons;\n       (ii) new capabilities; and\n       (iii) such other concepts as the Administrator and the \n     Chairman determine necessary to fully exercise and create \n     responsive design capabilities in the enterprise and ensure a \n     robust nuclear deterrent into the 2030s;\n       (B) assess how the capabilities and defenses that may be \n     employed by other countries could impact deterrence in 2030 \n     and beyond and how such threats could be addressed or \n     mitigated in the warhead and related delivery systems;\n       (C) exercise the full set of design skills necessary for an \n     effective nuclear deterrent and responsive enterprise through \n     production of conceptual designs and, as the Administrator \n     determines appropriate, production of non-nuclear prototypes \n     of components or subsystems; and\n       (D) examine and recommend actions for significantly \n     shortening timelines and significantly reducing costs \n     associated with design, development, certification, and \n     production of the warhead, without reducing worker or public \n     health and safety.\n       (2) Timing.--The Administrator shall--\n       (A) during fiscal year 2018, develop a plan to carry out \n     paragraph (1); and\n       (B) during fiscal year 2019, implement such plan.\n       (c) Briefing.--Not later than March 1, 2018, the \n     Administrator, in coordination with the Chairman, shall \n     provide a briefing to the congressional defense committees on \n     the plan of the Administrator to carry out the warhead design \n     competition under subsection (b).
