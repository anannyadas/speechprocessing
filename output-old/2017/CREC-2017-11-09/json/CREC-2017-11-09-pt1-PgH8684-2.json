Mr. Speaker, let's put rhetoric aside when it comes to the \nRepublican tax bill. This is a bill that gives tremendous tax breaks to \nmillionaires and billionaires while it hits the middle class.\n  The facade of it may look like middle class people are getting a tax \nbreak, but when you add on all the deductions that they will now no \nlonger be allowed to take, it is a negative for the middle class.\n  The government is always accused of giving you something in one hand \nand taking it back in the other hand. A classic bait and switch, that \nis what this bill is about.\n  In my home State of New York, which is a high tax State, people will \nno longer have the ability to deduct State and local taxes or deduct \nmortgage interest to the degree that they have now.\n  So when you add it all up, what does it do?\n  Higher taxes for the middle class, lower taxes for millionaires and \nbillionaires like our President--a classic bait and switch.\n  When you talk about New York, New York is a donor State. We give more \nmoney to the Federal Government than we get back, and this is just \nhitting New York in the head again.\n  We should be protecting the middle class and letting people who can \nafford to pay more, millionaires and billionaires, pay more, not the \nother way around.\n  Finally, whatever happened to the fiscal responsibility of the \nRepublican Party? This blows a hole in the deficit--$1.75 trillion.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. ENGEL", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "183", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H8684", "wkday": "Thursday", "day": "9", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "REPUBLICAN TAX BILL GIVING TAX BREAKS TO MILLIONAIRES AND BILLIONAIRES", "id": "CREC-2017-11-09-pt1-PgH8684-2", "title": "REPUBLICAN TAX BILL GIVING TAX BREAKS TO MILLIONAIRES AND BILLIONAIRES"}
