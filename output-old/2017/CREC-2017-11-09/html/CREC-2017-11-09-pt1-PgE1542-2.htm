              IN RECOGNITION OF THE NEW PLYMOUTH TOWN HALL

                                 ______
                                 

                        HON. WILLIAM R. KEATING

                            of massachusetts

                    in the house of representatives

                       Thursday, November 9, 2017

  Mr. KEATING. Mr Speaker, I rise today in recognition of the new Town 
Hall in Plymouth, Massachusetts.
  On November 12th, America's hometown will be celebrating its 
community with the opening of the new Plymouth Town Hall. This event 
will be marked by a walk from the old Town Hall to the new Town Hall 
with everyone who contributed to this new landmark.
  Construction on the new Town Hall began just two years ago, in the 
fall of 2015. I commend the town leadership and the residents of 
Plymouth for their collaboration on this community project. This would 
not have been possible without the dedication of all of those who were 
involved, from the over 40 volunteers who helped generate support for 
the project over local coffee and tea events, to the residents who 
advocated for the project at Town Meeting, to the many involved in the 
construction and restoration efforts. The level of planning and 
outreach involved in this project serves as a powerful example of how 
local government working together with community members can be a 
tremendous success.
  This project involved the restoration of the historic 1820 
Courthouse. The Community Preservation Committee worked with a 
historical restoration team and many volunteers to return this building 
to its original glory. The centuries-old judge's bench in the 
courthouse is now set to be the new location for selectmen's meetings. 
Among the many 1800s-era pieces incorporated into the newly renovated 
building is its American Eagle Weathervane, which traveled aboard the 
ferry to Nantucket to be restored.
  Located at 26 Court Street in the heart of downtown Plymouth, this 
Town Hall will be a centerpiece for the town, including during the 
400th anniversary of Plymouth just a few years away, in 2020.
  Mr Speaker, I am proud to recognize the celebration of the new 
Plymouth Town Hall and the dedication of the entire Plymouth community.
