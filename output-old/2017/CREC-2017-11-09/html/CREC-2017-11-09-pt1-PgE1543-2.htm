                     WAY TO GO EDINA TENNIS CHAMPS

                                 ______
                                 

                           HON. ERIK PAULSEN

                              of minnesota

                    in the house of representatives

                       Thursday, November 9, 2017

  Mr. PAULSEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise to congratulate the Edina Girls 
Tennis Team on winning the Minnesota State Championship Title.
  The Hornets won the state finals with seven wins in seven contests. 
Sophomore Nicole Copeland and Senior Sophia Reddy both beat their 
opponents in two straight matches, clinching the victory for Edina in a 
decisive fashion.
  This was a big year for the Hornets. Edina has won the state 
championship in girls tennis in 20 out of the last 21 years, a 
tremendous feat by any standard. Many of the matches in this year's 
tournament were decided by one point. They know what it's like to play 
under pressure and still clinch a victory.
  Mr. Speaker, the Hornets' victory is a tribute to their hard work 
throughout the season and their ability to play under pressure. And 
most importantly, I commend these student athletes, who have also 
excelled in the classroom and our community.
  Congratulations again to Coach Steve Paulsen and the Edina High 
School Girls Tennis Team. Their families, teachers, friends, neighbors, 
and our entire community are very proud to call them state champs.

                          ____________________
