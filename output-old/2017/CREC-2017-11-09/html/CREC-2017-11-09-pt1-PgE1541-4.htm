                       Thursday, November 9, 2017

  Mr. RYAN of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of 
Patricia Bowser, age 67 who passed away on Monday, November 6, 2017.
   Patricia was born on October 3, 1950 in Youngstown, Ohio to Stephen 
and Mary Ann (Svesko) Sinkovich. She was a graduate of Cardinal Mooney 
High School and attended Youngstown State University for college. She 
devoted 30 years to working with the Youngstown Board of Education with 
behavioral and special needs children. Patricia was also a member of 
the AFL-CIO executive board and was an active participant with the 
Democratic Party of Mahoning County. She was also an avid cat lover.
   She is survived by her mother, Mary Ann Sinkovich of Struthers, 
Ohio; two sons, Russel Bowser and Jerred Kent Bowser, both of 
Youngstown; two sisters, Sue Benish of Struthers and Marianne (Keith) 
Burnside of Struthers; a niece, Kayla Burnside; and a nephew, Keith 
(Luca) Burnside. She was preceded in death by her husband, Melvin K. 
Bowser, whom she married in 1979, and by her father and brother.
   I extend my most sincere and heartfelt condolences to Patricia's 
family and friends. She will be dearly missed.
