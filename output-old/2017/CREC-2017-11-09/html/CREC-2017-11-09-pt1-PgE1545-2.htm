                    in the house of representatives

                       Thursday, November 9, 2017

  Mrs. TORRES. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Mr. Michael ``Mike'' 
E. Story of the City of Rialto in my district on the occasion of his 
retirement from a lifetime of civic service to the communities of the 
Inland Empire.
  Mr. Story has been the City Administrator for the City of Rialto 
since 1985 and has been a resident of the city since 1981. Prior to 
being named City Administrator, his previous positions included 
Associate Planner, Senior Planner, and Director of Development Services 
for the City of Rialto.
  His long time commitment to civic service and contributions is not 
limited to the city of Rialto. Mr. Story previously worked for the 
cities of Fontana and Duarte as a Planner. He graduated with a Bachelor 
of Arts in Political Science and Public Administration from Cal Poly 
Pomona.
  Mr. Story has been a dedicated public servant during his time working 
for the city of Rialto where his efforts have resulted in improvements 
to the quality of life for all residents. His extraordinary skills in 
planning and collaboration have created new and improved opportunities 
for the booming city.
  Along with being dedicated to his civic employments, Mr. Story is an 
avid member of his church's community. He now serves as an Elder for 
the Rialto Sunrise Church, a church with multiple locations that serves 
the Inland Empire communities. And as a former board member, he was and 
is well respected for his continued participation and selfless 
dedication.
  Today, Mr. Speaker, it is my honor to recognize Mr. Mike Story for 
his unmatched commitment and civic employment to the City of Rialto for 
over 30 years, and to the contributions he has made to the greater 
community of the Inland Empire.
