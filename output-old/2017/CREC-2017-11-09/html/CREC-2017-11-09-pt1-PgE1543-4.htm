   CELEBRATING THE CAREER OF U.S. CAPITOL POLICE SERGEANT JOEL HOBBS

                                 ______
                                 

                           HON. GREGG HARPER

                             of mississippi

                    in the house of representatives

                       Thursday, November 9, 2017

  Mr. HARPER. Mr. Speaker, I rise to celebrate the career of U.S. 
Capitol Police Sergeant Joel Hobbs, who is retiring in November after 
twenty-seven years with the force.
  Since 2014, Sergeant Hobbs has served in the Criminal Investigations 
Section. He was responsible for supervising investigations for criminal 
offenses occurring on Capitol Grounds, such as assaults, stolen 
property, thefts, and fraud, among other offenses.
  Prior to his promotion to Sergeant, Sergeant Hobbs served over 20 
years on the Patrol Division. The Patrol Division is responsible for 
providing police services on a 24-hour basis, and security services 
designed to protect Congress, its employees, visitors, and property 
under the jurisdiction of Congress. As a Patrol Division Officer, Hobbs 
became recognized as a subject matter expert in areas involving arrest 
procedures, crime scene search, report writing, among other areas.
  Sergeant Hobbs has accumulated numerous awards and recognitions from 
USCP and the Congressional Community throughout his career. As an 
officer and supervisor, Sergeant Hobbs has embraced every assignment 
given to him, and has had a positive impact everywhere he has been.
  The U.S. Capitol Police play an extraordinarily important and often-
overlooked role in the functioning of our nation's democracy. Without 
the safe and secure space they provide, lawmakers would be unable to 
conduct the American people's work and carry out our functions under 
the Constitution. All of us who serve in Congress hold the U.S. Capitol 
Police and its personnel in high esteem, and we are grateful for those 
who put on its uniform every day.
  I hope my colleagues will join me in thanking Sergeant Joel Hobbs for 
his almost three decades of service to the U.S. Capitol Police, to the 
Congress of the United States, and to

our nation. I wish him all the best in his retirement.
