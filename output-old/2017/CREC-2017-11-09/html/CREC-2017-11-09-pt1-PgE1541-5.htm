              HONORING THE MONTEREY COUNTY FILM COMMISSION

                                 ______
                                 

                           HON. JIMMY PANETTA

                             of california

                    in the house of representatives

                       Thursday, November 9, 2017

  Mr. PANETTA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today on behalf of an organization 
that displays the unique beauty of my district around the entire world. 
The Monterey County Film Commission has served my district on the 
central coast of California by inspiring, facilitating, and assisting 
in the production of media that highlights the pristine beauty, and 
unique culture of our community. This year, the Monterey County Film 
Commission celebrates its thirtieth anniversary. Since its inception, 
the Commission has helped attract and assist in the production of 
hundreds of movies, television shows, commercials, documentaries and 
still photography productions. Thanks to the work of the Commission, 
our community has benefited from over one hundred million dollars in 
direct financial impact in our local communities.
   The Commission serves as a liaison for movie producers, government 
entities and local businesses. It provides substantial information 
about our Monterey County, and straightforward guidelines for filming 
procedures that facilitate the development of successful media 
productions. The Commission also serves our community by highlighting 
highly desirable Monterey County locations through domestic and 
international tradeshows, sales trips and direct public advertising 
campaigns. Beyond this, the Commission also contributes to growing the 
next generation of young filmmakers, and is crucial in our communities' 
effort to create opportunity for creative-minded young people to find 
success pursuing their passion.
   I would also note that the Monterey Peninsula has been, and remains, 
home to many prominent actors including Clint Eastwood and Betty White. 
Clint Eastwood came to Carmel to film Play Misty for Me, and later 
become Mayor of Carmel. The Peninsula has hosted stars such as Marilyn 
Monroe and Barbara Stanwyck in Clash by Night. Over the years, the 
Central Coast of California has attracted over two hundred films, 
hundreds of television programs and countless magazine ads. Most 
recently, my district played home to the highly successful and 
critically acclaimed HBO series Big Little Lies, filmed on the Monterey 
Peninsula, largely in Monterey and Pacific Grove.
   The hard work of the staff and Board of Directors of the Monterey 
County Film Commission continues to provide our community and our 
country with great films and TV shows filmed in our beautiful district. 
Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure to recognize the dedication and hard 
work the Monterey County Film Commission has given to the Central Coast 
and the entire State of California. I ask my distinguished colleagues 
to join me in recognizing the Monterey County Film Commission as an 
integral part of our community.
