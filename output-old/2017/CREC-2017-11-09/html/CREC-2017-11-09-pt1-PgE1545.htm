             RECOGNIZING THE UNITY GIRLS CROSS COUNTRY TEAM

                                 ______
                                 

                           HON. JOHN SHIMKUS

                              of illinois

                    in the house of representatives

                       Thursday, November 9, 2017

  Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize the Unity High School 
Girls Cross Country Team, who are the 2017 Class 1A Illinois team cross 
country champions.
  Unity, in Tolono, won the meet with 108 points, as its three All-
State finishers, Caroline Bachert (13th), Jordan Harmon (21st), and 
Evelyn Atkins (25th), powered the team to victory. But this was a team 
effort and a team victory as every runner contributed to Unity's razor-
thin two point victory.
  I would like to congratulate the entire Unity Girls Cross Country 
Team on their victory: Evelyn Adkins, Caroline Bachert, Mackenzie 
Brunk, Caroline Cousins, Savannah Day, Kylie Decker, Miranda Fairbanks, 
Audrey Hancock, Jordan Harmon, Chelsie Helmick, Elizabeth Hulick, 
Taylor Joop, Rachael King, Natalie King, Riley Millsap, Taylor Millsap, 
Evyenia Pyle, Lily Styan, as well as Head Coach Kara Leaman, on a 
superb end to a great season. And with only one senior in the group who 
ran at the state meet, Unity can look forward to continued success with 
its program.
  Mr. Speaker, today it is an honor for me to acknowledge the hard work 
and dedication of the Unity Girls Cross Country Team in winning the 
2017 state cross country title, and I wish the team and their coach all 
the best in the future.

                          ____________________
