                    SERVICEMEMBER FAMILY BURIAL ACT

                                 ______
                                 

                          HON. J. LUIS CORREA

                             of california

                    in the house of representatives

                       Thursday, November 9, 2017

  Mr. CORREA. Mr. Speaker, currently, spouses and dependent children of 
active-duty servicemembers may be buried in a VA national cemetery if 
predeceased by the servicemember. However, if the spouse or dependent 
child passes away before the servicemember, current law does not 
explicitly authorize their burial.
  Since becoming aware of this gap in their burial authority, the 
National Cemetery Administration has been processing requests for 
burial of spouses and eligible dependent children of active duty 
servicemembers in a VA national cemetery on case-by-case basis, using a 
designation of discretionary authority.
  Today, I am introducing the Servicemember Family Burial Benefits Act 
to address the ability of the Department of Veterans' Affairs to bury 
an active-duty servicemember's loved ones if they pass away before the 
servicemember. My legislation will allow active duty servicemembers to 
bury their spouse or eligible dependent child, if they choose, in a VA 
national cemetery and authorize VA to provide headstones and markers 
for spouses and eligible dependent children. Finally, the language will 
allow state and tribal veterans cemeteries to provide this benefit in 
the same manner as VA national cemeteries. This legislation will allow 
active duty servicemembers the opportunity to choose to bury their 
loved one, lost while the servicemember is serving our nation, in a VA 
national cemetery. At their own time of need, servicemembers will have 
the option to be buried in a national cemetery with their loved ones.
