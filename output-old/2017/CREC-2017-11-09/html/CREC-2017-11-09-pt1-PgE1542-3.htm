                       Thursday, November 9, 2017

  Mr. BUTTERFIELD. Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor and recognize Tolie 
Brodie Harrison who is an outstanding citizen in Nash County, North 
Carolina. Mrs. Harrison affectionately known as ``Ma Tolie'' will be 
100 years young on December 12, 2017.
  Born in 1917 during the height of World War I, Mrs. Harrison has 
devoted her entire life toward improving the quality of life for her 
community.
  Mrs. Harrison and her husband, Frank Barnabas Harrison, were blessed 
with ten wonderful children. Education was important to the family. The 
Harrison's were adamant that their children would receive a proper 
education and encouraged them to attend college. Mrs. Harrison was also 
a provider and motivator by working countless hours on farms and in 
tobacco factories to keep her children enrolled in school. At age 45, 
she was employed by Abott's Pharmaceuticals; which ensured the 
necessary benefits to support her family.
  Mr. Speaker, many in the Nash County community can testify to the 
hospitality and encouragement of Ma Tolie. As a strong advocate for 
education, she would welcome new teachers to her home until they could 
find a permanent residence. For the students; she fed them, housed 
them, and wisely counseled them. With her many years of selfless 
service, Mrs. Harrison has left an indelible impression on the lives 
she touched. Throughout her life she has received many awards, 
recognitions, and praises for her contributions.
  It is my high honor to offer these remarks in recognition of a great 
American who is an example of the highest degree of service to 
humanity.
