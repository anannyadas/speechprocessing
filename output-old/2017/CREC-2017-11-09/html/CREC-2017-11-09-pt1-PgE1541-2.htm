                        HONORING BARBARA HIGGENS

                                 ______
                                 

                          HON. PETER J. ROSKAM

                              of illinois

                    in the house of representatives

                       Thursday, November 9, 2017

  Mr. ROSKAM. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of the long and 
distinguished career of Barbara C. Higgens on the occasion of her 
retirement. After 19 years of dedication and commitment, she is 
stepping down as CEO of Plumbing Manufacturers International (PMI).
   Since its founding in 1998, Ms. Higgens has nurtured and grown PMI's 
visibility and influence within the United States and abroad. Ms. 
Higgens revamped the organization from her kitchen table as its first 
employee. She went on to hire dedicated professional staff and 
significantly enhanced the association's advocacy, technical, water 
conservation, environmental, and trade initiatives. Today, PMI is the 
nation's leading plumbing manufacturing trade association representing 
90 percent of all the plumbing fixtures and fittings sold in the United 
States.
   Under her leadership, PMI has grown into an advocate for water-
efficient products meeting high safety and performance standards. She 
was instrumental in the introduction and passage of a federal 
nationwide law to reduce lead in plumbing products, known as the 
Reduction of Lead in Drinking Water Act, which was designed to 
safeguard all Americans.
   Mr. Speaker, please join me in celebrating this special occasion and 
wishing Barbara Higgens every happiness in her well-deserved 
retirement.
