TRIBUTE TO YOUNG STAFF MEMBERS FOR THEIR CONTRIBUTIONS ON BEHALF OF THE 
   PEOPLE OF THE 18TH CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT OF TEXAS AND THE UNITED 
                                 STATES

                                 ______
                                 

                        HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE

                                of texas

                    in the house of representatives

                       Thursday, November 9, 2017

  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, as Members of Congress we know well, 
perhaps better than most, how blessed our nation is to have in reserve 
such exceptional young men and women who will go on to become leaders 
in their local communities, states, and the nation in the areas of 
business, education, government, philanthropy, the arts and culture, 
and the military.
  We know this because we see them and benefit from their contributions 
every day. Many of them work for us in our offices as junior staff 
members, congressional fellows, or interns and they do amazing work for 
and on behalf of the constituents we are privileged to represent.
  Mr. Speaker, I believe there is no higher calling than the call to 
serve a cause larger than ourselves. That is why I ran for public 
office. I was inspired to serve by President Kennedy who said, ``Ask 
not what your country can do for you, ask what you can do for your 
country,'' and by the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. who said:
  ``Everybody can be great because anybody can serve. . . . You only 
need a heart full of grace. A soul generated by love.''
  By this measure, there are several other great young men and women 
who served as volunteers this year in my offices. They may toil in 
obscurity but their contributions to the constituents we serve are 
deeply appreciated. That is why today I rise to pay tribute to two 
extraordinary young persons for their service to my constituents in the 
18th Congressional District of Texas and to the American people. They 
are: Shannon O'Quinn from Texas Tech University; and Lauren Butia from 
The Madeira School.
  Mr. Speaker, the energy, intelligence, and idealism these wonderful 
young people brought to my office and those interning in the offices of 
my colleagues help keep our democracy vibrant. The insights, skills, 
and knowledge of the governmental process they gain from their 
experiences will last a lifetime and prove invaluable to them as they 
go about making their mark in this world.
  Because of persons like Shannon and Lauren the future of our country 
is bright and its best days lie ahead. I wish them well.
  Mr. Speaker, I am grateful that such thoughtful, committed young men 
and women can be found working in my office, those of my colleagues, 
and in every community in America. Their good works will keep America 
great, good, and forever young.
