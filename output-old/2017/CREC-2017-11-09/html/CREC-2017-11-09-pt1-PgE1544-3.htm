                    CONGRATULATIONS TO PAM TESTROET

                                 ______
                                 

                           HON. GARRET GRAVES

                              of louisiana

                    in the house of representatives

                       Thursday, November 9, 2017

  Mr. GRAVES of Louisiana. Mr. Speaker, I'd like to honor my 
constituent and friend, Pam Testroet, as incoming President of the 
Louisiana REALTORS Association. Pam and her leadership team will 
represent over 13,000 REALTOR members and have proven to be exemplary 
and dedicated volunteers to the organization. Home ownership is an 
important goal for most Americans, and certainly for citizens of 
Louisiana. It bolsters our state and local economies and helps with job 
creation. More importantly, home ownership is not just an aspiration 
that is part of the American Dream; to many Louisianans, it is a dream 
come true. REALTORS remain at the forefront and work tirelessly to help 
their clients achieve that dream. At a young age, Pam braved adversity 
and helped champion diversity in the historic story of Ruby Bridges. 
This kind of example gives us all hope for a better tomorrow. Pam had 
an extensive career in the telecommunications industry before earning 
her real estate license in 2003. She is passionate about education and 
homeownership and has served on the local, state and national level in 
various committees and roles. Pam is a proud REALTOR member with a 
passion for advocacy, policy, and fostering relationships to protect 
homeowners. I look forward to working with her, the leadership, and all 
the REALTORS in the coming year.
