  INTRODUCTION OF THE IMPROVING OVERSIGHT OF WOMEN VETERANS' CARE ACT

                                 ______
                                 

                          HON. J. LUIS CORREA

                             of california

                    in the house of representatives

                       Thursday, November 9, 2017

  Mr. CORREA. Mr. Speaker, women represent the fastest growing 
population in the veteran community. The Department of Veterans' 
Affairs reports that in 2016 women accounted for nearly 10 percent of 
the veteran population. This percentage will only increase in future 
years. It is vital that we ensure women veterans receive quality care 
in a safe and dignified environment, as well as in a timely manner.
  According to the Government Accountability Office, the Veterans 
Health Administration does not have data and performance measures to 
determine women veterans' accessibility to gender-specific care 
delivered through certain community care programs. GAO also reports 
that VHA does not have accurate or complete data regarding VA medical 
centers' compliance with environment of care standards for women 
veterans. Medical centers must conduct regular inspections and report 
instances of noncompliance, but sometimes these cases are not reported 
to VHA.
  Therefore, I am introducing the Improving Oversight of Women 
Veterans' Care Act. This legislation will enhance the monitoring needed 
for effective oversight of women veterans' healthcare in and out of the 
Department of Veterans' Affairs. To accomplish this goal, the bill will 
require VA to report to Congress on women veterans' accessibility to 
gender-specific healthcare in any community of care program and require 
VA medical facilities to report to the Secretary on their compliance 
and noncompliance with quality care standards.
