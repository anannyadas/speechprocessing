                       Thursday, November 9, 2017

  Mr. PAULSEN. Mr. Speaker, I offer congratulations to the Wayzata High 
School Boys Soccer team on winning the Minnesota State Championship 
Title.
  The Trojans topped off their incredible 20-0-2 season by coming home 
with the state championship trophy. It is inspiring to see a team that 
shows up with their best every day, and consistently comes out on top. 
After losing in the championship last year, they came back stronger 
than ever to win the state title in 2017.
  After a scoreless first half, sophomore Patrick Weah netted a goal 
that eventually decided the match. The Wayzata keeper, Daniel Weshons 
delivered a shutout after facing thirteen shots. Just before the 
buzzer, Ethan Wagner put a second goal in the net to secure Wayzata's 
victory.
  Mr. Speaker, the championship title earned by the Trojans shows how 
hard work throughout the season and the ability to play under pressure 
always pays off. These outstanding student-athletes have lived up to 
their obligations in the classroom and in the community.
  Congratulations again to the players, coaches, and parents of the 
Wayzata High School Boys Soccer team on becoming state champs. Go 
Trojans.
