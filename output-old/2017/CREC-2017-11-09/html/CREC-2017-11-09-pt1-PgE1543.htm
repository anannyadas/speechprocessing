                          HON. AL LAWSON, JR.

                               of florida

                    in the house of representatives

                       Thursday, November 9, 2017

  Mr. LAWSON of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to an 
educator par excellence, university administrator, trailblazer and 
community servant, Dr. Jacqueline Bolden Beck, who died on Tuesday, 
October 31, 2017, at the age of 86.
  Dr. Beck was born and raised in Gulfport, Mississippi. After 
completing her high school education, she went on to Dullard University 
where she graduated as an honor student receiving a Bachelor of Science 
degree in Nursing in 1955. She continued her education at the Indiana 
University, where she received her Master of Science degree in Nursing 
in 1958. Later, Dr. Beck would complete her Ph.D. studies at the 
University of Florida earning a Doctorate of Education in Curriculum 
and Instruction in 1976.
  Dr. Beck and her late husband, Dr. James Beck who she married in 
1957, both joined the faculty at Florida A&M University (FAMU) in 1958. 
She rose quickly through the faculty ranks, first as an instructor, 
then Assistant Professor, followed by Associate Professor and Acting 
Dean of the School of Nursing.
  In 1978, FAMU's former president, Walter L. Smith, Ph.D., entrusted 
Beck with developing the proposal that led to the creation of the 
School of Allied Health Sciences in 1982. Beck served as the founding 
dean of the School of Allied Health Sciences until 2000.
  During her time as Dean, the School of Allied Health Sciences 
received more than $13 million in extramural funding from Federal, 
State, and local agencies. The school evolved from two divisions, the 
Division of Medical Records Administration and Physical Therapy to five 
divisions, offering bachelor's degrees in cardiopulmonary science, 
healthcare management, health information management, occupational 
therapy and physical therapy and a master's in physical therapy by 
2000. Additionally, the school's programs were all accredited by their 
respective accrediting bodies and were sought after by students from 
across the country.
  Upon her retirement as Dean, Dr. Beck was appointed to the rank of 
Professor Emeritus. To commemorate her many contributions and 
dedication to the University, in 2007, the building that houses FAMU's 
Allied Health Sciences programs (Lewis-Beck Building) was named in her 
honor along with the late nursing school dean Margaret Lewis, Ph.D.
  She served on numerous boards and commissions including the Pew 
Health Professions Commission, Board of Directors of ASAHP, Board 
Member of the National Society of Allied Health, College of Health 
Deans Group, Board of the National Society of Allied Health Journal and 
as a member of the State-Wide Allied Health Articulation Task Force, 
appointed by the Florida Commissioner of Education.
  Dr. Beck was the recipient of the Cultural Pluralism Award by the 
Association of School of Allied Health Professions and in 2005, she was 
awarded the Honorary Doctorate of Humane Letters from the State 
University of New York, Down State. Dr. Beck was also very active in 
the Tallahassee community where she served in many organizations and on 
the boards of numerous community service groups.
  Throughout the ensuing decades of her life and career, she fashioned 
a powerful place in higher education and influenced the thinking of 
generations of young people. Driven by an enormous heart and keen 
intellect, Dr. Beck worked her entire life to give the opportunity of 
education to young people who had the will to cease it.
  Mr. Speaker, with an unwavering dedication, strong values, and an 
avid pursuit of ``leveling the playing field'' in higher education, Dr. 
Beck made a tremendous impact in her community, the state of Florida, 
and the nation. We must honor her life and legacy by keeping hers a 
torch kept lit.
