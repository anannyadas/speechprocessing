                     IN HONOR OF CHRIS VANDERSLICE

                                 ______
                                 

                           HON. BILL HUIZENGA

                              of michigan

                    in the house of representatives

                       Thursday, November 9, 2017

  Mr. HUIZENGA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Chris VanderSlice, 
who passed away on October 28, 2017 after a courageous four year battle 
with leukemia. Chris was a beloved educator and leader in the West 
Michigan community--whose legacy will never be forgotten.
   Chris, or ``Slice'' as his colleagues knew him best, was a servant 
leader with Grandville Public Schools for nearly 18 years. His career 
began as a teacher at Grandville's Middle School and South Elementary. 
Chris was then promoted to assistant principal at Grandville High 
School, where he became principal in 2013.
   A former Hope College basketball team captain, Chris brought his 
competitive spirit to the classroom and school district. He inspired a 
culture of ``pride and excellence,'' that influenced both students and 
teachers. After only a short time as principal, Chris implemented 
professional learning communities to improve teaching techniques and 
accountability.
   Following the initial diagnosis of acute lymphoblastic leukemia in 
2013, the Grandville community quickly rallied to embrace the 
VanderSlice family. The swift response from the community is a touching 
testament to the character of Chris, his family, and West Michigan as a 
whole. Chris leaves behind a legacy of ``grit and perseverance''--
characteristics that will continue to inspire, encourage, and forever 
impact generations to come.
   Mr. Speaker, Chris VanderSlice spent his life working to educate and 
better the students of Grandville, Michigan. It is thus fitting and 
proper that we honor him here today. I extend my deepest condolences to 
his wife Tonya, daughters Hannah and Elizabeth, and to all who knew and 
loved Chris.
