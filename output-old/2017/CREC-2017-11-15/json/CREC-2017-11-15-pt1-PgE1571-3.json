Mr. Speaker, today I rise in memory \noffallen Mississippi soldier Army Private First Class (PFC) Damian \nLaquasha Heidelberg who paid the ultimate sacrifice on November 15, \n2003, during Operation Iraqi Freedom. PFC Heidelberg was killed when \ntwo UH-60 Black Hawk helicopters collided in Mosul, Iraq. He served as \nan administrative specialist in the Army. PFC Heidelberg was assigned \nto 1st Battalion, 187th Infantry Regiment, 101st Airborne Division (Air \nAssault), Fort Campbell, Kentucky.\n  According to the Associated Press, PFC Heidelberg, a Shubuta, \nMississippi native, was a former choir member and church usher. He\n\n\nwas remembered by Staff Sergeant (SSG) Sylvester Watkins on a memorial \nwebsite. ``I served with him in the TOC and he was always smiling and \nalways spoke,'' SSG Watkins said. ``When I heard ofhis passing, I was \nhome on mid-tour leave from Iraq. I felt bad because it wasn't me. That \nkind of trait found in Heidelberg is so hard to find, it must remain on \nearth. However, I realize his body planted in the ground is merely a \nseed which, after the winter, will blossom and show its wonderful \ncolors. We will then know he is again among us. We love you, brother.''\n  Phyllis Heidelberg, PFC Heidelberg's aunt, told the Associated Press \nthat her nephew was a good man. ``He was a wonderful young man, sweet \nand mild mannered,'' Ms. Heidelberg said. ``He was slow to speak, loved \nto go to church, and always had a big smile.'' Jerry Jones, one of PFC \nHeidelberg's childhood friends, said of his determined work ethic. ``He \ntold me that he was trying to make something of himself,'' Mr. Jones \nsaid. ``He was trying to make it for his family and his baby.''\n  Prior to enlisting in the U.S. Army, PFC Heidelberg was a student in \nthe auto mechanic program at the Finch-Henry Job Corps Center in \nBatesville. To this day, a plaque commemorating PFC Heidelberg's \nservice is on display at the facility. Earlene Brewer, a career and \ntechnical training instructor, recently said PFC Heidelberg was a \nstandout student. ``He was a good soul,'' Mrs. Brewer said. ``He was \nvery friendly. His parents raised him right.''\n  PFC Heidelberg is survived by his father, Grady Jones; his mother, \nDeborah Heidelberg; and his daughter, Stacie.\n  PFC Heidelberg's service and sacrifice to protect America will not be \nforgotten.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. KELLY of Mississippi", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 3}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "187", "extension": true, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "E1571-E1572", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "15", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "RECOGNIZING THE LIFE OF FALLEN MISSISSIPPI SOLDIER ARMY PRIVATE FIRST CLASS (PFC) DAMIAN LAQUASHA HEIDELBERG", "id": "CREC-2017-11-15-pt1-PgE1571-3", "title": "RECOGNIZING THE LIFE OF FALLEN MISSISSIPPI SOLDIER ARMY PRIVATE FIRST  CLASS (PFC) DAMIAN LAQUASHA HEIDELBERG"}
