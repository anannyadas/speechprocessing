Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to the \nRepublican's tax scam that has been jammed through this Chamber without \nnormal order, without public debate, and without consideration for our \nNation's future.\n  I represent the heart of Las Vegas, a city that was one of the \nhardest hit during the financial crisis. Many of my constituents are \njust beginning to recover from the worst financial crisis since the \nGreat Depression, and this tax bill will greatly hinder their progress.\n  Some 20 percent of my constituents itemize their deductions, the vast \nmajority of whom earn under $75,000 per year. These families will all \nsee a tax hike if this bill becomes law because the deductions for \nstudent loans, medical expenses, sales tax, and some mortgages will all \ndisappear.\n  The sad reality is, they won't just feel the hit on April 15, tax \nday. They will feel it every single day. The deficit that this bill \nwill create will lead to State and local governments missing out on \nneeded Federal funding, and they will either have to slash vital \nprograms or raise taxes at that level. If the Senate has its way, they \nwill cut Medicare by $25 billion and repeal the ACA. This is not a tax \nreform. It is a system that will be rigged.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Ms. TITUS", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "187", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H9268", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "15", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "OPPOSING THE TAX BILL", "id": "CREC-2017-11-15-pt1-PgH9268-3", "title": "OPPOSING THE TAX BILL"}
