We thank You for Your steadfast love that sustains our \nlawmakers every hour. We thank You for surrounding our Senators with \nYour presence that permits them to dwell in peace.\n  Lord, we are grateful for the joy we all receive by observing the \nworks of Your hands, finding pleasure in the beauty of the sunrise and \nthe glory of the sunset. We gaze with wonder at the majesty of the \nbutterfly and the soaring eagle, knowing that the same hands that guide \nthem in flight desire to direct our steps.\n  Generous God, we celebrate Your love that provides redemption for \nhumanity. You sacrificed Yourself for our salvation.\n  Lord of all, to You we raise this our prayer of grateful praise.\n  We pray in Your bountiful Name. Amen.\n", "kind": "Unknown", "speaker": "Unknown", "itemno": 0, "turn": -1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 1}], "header": {"chamber": "Senate", "num": "187", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "S7225", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "15", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "PRAYER", "id": "CREC-2017-11-15-pt1-PgS7225-2", "title": "PRAYER"}
