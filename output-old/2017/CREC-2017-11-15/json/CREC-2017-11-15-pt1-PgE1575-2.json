Mr. Speaker, I rise to introduce legislation to make a \ncommonsense update to the Selective Service Registration system.\n  As my colleagues know, our country has long recognized the moral \ndilemma faced by those with strong religious or moral grounds against \nserving in the military and engaging in war. As noted by the Supreme \nCourt in Welsh vs. United States, there are many in our country ``whose \nconsciences, spurred by deeply held moral, ethical, or religious \nbeliefs, would give them no rest or peace if they allowed themselves to \nbecome a part of an instrument of war.''\n  Historically, Congress has provided for alternative service or \nexemption from service for those whose scruples and conscience cannot \nallow them to participate in combat or in any form of military service.\n  In today's all-volunteer military, those who have moral objections to \nparticipating in war can opt not to join the military. However, under \nthe Universal Military Training and Service Act, all men between the \nages of 18 and 26, including conscientious objectors, are still \nrequired to register for a national draft, should Congress authorize \none.\n  My bill would require that the Selective Service provide registrants, \nat the time of registration, with the option to indicate a desire to be \nclassified as a conscientious objector.\n  My bill would make clear that simply making that indication at \nregistration does not bind the U.S. in any way and does not assure that \nthe registrant will be so classified.\n  Finally, the bill would allow the Selective Service system to also \naccept, at the time of registration, written statements in support of a \nconscientious exemption claim.\n  I want to be clear that the legislation does not change current \nrequirements for how such claims are handled. Under current law, those \nwho pursue a conscientious exemption from military service during a \ndraft can only put forward an actual claim, with supporting evidence, \nafter they get an induction notice.\n  Again Mr. Speaker, our nation has a history of recognizing, as noted \nby the Supreme Court in Gillette v. United States, ``the situation of \nconscientious objectors to war, who, absent special status, would be \nput to a hard choice between contravening imperatives of religion and \nconscience or suffering penalties.'' My bill simply tries to make the \nprocess of registering those objections more direct and \nstraightforward.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Ms. MOORE", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 3}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "187", "extension": true, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "E1575", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "15", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "INTRODUCING LEGISLATION TO UPDATE THE SELECTIVE SERVICE REGISTRATION SYSTEM", "id": "CREC-2017-11-15-pt1-PgE1575-2", "title": "INTRODUCING LEGISLATION TO UPDATE THE SELECTIVE SERVICE REGISTRATION  SYSTEM"}
