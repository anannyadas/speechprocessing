Mr. Speaker, I rise today to lend my support to the flood \ninsurance reform legislation that we considered on this floor yesterday \nand passed.\n  Let me tell you the reasons and the importance of that particular \nlegislation. One is, the problems that it deals with is FEMA's flood \nplain maps can be inaccurate and are based on old technology. Property \nowners in the insurance flood plain plans are required to pay flood \ninsurance premiums, even though they may not be at risk under the old \nmaps whenever you look at it.\n  For example, today I brought a map from my district--one of the \nplaces in my district where these maps are wrong. This is actually \nCarterville, Illinois. If you will notice, as the flood plain comes \ndown here from the north, actually, that is really unique because, if \nyou will notice right beside it, out of the flood plain is the creek \nthat actually flows and the ditch that is the creek, and the flood \nplain is not in that. Yet it is over in the other area here, where it \naffects homes that are actually charged larger amounts of money on \ntheir flood insurance when they are not even in the flood plain. Yet it \nnever even continues to flow on down to Crab Orchard Lake, where the \nnatural water flow goes. So those areas are out of the flood plain, \naccording to this mapping.\n  The flood zone maps--here is the problem: property owners can \nchallenge the map under existing law, before we sent this over, and you \ncan challenge it, but it would cost you $2,000 to challenge that. Or if \nyou wanted to participate with your city, the city taxes would then be \ncharged $17,000 to challenge the map.\n  Flood insurance is vitally important and necessary to the people \naround this Nation and the security that it gives to others that are \nnot in flood plains for not having a cost dropped on them. But the \naccuracy of these maps are vitally important.\n  Two things the legislation did that were vitally important, it is \neasier and more affordable to appeal FEMA about their maps and whether \nor not something is in a flood plain. It also uses its higher \ntechnology to truly draft the flood plain maps in a way that they are \nfair, and that the costs are not unbearable to many homeowners.\n", "turn": 1, "speaker": "Mr. BOST", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "187", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H9258", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "15", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "FLOOD INSURANCE REFORM", "id": "CREC-2017-11-15-pt1-PgH9258", "title": "FLOOD INSURANCE REFORM"}
