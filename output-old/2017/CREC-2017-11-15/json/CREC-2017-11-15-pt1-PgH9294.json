Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Kentucky for \nyielding the time for this important legislation.\n  On January 29, 2017, U.S. Navy Chief Special Warfare Operator William \n``Ryan'' Owens was killed during a raid in Yemen. At the age of 36, he \ngave the ultimate sacrifice in order to protect our great Nation. \nToday, he is survived by his wife, Carryn, and their three young \nchildren.\n  Ryan Owens grew up in Edelstein, Illinois, in my congressional \ndistrict, a town that is in a very rural area with barely one stop \nsign. Friends and family say that, even at a very early age, Ryan knew \nhe wanted to serve his country as a Navy SEAL.\n  After graduating from Illinois Valley Central High School in \nChillicothe, Illinois, in 1998, he took the first steps towards his \ngoal by enlisting in the Navy.\n  Ryan served his first tour of duty at the Office of Naval \nIntelligence in Suitland, Maryland, eventually completing his SEAL \ntraining in California in 2002. Over the next 15 years, he completed \nfour tours as a U.S. Navy SEAL, working all over the globe to fight \nagainst terrorism and protect the interests of the United States.\n  Ryan was 2 years into his fifth tour as a Navy SEAL when he was \ntragically killed during an intelligence-gathering operation against an \nal-Qaida cell in Yemen.\n  Throughout his 15 years as a Navy SEAL, Ryan Owens gave much to our \ncountry, protecting our freedoms, and helping rid the world of evil. It \nis for these reasons that I introduced H.R. 3109, which will rename the \npost office in Chillicothe, Illinois, as the Sr. Chief Ryan Owens Post \nOffice Building.\n  My office and I worked closely with the U.S. Postal Service, the U.S. \nNavy Congressional Liaison's Office, the Central Illinois Gold Star \nFamilies, and, most importantly, Ryan's family. All of us were \ndetermined to make sure we got this right, choosing a location with \nstrong ties to the community in which Ryan grew up. In the end, it was \nhis wife, Carryn, who decided on Chillicothe, the town where Ryan \nattended and graduated high school, as the best place for this building \nto be renamed in his honor.\n\n\n  I was proud to introduce our bill with overwhelming bipartisan \nsupport here in the House with every member of the Illinois delegation \nsigning on as a cosponsor in support. It is my hope that the House acts \nto pass this bill today and that the Senate will quickly follow suit.\n  While we can never repay Chief Owens or his family for the sacrifices \nhe made, renaming the post office in his honor is a small way to thank \nhim for his service and dedication to protecting our great Nation and \nthe values that we hold so dear. We continue, today, to pray for Carryn \nand his children. We are indebted to his service and his sacrifice to \nour great country.", "turn": 5, "speaker": "Mr. LaHOOD", "itemno": 10}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "W000822", "text": "  Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN.
