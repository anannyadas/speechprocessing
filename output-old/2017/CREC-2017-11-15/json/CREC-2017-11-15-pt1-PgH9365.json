Mr. Speaker, tomorrow we are going to be asked to cast \nperhaps one of the most important votes that will take place in a \ncareer here in the House based on the tax plan that the Republicans \nhave put forward.\n  I say history is important, because this vote is likely to have \nconsequences for years and years and years to come.\n  As I noted earlier tonight, as we look at a million new veterans from \nthe wars in Afghanistan and Iraq who deserve our care, for those of us \nwho represent soldiers' homes and hospitals for the VA, we know just \nhow important this is.\n  We know what happens to Alzheimer's patients who are going to lose \nthe deduction on healthcare. We know what is going to happen to those \nstudents who currently write off parts of their student loans through \ninterest deductions. We know the assessed tax that is going to go on \nplaces like the University of Notre Dame and others. We also understand \nthat the homeowner deduction, the mortgage interest deduction, which is \na huge middle class benefit, is about to be taken away arbitrarily.\n  State and local taxes, in some cases sales taxes, are about to be \nabolished all based upon the premise of maybe there will be enough \neconomic growth.\n  There is no evidence, based on the tax cuts of 2001 and 2003 or the \nrepatriation that took place in 2004, that any of this is accurate, but \nthey continue to proceed.\n  The next part of the challenge is they have now substituted the old \nsupply side economics theory--remember tax cuts pay for themselves--and \nthey have come up with a new term, and the new term that they have come \nup with is ``dynamic scoring.''\n  So we have the challenge of technology, we have the challenge of \nglobalization, and, yes, we have the challenge of skill set across \nAmerica to move people into a direction of employment where they and \ntheir skills might be aligned with the jobs that are open, because the \nDepartment of Labor this week said there are 6 million jobs in America \nthat go unanswered, 18,000 precision manufacturing jobs in New England \nthat go unanswered, and 1 million tech jobs.\n\n\n  So we should be using this opportunity to invest in vocational \neducation; we should be using it to invest in internship programs; and, \nyes, we should be using it to invest in community colleges. So part of \nthis discussion should be based on, again, the historic vote of long-\nterm investment.\n  Now, we also know that is unlikely to happen because, when people \nhave a chance to look at these distribution tables on these tax cuts as \nto who gets what, they are going to be furious.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Napa, California (Mr. \nThompson), and then the gentleman from Connecticut (Mr. Larson) will be \nacknowledged right after that.", "turn": 1, "speaker": "Mr. NEAL", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "T000460", "text": "  Mr. THOMPSON of California. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for \nyielding.\n  It is not often that I come down and participate in these Special \nOrders, but\n\n\nI have got to tell you I was in my office watching the previous \nspeakers, and I started to get a little queasy from the spin that they \nwere providing from the floor, talking about what they say this bill \nwill do. I can tell you that there were a lot of inaccuracies in some \nof the things that they were trying to convince the American people \nthat they would benefit from this.\n  As Mr. Neal said, this bill, this vote, is an important vote. This is \ngoing to be around a long time. Numerous speakers today have mentioned \nthe fact that the last time we did major tax reform, a major tax \noverhaul, was over 30 years ago. So if that is any indication, we are \ngoing to be living with the consequences of this bill for a long time, \nand I don't think those consequences are anything to be proud of.\n  We heard repeatedly that this bill is not going to help at all the \nwealthiest people in the country, and you just can't help but laugh.\n  The last speaker came out and stated that this does away with the \nalternative minimum tax. The alternative minimum tax was put in place \nto ensure that the wealthiest of taxpayers actually pay taxes because \nthey were able to escape paying taxes, so that is why the alternative \nminimum tax came into play. They are the ones who pay this tax, so if \nyou do away with it, I don't see how you can, with a straight face, say \nthat this doesn't help wealthy Americans.\n  Inheritance tax was talked about a lot. As a matter of fact, it was a \nvery dishonest discussion. They kept referring to it as the ``death \ntax.'' We have heard this ad nauseam. We heard it in committee. We hear \nit on the floor. We have heard it for the past few years. This has been \na very clever campaign on the other side's part to discredit the \ninheritance tax.\n  If you open the Code, the Tax Code, there is nothing in the Code that \nsays the death tax. It doesn't exist. It is not real. It is made up. It \nis fiction.\n  We heard some very compelling arguments about how farmers will lose \ntheir farms if they don't do away with the death tax. There is no such \nthing as a death tax.\n  We heard repeatedly that, after somebody dies, it is unfair to make \nthem pay taxes. I am here to tell you, after you die, you will never \nhave to pay taxes.\n  The inheritance tax refers to inherited wealth. If I inherit money \nfrom my parents, then I am taxed on that wealth that I inherit. And \nthere is a provision in the law that says the first $11 million doesn't \nget touched, so it has got to be a pretty huge estate before you even \npay any taxes on it.\n  If there was all this concern about losing the family farm, then the \nRepublicans should have taken up my bill, a bill that I have had for a \nnumber of years with absolutely no support from the Republican side of \nthe aisle, that says, if you inherit the family farm or a family \nbusiness and you continue to farm it or you continue to run the \nbusiness, you are deferred from paying any inheritance tax. Now, if you \ninherit it and sell it and take the money and move to a beach in \nHawaii, then you would pay a tax on that inherited wealth.\n  So this is subterfuge, at best. It is dishonesty, at worst.\n  The last speaker said that American families are big winners in this \nbill. Well, I don't know whose American family he was talking about.\n  Mr. Neal was right when he said American families had a chance to be \nbig winners if we had used this opportunity to invest in workers, \ninvest in training, invest in community colleges, create jobs, create \nopportunities, build this tax reform from the middle class, the working \nclass out.\n  But, instead, we didn't do that. We didn't even talk about it. We \ndidn't talk about it because we didn't have a single hearing on one of \nthe most important bills that we will cast a vote on in our time in \nCongress. We didn't hear from one expert witness.\n  They dropped this bill, written in secret. As a matter of fact, many \nof our Republican colleagues were complaining that they didn't get a \nchance to see what was in the bill. They dropped this on us at the last \nminute.\n  We could have worked with them. We could have addressed some of these \nissues. We could have figured out how to invest in the American worker. \nWe could have figured out how to make investments that created jobs. \nBut, no, we didn't get to do that because we didn't have any hearings. \nIt was written in the middle of the night, in a dark room someplace way \nout of our wheelhouse.\n  They said they had to do this because the Tax Code was too big, and I \nagree with them. I think it is too big. I think it does need to be \nreformed.\n  But the fact of the matter is, and Joint Tax testified on this, if \ntheir bill is passed and signed into law, it won't do away with a \nsingle chapter of the Tax Code, but, instead, it will add one more to \nit. So this is literally making the Tax Code bigger.\n  And I want to know who those American families are who some of my \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle claim will be helped by this, \nbecause this is what I see in reading this and reading the analyses \nfrom different experts.\n  If someone in your family has Alzheimer's, you will pay more because \nthey are going to take away the medical expense deduction that you now \ncan take advantage of.\n\n  Low-income folks with kids, you are going to pay more when you are \nexcluded from the child tax credit.\n  If you are a teacher, dedicated to your students and to their well-\nbeing and you take money out of your own pocket to buy pencils, \nsupplies, and things for your classroom, today you get a deduction for \nthat because we know how important education is. But under this bill, \nyou will pay more because they are taking that deduction away, too.\n  We just heard from a veteran on the other side who said how great \nthis is for veterans. Well, let me tell you, if you are a veteran and \nyou get your duty station reassigned and you have to go someplace else \nand the house you have to sell in your first duty station, if you \nhaven't lived in it for 8 years, you are going to be taxed on any \nprofit from that. So if you are a veteran and you get transferred, you \nare not going to benefit from this. You are going to lose.\n  Do you have a student loan? And we all know how expensive those are \nthese days. If you do, you are going to pay more because they are \ntaking away your ability to deduct the interest payment on your student \nloan.\n  Do you own a home? If you do, you will pay more when they limit the \nmortgage deduction, mortgage interest deduction.\n  By the way, as we heard in committee during the markup on this bill, \nthis could actually decrease the value of your home by 10 percent. Now, \ntell me how that helps working class, middle class families to say, all \nthat money that you have been saving by buying your home, we are going \nto take 10 percent away from the value of that? That certainly doesn't \ncreate a big win for American families.\n  Are you in the middle class, that big win for American families, \nthose middle class families? Because the analysis says that 36 million \nmiddle class families are going to see a tax hike in this bill.\n  Do you deduct your State and local taxes? Well, if you do, you are \ngoing to pay more because you are going to lose that deduction, too.\n  Do you care about infrastructure investments in your community?\n  I had a visit yesterday from the head of the San Francisco airport. \nHe came in because of this bill. I don't represent San Francisco, but \nhe came in to see me because I am a member of this committee, and he \nknew we were going to be taking this bill up.\n  They have a tremendous amount of infrastructure investment pending. \nThey do it with the bonds that will be disallowed under this bill, the \nsame, similar type of action that they are going to do in regard to \nlow-income housing.\n  In my State, we need housing badly, and we are able to build low-\nincome housing by using those bonds that are made available in our Tax \nCode. That goes away. That hurts homes. That hurts people who want to \nmove into homes.\n  And I will tell you, in my district, it is a particularly raw subject \nright now because in one of my counties, Sonoma County, we had a 2 \npercent vacancy rate in residential housing about a month ago. And \nabout a month ago now, we had the worst fire in California history. In \nSonoma County, it wiped\n\n\nout 5 percent of the residential housing stock. There were about 9,000 \nhomes, total, in the fire that were destroyed, homes in Sonoma, homes \nin Napa, homes in Lake, homes in Mendocino, homes in Butte, homes down \nin southern California, and that just further deteriorated the housing \nshortage problem that we face. So to take away ability to construct \nnew, low-income housing hurts.\n  But I think what hurt even more is, in this bill, they took away the \nability for individuals and families, those middle class families that \nthey are talking about helping, they took away their ability to write \noff their losses due to a disaster.", "turn": 2, "speaker": "Mr. THOMPSON of California", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "L000557", "text": "  Mr. LARSON of Connecticut.

Mr. Speaker, I think my good friend and colleague from \nCalifornia is raising a very important point, and it is a point that \nall of us here this evening on the Ways and Means Committee, with the \nleadership of Mr. Neal from Massachusetts, have been raising for some \ntime.\n  Doing tax reform right is tough. There are a lot of moving pieces to \nit, and there are a lot of traps and unintended consequences if you do \nit the wrong way. Not having one hearing, not having proper vetting, \nnot taking the time to listen to people back home in our respective \nStates and districts about the consequences of something that is going \nto affect every American life in this country is legislative \nmalpractice, and that is what we are on the verge of committing leading \nup to tomorrow's vote.\n  My friend from California mentioned the $2.3 trillion in additional \ndebt over the next 10 years by the time you add in the interest \npayments and how devastating that will be, and it is happening at the \nwrong time.\n  I mean, we might have gotten away with that with the 1981 tax cuts \nthat weren't paid for back then because there was a little bit of time \nto recover\n\n\nfrom a big fiscal mistake, and from 2001, 2003. We have run out of time \nas a nation, with 70 million baby boomers beginning their massive \nretirement, 10,000 a day joining Social Security and Medicare.\n  But their entire theory is premised on the fact that over two-thirds \nof the tax cut will be going to large corporations under their bill of \nthis illusory growth that is going to come from it. Part of that is \nbased on this tax holiday, they call it deemed repatriation, where \nthese multinational companies are going to be able to bring dollars \nback into America at a much lower rate and supposedly reinvesting here \nthat is going to promote growth.\n  But there was a recent survey by Bank of America and Merrill Lynch of \n300 executives of some of the largest U.S. multinational companies \nasking them what they would do with this deemed repatriated money \ncoming back to the country. Their number one response was paying down \ndebt. Reinvesting in their company, reinvesting in research and \ndevelopment, investing in more jobs and good-paying jobs barely \nregistered in that survey.\n  But this should not come as a surprise. It is not like we haven't \nbeen down this road before. We tried a repatriation bill back in the \nearly 2000s, where these companies were able to bring back a ton of \nmoney, and what they used it for was dividend give-outs and stock \nbuybacks. Yet they are refusing to learn the lessons of the past and \ngoing on this theory of an illusory growth that none of the major \neconomists see under this tax bill, and it is a huge fiscal gamble that \nI think i going to leave us in the same place as the 2001 and 2003 tax \ncuts, which was one of the worst decades when it came to job growth in \nour country.\n", "turn": 29, "speaker": "Mr. KIND", "itemno": 29}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "N000015", "text": "  Mr. NEAL.

It is important because \nI know that it will affect, in one way or the other, every citizen of \nthis country.\n  As I listened to the debate over the last 2 days, I know that America \nis at a great crossroads, and that we can either go forward or we can \ngo backwards.\n  We can go forward into a new era of job creation, supporting \neducation for all, and keeping the greatest level of healthcare that \nthis country has ever known.\n  Or we can go backwards, backwards with Marie Antoinette-type tax \npolicy that takes opportunity and bread from the middle class, and then \nsay: Let them eat cake.\n  Or we can go forward with a more equitable tax plan, one that \npromotes infrastructure protection and development by keeping the \nprovisions for State and local deductions, which everybody knows will \ncreate jobs, jobs, and jobs.\n  We can go forward by making sure that the access we currently have to \nquality healthcare will continue.\n  I hear many people talking about what we will get from H.R. 1, what I \ncall the Republican Marie Antoinette tax bill.\n  But let me just mention some of what we will not get that we already \nhave. Teachers will not get the ability to write off the $250 that they \nspend out of their pockets for materials and supplies for their \nstudents. Students will lose $65 billion in Federal funds to help make \ncollege more affordable. Senior citizens, as we have already heard, \nwith Alzheimer's will lose the ability to write off high medical costs. \nStudent loan interest can no longer be used.\n  Cities like mine; like Philadelphia; like Detroit; like Gary, \nIndiana; cities all over the country will not be able to make use of \nthe new market tax credits to rebuild slum and blighted areas.\n  Many of those areas have been laying fallow for 50 and 60 years, \nwhere there used to be thriving communities. Historical buildings will \nbe left standing because the tax credits to restore them will no longer \nbe available, losing the opportunity to create jobs and work \nopportunities for people who are unemployed.\n  Under the bill, any way that you cut it, the middle class will lose \nand the special interests and the wealthy will again win.\n  I know that we are again being sold the idea of what I call trickle-\ndown economics. Feed those at the top, and crumbs will trickle down to \nall the rest of society, even though study after study has shown that \nthis does not work. It is nothing more than a theory, far from any \nbasis of truth.\n  I think that we have no choice. When I hear these kinds of \ndiscussions, I think of all kinds of things.

They are taking away the 199 tax deduction, which is \nas important for our domestic manufacturers as it is for our family \nfarmers.\n  If you want to grow things and invent things and create things, make \nthings in America, the 199 has a proven track record of making it \neasier for our farmers and manufacturers to do it. Under their bill, \nthat goes away.\n  That operating loss carryback, which is important for a lot of \nfarmers in order to recoup some of the losses that they have \nexperienced in their business, it goes away.\n  Like-kind exchanges for property and heavy machinery in farm country \ngoes away. A lot of my farmers are operating on a margin right now. I \nam concerned about the impact this is going to have on the rural \neconomy and our family farmers with what they are proposing.\n  You don't have to be from a city or from a rural district to \nunderstand that, again, the work wasn't put into this bill to \nunderstand the real consequences of what they are asking for. It is not \ntoo late. We can still regroup and work in the bipartisan fashion that \ntax reform was meant to occur and figure out a way to truly simplify, \nmake us more competitive, but make it fair for working families, small \nbusinesses, and family farmers in all of our districts, rather than \nthis rush to judgment just so they can score a political win before the \nend of the year.\n\n\n  So I think the points that my friend from Chicago raised are very \nvalid, and it is something that I would hope all of us would heed \nbefore we reach our final decision tomorrow morning.", "turn": 35, "speaker": "Mr. KIND", "itemno": 35}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "D000096", "text": "  Mr. DANNY K.

What I \nmean by that is, when the minority doesn't get an opportunity to bring \nforth witnesses, to have hearings--and you heard Mr. Neal talk about \nthe more than 30 hearings in the committee, the more than 12 \nsubcommittee hearings, the 450-plus experts that we never got to hear \nfrom--you understand the position that we find ourselves in.\n  As I said earlier, this impacts 100 percent of our economy and 100 \npercent of our people. We all swear an oath of allegiance to the \nConstitution, but apparently on the other side, they swear an oath of \nallegiance to Grover Norquist because that is more important than \nfulfilling our constitutional responsibility and going through regular \norder and having the experts.\n  It is more important to take a pledge to Mr. Norquist and pass \nsomething politically in as pure a bare-knuckle way as you possibly can \nwithout any amendments being made in order and rushing the bill to the \nfloor in haste, without any concern for the ramifications that it has \nother than fulfilling a pledge to Mr. Norquist, and also a pledge, as \nwe have heard from some of their Members, to their donor base.\n  That is what has frustrated us on this side of the aisle. I think Mr. \nNeal said it very clearly, we had a missed opportunity here. Mr. Kind \nmentioned that we still have that opportunity. If there are enough \npeople on that side of the aisle--and we know there are. We know \nregionally, as Mr. King and Mr. Zeldin have said, that this tax bill \nrepresents the greatest shift that we have seen in wealth in this \ncountry from the middle class of the Northeast and West Coast to the \nrest of the country.\n  It is unconscionable that this would take place under the guise of \ntrying to say that you are providing middle class tax relief.\n  I went to the commissioner of revenue services in the State of \nConnecticut and asked: How will this impact our citizens? It represents \nan increase in taxes for the middle class, not this so-called tax cut \nthat the other side has perpetrated.\n  I want to point out this claw that exists within here. Because even \nfor those States, red State or blue State, where you think you might \nreceive a de minimis tax cut today, it is clawed back within 5 years \nbecause they put something in the Code, commonly referred to as a \n``chained CPI.''

The focus is \non directing that tax relief to the people in the middle and the people \nwho are trying to get there.''\n  This bill is the opposite. As we discussed with our ranking member at \nthe markup, and we challenged it, the Joint Tax said to us: Well, I \nthink--and we will show this to you--that there are going to be \nmillions of people in the middle class who, in subsequent years, will \nhave their taxes increased, not decreased. Millions.\n  When we asked about the passthrough--picking up on the gentleman's \npoint about the middle class--he pointed to tables which showed that \nthe vast majority of the moneys that are going to go through \npassthroughs, that are going to get some tax help, the vast majority \nare for very wealthy people.

Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from \nMichigan.

I asked him: Will this fall unevenly as we have seen \nacross the Northeast and as we have seen across the West Coast?\n  The response was: It is not possible to say that in all cases--\nmeaning all 50 States--that these taxpayers will have lower total \nincome tax liability under H.R. 1 than under the present law.\n  Why?\n  Because they are not going to be allowed to take the deductions they \nnormally get. In the State of Connecticut, 41 percent of our citizens \nutilize and itemize their deductions under the code that they have been \nable to do since 1913 and its inception.\n  Why is this important?\n  Well, we have heard Mr. Brady say--after everyone gets up and speaks, \nhe talks about what is going on in their district in an overgeneralized \nmanner.\n  So I asked Joint Tax: What would it be for a couple in West Hartford \nwith a child in college?\n\n  They own a home and have a combined income of $125,000. Under the \nRepublican plan, they would see a $767 tax increase in 2018, and they \nwould see more than a $1,667 tax increase in 2023, when the family \ncredit expires, a point Mr. Neal has made repeatedly.\n  Tax cuts are made permanent for corporations and the wealthy. The \nwealthy get the alternative minimum tax and they get the estate tax and \nthey are made permanent. For those of you who may think you are even \ngoing to get a tax cut, the Norquist clawback provision, under \nsomething we referred to as ``chained CPI,'' takes it away after the \nfifth year.\n  So we find ourselves in this god-awful position without public \nhearings and without the ability to call expert witnesses and to only \nhave a back-and-forth between Democrats and Republicans.\n  The Republicans need a political win. That is probably true. But who \nreally needs to win here are the American people. The American people \nexpect more of us.

Mr. Speaker, I would be glad to. Just by way of \nintroduction, I thank the ranking member for his leadership.\n  As the gentleman said, the biggest challenge we face in this \ncountry--and it is not a Democrat or Republican issue--is that wages \nhave been stagnant for Americans for 20 years. They haven't had a pay \nraise. That is a huge challenge because the American Dream has always \nbeen premised on the fact that our parents have made an economy that \nhas provided more opportunity for their kids.\n  Wages are flat. America hasn't had a pay raise in 20 years. So the \nfundamental question for me on a tax bill is whether that tax bill will \nincrease opportunity for hardworking Americans. And it doesn't matter \nwhere they are\n\n\nfrom, rural or urban. It doesn't matter what their race is. It doesn't \nmatter what their gender or their sexual orientation is. Most Americans \nwant to work and they want to take care of the people they love and \nthey want to have an opportunity.\n  This tax bill comes up real short. By the way, I want to be somewhat \nself-critical of the Democrats. We haven't been where we have needed to \nbe, oftentimes, which is for hardworking Americans, but I think we are \nsolidly where we need to be on this tax bill.\n  Mr. Speaker, I will give the gentleman a couple of examples in \nexplicit response to his question. I went out to a school that provided \ntraining for young Vermont men and women who wanted to become welders. \nThat is a great job. They get out of school and they get a job that \npays them good wages. They have got to borrow money in order to do \nthat.\n  In some cases, they have an employer who pays their tuition. Under \nthis tax bill, that young woman or that young man who gets tuition \nassistance from his or her employer has to declare that as income and \npay taxes on it.\n  That is an opportunity tax. A lot of those folks have borrowed money. \nWe have got a wonderful Vermont Student Assistance Corporation program. \nIt doesn't matter whether you are a Republican child or a Democratic \nchild, you get low interest loans. They have lost their tax deduction.\n  This is when they are beginning their career, so their income is not \ngreat, and they are trying to pay their bills, maybe get a condominium; \nmaybe, if they are really lucky, get a house. They have got to pay more \ntaxes as a result of this bill.\n  The other thing is private activity bonds. This is unbelievable \nbecause what those bonds are--I didn't know much about this before I \ncame to Congress--but it is a benefit where there can be an opportunity \nto borrow money from the private market, by the way, in order to \nprovide low interest rates. The people who buy these bonds get the \nbenefit of a tax deduction in order to provide a continuing benefit to \nlower interest rates for kids who are trying to get a welding degree or \na community college degree or a higher education degree.\n  We are taking that away. We are taking away opportunity. We are \nimposing a big tax on the opportunity for young women and men in \nVermont. There is not a single Republican who would want to do that. \nBut we don't have an opportunity in this bill to propose an amendment, \nto say: Hey, wait a minute. We made a mistake on this provision because \nwe don't want the would-be welders in Alabama, the would-be welders in \nTexas, the would-be welders in Vermont to have to pay more in order to \ndevelop a skill that is really essential to making those joints on our \nbridges and doing the things that we need to rebuild our cities.\n  We are not allowed an opportunity to propose an amendment where every \nsingle American would know whether your Representative wanted to impose \nan opportunity tax on that student who wants to become a welder.\n  Where is the democracy in this? Where is the transparency in this?\n  That is what really is heartache for me. As Chairman Neal knows, we \ngrew up in the same city and it was rough and tumble, working class, \nproud people, and ethnic.\n\n\n  We played hard in sports, and we battled all the time. But we had a \nkind of common pride in the value of work. We saw how hard our parents \nworked. We didn't necessarily notice that when we should have when we \nwere younger. But as we grew up, we really were stunned at the kind of \ncommitment they had to rebuilding the city that we were in and the \ngentleman became mayor of. We became so appreciative of the opportunity \nthey gave us.\n  I grew up in a family of six kids, and how my parents did it in a \nsmall house with four bedrooms and sharing a bedroom, we didn't know. \nIt was only after the fact that we became aware of how wonderful this \nopportunity was that they gave us and the sacrifices that they made.\n  Isn't it our job in this House of Representatives to give everybody \nthe same opportunity to the experience that Mr. Neal had, that Mr. \nLipinski had, and that I had? That was on the shoulders of parents who \nsacrificed for our benefit.\n  So the bottom line for me on this tax bill is whether it enhances the \nopportunity of every American striver, every American who wants to \nbecome better, more contributing, more of an active citizen, more of an \naccomplished adult, and more of a contributor to our workforce. Does \nthis bill help them achieve that or does it impede them from doing \nthat?\n  When I look just at one specific provision where we say that students \nare going to have to pay taxes on the interest that they pay on their \nstudent loan or when a student who earns, in fact, a scholarship or a \nfellowship to go advance their higher education and they have to pay \nincome tax on that, I am truly horrified because this country--and this \nis not a Republican-Democratic deal--is all based on the optimism that, \nif we give people opportunity, it will benefit all of us. It will \nbenefit that individual who is there to seize that opportunity and make \nthe best of what they can do and, therefore, build the country.\n  So, Mr. Speaker, I really appreciate the ranking member's efforts on \nthis.", "turn": 46, "speaker": "Mr. WELCH", "itemno": 46}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "N000015", "text": "  Mr. NEAL.

Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Neal, the ranking member of \nthe Ways and Means Committee, for all his work.\n  I want to talk tonight from the perspective of Blue Dog Democrats.\n  Now, clearly, we all know--and Mr. Welch very eloquently talked about \nthe needs of the middle class and people who are struggling--it is far \npast time that we reform the Tax Code by making it simpler, closing \nloopholes, and lowering rates. However, this bill that we are going to \nbe voting on tomorrow is certainly not the answer for the middle class.\n  Now, it didn't have to be this way. Throughout the year, I heard from \nRepublican lawmakers and from the White House about the benefits of \ncreating a bipartisan tax reform plan. As the policy co-chair of the \nBlue Dog Coalition representing modern Democrats, I coordinated the \ncoalition's creation of key principles needed for a permanent, \nbipartisan tax reform bill. Our reform principles called for the \nfollowing:\n  First, tax reform must be passed with an open, bipartisan process and \nthrough regular order.\n  Second, tax reform must be credibly revenue neutral and should not \nuse unrealistic economic growth projections to offset the costs of tax \nreform or tax relief.\n  Third, American companies need a more competitive corporate tax rate \nand structure in order to maintain their ability to compete globally. \nCongress must also account for the needs of small businesses when it \ncomes to setting tax rates.\n  Fourth, and most importantly, the middle class must be the priority \nin this tax bill.\n  Fifth, Congress should use tax reform to address the funding \nchallenges for the highway trust fund.\n  Taken together, I think most people would say that this is a good, \nsound set of principles; but, disappointingly, H.R. 1 fails to meet \nthese criteria.\n  First, this bill is not bipartisan. The Blue Dogs met with the \nTreasury Secretary, the Director of the National Economic Council, as \nwell as the chairman of the committee. We were told that they wanted \nthis to be a bipartisan bill.\n  But the bill was passed in committee less than a week after it was \nintroduced and less than a day--even less than that--after last-minute \nchanges were made by the chairman. The committee voted down every \nDemocratic amendment on a party-line vote, and 1 week later, this bill \nis being brought to the floor with no amendments allowed.\n  This is clearly not bipartisan, and it is tough to argue that this is \nan open process of regular order where Members get to participate in \nthe process.\n  But what about the contents of the bill?\n  First, it is not revenue neutral. We were told that this bill would \nbe revenue neutral using dynamic scoring, that is, when considering \nadditional revenue that will be raised from increased economic growth \nbecause of\n\n\nthe tax cuts. Some dismiss dynamic scoring out of hand, but I believe \nthat it can be legitimate. But as we were about to vote on the bill, \neven the idea of having an official dynamic score of this bill before \nvoting on it seems to have completely disappeared.\n  What we do know is that the nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation \nsays it will add nearly $1.5 trillion plus interest to our debt, which \nis currently $20 trillion and growing. The one rough dynamic score that \nhas been produced by the rightwing Tax Foundation shows that this bill, \nas originally introduced, would still add over $1 trillion to our debt.\n  The new debt is not even used to put the needs of middle class \nAmericans first. The bulk of the benefits from the bill favor \nbusinesses and corporations rather than individual taxpayers.\n\n  The Tax Policy Center estimates that families would only get the \nbenefit of about one-third of the tax cuts offered by the bill, with \ncorporations and other businesses getting twice as much. This is \nbecause of the unbalanced way in which business tax rates are lowered \nwith relatively few cuts to corporate deductions.\n  But as we have heard many of our speakers talk about all of the \ndeductions, they are going to hurt middle class Americans as they try \nto deal with growing expenses for healthcare, education, and childcare.\n  Of course, true tax reform can alter some of these provisions in \norder to simplify the Tax Code. But we must make sure that, at the end \nof the day, middle class families' pocketbooks are not harmed by the \nchanges that we make.\n  While many tout that this bill doubles the standard deduction, it is \nimportant to understand that it also eliminates personal exemptions. \nThis means that families with children or other dependents may be worse \noff.\n  There are other examples of deductions lost that will negatively \nimpact middle class families. We have heard many of them, including the \nmedical expense deduction. That means that families with very high \nexpenses, such as long-term care for extraordinary illnesses, will pay \nhigher tax bills.\n  The bill also makes student loan borrowers pay new taxes on the loan \ninterest they pay.\n  The list goes on.\n  One particularly contentious part of this bill is that it severely \ncurtails the deduction individual taxpayers take for State and local \ntaxes paid. Supporters of this idea claim that this deduction is an \nunfair subsidy from the Federal Government to high-tax cities and \nStates, but in my own State of Illinois where taxpayers will get hit \nhard by this, we already get only 79 cents back from the Federal \nGovernment for every dollar we contribute in taxes. Taking away the \nState and local tax deduction will only make this discrepancy worse.\n  Now, one particularly troubling aspect of this bill is that, while it \nadds some new incentives to make it easier to raise children and \nsupport families, these incentives expire after 5 years, even as \nprovisions that primarily benefit high-income taxpayers and \ncorporations are made permanent.\n  When analyzed as a whole, the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center predicts \nthat any tax relief some middle class families might receive from this \nbill will disappear over time. Yet families in the top of 1 percent and \neven the top one-tenth of 1 percent will not only see immediate relief, \nbut even larger returns in the long run.\n  Finally, this bill does nothing to address a major tax issue that our \nNation faces: the fact that the highway trust fund that pays for \nFederal roads and transit projects is taking more and more money every \nyear out of general revenue. We need to fix the highway trust fund, and \nif we did that here, we could also start finally doing some of those \ntrillion-dollar infrastructure projects that the President keeps \ntalking about.\n  So, once again, in this bill, the House is choosing to pursue a \nneedlessly partisan, closed process for major legislation with wide-\nranging impacts and enormous price tags. I really urge my colleagues to \nchange course. Pursue a truly bipartisan reform so that we do well by \nAmerican families and businesses that need Congress to act on this \ncritical issue.\n  Mr. Speaker, I thank Ranking Member Neal for all his work on this.", "turn": 48, "speaker": "Mr. LIPINSKI", "itemno": 48}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "N000015", "text": "  Mr. NEAL.
