{"content": [{"text": "  Dr. Glynn Stone, Mobberly Baptist Church, Longview, Texas, offered \nthe following prayer:\n  Thank You, Lord, for these times when our Nation has recognized her \nneed for You. God, You are our help in ages past and our hope for years \nto come. You can see our trust in You is engraved throughout this very \nbuilding. So before any speeches are heard or votes are cast or \ndecisions are made, we recognize that our greatness comes only from \nYour grace.\n  So I humbly ask You to remind each of these, Your servants, of their \nspecial responsibility, to lead in Your way, to lean on Your word, and \nto listen to Your voice. As they represent constituents, may they \ndefend the defenseless, protect those in danger, and promote good, so \nthat all Americans can reflect Your image and bring glory to You and \naccomplish Your will.\n  Your providential hand has promoted us to these lofty positions and \nwill assuredly judge our stewardship of these responsibilities. So we \nsubmit this day and ourselves to You, Jesus, my Lord.\n  Amen.\n", "kind": "Unknown", "speaker": "Unknown", "itemno": 0, "turn": -1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 1}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "187", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H9264", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "15", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "PRAYER", "id": "CREC-2017-11-15-pt1-PgH9264-3", "title": "PRAYER"}
