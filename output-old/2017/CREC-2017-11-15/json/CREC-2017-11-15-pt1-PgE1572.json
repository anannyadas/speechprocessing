Mr. Speaker, this year the Riverdale Neighborhood House is \ncelebrating its 145th Anniversary, and to mark the occasion they are \nhonoring the family that started it all for them, the Dodges, at their \nannual anniversary gala.\n  Few names are as synonymous with RNH and the Northwest Bronx as the \nDodges. Their roots in the community run deep, starting in 1872 when \nGrace Hoadley Dodge founded the Riverdale Neighborhood House. Grace, at \nthe age of 16, created a small library in one of the greenhouses on her \nfamily's property in Riverdale. The library became a hub for the \nworkers in Riverdale and grew from there. In 1884, Grace helped \nRiverdale Neighborhood House acquire its own building, which provided \ncommunity based services for the workers of Riverdale.\n  In 1917, Grace's brother, Cleveland Hoadley Dodge, established the \nCleveland H. Dodge Foundation. At the time, the Dodge family was \nprofiting greatly off their copper mining business due to the Great \nWar. Dodge was determined, as he wrote to his Presbyterian pastor, that \n``I will not burn my pockets by keeping a cent of the money coming to \nme from war profits.'' He set up the Foundation with the very general \nprovisio that its income should be used ``for the betterment of \nmankind.'' Ever since its establishment, grants have been made by the \nFoundation to charitable and cultural institutions in New York City. In \nmany cases, members of the family had helped to found them and \nsubsequent generations have continued to support them.\n  The combined good works of RNH and the Cleveland H. Dodge Foundation \nare too many to list. Through the years, many members of the Dodge \nfamily have shared their wealth, wisdom and support to the programs and \nservices at RNH: Grace Parish Dodge, (Mrs. Cleveland H. Dodge) \ncontributed to the Bayard Dodge Pool project in 1945; Mrs. Pauline M. \nDodge, (Mrs. Cleveland E. Dodge) served on the RNH Board for many \nyears, and Grace's grand nephew and grand nieces, Alfred H. Howell, \nElizabeth Dodge R. Haxall, and Ruth Rea Howell, also served RNH during \ntheir lifetimes.\n  The commitment the Dodge family has shown to RNH and our neighborhood \nis inspiring. They have done a wealth of good for my constituents and I \nwant to thank them as they receive this great honor\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. ENGEL", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 3}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "187", "extension": true, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "E1572", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "15", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "HONORING THE DODGE FAMILY", "id": "CREC-2017-11-15-pt1-PgE1572", "title": "HONORING THE DODGE FAMILY"}
