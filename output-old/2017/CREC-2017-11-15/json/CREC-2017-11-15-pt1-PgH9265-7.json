Mr. Speaker, this is a historic week, one that has been 31 \nyears in the making. In a once-in-a-generation vote, we will vote to \ncut taxes for the middle class and unleash the power of the American \neconomy.\n  Our Tax Code is more than 70,000 pages of opaque rules and \nregulations\n\n\nthat cost Americans money and jobs. In critical ways, our Tax Code \ngives explicit economic advantage to our foreign competitors. That \nchanges with this bill.\n  The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act puts the American taxpayer and the American \neconomy first. The bill cuts taxes for individuals and families in \nevery tax bracket.\n  By lowering rates, doubling the standard deduction, and increasing \nthe child tax credit, hardworking American families can keep more money \nin their paychecks. The average family of four earning $55,000 will see \na tax cut of over $1,000.\n  This bill will supercharge our economy by making everyone play by the \nsame rules. It substantially reduces taxes on small businesses and \nmanufacturers. This means more jobs, more money, and more opportunity \nfor American workers.\n  Tax reform is the single best thing we can do for our economy. I urge \nall my colleagues to support this bill.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. DUNN", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "187", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H9265-H9266", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "15", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "TAX CUTS", "id": "CREC-2017-11-15-pt1-PgH9265-7", "title": "TAX CUTS"}
