The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nMinnesota (Mr. Walz) for 5 minutes.", "turn": 0, "speaker": "The SPEAKER pro tempore", "itemno": 0}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "W000799", "text": "  Mr. WALZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise today as the ranking member of the \nHouse Veterans' Affairs Committee, as the co-chair of the National \nGuard and Reserve Components Caucus, as the co-chair of the \nCongressional Veterans Jobs Caucus, and probably more importantly, as a \nretired enlisted soldier to bring to your attention a number of \nprovisions in the GOP tax bill that will negatively impact the men and \nwomen currently serving and transitioning from the United States \nmilitary.\n  Mr. Speaker, I want to be clear. Tax reform is a laudable goal. It \nwould have been nice had we actually done it, had we actually had \ndebates, had we actually had witnesses. Zero, zero, zero. What we have \nis a closed-door bill brought forward and forced upon the House. In my \nopinion, trying to think that the American people would not watch what \nhappens here is pretty risky.\n  These are folks in the military who risked everything to give us the \nright to debate things here. We should at least probably debate their \nfuture in an open manner. I hope we will strongly consider, Mr. \nSpeaker, each of these following provisions in this bill that will put \nthe prosperity of America's heroes at risk.\n  As the legislation is written, this tax plan includes provisions that \nwill specifically harm members and veterans to help pay for tax cuts \nfor corporations and the ultrawealthy.\n  How can you justify giving a tax cut for carrying interest, but not \nfor carrying a rucksack?\n  That is what that vote will be today. Be very clear about this. When \nyou cast your ``yes'' vote, you are being very clear.\n  The first thing it does is it repeals tax credits proven to help \nveterans find employment when they come home, such as the repeal of the \nWork Opportunity Tax Credit, which includes the Help Hire Our Heroes \nAct. This credit is available to employers who hire veterans who have a \nservice-connected disability, or are unemployed, or receive SNAP \nbenefits.\n  Between 2013 and 2015, the Work Opportunity Tax Credit helped nearly \n300,000 veterans find employment. But, again, don't take my word for \nit. The people who are telling you not to do this are the Air Force \nSergeants Association, the United States Air Force Association, AMVETS, \nArmy Aviation Association of America, Association of the United States \nArmy, Enlisted Association of the National Guard of the United States, \nGold Star Wives of America, Jewish War Veterans of the United States of \nAmerica, Marine Corps League, Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, \nVietnam Veterans of America, and the Veterans of Foreign Wars. They are \ntelling you, if you vote ``yes,'' you are hurting the opportunities of \nAmerica's veterans.\n  The GOP tax bill also repeals the disabled access tax credit. This \nsimply allows small businesses to claim a tax\n\n\nexpenditure when they make their buildings more accessible for people \nwith disabilities. Its elimination will discourage small businesses \nfrom making their workplaces accessible and friendly to those disabled \nveterans.\n  Mr. Speaker, by eliminating the deduction for interest payments or \nstudent loans, the GOP tax bill will make education even more expensive \nor out of reach for our veterans. While the GI Bill pays a portion of \nit, it does not pay it all. A large percentage of veterans also rely on \nstudent loans. This will hurt many veterans who rely on that to make \nschool work.\n  This bill will make it more expensive for military families to sell \ntheir homes. How wrong is that?\n  The bill requires a homeowner to have owned and lived in a home for \nat least 5 years of the last 8 years to get a tax exemption on the \nmoney made from the sale of their home. No one serves in one location \nthat long. No exemption was written in it. Had it been brought to the \nfloor, we would have offered an amendment, and I bet you money, my \nRepublican colleagues would have accepted it.\n  They didn't get that chance because somebody wrote it for them and \npassed it down here and is going to tell them to vote ``yes'' on it. \nThat is simply wrong. I don't question their commitment to veterans. I \nquestion the way they wrote this bill. That is real life. These things \nwill really happen, and it is verified by all kinds of outside sources.\n  By repealing the medical expense deduction, the GOP tax bill will \nhurt veterans struggling with costly medical bills. Most veterans \naren't in the VA. Most veterans don't qualify for the VA because they \nmake more money than the threshold, or they are not disabled to the \npoint where they get there. So most of them receive their health \nbenefits through their employer. But when those expenses get too great, \none of the things we have in current tax law is they are allowed to \ndeduct those expenses. They are taking that away.\n  When you vote ``yes'' today, you are taking that away and giving \nbillionaires a tax break. Once again, it is going to be a choice. It is \nvery simple, yes or no; green light, red light. You will be able to \ndecide on that. This hurts veterans.\n\n  By prioritizing corporations and the ultrawealthy over the middle \nclass, they are directly harming veterans. Be very clear: a veteran's \nmedian income is $37,466. They are not going to see savings from this \nbill. If they are a disabled veteran or have a child going to college, \nthey will pay more so that a very few of us can get a tax break.\n  Corporations, by the way, can deduct State and local taxes. Veterans \ncan't. A corporation can deduct property tax. There is a lot more in \nhere that is bad. Bring this back to the floor. Work with us. Protect \nAmerica's heroes. Do what is right.\n", "turn": 1, "speaker": "Mr. WALZ", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "187", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H9260-H9261", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "15", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "TAX BILL IS HARMFUL TO VETERANS", "id": "CREC-2017-11-15-pt1-PgH9260-2", "title": "TAX BILL IS HARMFUL TO VETERANS"}
