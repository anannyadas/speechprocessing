Senator Cruz--who was serving \nas the acting chair of the committee for this hearing at this time--and \nI had hoped that the vote would be held open long enough for us to \nparticipate.\n  (At the request of Mr. Schumer, the following statement was ordered \nto be printed in the Record.)\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mrs. FEINSTEIN", "itemno": 0}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 1}], "header": {"chamber": "Senate", "num": "187", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "S7259", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "15", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "VOTE EXPLANATION", "id": "CREC-2017-11-15-pt1-PgS7259", "title": "VOTE EXPLANATION"}
