Mr. Speaker, I want to do actually two or three \nthings specifically tonight. One is walk through a bunch of data on why \nthe tax reform proposal is actually just sort of crucial to our society \nand where we are going and, number two, actually walk through some \nimpressions of being one of the new members on Ways and Means.\n  I have been here in the U.S. House; now I am in my seventh year here. \nI have only been on the Ways and Means Committee now for a year. It has \nbeen one of the most fascinating experiences of my life because of the \nnumber of meetings, the diving into data, the ability to sort of make \nthings mesh together and make the math work, with an understanding of \nhow serious this is.\n  The problem is, in the somewhat toxic partisan environment we are in \nright now, I know there are some of my friends on the other side who \nare really uncomfortable with the idea of Republicans having a win.\n\n\n  I know there are others who are constantly looking for what the \npartisan wedge is. I am going to ask, at least for just a couple of \nmoments, that we sort of think through something altogether.\n  We are going to walk through some of these boards. If you see this \none right here, this is with the borrowing from all the trust funds. \nBut our country is already 105 percent of debt. If you add up the \npublicly held debt and that from borrowing from the trust funds, it is \nover 105 percent of debt to GDP.\n  Lots and lots of economists get really nervous when you start to say: \nHey, in just a few years, the amount of debt issued by this government \nwill be the size of the entire economy. This is issue, not borrowing \nfrom trust funds.\n  Understand that the curve is steepening because the trust fund \nbalances are falling. We are finally hitting that inflection period \nwhere demographics are moving our numbers. Remember, the peak of the \nbaby boom is 60 years old today.\n  We have obligations that we as a society have made to our brothers \nand sisters who are getting older. We have a real problem. You are \ngoing to see in a number of these slides that if we continue to stay as \na society, as a country, that is only growing. Remember, the projection \nright now is 1.8 percent growth over the next 20 years. You \nmathematically cannot meet your obligations. It is called a debt \ncrisis. It is called an entitlement crisis.\n\n\n  One of the key solutions to being able to meet our obligations, to \nmeet our promises, is we need a society, an economy that is growing. If \nyou love people, if you care about them, if you want them to be able to \nsave and have opportunity and a future, you need a society that is \neconomically expanding.\n  I accept that this body is often about our next reelection. This is \nan observation that I learned this year. There are some things that are \nin the Tax Code that are brilliant politics. They get you reelected. \nThey give you something warm and fuzzy to go talk about at home. They \nare really bad economics.\n  It is hard to stand in front of a group and say: Hey, we get to \ndeduct State and local taxes. Yay.\n  Then you look at the economic expansion modeling of it and there is \nalmost no economic growth for a huge amount of spending.\n  I know it is a sensitive issue with a lot of my brothers and sisters \nhere on both the right and left who are from high-tax jurisdictions, \nbut understand one of the reasons it has been looked at is that it is a \ntremendous amount of spending in the Tax Code and there is almost no \neconomic expansion from that spending.\n  Whereas, if that same spending in the Tax Code is in things that grow \nbusinesses, grow job opportunities, grow the ability to save, you can \nactually see the modeling where the economy gets bigger, where all of \nus have job opportunities, and over the coming years, you get paid more \nbecause the economy is growing.\n  This is great politics. This is good economics. I don't think those \nof us on the Republican side know it--and I know so often we get behind \nthese microphones and we all sound like accountants on steroids--but \nthe math is important.\n  How many times has this body made public policy that felt good, that \nwas good politics, and really crappy economics?\n  That is how you wake up one day and your society is $20 trillion in \ndebt and the curve is about to blow off the charts.\n  Remember, a lot of outside groups on the right and left have been \ndoing modeling, saying there will be a debt crisis in about a decade \nand a half. It is coming, and it is coming very, very fast at us.\n  To have an understanding of just how difficult these numbers are, on \nthis chart I have up here, do you see the red area?\n  This is for 2027. But you figure we just finished the 2018 \nappropriations and budgets, so we are already starting to plan the \n2019.\n  Well, 8 functionally budget years from now, only 11 percent of this \nFederal Government's spending will be for things that people think of \nas government. Everything else--defense and entitlements, mandatory \nspending, both earned entitlements and unearned entitlements--will be \neverything other than 11 percent of the spending.\n  Public lands, the FBI, the Justice Department, the Park Service, \nhealth research, education, all the things you think of as government \nwill be only 11 percent of our spending. Everything else will be either \nmilitary--the military will also be only 11 percent--and everything \nelse after that is mandatory. It continues to grow that way.\n  If you are someone who cares about education, who cares about the \nenvironment, who cares about these things, understand that if you do \nnot start to get some dramatic economic growth, you are going to be \nsqueezed out.\n  The dollars spent on your priorities are disappearing. It is math. We \ndo not have the revenues. It is going to get crushed. It is coming \nvery, very fast. This isn't Republican math or Democrat math. It is \nmath.\n  What if I came to you right now and asked: What is one of the most \npowerful things we can do as a society to keep our promises?\n  My brothers and sisters on the left often talk about our promises to \nretirees. They are absolutely right. The fact of the matter is, I \nbelieve that for someone who retires in the next couple of years, they \nwill have put in about $190,000 for their Medicare. They are going to \nreceive over $600,000. That is in, like, dollars.\n  Multiply that by 76 million baby boomers in that 18-year period. In \njust that differential, understand that one of the root causes is \ndemographics. We still made a promise. The way you are able to cover \nthat promise is economic growth.\n  When you look at this chart, it is fairly new from a Stanford \neconomist. I found this in a book about 2 months ago. Do you see that \nred line on the left-hand side? Do you see where it lays fairly flat?\n\n  That is actually a line that says: ``Entitlement spending to GDP.''\n  The size of the economy, the entitlement spending in the 1990s, in \nthe late 1980s didn't go down. It was still going up. The difference \nwas the economy got bigger.\n  So when you hear us talk about debt-to-GDP ratios, start thinking \nabout that denominator.\n  How do you grow the economy so that if we keep our promises, it \ndoesn't crash the economy and functionally almost bring the world down?\n  We have some charts that make it very clear that when we have been in \ntimes of economic expansion, we have even been able to spend more money \non these entitlement programs; yet we bent the debt curve and the \namount of that consumption to the size of the economy.\n  I know this gets a little geeky, but at some point the math is \nimportant. I know we just spent a couple of hours talking about \npeoples' feelings on a 400- or 500-page tax bill, but let's get some of \nthe math correct.\n  Understand that the chart next to me is sort of the CBO projections. \nThe math is worse than even the CBO projections. If you can look--and I \nknow this is small--but the CBO missed the 2017 number by over $100 \nbillion. The fiscal year we just finished, the 2017 fiscal year, we \nborrowed $666 billion. This is one of the good years.\n  So, remember, you have heard people talking about in a static score \nover the next decade--10 years--this tax bill costs a $1.5 trillion. \nBut we borrowed $666 billion last year, with no tax relief and a \ngovernment policy that functionally gave us a 1.8 percent GDP.\n  Take a look at this year. It was supposed to get much better, but now \nthat we know we have the spending for the hurricanes and disasters, we \nknow we are going to blow through that.\n  If you can see it in about 4 budget years, because of that 1.8 \npercent economic expansion, we are going to start borrowing $1 trillion \na year.\n  Yes, building a tax bill with $1.5 trillion borrowing over 10 years \nis something you have to really think about. You need to design it so \nwe get the economic expansion so that the size of the economy gets \nbigger so there are opportunities to take in new revenues.\n  But do understand that if you are part of the side that you are just \nhearing supporting the status quo, the status quo is already a disaster \nand is just on the cusp of time. The disaster is already here. The \ndisaster is status quo and doing more of the same.\n  In 4 budget years, you are borrowing $1 trillion a year, and it goes \nup from that. So doing nothing, continuing the status quo, is the \nentitlement crisis, is the fiscal cliff, is the debt crisis. We don't \nhave a choice. We must get together and do what is necessary to get \nthis economy growing.\n  We heard one of the previous speakers--who is one of the people I \nreally like; he is a good guy; a Democrat of Illinois--talk about the \nTax Foundation. I sort of forgot this part. This is a quote from the \nTax Foundation study. It is $1 trillion in new revenues.\n  Our static score that we are doing--and the Tax Foundation score is \nhigher in spending--but our model says it is $1.5 trillion of spending \nin the Tax Code static. That means no economic growth. We are going to \ntalk about what dynamic growth is. They say a new, additional trillion \ndollars of revenue. That is what we call dynamic scoring.\n  What is dynamic scoring, you may ask. Dynamic scoring is nothing more \nthan asking: How does this policy affect the size of the economy? And \nthen you loop it back and look for the feedback effects.\n  If you are a Democrat and you are saying, ``I don't believe in \ndynamic scoring,'' you really need to think about that position because \nyou believe in dynamic scoring when the left introduced an immigration \nbill. It was dynamically scored.\n  Global warming. If you actually look at the scoring, it has feedback \neffects. Go back to the stimulus.\n\n\n  We all use dynamic scoring around here. We just seem to only want to \nembrace it when it supports our own political views. Every March, the \nCongressional Budget Office gives us an update that has economic \nfeedback effect in it. That is called dynamic scoring.\n  For both my friends on the right and the left, you can't just pretend \nthat public policy has no effect in the size of the economy when it is \ncontrary to your certain political pitch that you are making right now.\n  Just understand, the Tax Foundation says $1 trillion in new revenues. \nBut the other things that are really important--and this actually \nstarts to give you an understanding of some of the effects--is we have \nclose to $300 billion in new payroll taxes.\n  Understanding that Social Security and Medicare are pay-as-you-go \nprograms, today's taxpayers are functionally paying today's recipients. \nThat is why I have been behind this microphone over the last year \ntalking about things like demographics and birth rates and the really \ndangerous effects these low birth rates are having in the society, but \nthat is other stuff.\n  We will have almost $300 billion in new payroll taxes. So I have $1 \ntrillion in new income taxes and close to $300 billion in new payroll \ntaxes for what we model is a trillion-and-a-half-dollar static score.\n  You may not like the numbers, but the Tax Foundation is really good \nat this. They have some of the most advanced models that exist anywhere \nin this country and it is worth going to and reading their information.\n  Right now, when you hear us talking, we are giving you just static \nscores. It is important to know that the freaky smart people are out \nthere modeling, saying what we are doing is expanding the size of the \neconomy as you go into the future.\n  Why is this so critical?\n  If you see this chart, this is what is being projected for our \nfuture. This is the CBO's estimates over the next, I believe it is, \nthree decades.\n\n\n  Functionally, a 1.8 percent GDP growth. This is their projection. \nThis is what they see our future looking like.\n  But if you go back to the 1950s--to 1973, yeah, we had a demographic \nbubble that was young and moving into the workforce. If you look at the \nlate 1970s, 1990s, we were actually doing an average of 3.3 percent GDP \na year.\n  If you actually are someone like I am where you just are fascinated--\nGDPNow, which is the Atlanta Fed's calculator, right now, has our GDP, \nas of today, at 3.2 percent GDP. That is amazing. The model we have \nbeen given says we should be at 1.8. We are substantially above that \nright now in anticipation of tax reform.\n  Apparently, a lot of the economy out there is already anticipating a \nbetter regulatory market and a better tax regime, and, with that, they \nare spending, they are investing, and we are already seeing it in the \nbaseline numbers. This is something we can't screw up. It is incredibly \nimportant.\n  So let's try to understand, once again, if you care and love people \nand want them to have an economic future, why that growth is so \nincredibly important. If you actually sort of look at the difference--\nand this is sort of a difficult chart to understand. But if we are \nsitting here somewhere between this 1\\1/2\\ and 2 percent GDP growth, \nand you wanted to double the size of the economy, you are looking at \nhaving to wait over 35 years.\n  What happens if we were in the very tail end? And look, from my own \nmath, I don't think we get there. We might have some years that touch \nit. But what would happen if you were at 4 percent GDP growth? You go \nfrom over 35 years to a little over 17 years to double the size of the \neconomy. Well, how about if we could beat 3\\1/2\\ percent GDP? You go \nfrom over 35 years to 22 years.\n  Just understand the size of the economy has almost everything to do \nwith what you are paid, your ability to have a pay raise, your ability \nto have enough cash flow in your life so you can save for your \nretirement. I know this seems like an academic lecture, but it is not. \nThese things affect our lives. They also affect our ability to pay our \npromises. It also affects our ability to protect our Nation. It is not \na game.\n  So another way to sort of look at the same numbers--and I just happen \nto like this chart, so that is one of the reasons we are putting it up. \nYou can see sort of the bubbles. What would it take to sort of double \nthat GDP per person? You know, okay, so instead of the entire economy, \nhow about you, as an American citizen, the size of the economy as you--\nbecause as a participant in the economy, this has something to do with \nwhat you are paid, your ability on your lifestyle, the things you can \nown, the things you can do for your family.\n  The difference between the 2 percent--and let's just jump up to 4 \npercent, and the number of years, you start to realize the difference \nbetween 17 years or 35 years. This is about every one of us as an \nindividual in this country that if we can adopt tax policy, that is \ngood for families, good for the middle class, but also makes us \ncompetitive in the world again, and we start to grow, good things \nhappen. Do you do a Tax Code that is great politics or really good \neconomics?\n  Some of the math is hard. We live in a society right now where if you \ncan look at the very far left side of this chart, the top 20 percent of \nour society, of our income earners--the top 20 percent of income \nearners are paying 88 percent of the Federal income taxes.\n  You start to understand. If I came to you right now, just as a simple \nmath problem, and said, ``Hey, I have got 20 percent of very high \nincome earners who are paying 88 percent of all the Federal income \ntaxes, but I really want to make sure that the quartiles of our \nhardworking middle-income earners are getting a lot of this benefit,'' \nyou can understand why there were such great math problems in making \nthese things work, because 88 percent of all your Federal revenue is \nsitting out here with 20 percent of the population.\n  That is actually why we have had to do a lot of the things we have \ndone. And where certain deductions, certain things phase out, it is \njust a math problem. But remember, you see that red line, and you see \nwhere it crosses the blue line? That is where publicly held debt will \nexceed the size of our economy.\n  This government will have issued debt to foreign buyers, to your \nretirement account, to pension funds that will exceed the size of this \neconomy, and it is only a few years away, and that is what the status \nquo is. That is where we are going.\n  I will make you the argument, we don't have a choice. We must make a \nsimpler, a fairer, but a dramatic and more progrowth tax system as part \nof this country's culture.\n  In being blessed to now be on the Ways and Means Committee, which I \nam incredibly appreciative--they are some of the smartest people I have \never worked with, are really smart calculators and people--there is \nsomething called Joint Tax. If you ever want to know where all the \nfreaky smart people or president of your high school math class are, \nthere is 50 of them in there. I think like more than half may have \nPh.D.'s in math and statistics and accounting. They tell us, the \ntestimony to the committee is, 94 percent of the tax paying population \nwill now do their taxes on this. Only 6 percent of taxpayers in the \ncountry will need to itemize.\n  There is actually some really interesting math that also starts to \nhappen when you have made a tax system fairer, simpler, and progrowth. \nBut the simplicity of it makes compliance, makes the ability to pay, \nmakes the ability to participate so much easier and so much more \nelegant.\n  I have been proud to be part of the team that has helped build this \ntax plan. It is not perfect, and it is still going to go through a \ncouple of more changes. That is the way it works. We will get the \nSenate product; we will sit in conference committee; we will work out \nthe math; but understand the status quo is disastrous for every \nAmerican, and I actually believe it is disastrous for the world. The \ntax reform gives us an opportunity to grow and have an incredibly \nbright future if we do it the right way.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n\n", "turn": 1, "speaker": "Mr. SCHWEIKERT", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "187", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H9371-H9374", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "15", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "TAX REFORM", "id": "CREC-2017-11-15-pt1-PgH9371", "title": "TAX REFORM"}
