Mr. Speaker, I would like to honor the life of James \nHenry Ford of Martinsville, Virginia. Jim passed away on October 28, \n2017. He was a fine man who always had the interests of his community \nat heart.\n  Jim grew up in Martinsville and made his career practicing law there \nfor 58 years after he studied at Roanoke College and the University of \nVirginia Law School. As an active member of the Martinsville and \nVirginia State Bar, he served two terms on the Virginia State Bar \nCouncil. I came to know Jim when we served together on the Blue Ridge \nBoy Scout Council, which covers 21 counties and nine cities in \nVirginia, in the 1980s and 90s. I greatly respected his contributions \nas well as his commitment; whenever the council met, he would drive \nover an hour from Martinsville to Roanoke. This level of dedication was \ntypical of Jim, who found every venue he could to serve the community \naround him. Along with the Boy Scout Council, he served as president of \nthe Martinsville Jaycees, the YMCA, and the Kiwanis. He helped found \nand later led the Piedmont Arts Association. As a lifetime member of \nMartinsville's First Presbyterian Church, he served variously as \nDeacon, Elder, and Clerk of Session. For many years he served as \nChairman of the Martinsville Planning Commission and as Secretary of \nthe United Fund of Martinsville and Henry County. He was also a member \nof the Board of Directors of the Patrick Henry Scholarship Fund.\n  Jim garnered honors for his work with these organizations, including \nthe Scout's Silver Beaver Award, the highest award a volunteer can \nreceive at the council level, and the Jaycees' Distinguished Service \nAward. His service was a gift to the people of Martinsville and its \nsurrounding communities. Our society counts on people like Jim, the men \nand women who dedicate their time, their resources, and their passion \nto the places they call home. They do so not in search of monetary gain \nor the acquisition of power, but out of a sense of duty to their \ncommunity and joy in improving the lives of their fellow citizens.\n  Jim is survived by his wife Sandra, his daughter Margaret, his son \nMartin, and his grandchildren Wesley, Sandra, Jimmy, and Charlotte. My \nthoughts are with them in this difficult time. The Martinsville/Henry \nCounty area is diminished by his passing, as we all are.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. GRIFFITH", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 3}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "187", "extension": true, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "E1572", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "15", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "HONORING JAMES HENRY FORD", "id": "CREC-2017-11-15-pt1-PgE1572-4", "title": "HONORING JAMES HENRY FORD"}
