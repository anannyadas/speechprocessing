Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the nomination of \nDr. Mark Esper to serve as the next Secretary of the Army. The Senate \nArmed Services Committee held a hearing on his nomination on November \n2, and he was voted out of committee shortly thereafter.\n  Dr. Esper is a proud graduate of the U.S. Military Academy. Following \nhis graduation from West Point, Dr. Esper served as a rifle platoon \nleader and subsequently deployed with the 101st Airborne Division \nduring the 1991 Gulf war. He went on to command an airborne rifle \ncompany that supported a NATO rapid reaction force. As such, Dr. Esper \nhas learned the trade of a soldier from the very basics, leading other \nyoung Americans in combat. To me, that is probably the best training \none could have to be a Secretary of any service.\n  Following Dr. Esper's active duty service, he transferred to the \nVirginia National Guard. He ultimately retired with the rank of \nlieutenant colonel.\n  In addition to Dr. Esper's military career, he also has a wealth of \npublic policy service, having worked on Capitol Hill as Majority Leader \nBill Frist's national security adviser, as well as serving in the \nDepartment of Defense during President George W. Bush's administration.\n  Finally, for the past 7 years, Dr. Esper has worked at Raytheon, \nwhere he rose to the senior echelons of the company to serve as the \nvice president for Government Relations.\n  The U.S. Army is one of our greatest institutions, and if Dr. Esper \nis confirmed today, he will be leading an organization at a time in \nwhich it is facing many challenges. Most urgently, the Army must \ncontinue to improve full spectrum readiness while, at the same time, \ndeploy soldiers around the world.\n  The Army also continues to grapple with modernizing the force, to \ninclude how best to make targeted investments in programs and canceling \nthose efforts that are underperforming or are cost prohibitive.\n\n\n  Based on Dr. Esper's qualifications and experience, as well as his \ntestimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee, I will vote in \nfavor of his nomination to be the next Secretary of the Army.\n  Dr. Esper's unique perspective will enable him to tackle many \nchallenges facing the Army head-on, and I trust that as the next \nSecretary of the Army, he will do his best to lead the men and women, \nand their families, who serve this Nation so ably and courageously.\n  Once again, I would like to say that with his experience as an \ninfantry platoon leader at the front, with soldiers of the 101st \nAirborne Division, he knows--as few people do--the real cost of our \nnational security and the real challenge of being in our Army. It is \nkeeping faith with those men and women and it is doing everything they \ncan and we can to protect this Nation. With that experience, I am very \nconfident that he will be an extraordinary Secretary of the Army.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.", "turn": 2, "speaker": "Mr. REED", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to support the nomination of \nDr. Mark Esper to be Secretary of the Army. Perhaps more than any other \nservice, our Army is experiencing the strain of 16 years of continuous \nconflict. From our troops on the ground in Afghanistan and Iraq to \nrecent headlines about the tragic loss of four soldiers in Niger, there \nare constant reminders that we remain a nation at war. And with rising \nthreats around the world, the operational tempo is not slowing down.\n  We owe our young men and women in uniform leadership that fits their \nservice. I am confident that Dr. Esper will provide our Army with that \nleadership. His record of service in the Army, in the Pentagon, and on \nCapitol Hill provides the foundation for the leadership our soldiers \ndeserve. I am also confident that he will call upon his experience in \nthe private sector to bring a reform mindset to the many challenges \nfacing our Army, such as the readiness crisis and the urgent gaps in \ncapabilities and modernization.\n  Dr. Esper began his career as an Infantry officer in the 101st \nAirborne Division, serving with distinction in the first Gulf war. He \nlater served on active duty in Europe, and on the Army staff in \nWashington, DC, before transitioning to the National Guard and retiring \nafter 21 years of service. He was an Airborne Ranger and recipient of \nthe Legion of Merit, Bronze Star, and Meritorious Service Medals, among \nother awards and qualifications.\n  Dr. Esper also worked national security issues on Capitol Hill with \nmany of my colleagues here. He was a professional staff member on the \nSenate Foreign Relations Committee and the House Armed Services \nCommittee. Later, he served as Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense.\n  I will not hold it against him that he is a graduate of the U.S. \nMilitary Academy at West Point. He also holds degrees from Harvard \nUniversity's John F. Kennedy School of Government and George Washington \nUniversity.\n  Our soldiers continue to prove their commitment, courage, skill, and \ndetermination. In return, we owe them the same kind of leadership. I \nbelieve Dr. Esper will provide that leadership.\n  I am proud to support Dr. Esper's nomination, and I ask my colleagues \nto do the same.\n  I yield the floor.", "turn": 12, "speaker": "Mr. McCAIN", "itemno": 14}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
