Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to \nH.R. 1, a deficit-exploding tax cut for the wealthy that will hurt \nmiddle class families in my district.\n  I am all for real, bipartisan tax reform that puts the middle class \nfirst, but that is not what this bill is. This is a giveaway to the \nwealthy and big corporations. It adds trillions to the debt and pays \nfor it on the backs of the middle class.\n  Half of my constituents on Long Island deduct their State and local \ntaxes, an average of more than $23,000. Under this bill, that \ndisappears. Corporations can still deduct their State and local taxes, \nbut individuals and couples cannot. That means many middle class \nfamilies will see their taxes go up, while the vast majority of relief \ngoes to the people who don't need it: the wealthiest individuals and \nthe biggest corporations.\n  The National Education Association also found that eliminating SALT \ncould lead to a $250 billion cut in education funding just in the State \nof New York over the next decade.\n  Make no mistake: this bill won't help the middle class. It will \nexplode the deficit, and Republicans will try to pay for it with big \ncuts to healthcare, education, Social Security, and other important \nlifesaving programs.\n  I urge my Republican colleagues to give up this trickle-down fantasy \nand work with Democrats on real bipartisan tax reform that truly puts \nthe middle class first.\n", "turn": 1, "speaker": "Miss RICE of New York", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "187", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H9263", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "15", "month": "November"}, "related_bills": [{"type": "HR", "context": "FIRSTPARAGRAPH", "congress": "115", "number": "1"}, {"type": "HR", "context": "OTHER", "congress": "115", "number": "1"}], "doc_title": "GOP TAX CUTS", "id": "CREC-2017-11-15-pt1-PgH9263-2"}
