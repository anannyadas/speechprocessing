Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the Phoenix Fire \nCompany No. 2 of Pottsville, Pennsylvania. The fire company will be \ncelebrating its 150th anniversary on November 25.\n  The Phoenix Fire Company No. 2 originated from the Schuylkill \nHydraulian Fire Company, which organized in April 1829 and was \nofficially recognized the following year. This early company purchased \na hand engine and was housed in Pottsville's original borough building. \nIn 1861, a few days after the attack on Fort Sumter, the Schuylkill \nHydraulian Company reformed into a military company called the Union \nGuards of Pottsville. They left for Harrisburg on April 24, 1861 and \nwere greeted by Governor Andrew Curtin when they arrived.\n  Management of Pottsville's fire apparatus was then left to the \nborough council. The Phoenix Fire Engine Company was established during \nreorganization meeting in September 1867. A hose carriage was \npurchased, and the company was headquartered at the corner of Centre \nand Norwegian Streets. In 1885, a cornerstone was set for a new fire \nhouse on East Norwegian Street, and this very house continues to serve \nas the station for the Phoenix Fire Company No. 2 today.\n  The company operated with horse-drawn equipment until summer 1919. In \nJuly that year, an American La France truck with a seventy-five-foot \naerial ladder was purchased for $18,000 and shipped to Pottsville. That \ntruck saw extensive damage in 1925 when Phoenix Company responded to a \nmajor fire in Mechanicsville. After a six-month repair process, \nhowever, the engine was restored to working condition and served \nPottsville well until 1939.\n  It is an honor to recognize such a historic and distinguished fire \ncompany. I am grateful for the Phoenix Fire Company's 150 years of \noutstanding service to our community, and you can count me as a strong \nsupporter for a successful future.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. CARTWRIGHT", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 3}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "187", "extension": true, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "E1571", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "15", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "IN RECOGNITION OF PHOENIX FIRE ENGINE COMPANY NO. 2", "id": "CREC-2017-11-15-pt1-PgE1571", "title": "IN RECOGNITION OF PHOENIX FIRE ENGINE COMPANY NO. 2"}
