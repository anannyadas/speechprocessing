Whether serving in the Army, Navy, Marine Corps, \nAir Force, or Coast Guard, these brave individuals risk their lives to \nprotect others and demonstrate an unmatched level of selflessness, \ncourage, and dedication.\n  While this bill will name the post office in Tilden, Texas, in honor \nof all veterans who have served, I would like to specifically recognize \nthe service of Mr. Anselmo Villarreal.\n  Drafted into the Army in March of 1968, he served in Vietnam until \n1970, and he continues to serve his fellow veterans through volunteer \nwork at his local veterans service organization.\n  His story is not unlike other servicemembers who give their time at \nhome and abroad to protect and improve their communities in so many \nways. In recognizing his contributions, we recognize the contributions \nof veterans throughout Texas and the United States, and we thank them \nfor their work.\n  Mr. Speaker, we should pass this bill to celebrate the lives of \nAmerican veterans and commemorate the sacrifices that each have made \nfor the good of our Nation.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge the passage of H.R. 1207, and I reserve the \nbalance of my time.", "turn": 5, "speaker": "Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN", "itemno": 10}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "F000460", "text": "  Mr. FARENTHOLD.

Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from New Jersey for \nyielding and for her kind words about the Tilden Veterans Post Office. \nI also want to thank my friend from Corpus Christi, Texas, for his kind \nwords on the naming of this post office.\n  Mr. Speaker, today I rise to support and present H.R. 1207, which \nwill name the post office facility in my district as the Tilden \nVeterans Post Office.\n  Across my district, there are many examples of fine men and women who \nhave honorably served our country. It is imperative that we honor their \nservice and dedication to our Nation.\n  Dedicating this post office to our veterans will serve as a constant \nreminder of the sacrifices that our friends, neighbors, and families \nmade while serving their country. These are individuals who put country \nahead of self and for whom I am proud to recognize with the dedicating \nof the post office facility.\n  For example, as the gentlewoman from New Jersey said, Anselmo \nVillarreal of Tilden, Texas, was drafted in the Army in 1968. He served \nin Vietnam. After his service, Mr. Villarreal\n\n\nreturned to Tilden and worked in a local plant for 28 years before \nretiring.\n  This veteran also continues to serve his community by volunteering \nfor local veterans service organizations. We owe our freedom to \nveterans like Mr. Villarreal and others, which is why I am recognizing \nhim and the other veterans with the dedication of this post office. He \nis one example of many veterans who have made countless sacrifices for \nour country in the face of danger.\n  The courage and dedication of our veterans toward our Nation \ndemonstrates what it really means to be an American--the essence of \nbeing an American.\n  I also thank the veterans from Tilden and McMullen County for their \nservice and sacrifice for our country. I also thank the veterans \norganizations throughout my district for their tireless work in \nproviding the care our veterans need. There are many local \norganizations like the veterans service offices in McMullen County that \nprovide essential care to those who have returned home from service.\n  Let us remember and express gratitude to these brave people: the \nveterans, their families, as well as the care providers.\n  In the words of President John F. Kennedy: ``As we express our \ngratitude, we must never forget that the highest appreciation is not to \nutter words, but to live by them.''\n\n", "turn": 8, "speaker": "Mr. CUELLAR", "itemno": 13}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "W000822", "text": "  Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN.
