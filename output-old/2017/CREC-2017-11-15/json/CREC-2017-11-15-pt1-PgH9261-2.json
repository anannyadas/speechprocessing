Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my opposition to \nH.R. 1, the Republican tax plan, and the negative impacts it would have \non my constituents in Guam.\n  This bill is an attack on the middle class and would do very little \nto help those who most need tax relief. I am especially concerned that \nH.R. 1 does not take into account the unique application of the Federal \nTax Code to Guam and the other U.S. territories.\n\n\n  Unlike the 50 States who have control of their tax system, Guam is \nrequired to mirror the income tax portion of the Federal Internal \nRevenue Code, and any changes to the IRC would have a direct impact not \nonly on taxes paid by my constituents, but also on the general fund \nrevenues collected by the government of Guam.\n  Under the current framework, it is the United States Congress, not \nthe Guam Legislature or any other elected body on Guam, that sets the \nincome tax provisions for our territory. Any changes to the Internal \nRevenue Code are automatically mirrored and adopted as changes to \nGuam's local tax structure.\n  This does not give Guam the ability to decide for itself the best tax \nstructure for the people of Guam. It applies decisions made for the \nNation as a whole, with more than 320 million citizens, to \nsignificantly different demographics on our island of just 170,000 \nAmericans.\n  Even more outrageous, Mr. Speaker, is that Republicans will have \nbrought this bill to the floor without any opportunity for the \nDelegates from the territories to affect it or express our support or \nopposition through a recorded vote.\n  As the Speaker knows, as a Delegate from a territory, along with the \nother four territories and D.C., we are not able to vote on amendments \non the floor of this House, nor are we able to cast a vote on the final \npassage of a bill.\n  Some on the other side will argue, especially since H.R. 1 is a tax \nbill, that the Delegates--therefore, the more than 4 million American \ncitizens who live in the territories--should not be able to vote on the \nbills considered by this House because our constituents do not pay \ntaxes to the Federal Treasury.\n\n\n  But this ignores the sacrifices that the sons and daughters of Guam \nand the other territories make to defend our country through military \nservice, as well as the fact that my constituents pay other Federal \ntaxes that support Federal programs like Social Security and Medicare.\n  Importantly, Mr. Speaker, H.R. 1 will have a direct impact on my \nconstituents because of the Federal Government's requirement for the \ngovernment of Guam to mirror the Internal Revenue Code. This will \ndirectly impact the rates, deductions, and credits paid by Guam tax \nfilers and, unlike the States, will also directly correspond to the \nrevenues collected by our territorial government.\n  This, Mr. Speaker, is the very definition of taxation without \nrepresentation.\n  So I cannot support the Republican tax plan because it ignores the \nimpacts it would have on my constituents in Guam and the other \nterritories, and it prevents the people of Guam from having a say, \nthrough their own representative in both the House and the Senate, in \nits development.\n  I oppose, Mr. Speaker, H.R. 1, and I urge my colleagues to defeat it. \nVote ``no.''\n", "turn": 1, "speaker": "Ms. BORDALLO", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "187", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H9261-H9262", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "15", "month": "November"}, "related_bills": [{"type": "HR", "context": "FIRSTPARAGRAPH", "congress": "115", "number": "1"}, {"type": "HR", "context": "OTHER", "congress": "115", "number": "1"}], "doc_title": "TAX PLAN IS HARMFUL FOR GUAM", "id": "CREC-2017-11-15-pt1-PgH9261-2"}
