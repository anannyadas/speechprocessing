Thank you, Mr. President.\n\n\n                               Tax Reform\n\n  Mr. President, on Sunday, Politico offered this headline: ``Middle \nclass biggest winners in Senate tax plan, study says.''\n  The article goes on to say: ``Moderate-income people would \nconsistently see the largest percentage declines in their tax bills, \naccording to an analysis released late Saturday by the official, \nnonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation.''\n  It goes on to say: ``In 2019, people in the middle spectrum, earning \nbetween $50,000 and $70,000, would see their taxes fall by 7.1 percent. \nThose earning between $20,000 and $30,000 would see a 10.4 percent \ndecline.''\n  This is what we set out to achieve with the Senate tax bill that we \nreleased last week--real relief for American families, and that is what \nour bill delivers.\n  I don't need to tell anyone that the American people have had a rough \nfew years. Stagnant wages and a lack of opportunities have left many \nAmerican families stretched thin. A recent survey found that 50 \npercent--50 percent--of people out there consider themselves to be \nliving paycheck to paycheck. About one-third of those same people say \nthat they are literally just $400 away from a financial crisis. Well, \nreal help is on the way.\n  Last night, Chairman Hatch released a revised bill that provides even \nmore relief for middle-class families. I applaud Chairman Hatch for his \nwork on this revised bill that includes Republican and Democratic \namendments and reflects feedback we have received from the whole \nRepublican conference.\n  Our bill provides immediate, direct relief to hard-working Americans. \nOur bill doubles the standard deduction. That means, beginning in \nJanuary, a family making $24,000 a year or less per year will not be \npaying any taxes, and families making more than $24,000 per year will \nbe paying significantly less than what they are paying today.\n  Our bill also doubles the child tax credit from $1,000 to $2,000 per \nchild. We all know that raising children is expensive, and this \nprovision provides a significant tax cut for families across the \ncountry.\n\n\n  I wish to thank Senators Scott, Heller, Rubio, and Lee for their \nleadership on this issue. Their advocacy for expanding the child tax \ncredit will result in substantial tax relief for working families, but \nthat is just the beginning of what this tax bill is going to do for \nAmerican families.\n  We are not just going to ensure that Americans can keep more of their \nhard-earned money; we are also going to ensure that they can make more \nof it. Our bill is not just going to cut Americans' taxes, as important \nas that priority is to all of us; it is also going to give Americans \naccess to the kinds of jobs, wages, and opportunities that will set \nthem up for a secure future.\n  So how does that work? Well, in order for individual Americans to \nthrive economically, we need American businesses to thrive. Thriving \nbusinesses create jobs. They provide opportunities, and they increase \nwages and invest in their workers. But our current Tax Code is not \nhelping businesses thrive. It is doing the opposite. It is strangling \nboth large and small businesses with high tax rates.\n  Small businesses are incredibly important for new job creation, \nespecially in places like my State of South Dakota. But right now the \nhigh tax rates that small businesses face can make it difficult for \nthese businesses to even survive, much less thrive and expand their \noperations. Our bill will fix this.\n  To start with, our bill implements a new deduction for businesses \nthat will allow them to keep more of their money, which will allow them \nto reinvest in their operations, increase wages, and hire new workers. \nOur bill also reforms a number of current provisions in the Tax Code \nthat frequently leave small businesses with very little cash on hand. \nUnder our legislation, small businesses will be able to recover the \ncapital that they have invested in things like inventory and machinery \nmuch more quickly--and in certain cases, immediately--which will free \nup capital they can use to expand and create jobs. Our legislation also \nincludes provisions I helped develop that will simplify accounting \nrules for small businesses, which will also help reduce their tax \nburden, leaving more of their earnings to reinvest in their businesses \nand in their workers.\n  In addition to cutting rates for small businesses, our bill also \nreduces our corporate tax rate. Our Nation's corporate tax rate is \ncurrently the highest in the industrialized world, which puts U.S. \nbusinesses at a major disadvantage next to their international \ncompetitors. By reducing the corporate tax rate, our bill will enable \nU.S. businesses to compete on a more level playing field with their \ncompetitors, which will in turn free up money that U.S. businesses \ncould use to create jobs and increase wages.\n  The White House Counsel of Economic Advisers estimates that reducing \nthe corporate tax rate to 20 percent will increase average household \nincome by $4,000 annually.\n  Our bill also ends the outdated tax framework that is driving \nAmerican companies to keep jobs and profits overseas. Our Nation \ncurrently operates under a so-called worldwide tax system, which means \nthat American companies pay U.S. taxes on the profit they make here at \nhome, as well as on part of the profit they make abroad once they bring \nthat money back to the United States. The problem with this is that \nAmerican companies are already paying taxes to foreign governments on \nthe money they make abroad. Then, when they bring that money back home, \nthey can end up having to pay taxes again on part of those profits--and \nat the highest tax rate in the industrialized world. So it is no \nsurprise that this discourages businesses from bringing their profits \nback to the United States to invest in their domestic operations, in \nnew jobs, and in increased wages.\n  Between 1983 and 2003, when the U.S. tax rate was much more \ncompetitive with those of other countries, there were 29 corporate \ninversions where U.S. companies moved abroad. Between 2003 and 2014, \nwhen other countries were dropping their corporate tax rates and \nshifting to territorial tax systems, there were 47 such inversions. \nWell, our bill addresses this drag on our economy by moving from our \noutdated worldwide tax system to a territorial tax system.\n  By shifting to a territorial tax system--a move I should note that \nhas been supported by Members of both parties--we eliminate the double \ntaxation that encourages companies to send their investments and their \noperations overseas. Combine that with the reduction in our high \ncorporate tax rate, and our bill provides a strong incentive for U.S. \ncompanies to invest their profits at home in American jobs and in \nAmerican workers instead of abroad. All in all, the Tax Foundation \nestimates that in addition to increasing wages, our bill will create \nnearly 1 million new jobs for American workers.\n  The legislation we unveiled last week is the product of years of work \nhere in the Senate--work, frankly, by Members of both political \nparties. I hope, in the end, my Democratic colleagues will advance this \nbill, which is partly the result of their labors.\n  This is the kind of chance we all dreamed of when we came to \nWashington--a once-in-a-generation opportunity to make a real \ndifference in the lives of ordinary Americans, to substantially improve \ntheir lives today and give them access to a brighter, more secure, and \nmore prosperous future.\n  I look forward to debating this bill over the next few weeks. We are \ngoing to a markup today, tomorrow, and Friday in the Senate Finance \nCommittee, where amendments will be offered. They will be debated, they \nwill be voted on, and then, of course, the bill will come to the floor \nof the U.S. Senate where there will be an open amendment process, where \nindividual Senators will have opportunities to offer amendments, to \ndebate those amendments, and to vote on those amendments. But when all \nof that is said and done, I hope we can send a bill to the President's \ndesk that will bring much needed relief to those Americans who are \nliving paycheck to paycheck--to those Americans who are struggling to \nmake ends meet, to raise their children, and to provide for a more \nsecure retirement--by allowing them to keep more of their hard-earned \ndollars in their pockets, by making their paychecks bigger, and by \ncreating access to better jobs, higher paying jobs, and higher wages. \nThat improves all Americans' standard of living, all Americans' quality \nof life. That is what this bill will do.\n  We need to get it across the finish line. There is a lot of work \nahead of us, but I am looking forward to the day when we can get this \nsigned into law and give the American people access to a brighter and a \nmore prosperous future for them and their families.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.", "turn": 2, "speaker": "Mr. THUNE", "itemno": 5}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, the Republican tax plan, even before \nyesterday, would exacerbate income inequality at a time when it is \nalready spiraling out of control, helping the rich get richer and big \ncorporations get bigger while the middle class is left stuck in \nneutral. Many millions of middle-class families would wind up paying \nhigher taxes at the end of the day--13 million in 2019 and 20 million \nin 2027--under the Senate plan.\n  That is the wrong approach for our economy. It betrays the American \nworker and the American family, who deserve tax relief, because it \nconcentrates more of our country's wealth at the very top--just what \nthe American people don't want, but so many of those who fund the \nRepublican Party do. For most of my colleagues and most of the American \npeople, that is reason enough to oppose the bill, and the American \npeople do, by large numbers.\n  But yesterday Republicans made two last-minute changes to their bill \nthat make it even worse. First, Republicans decided to throw the mother \nof all monkey wrenches into the bill: repealing the individual mandate. \nMy friend the majority leader called this provision ``helpful'' to the \nbill because it raises revenue. I would remind him and all of my \nRepublican colleagues that\n\n\nthe nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office said it would lead to 13 \nmillion fewer Americans with health insurance. So we are taking 13 \nmillion people off of health insurance to give tax cuts to the wealthy.\n  Also, according to CBO, it would lead to a 10-percent increase in \npremiums. Each year, they would be 10 percent higher than they \notherwise would be. So the Republican bill says: Raise the premiums on \naverage Americans' healthcare by 10 percent so we can give the wealthy \na tax cut.\n  This is the same thing they did in the healthcare bill until the \npublic outrage forced them to back off, and, of course, it lost. Now \nthey are doing it again because the Republican belief is to reduce the \nhealthcare safety net for middle-class Americans so they can give more \ntax cuts to the wealthiest and most powerful amongst us.\n  If Republicans had their way, younger, healthier people would flee \nthe market, making the risk pool older and sicker. If you are 50 to 64, \nthis is very bad news for you. That is why the AARP is against this \nbill and yesterday denounced the new change.\n  I would remind my Republican colleagues that the provision raises \n$400 billion in revenues because it throws Americans off insurance, and \n$179 billion alone is saved because people wouldn't sign up for \nMedicaid. So the Republican bill takes $400 billion out of help for \nhealthcare and gives it to the wealthy and the powerful for even more \ntax breaks. Does any American support that? A handful maybe, but it \nseems a lot of people in this Chamber might.\n  So when the Republicans say this provision in their bill is helpful, \nthey don't mean it is helpful to Americans. It may help Republicans in \nthe Senate give a larger tax break to the rich, but it hurts millions \nof Americans seeking affordable health insurance. Many will lose \ninsurance. Many more will pay an increase in their premiums, while our \ncolleagues have always promised to make premiums lower.\n  One other point. I have heard some on the other side say they would \nbe willing to pass the bipartisan Alexander-Murray health compromise as \nsort of a salve after they repeal the individual mandate. I am here to \ntell my colleagues that won't work. You don't attempt to blow up the \nhealthcare system and then say: We are going to make a few tweaks to \nmake it better. We are not falling for that, and my Republicans friends \nshouldn't, either. They are completely contradictory ideas. Alexander-\nMurray is meant to stabilize markets and lower premiums; the Republican \nplan destabilizes markets and raises premiums in a way that Alexander-\nMurray could never repair.\n\n  Furthermore, Alexander-Murray would not survive under the rules of \nreconciliation. Too many of its provisions are under the HELP \nCommittee, not the Finance Committee, so anyone who thinks they can \njustify the changes the majority leader has said he will put in the \nbill by saying: OK. We will then pass Murray-Alexander, is wrong on the \nsubstance and wrong on the politics because it will not pass.\n  When Alexander-Murray was negotiated, it was in good faith by the \nchairman and ranking member of the HELP Committee as a compromised \nhealthcare bill. Republicans cannot expect to pass their own separate \nideological healthcare provision and then turn around and ask Democrats \nto vote to pass Murray-Alexander. Again, you can't create major injury \nto the healthcare system and hurt millions, and then say: Please give \nus a bandaid. That is not what is going to happen. That is not the \nright thing to do.\n  Any Republican Senator who thinks they can pass the individual \nmandate and then turn around and get Murray-Alexander passed is dead \nwrong. It is clear the dark tradeoff at the center of the Republican \npolicy agenda is back--cutting healthcare in order to fund tax \ngiveaways to the very wealthy and very powerful. Democrats will not go \nfor it. So that is one reason this provision is a bad one.\n  The second change the Republicans made to their tax bill was to have \nmany of their tax provisions for individuals expire while corporate tax \nbreaks remained permanent. With this new proposal, Republicans have put \nthemselves between a rock and a hard place. The provisions that help \nindividuals--and not enough middle-class folks were helped--expire by \n2025. The corporate tax cuts to the wealthiest of corporations above \nall are permanent.\n  Why did our colleagues do this? For one, they favor the big \ncorporate, powerful interests over the middle class, but the second is, \nthey had a huge deficit problem. They had to figure out where to reduce \nthe deficit, and so they took it out on the crumbs they gave to the \nmiddle class in the earlier years in this bill.\n  One of two things will happen. Some of our Republican colleagues are \nsaying, ``Don't worry. We will extend the middle-class tax cuts after \n2025,'' but that will create a huge deficit. So I say to my \ncolleagues--particularly the deficit hawks--you can't have it both \nways. You cannot say we are going to protect the middle class after \n2025, and we are going to reduce the deficit. This bill is a deficit \nbudget buster. We all know what will happen. We all know the deficit \nwill skyrocket after 2025. We can't allow the sort of tricks that are \nput into this bill to dissuade us from the fact that this bill \ndramatically will increase the deficit.\n  There are two problems with this tax bill. One is inside the confines \nof the bill, and one is with the public after the bill passes--should \nit pass, which I think it will not. Inside the bill, as I mentioned, \nRepublicans are stuck between raising taxes on millions of middle-class \nfamilies or busting the deficit. There is no choice. You can't have it \nboth ways. The bill is a dramatic exposition of being between a rock \nand a hard place. There are two choices the bill gives people: raise \ntaxes on the middle class or dramatically increase the deficit.\n  Outside the bill, with the public, Republicans have a dilemma as \nwell. If they don't pass the bill, they look feckless and unable to \ngovern--and that is what is motivating most of my colleagues--but if \nthey pass the bill, there is going to be public outrage, and they are \ngoing to pay a real price in 2018. They know it.\n  Outside the bill, the Republicans have two bad choices too. Outside \nthe confines of the bill, in broad-brush strokes, our Republican \ncolleagues can fail to pass the bill and look unable to govern or they \ncan pass the bill--dramatically unpopular--and pay a price at the \npolls. These are not enviable choices. They are a Gordian knot that my \nRepublican friends will not be able to slip out of. If they pull on one \npart of the knot, they tighten another part of it.\n  The reason my colleagues are caught in this lose-lose situation is, \nthey have elected time and time again to eschew bipartisanship. Passing \nlegislation of this magnitude with the votes of one party is divisive \nand demanding. A small number--say the Freedom Caucus--can demand \nalmost all the tax breaks go to the very wealthy or they will not vote \nfor the bill. That gives the rest of the Republicans a difficult \nchoice: hurt the middle class or blow a hole in the deficit.\n  On the other hand, if our Republican colleagues had worked with us, \nthat Freedom Caucus would have no say. They wouldn't have the votes to \nkill the bill because there would be lots of Democratic support.\n  Passing legislation of this magnitude, with votes of only one party \nis divisive and demanding. It has meant Republicans have produced \nlegislation that appeals to only a small number of Americans, and, \nprobably in their heart of hearts, even a minority of Republicans. We \nare a fiercely divided country. Legislation that is crafted to appease \nthe extremes of only one political party is never going to be broadly \npopular with the American people and, frankly, will not work.\n  That is why we should pursue bipartisan legislation, both parties \naccepting the credit of success and the blame of failure. The American \npeople are clamoring for us to work together in such a fashion, and \nworking together doesn't mean a bill crafted behind closed doors under \nreconciliation, which basically says to Democrats: Take a hike. We \ndon't need you.\n  I say to my Republican friends, there is a way out of this mess, and \nit is simple: reject your Faustian bargains and come to work with \nDemocrats on a real bipartisan reform bill. You will not have to choose \nbetween blowing up the deficit and hurting the middle class. You will \nnot have to choose between unpopular legislation and legislative\n\n\nfailure. Just like Alexander-Murray proved, we can produce legislation \non the thorniest of issues that will receive bipartisan support and \nimprove the conditions of working and middle-class Americans.\n  Why don't we give this a try on tax reform as well--because the \nchoices you are giving yourself now, you will regret.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.", "turn": 6, "speaker": "Mr. SCHUMER", "itemno": 10}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I \nspent the last hour of the Senate presiding, and for those of you in \nthe Gallery who don't know these things, I will pull back the curtain a \nlittle bit. It is called Presiding Officer duty, not Presiding Officer \nprivilege or honor, because it is reserved for the young Senators who \nare new to the Senate, such as Senator Sullivan and me. It also means \nthat we actually have to listen to our colleagues' speeches, which \ndoesn't happen very often around here anymore.\n  This morning I had the privilege of listening to the Democratic \nleader's speech about our tax bill and the fact that we are going to \nrepeal the hated mandate of ObamaCare as part of this tax bill, and I \njust can't let stand what he said without correcting the record.\n  First, the Senator from New York said that we are ``injecting \nhealthcare into the tax bill.'' Injecting healthcare into the tax bill? \nI would remind him and all the other Democrats who have been denouncing \nthis decision on the Senate Finance Committee that the individual \nmandate is a tax according not to me, not to Republicans, but to the \nObama administration. That is what they argued in 2012 to the Supreme \nCourt, even though they contended throughout the debate on ObamaCare in \n2009 and 2010 that it wasn't a tax. In 2012, they argued to the Supreme \nCourt that the ObamaCare mandate is a tax, and the Supreme Court upheld \nit as a tax.\n  I am willing to bet that the Democratic leader issued a statement in \nthe summer of 2012 applauding that decision which held that the \nindividual mandate is a tax. After all, it is collected on your 1040. \nIt is collected by the IRS. It doesn't get more ``taxy'' than that.\n  My second point is on the claim that 13 million Americans will lose \ntheir insurance--lose their insurance--if we repeal the mandate. Well, \ntwo-thirds of the American people want us to repeal the mandate, so \nthey must be up to something. Secondly, let's think about what the \nmandate repeal does. It doesn't cut a single dime out of Medicaid, it \ndoesn't cut a single dime out of insurance subsidies for people on the \nexchanges, and it doesn't change a single regulation of Obamacare. All \nit says is that the IRS cannot fine you for being unable to afford the \ninsurance that ObamaCare made unaffordable in the first place. That is \nright. Today, if you cannot afford your insurance because ObamaCare \nmade it unaffordable, the IRS will fine you and your family up to \n$2,000 a year, and that number goes up every year. Let me tell you, \nmore than five out of six households who pay that fine make less than \nthe median income in this country. That is right. That is a direct tax \non working families and poor people because they can't afford the \ninsurance that ObamaCare made unaffordable. In Arkansas, there are over \n55,000 families who already have to deal with the insecurity and \nfinancial hardship of not having health insurance and who then have to \npay a fine to the IRS. That is why two-thirds of the American people \nhave wanted us to repeal the individual mandate of ObamaCare since the \nvery day that law was passed, and that is why we are about to finally \nrepeal that mandate.\n  In the meantime, it is going to pay for more tax relief for working-\nclass families. We are going to bring rates down for all of our \nfamilies, preserve more popular or widely used deductions or credits \nthat help people make ends meet, such as the home mortgage interest \ndeduction credit. It will help them be a little more generous to their \nchurch or local charities through the charitable deduction. It will \nhelp them offset the cost of some of their property or State and local \nincome taxes--all because we are going to repeal the hated ObamaCare \nmandate.\n  I know the Democrats are in high dudgeon these days. Turn on C-SPAN, \nif you have nothing better to do, and watch the Senate Finance \nCommittee, and they will say: Oh, we are injecting healthcare into the \ntax bill. Oh, 13 million people are going to lose their insurance.\n  What we are doing is repealing the most hated tax of ObamaCare and \ngiving the American people the freedom to choose insurance that is \nright for them without being threatened by a fine from the IRS if that \ninsurance doesn't meet some Washington bureaucrat's definition of what \nis suitable. That is why two-thirds of the American people support the \nrepeal of the individual mandate, and that is why, when we repeal it, \nthe American people are going to have a big victory, notwithstanding \nwhat the Democratic leader or any other Democratic Senator has said.\n  Mr. President, I yield my time.\n  Have fun during Presiding Officer duty.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.", "turn": 10, "speaker": "Mr. COTTON", "itemno": 14}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
