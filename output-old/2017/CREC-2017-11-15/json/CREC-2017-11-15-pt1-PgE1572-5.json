GWEN MOORE\n\n                              of wisconsin\n\n                    in the house of representatives\n\n                       Monday, November 13, 2017\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 3}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "M001160", "text": "  Ms. MOORE. Mr. Speaker, I have heard from many of my constituents who \nare concerned about U.S. involvement in Yemen. The\n\n\ncountry is in ruins, civilians are paying the price, and there seems to \nbe little to no interest in using our considerable heft and moral \nauthority to search for and find a diplomatic solution.\n  We are no closer to peace in Yemen today than when the first bombs \ndropped. What we do have after over two years of war and suffering is a \nfractured country, repeated attacks on health and other civilian \nfacilities in a country now experiencing a deadly cholera outbreak that \ncould eventually reach 1 million suspected cases by year's end, limited \naccess to lifesaving humanitarian aid, including the decision last week \nby the Saudi-led coalition to close all ports and ground all \nhumanitarian flights into the country that will only make a bad \nsituation, worse.\n  That decision was quickly condemned by the United Nations and others \nwho warned about the dire consequences for Yemen's 27 million citizens. \nIn the face of international pressure and condemnation, it appears the \nSaudi-led coalition may now reopen some ports but the situation remains \ndire.\n  There are serious questions that need to be answered about U.S. \ninvolvement, direct and indirect, including what it is actually helping \nto achieve, and what are the costs. While participation in the Yemen \ncivil war preceded this Administration, that fact does not remove the \nresponsibility of the President and this Congress.\n  The final FY 2018 Defense Authorization bill (H.R. 2810) that we are \ngoing to consider later this week includes a provision calling for a \nU.S. Security Strategy for Yemen from this Administration. That would \nbe a step forward. Unfortunately, the bill that will come before the \nHouse this week would strip--without public debate, discussion, or \ndeliberation--a provision from the House-passed bill that would have \nbarred any use of taxpayer funding to deploy members of the U.S. Armed \nForces to participate in the ongoing civil war in Yemen.\n  Additionally, the House-passed version of H.R. 1298 barred the use of \ntaxpayer funds authorized in the bill to conduct U.S. military \noperations in Yemen. That provision was also dropped in conference with \nthe Senate, again with no public debate or deliberation. If we agree \nthat the humanitarian situation is horrific, that a political solution \nis the only solution, then why keep the pathway open for broader U.S. \nmilitary engagement?\n  The provisions in the House-passed version of H.R. 2810 would have \nput strong teeth behind the resolution we are considering today and \nbehind the concerns expressed during this debate and in this resolution \nregarding the humanitarian crises that is unfolding in Yemen as a \ndirect result of this damaging conflict.\n  Mr. Speaker, it is not in our nation's interest to make a dangerous \nregion only more volatile. It is not in our nation's interest to see \nYemen become an even more broken and divided nation and even a failed \nstate. And it is not clear that continuing to do more of the same will \nnot reverse those trends or bring us closer to the diplomatic solution \nthat is almost universally recognized as the only effective solution.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Ms. MOORE", "itemno": 4}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 5}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "187", "extension": true, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "E1572-E1573", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "15", "month": "November"}, "related_bills": [{"type": "HR", "context": "OTHER", "congress": "115", "number": "1298"}, {"type": "HR", "context": "OTHER", "congress": "115", "number": "2810"}], "doc_title": "EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE HOUSE WITH RESPECT TO UNITED STATES POLICY TOWARDS YEMEN", "id": "CREC-2017-11-15-pt1-PgE1572-5"}
