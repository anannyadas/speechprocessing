Mr. Speaker, I rise today to highlight \nan exciting event at Penn State that raises awareness about veterans \nwho suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder.\n  The Freedom 5K for PTSD is the brainchild of some of Penn State's \ncadets. Nicholas Pisciotta organized the 2016 run, and Joshua Stein \norganized this year's event.\n  Mr. Speaker, these dedicated cadets said they felt it was important \nto take care of the men and women who have fought for our country and \nare still fighting for the freedoms that we enjoy today.\n  The proceeds from the event support the Lone Survivor Foundation, \nwhich provides support for wounded servicemembers, their spouses and \nchildren, by empowering them with helpful information on how to address \npost-traumatic stress, mild traumatic brain injury, chronic pain, \nmilitary sexual trauma, and care partner stress.\n  The Freedom 5K also honors the spirit of Navy SEAL Lieutenant Michael \nMurphy, a Penn State alumnus, who made the ultimate sacrifice as part \nof Operation Red Wings.\n  Mr. Speaker, I commend these current and future servicemembers for \nnot only organizing this impactful event, but for caring about their \nfellow military men and women.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "187", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H9266", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "15", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "RECOGNIZING THE FREEDOM 5K FOR PTSD", "id": "CREC-2017-11-15-pt1-PgH9266-2", "title": "RECOGNIZING THE FREEDOM 5K FOR PTSD"}
