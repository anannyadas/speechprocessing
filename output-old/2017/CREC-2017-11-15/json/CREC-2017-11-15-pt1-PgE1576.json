Mr. Speaker, I rise today to ask the House of \nRepresentatives to join me in recognizing the District of Columbia-\nbased Washington Photo Safari, which has just hosted the 35,000th \nparticipant in its amateur photographers training program.\n  Founded by professional architectural photographer E. David Luria, \nWashington Photo Safari was the first community-based field photography \ntraining program in the country. With 11 instructors, the program \nprovides more than 40 photography skill sets in 140 different venues \nthroughout the District.\n  Most of Washington Photo Safari's participants come from the D.C.-\narea. The `participants' skill levels range from people who have just \nbought their first camera to seasoned professional photographers who \nvalue Mr. Luria's knowledge of when, where and how to capture the best \nimages in the District.\n  Averaging just six to seven participants per training session, the \n``photo safaris'' take place at some of the District's most iconic \nlandmarks, including the National Mall, Washington National Cathedral, \nFranciscan Monastery of the Holy Land in America, Tidal Basin, Capitol \nHill, Cathedral of St. Matthew the Apostle, Smithsonian National Zoo, \nNational Gallery of Art and National Museum of American History.\n  The Washington Photo Safari has received Trip Advisor's Certificate \nof Excellence Award for the past five years due to dozens of five-star \nreviews from its customers, solidifying its place on Trip Advisor's \nlist of top 10 outdoor activities in the District. In addition, with \nits success, similar programs have been implemented in 20 other U.S. \ncities with guidance provided by Washington Photo Safari.\n  Therefore, I ask the House of Representatives to join me in \nrecognizing Washington Photo Safari for its achievements and \ncontributions to the District of Columbia tourism industry, as well as \nfor serving as a member organization of Destination DC, Cultural \nTourism of DC and the National Cherry Blossom Festival.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Ms. NORTON", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 3}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "187", "extension": true, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "E1576", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "15", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "HONORING WASHINGTON PHOTO SAFARI", "id": "CREC-2017-11-15-pt1-PgE1576", "title": "HONORING WASHINGTON PHOTO SAFARI"}
