{"content": [{"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "M000355", "text": "  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, the need for tax reform has been \nobvious for a long time now. Many Republicans have said it. Many \nDemocrats have said it. We certainly hope Democrats will continue to \nstand by their strong statements in support of tax reform today, \nbecause while the occupant of the Oval Office may have changed, the \nneed for tax reform certainly hasn't.\n  Indeed, after many long years of an Obama economy that so often \nfailed the middle class, its effects continue to be felt across the \ncountry for many: for single parents who still struggle to make ends \nmeet; for moms and dads who still struggle to find a way to send their \nkids to college, make a car payment, or save for retirement; and for \nsmall business owners who still find themselves frustrated when they \ntry to hire more employees, reinvest in their business or pursue their \ndreams.\n  There are many obstacles to tackle--an out-of-control regulatory \nstate, for one. We have taken significant action to tame that already, \nand we will continue to do so.\n  Another huge factor is our seriously outdated Tax Code. Filled with \ncomplicated schedules, worksheets, deductions, and loopholes, the code \nis easy for the wealthy and well-connected to game and almost \nimpossible for almost anyone else to understand. If you are wealthy, \nyou hire accountants and lawyers to navigate a complicated process. But \nthe young, small business owner starting out can't afford a team to do \nher taxes and bring on a new employee or raise wages.\n  Moreover, the Tax Code actively punishes those small businesses and \nthe middle class with rates that are too high, provisions that are \nclearly outdated, and incentives that are just plain ridiculous--like \nthe fact that it actually encourages the shipping of American jobs and \nbusinesses overseas. Our Tax Code actually encourages that. That is why \nthis Congress, in conjunction with the White House, is working hard to \npass tax reform.\n  Today the Senate Finance Committee will continue to examine its tax \nreform proposal under Chairman Hatch's leadership. Members are \ncontinuing to discuss the best path forward to deliver relief to the \nmen and women we represent. This week's hearings are just the latest in \na years-long process to write a tax code that supports the middle \nclass. In fact, since Chairman Hatch has been the top Republican on the \nFinance Committee, it has hosted 70 hearings in the last 6 years. Each \none of those hearings considered how to improve the Tax Code to make it \nwork better for all Americans.\n  The committee has made numerous serious efforts to engage across the \naisle to get this done. Members on both sides agree that a pro-growth \ntax plan will move our economy forward, help create more jobs, and help \nfamilies keep more of their hard-earned paychecks, or at least our \nDemocratic friends used to, seemingly, until President Trump came \nalong.\n  The plan before the committee fulfills important goals that all of us\n\n\nshould share. It aims to make taxes for families lower, simpler, and \nfairer. According to the nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation and \nrecent news reports, the ``Middle Class [are the] biggest winners in \n[the] Senate tax plan.''\n  It also aims to make it easier for small businesses to grow, invest, \nand hire. For Kentucky's small businesses and for those across the \ncountry, this proposal will help to do just that by creating incentives \nto bring investment and jobs home and keep them here.\n  The plan before the Finance Committee fulfills our main goal for tax \nreform, which is taking more money out of Washington's pockets and \nputting more money into the pockets of the middle class.\n  Last evening, the committee released a modified chairman's mark that, \namong other important elements, will effectively repeal ObamaCare's \nindividual mandate tax so we can provide even more tax relief to low- \nand middle-income families. In short, the goal is to repeal an \nunpopular tax from an unworkable law in order to provide more tax \nrelief to middle-class families.\n  Now, as the committee continues its legislative markup through an \nopen process, it will explore further ways to improve this good \nlegislation. Both Republicans and Democrats have offered hundreds of \namendments. Chairman Hatch is setting aside full days for the committee \nto consider them. Once the Finance Committee completes its work and \nreports its proposal to the Senate floor, all Members will have the \nchance to offer their amendments under the regular order.\n  Another Senate committee is having an important markup today as well. \nThe Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee is beginning its \nconsideration of an important proposal to support good jobs, our energy \nfuture, and our national security.\n  So, once again, I commend Chairman Murkowski and the members of the \ncommittee for their work on this proposal to further develop Alaska's \noil and natural gas potential in an environmentally responsible way--\nmore American jobs, more American energy, and more energy security and \nindependence. I look forward to the Energy Committee reporting its \nlegislation today.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. McCONNELL", "itemno": 0}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 1}], "header": {"chamber": "Senate", "num": "187", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "S7225-S7226", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "15", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "TAX REFORM", "id": "CREC-2017-11-15-pt1-PgS7225-6", "title": "TAX REFORM"}
