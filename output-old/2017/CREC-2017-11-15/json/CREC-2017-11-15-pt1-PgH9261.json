Mr. Speaker, I tell folks back home that they should \nwatch this time at 10 in the morning, where any Member can come down \nand talk about anything they want to talk about, because you can learn \na lot about one another.\n  There are folks who come to this floor every single morning to \ncelebrate somebody in their district back home, to build up the country \nwith optimism, and with the belief that if only we unite, if only we \nwork harder, we can make tomorrow better than yesterday was.\n  There are those Members who come to the floor on a regular basis to \ntear things down. I tell you, Mr. Speaker, I have been in this world \nfor 47 years. I know it is easier to tear things down than it is to \nbuild things up. Something has happened in this institution where the \ncurrency is how quickly can you tear the other side down instead of how \nquickly can you partner with them to build things up.\n  Tax reform is hard. I have a bill for folks who are uncomfortable \nwith the elimination of special carve-outs, deductions, exemptions, and \nlobbyist loopholes. For folks who are uncomfortable with those things, \nI have a bill that repeals absolutely every one. It is called the \nFairTax Act. It is H.R. 25.\n  We are not going to vote on that bill today because this institution \nis not comfortable eliminating absolutely everything all at once. But \nthere is a difference of opinion, Mr. Speaker, in what the Tax Code is \ndesigned for. Is it designed to punish people that you dislike and \nreward people that you do like? Or is it designed simply to raise the \nrevenue so that the government can do the things it needs to do?\n  I believe the latter.\n  My friends have come to the floor today and they have said: Oh, we \nare eliminating this exemption and that deduction, and that carve-out \nand that loophole, and those things help with the cost of education.\n  Well, I say to my friends: If we want to help with the cost of \neducation, let's deal with education.\n  The Tax Code is not the solution to every problem. Oftentimes it is \nthe source of those problems.\n  For folks who believe that the cost of medical care is too expensive, \nI agree. Another carve-out, another loophole, another exemption, the \nTax Code will not solve that problem. It may mask that problem, but it \nwill not solve it. We have to come together to solve the healthcare \ninflation problem.\n  I say to my friends who are worried about the medical cost deduction: \nI worry about that, too. I worried about it when the Affordable Care \nAct made it 33 percent harder for Americans to claim that; when it \nraised that base level from 7.5 percent to 10 percent, meaning so many \nmore Americans couldn't claim it.\n  This bill doubles the standard deduction so that families don't have \nto worry about the magnitude of their burden. Simply, the fact that \nthey have a burden means that they will be able to exempt it.\n  My friend from Pennsylvania came and told the story of two families \nfrom Pennsylvania working in a picture tube factory. It was a powerful \nstory of American manufacturing disappearing. If I looked around this \ninstitution to find a millennial here, they wouldn't even know what a \npicture tube is. That factory was going to go out of business because \ntechnology surpassed it.\n  We are losing American manufacturing overseas every single day, not \nbecause we are not the hardest working people on the planet, but \nbecause we have the most punitive Tax Code on the planet. Everyone here \nknows it.\n  In 1986, everyone knew it. America had the least competitive Tax Code \non the planet, but Democrats and Republicans came together--Ronald \nReagan and Tip O'Neill--and they took America from worst to first. \nDecades of economic prosperity ensued. We are doing that very same \nthing today: worst to first.\n  Would be that it were Democrats and Republicans together that were \ndoing that, but I tell you, Mr. Speaker, the time is not too late to \ncome together to do that. It was a worthy goal in 1986. It is a worthy \ngoal today. The Tax Code should not be picking winners and losers. It \nshould be creating an economic environment where the American worker \ncan succeed; where the American worker and its commitment is not at a \ndisadvantage to the rest of the world, but it is at least on a level \nplaying field, if not advantaged to the rest of the world.\n  We can do that together today, and I hope that we will. It will \nalways be easier to tear things down and than to build things up, Mr. \nSpeaker. But I know the men and women in this Chamber on a personal \nlevel, and I know they didn't come to tear things down. They came to \nbuild a better day tomorrow for their children, their grandchildren, \nand the constituents that they represent.\n  Mr. Speaker, I hope that we will fulfill that promise together.\n", "turn": 1, "speaker": "Mr. WOODALL", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "187", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H9261", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "15", "month": "November"}, "related_bills": [{"type": "HR", "context": "FIRSTPARAGRAPH", "congress": "115", "number": "25"}, {"type": "HR", "context": "OTHER", "congress": "115", "number": "25"}], "doc_title": "BUILD A BETTER TOMORROW", "id": "CREC-2017-11-15-pt1-PgH9261"}
