Mr. Speaker, I want to start by saying that I would \noffer my thanks and collegial admiration and respect to the members of \nthe Rules Committee who, last night, once again, on an expedited basis, \nspent time devoted to the duty that they have not only to their party, \nbut also to the House of Representatives acting on behalf of the \nAmerican people.\n  The gentlewoman, Ms. Slaughter; the gentleman, Mr. Hastings; the \ngentleman, Mr. Polis; and certainly our friend from Worcester, \nMassachusetts, the gentleman, Mr. McGovern, conducted themselves not \nonly in the highest of spirit, but they also produced what I believe \nwas a fair argument, a product that they could be proud of. Each of the \nwitnesses that came before us, including Democratic Members of Congress \nand Republican Members of Congress, provided, I believe, top-notch \ntestimony and information on behalf of their ideas.\n  I personally want to thank Judge Hastings for his time last night, \nwhich was late into the night, and today. My admiration and respect for \nhis collegial activity is to be respected and appreciated.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of this rule and the underlying \nlegislation. The rule provides for consideration of H.R. 1, the Tax \nCuts and Jobs Act.\n  Last November, the November which was 1 year ago, the American people \nspoke, and they spoke clearly. I believe they stood up and demanded \nchange and action on our economy. They demanded an increase in \nunderstanding about America's lack in GDP growth, and they saw all \nacross the country companies that continue to move overseas. They saw \nmovement in our economy where people moved from one State to another \nseeking better opportunities.\n  I believe that the American people have spoken. We not only heard \nthat, but we are trying to make decisions now that would not only help \nevery single area of the country by picking those businesses that might \nbe in the city, in the town and location that they want to be, but by \ninfusing them with the opportunity to stay, to stay because they can \nnot only make a go of it, but they can be competitive in the world \nmarket.\n  Lowering tax rates in this country will help the middle class of this \ncountry. It will help jobs and job creation. That is why we are here \ntoday. We are here today as a Republican Party where we are trying to \nwork with the President of the United States, the United States Senate, \nand the House of Representatives to speak clearly about not only what \nwe stand for, but our hopes and dreams for a better opportunity for all \nAmericans tomorrow and in the future.\n  Mr. Speaker, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act delivers on those promises \nthat I just spoke of. This is a bold, progrowth bill that will overhaul \nour Tax Code and unleash the free enterprise system not just in my home \nState of Texas or in my city of Dallas, but, really, everywhere where \nbusiness wants to be, it can flourish in an unfettered way because we \nare now going to be competitive. It lowers tax rates on all businesses \nof all sizes so job creators can focus on not only their product and \nsales, but they can hire more people, increasing paychecks and growth.\n  Growth actually is the key to what we are talking about today. \nEconomic growth brings abundant opportunity: opportunity for people not \nonly to have a job, but to have a career, control their own lives and \nmake sure they can live where they want to live and so they can make \ntheir community stronger. That is this Republican viewpoint of what we \nare trying to get at, Mr. Speaker.\n  With the highest corporate tax rate in the industrialized world, \ntoday's broken Tax Code here in America forces many businesses to move \ntheir jobs, research, and headquarters overseas seeking opportunities \nin a world environment of competition where they can survive and they \ncan become more competitive. A corporate tax rate of 20 percent \nencourages American companies to bring their jobs back to the United \nStates, opening up opportunity. This decrease is fundamental to making \nthe United States more competitive once again.\n  The number one reason why America is not competitive in the world is \nno longer because of energy costs; it is no longer because we have the \nhighest priced employees, no, sir. It is because Uncle Sam, State, and \nlocal taxes make it noncompetitive, which creates a higher cost as we \ncompete around the globe.\n  This legislation will modernize the international Tax Code, also \nbringing back opportunities for American companies that want to bring \ntheir profits back home and encourage U.S. businesses to bring foreign \nearnings home, unleashing what will be, over some period of time, \ntrillions of dollars that can come back home.\n  It reduces the tax burden on all passthrough businesses regardless of \ntheir structure or their sector. This legislation provides tax relief \nfor job creators and creates capital investments, investments that will \ndrive growth, once again, of paychecks and opportunities for growth. \nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is a direct and immediate boost for middle-\nincome Americans who have been struggling to get by, let alone get \nahead.\n  Mr. Speaker, you will hear today how we are going to have a new tax \nbracket. All Americans until they, as individuals, earn $12,000 and two \nworking people at home earning $24,000 worth of income will not pay tax \non that. It is intended entirely to help the middle class of this \ncountry.\n  H.R. 1 is about the entrepreneur, the family of four, the small-\nbusiness owner, and the American people. The United States is already \nthe greatest place in the world to live. We are proud to be Americans. \nBut we have to be competitive in the world marketplace.\n  Mr. Speaker, 70 percent of the tax benefits in this legislation go \ndirectly to the middle class. The American people want and need, I \nbelieve, to learn not only more about this bill, but how it will \nincentivize them to Make America Great Again.\n\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.", "turn": 5, "speaker": "Mr. SESSIONS", "itemno": 7}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "H000324", "text": "  Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased that the gentleman from Texas, my good \nfriend, yielded me the customary 30 minutes for debate.\n  Once again, my Republican colleagues have decided that the best way \nto govern is through obfuscation, mathematical gimmicks, and a rushed \nand closed process, and all in an obvious attempt to hide from the \nAmerican people the devastating consequences the Republican-led tax \nscam bill will have on working class and middle class Americans.\n  Just so we are all crystal clear on this point: Who, under this tax \nbill, benefits on the backs of working and middle class Americans? Yes, \nfolks, it is the wealthy corporations and the richest among us.\n  The Republican majority has made lofty claims about their bill, \nsaying that because of this legislation, everyone gets a tax cut, jobs \nwill be plentiful, and that the economy will grow exponentially and \nastronomically. The White House has even said that the tax cuts would \nresult in each household receiving an additional $5,000 to $9,000 in \nannual income.\n  Mr. Speaker, it seems there isn't anything that Republican leadership \nwon't say to get their own Members to vote for this bill.\n  Mr. Speaker, they can make all the claims they want, but the actual \ntax experts who have analyzed this bill paint a much darker picture \nabout the consequences of this legislation. According to one \nnonpartisan tax analysis, today's Republican plan will result in a tax \nincrease for 38 million middle class Americans.\n  Not to worry, though. While these hardworking middle class families \nhave to deal with the tax increase, the richest 0.2 percent of \nAmericans will get a windfall. In fact, the estate provision in this \nbill alone would allow the heirs of just 11 ultrawealthy individuals to \npocket up to $67.5 billion. An estimated 80 percent of the tax cuts in \nthis legislation will go to wealthy corporations and the richest 1 \npercent.\n\n\n  Mr. Speaker, even more astonishing, a recent analysis by the \nnonpartisan Congressional Budget Office indicates that this Republican \ntax bill could trigger automatic cuts to mandatory spending to the tune \nof $136 billion, including $25 billion in the Medicare cut.\n  Let that sink in, because actually what is getting ready to happen \nhere is we are going to have a $1.5 trillion deficit, and these deficit \nhawks on the other side are then going to turn right back around and \nsay that we need to pay for these things. Then watch out Medicare, \nSocial Security, and Medicaid, because that is the objective, in my \nview, in the first place.\n  In order to cut taxes for the ultrawealthy and corporations, my \nRepublican colleagues are not only raising taxes on the middle class, \nbut are now potentially triggering a $25 billion cut to Medicare.\n  If this inequity were not staggering enough, Americans also have to \nkeep in mind that today's Republican tax giveaway to corporate America \nand the ultrawealthy is not only on the backs of the middle class, but \nalso future generations, as this bill will explode our national debt by \nan estimated $1.5 trillion over the next 10 years.\n  Not surprisingly, Republicans are making the tired excuse that these \ncuts will pay for themselves. If they did, then we would have the \neasiest jobs in the world. Just cut taxes, and magically we will have \neven more revenue to pay for the important needs of our country. That \nsounds a lot like the old trickle-down-which-never-worked economics. It \nsounds that way to me, and we all know that as far as economic theories \ngo, that one was and is a complete and total dud.\n  Mr. Speaker, to summarize the majority's attempt to overhaul our Tax \nCode for the first time in 30 years: they raise taxes on middle class \nAmericans, cut taxes for the wealthiest Americans and corporations, and \nmanage to explode the debt all at the same time--all this while also \nleading the most closed Congress in history and shutting out Members of \nCongress who represent nearly half of the American people.\n  Hear that, America: a lot of your Representatives had no opportunity \nto say or do anything regarding the measure that we are discussing.\n  Mr. Speaker, let us step back and really get a full view of how \ncallous this bill is for our Nation by looking at how the bill treats \nmiddle class Americans versus its treatment of the ultrawealthy and \ncorporate America.\n  Under this Republican tax scam bill, a working class schoolteacher \nwho buys supplies for his or her students would not be able to deduct \nthat expense, but a corporation that buys supplies for itself would be \nable to use such a deduction.\n  Under this Republican tax bill, a middle class homeowner would see \ntheir property tax deduction capped at $10,000, but a corporation would \nnot face the same cap.\n  Under this Republican tax bill, if a worker was forced to relocate \nfor his or her job--footnote there, including the military--because the \ncompany moved or, in the case of the military, they were relocated, he \nor she would not be able to deduct that moving expense; but if a \ncorporation decided to relocate, even to relocate overseas, it will be \nable to deduct its moving expense.\n  Mr. Speaker, the list goes on. But we shouldn't be surprised. As the \nold adage goes, bad process makes for bad policy.\n  Not since the Republicans' failed attempt to strip healthcare away \nfrom millions of Americans have we seen a process that is this bad.\n  Take, for example, the last time Congress passed major tax reform \nlegislation in 1986 and what that process looked like. During that \neffort, the Ways and Means Committee held a month of public hearings \nand took testimony from over 450 witnesses.\n\n\n  The legislation before us now has had no--zero--public hearings and \ntestimony from no--zero--expert witnesses.\n  During the last tax reform overhaul, the Ways and Means Committee \nspent 26 days marking up the framework of the legislation. This time \naround, Republicans spent only 4 days marking up the legislation.\n  The 1986 legislation framework was released a year before it was \npassed in the House. In contrast, the framework for this bill was \nreleased less than a month before they started today's process of \njamming their final bill through the House. There were no hearings and \nno amendments made in order. From start to finish, there was less than \na month of actual consideration.\n  Much like the majority's rushed healthcare processes that produced an \nabysmal, destructive bill that would hurt working class Americans, this \nrushed process has produced a tax bill that benefits corporations and \nthe wealthiest Americans, all while managing to raise taxes on the \nmiddle class and adding $1.5 trillion to the deficit.\n  Mr. Speaker, the Republican majority is lurching from one bad bill to \nthe next with speed--not thoughtful policy--seemingly being the only \ngoal. It begs the question: What is the rush?\n  As a matter of fact, I don't even think we need a tax bill of this \nconsequence. According to them, the economy is roaring, unemployment is \nlow, interest rates are low. So what is wrong with certainly leaving \nthe wealthy in the category that they are in?\n  Why are my Republican colleagues setting an arbitrary deadline of \npassing a tax bill by Thanksgiving, instead of focusing on thoughtful \npolicy and getting the substance right in a bipartisan fashion?\n  Everyone agrees that we need to do something about the Tax Code. \nDemocrats have been ready to work with Republicans on this effort, but \nhave been shut out of the process at every turn. Why?\n  The only logical conclusion is that this has nothing to do with \npolicy and everything to do with politics. It has nothing to do with \nhelping the middle class, but instead is a callous political maneuver \naimed at salvaging a stalled and ever-failing Republican agenda.\n  We are about to end the year with nothing having been done of \nconsequence. Mr. Speaker, don't take my word for it. This conclusion is \nnot based on my own opinion. Some of my Republican colleagues have \nadmitted as much.\n  When asked about the need to move on to tax reform quickly, one of my \nesteemed colleagues on the other side of the aisle was heard to say: \n``My donors are basically saying, `Get it done or don't ever call me \nagain.' ''\n  Likewise, on the other side of the Capitol, one Republican has stated \nthat, if the Republicans fail on tax reform, just as they did on \nhealthcare, financial contributions will stop.\n  Mr. Speaker, I don't think politics should dictate our efforts to \nreform something as significant as the Tax Code. Our guiding light \nshould be to help working folks get a leg up. The only way to do that \nis to work in a bipartisan, deliberate manner, hearing from experts and \nthe American people, as they did in 1986, and not as my Republican \nfriends have done this time around, spending a mere 3 weeks, with no \nhearings, no bipartisan efforts, simply to give us something done \nbefore Thanksgiving.\n  That approach only gets you what we have here before us today: a bill \nthat, in my opinion, does more harm than good to middle class Americans \nand puts our country further into debt.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.", "turn": 6, "speaker": "Mr. HASTINGS", "itemno": 8}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "S000250", "text": "  Mr. SESSIONS.

Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman of the Rules Committee \nfor yielding.\n  Today, the House of Representatives is considering tax reform for the \nfirst time since 1986.\n  In the last 31 years, the world has changed a lot and it is time that \nwe bring the Tax Code into the 21st century. This needed tax reform \nwill put our country on a path to long-term economic stability and help \nhardworking families around the country get ahead.\n  The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act will help American families in important \nways. First, it focuses on Americans in the middle of the earning scale \nby doubling the standard deduction and creating a new family \nflexibility credit for nondependents. Taxpayers will be able to deduct \neven more from their taxable income, reducing the need for tedious \nitemization.\n  In addition, the bill repeals the alternative minimum tax. This tax \nwas never intended to be as broad as it has become, but because it was \nnot indexed for inflation when it was introduced, many of us find \nourselves having to calculate our taxes twice to see if we are ensnared \nby the alternative minimum tax. It is time for this one to go away.\n  With decreased taxation, American families have more money in their \npockets, resulting in greater contributions to the economy.\n\n  The bill also alleviates some of the cost of raising children by \nexpanding the child tax credit. It preserves the adoption tax credit so \nparents can continue to receive additional tax relief as they open \ntheir hearts and their homes to an adopted child.\n  This bill reduces the number of tax brackets from seven to four, with \nrates of zero, 12, 25 and 35 percent for most taxpayers. It does \npreserve the 39.6 percent rate of the previous administration for the \nhighest earners. These reforms will help simplify the Tax Code and make \nit more competitive for hardworking American families.\n  I am grateful the Ways and Means Committee kept the step-up in basis, \ndespite repealing the estate tax by 2024. The step-up in basis is an \nimportant component of estate planning when people are planning for \nfuture generations. This will allow people who may experience a tragedy \nto continue ownership of family property without bearing excessive \npenalties.\n  Mr. Speaker, I am a supporter of the flat tax. I have introduced H.R. \n1040 in every term that I have been in office, but I recognize this \nbill makes a lot of needed reforms and repeals some credits while \nmaintaining those important to American taxpayers.\n  Donors will still be able to make tax-exempt charitable \ncontributions, employers will still be able to contribute to 401(k) \nretirement savings accounts, new homeowners will be able to deduct the \ninterest expense on up to $500,000 of a mortgage, and no changes are \nmade as to Social Security.\n  I was actually hoping we could lower Social Security taxes. We \ncouldn't. But we certainly do not increase Social Security taxes, \ndespite what some of the fake news says.\n  Students will continue receiving a credit through the consolidated \nAmerican opportunity tax credit.\n  Simply put, this bill will promote growth at middle-income levels, \ncreate a more favorable business environment, and continue important \ntax credits.", "turn": 8, "speaker": "Mr. BURGESS", "itemno": 10}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "H000324", "text": "  Mr. HASTINGS.

Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman of the Rules \nCommittee, my friend, for yielding.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of this rule as well as \nthe underlying legislation, H.R. 1, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.\n  This legislation demonstrates a commitment to my constituents and all \nof the American people to provide relief.\n  Our current Tax Code contains over 70,000 pages of rules and \nprovisions. Within these pages are hundreds of loopholes and carve-outs \nthat only special interests can fully understand and access.\n  At the very core of this legislation is a matter of fairness. By \npassing this rule and supporting the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, we will be \nmaking a profound reform of our Tax Code toward a system that is \nsimpler, flatter, and fairer to American families across the country.\n  According to analysis by the Tax Foundation, which is an independent, \nnonpartisan tax policy nonprofit, this legislation would stimulate GDP \ngrowth up to 4 percent and provide more than 3 percent of a wage \nincrease.\n  In my home State of Washington, it is projected that almost 22,000 \nnew jobs will be created and a middle class family in my State is \nprojected to gain over $3,000 in after-tax income, should this bill be \nsigned into law.\n  This means real and significant economic growth, with tens of \nthousands of new jobs in my State alone, and more money staying in the \npocket of central Washingtonians.\n\n  Mr. Speaker, I have been disappointed in the dialogue surrounding \nthis legislation from my colleagues on the other side of the aisle. The \naccusations that this will be a massive tax hike on the middle class \nare patently false.\n  Unfortunately, these claims are being made by Federal officials right \nhere in Washington, D.C., all the way to my State capital in Washington \nState.\n  In my congressional district, over 80 percent of the people file \ntheir taxes using the standard deduction. This bill actually doubles \nthe standard deduction for middle class families and for all Americans. \nThis allows families I represent in Moses Lake, Omak, and Tri-Cities to \nsave more money on their tax bill without having to jump through \ncomplicated loopholes and pore over their tax preparations for hours. \nHowever, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle refuse to \nacknowledge that fact.\n  This bill lowers individual tax rates for low- and middle-income \nAmericans and continues to maintain the highest rate of 39.6 percent \nfor the wealthiest of Americans. It eliminates special interest \ndeductions, expands the child tax credit, establishes a new family \ncredit for families taking care of a loved one, and it preserves the \nadoption tax credit.\n  It allows a small business in Othello or a farmer in Yakima to \nimmediately write off the full cost of new equipment. It repeals the \nunfair estate tax, which hurts family farms and small businesses.\n  Mr. Speaker, the American people need relief, the people of central \nWashington need relief, and this bill provides it.

I want to tell you what the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act will \nactually do for the families I represent back in southwest Alabama.\n  According to data from the IRS, almost three-fourths of the tax \nfilers in my district claimed the standard deduction instead of \nitemizing. Well, under our plan, the standard deduction will be \ndoubled.\n  Just consider the medium family of four in southwest Alabama. That \nfamily earns a little over $77,000 a year. If that family takes the \nstandard deduction, as most do, they will see a tax cut of $1,739 a \nyear. That comes out to almost an extra $150 a month.\n  Now, that may not sound like real money in Washington, but for \nfamilies in Bay Minette or Citronelle or Monroeville, that is \nimportant. That is extra money for a car payment. That is additional \nsavings for a child's college. That is money to help pay for home \nrepairs. That is real money.\n  When you add in the fact that we are fixing our corporate and \nbusiness Tax Code to make it fairer and simpler, then we can truly make \nAmerica boom again. President Trump has called it the ``middle class \nmiracle.''\n  By making our Tax Code more competitive, we can unleash our full \neconomic potential, bring jobs back to America, raise wages, and \nultimately get more money in the pockets of working Americans. Mr. \nSpeaker, this is exactly what President Trump promised and what the \nAmerican people sent him and us to Washington to do.\n  Now, my colleagues on the other side like to say this bill helps the \n1 percent, and they vehemently defend the current Tax Code.\n  You know who benefits from the current Tax Code? The 1 percent--\npeople who can hire lawyers and lobbyists to help them get a special \ntax break, people who can spend thousands of dollars a year on \nspecialty accountants. If you want to help the 1 percent, then keep the \ncurrent complicated and confusing Tax Code that only helps the elite \nand well connected.

Carolyn \nshared with me how she spends her own personal money on school supplies \nfor students who can't afford to buy their own. To help mitigate this \ncost, there is a Federal tax deduction that allows teachers to get back \nup to $250 of their personal money they put towards supplies in their \nclassroom, but the bill before us denies Carolyn and all of the other \nteachers that deduction and eliminates the tax benefits in the name of \ncutting taxes for wealthy international corporations.\n  This bill also rolls back a critical education tax benefit that \nallows employers to provide up to $5,250 of tuition assistance, pretax.\n  In practice, it encourages workforce training and apprenticeship \nprograms. In fact, this very week is National Apprenticeship Week, and \nyet the Republican tax bill pulls the rug out from under businesses and \nworkers, actually discouraging apprenticeships by stopping this tax \nbenefit.\n  Mr. Speaker, I was privileged to serve, before I came here, as the \nchairman of our State Board of Education and school superintendent.

This legislation will \n     provide much needed tax relief to America's job-creating \n     small businesses. H.R. 1 will be considered an NFIB Key Vote \n     for the 115th Congress.\n       Small business is the engine of the economy, and tax reform \n     should provide substantial relief to all small businesses so \n     they can reinvest their money, grow, and create jobs. Ninety-\n     nine percent of all American businesses are small businesses; \n     the average NFIB member has just 10 employees. Taken in sum, \n     however, small businesses create half of all private-sector \n     jobs in the U.S. and contribute half the nation's gross \n     domestic product.\n       Three-quarters of small employers are structured as pass-\n     through entities, meaning their owners are taxed at the \n     individual rate as opposed to the corporate rate. Crucially, \n     H.R. 1 reduces the tax rate on the smallest pass-through \n     businesses to 9 percent over five years, without industry \n     exclusions or restrictions.\n       NFIB supports passage of H.R. 1 and will consider it an \n     NFIB Key Vote for the 115th Congress.\n       Thank you for your consideration. We look forward to \n     working with you to protect small business.\n           Sincerely,\n\n\n                                            Juanita D.

Brady, R-TX, and 24 cosponsors\n\n       The Administration strongly supports House passage of H.R. \n     1, the Tax Cuts and\n\n\n     Jobs Act. Passing the bill is an important first step in \n     achieving comprehensive tax reform that cuts taxes for hard-\n     working families and puts the Nation's economy on a path of \n     higher economic growth. The President's priorities for tax \n     reform have been consistent from day one: (1) cut taxes for \n     middle-income families; (2) simplify the Nation's complicated \n     tax system; and (3) reduce business taxes so that American \n     employers can create jobs, raise wages for their workers, and \n     better compete with foreign businesses.\n       H.R. 1 would deliver meaningful tax cuts for middle-income \n     families by nearly doubling the standard deduction, lowering \n     tax rates, increasing the child tax credit, and creating a \n     new Family Flexibility credit. It would simplify tax filing \n     so that the large majority of Americans could file their \n     taxes on a single page. The bill would also cut the corporate \n     tax rate to 20 percent--below the average tax rate in the \n     Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. \n     Finally, H.R. 1 would lower taxes for millions of S \n     corporations, sole proprietors, and partnerships that pay \n     taxes at individual rates.\n       Based on a review of more than 100 academic papers, the \n     White House Council of Economic Advisors (CEA) estimates that \n     the corporate provisions in H.R. 1 would grow the economy by \n     between 3 and 5 percent over the next 10 years, which if \n     applied to 2027 Gross Domestic Product projections, would \n     result in an additional $700 billion to $1.2 trillion in \n     economic output per year. CEA also found that the same \n     provisions would increase average household income by at \n     least $4,000 annually.\n       If H.R. 1 were presented to the President, his advisors \n     would recommend that he sign the bill into law.", "turn": 20, "speaker": "Mr. SESSIONS", "itemno": 22}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "S000250", "text": "  Mr. SESSIONS.

It is \nincreasingly clear that no matter what party is in power, so long as \nour national security needs keep rising, an economy hampered by \nrestrictive tax rates will never produce enough revenues to balance our \nbudget--just as it will never produce enough jobs or enough profits. . \n. . ''\n  `` . . . only full employment can balance the budget, and tax \nreduction can pave the way to that employment. The purpose of cutting \ntaxes now is not to incur a budget deficit, but to achieve the more \nprosperous, expanding economy which can bring a budget surplus.''\n  I understand that there are differences of opinion on what we are \ntrying to do, but, please, let's talk about the facts. Let's talk about \na piece of legislation that is a rising tide that will lift all boats.\n  We are going to cut taxes for every American at every income level. \nWe are going to reduce taxes by almost $1,200 for every average-sized, \nmiddle-income American family. This puts more money in the pockets of \nour families. I don't care how they vote or how they registered. They \nare Americans.\n  It reduces by almost $2,000 for every average-sized, middle-income \nfamily in Pennsylvania's Third District. That is a $2,000 reduction for \nthem.\n  It will grow our national GDP by 3.6 percent.\n\n\n  It will increase average American wages by 3.1 percent.\n  In the long run, it will increase after-tax incomes for American \ntaxpayers by 4.4 percent.\n  I also want you to think about what we talk about back home where I \nam from. We talk about take-home pay. ``This is my take-home pay.'' In \nPennsylvania, Pennsylvanians--Republican Pennsylvanians, Democrat \nPennsylvanians, Independents, Libertarians--are going to have about \n$2,700 more in their pockets after this legislation goes through.\n  Let's talk about jobs. Nobody spoke better about jobs than President \nReagan when he said: It is about jobs, jobs, jobs, and more jobs. What \nis good for the American worker is good for America.\n  This will create 1 million new American jobs.\n  I want you to think about this: In the United States of America, we \nare now currently rated as the 23rd best country to do business in. The \nTax Cuts and Jobs Act will change that. I want you to think about that.\n  I am a hometown guy; I am a home team guy. It is hard for me to sit \nback and say that we have allowed ourselves to fall that far in the \nworld when people think: Where should I start that business? Twenty-\nthird, are you kidding me? With all of the assets that we have been \ngiven by the Lord? And to sit here today and have an argument over \nsomething else other than that doesn't make any sense at all.\n  What we are trying to do with our tax plan is make sure that the \nUnited States just doesn't participate in a global economy, it \ndominates a global economy, it leads the way in a global economy, it \nmakes American workers stronger, it makes American families stronger, \nand it allows us to rebuild our military and our infrastructure. It \nallows everything good to happen.\n  We cannot stay with the status quo. There is so much good in this \nbill for every single American. I did not say every single Republican, \nI said every single American. You can bat that one back and forth and \ntry to make it a political story, but it is not. It is truly an \nAmerican story. America has never dodged that responsibility.\n  Now, let me read you one other quote, again, from an Irish-American \nPresident, who I hold in such great esteem, and one of the greatest \npeople I have ever listened to. Let me read this to you. It says:\n  ``I do not underestimate the obstacles which the Congress will face \nin enacting such legislation. No one will be satisfied. Everyone will \nhave his own approach, his own bill, his own reductions. A high order \nof restraint and determination will be required if the `possible' is \nnot to wait on the `perfect.' But a nation capable of marshaling these \nqualities in any dramatic threat to our security is surely capable, as \na great free society, of meeting a slower and more complex threat to \nour economic vitality. This Nation can afford to reduce taxes, we can \nafford a temporary deficit, but we cannot afford to do nothing. For on \nthe strength of our free economy rests the hope of all free nations. We \nshall not fail that hope, for free men and free nations must prosper \nand they must prevail.''\n\n  Think of who it is that we are. This is America's house. Yes, this is \na GOP tax plan, but it helps every single American.

Only full employment can balance the budget, and tax reduction \ncan pave the way to that employment.''\n  What he did not say is--that will be in the record--is that John F. \nKennedy said this on December 14, 1962, 55 years ago, in an address to \nthe Economic Club of New York.\n  Mr. Speaker, in fact, there have been a lot of people here who have \ngiven testimony, I think testimony that they intended to sway the \nvoters and those listening in this country that the Tax Code that we \nhave works just fine, but then they spoke about the frailties of that \nand they talked about jobs going offshore, they talked about jobs and \neconomic activity going somewhere else.\n  I, being from Dallas, Texas, hear stories every day about people who \nare coming to Texas, coming to north Texas, coming because of the \neconomic climate that will allow them and their companies to have a \nbetter shot at not only being competitive, but, as Mike Kelly said, to \nbe winners in this economy, at the very top of the heap rather than at \nthe bottom of the heap.\n  What this common denominator is, is that my State of Texas does do \nthe things that this bill does also. It keeps taxes low, it creates \nopportunity.\n  By the way, how many poor people create jobs?\n  I don't know.\n  How many of those who really have incentive and entrepreneurship \ncreate jobs?\n  A ton of them.\n  We are going to grow entrepreneurs out of today.

Instead of it \nbeing a 95 percent failure rate of new business--which is what it is, \nit is a heavy bar because of rules, regulations, and taxes--we are \ngoing to make it easier.\n  The White House Council of Economic Advisers based their review, as \nthey provided the economic outlook to us, on more than 100 academic \npapers, estimates that corporate provisions in this tax bill alone will \ngrow our economy, not leave us in 23rd place, as Mike Kelly said.\n  Who wants to be in 23rd place?\n  If you want to be in the top 25 and you are comfortable, sorry.\n  We want to be at the top. We want to Make America Great Again. We \nwant to be able to say that businesses all over the United States stand \na chance, and that is what this does.\n  The Council of Economic Advisers says that this will grow the economy \nbetween 3 and 5 percent.\n  Whoops.

Kevin Brady,\n     House of Representatives,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Brady: You asked me to comment on the changes \n     made by H.R. 1 as ordered reported by the House Committee on \n     Ways and Means in the context of Clause 5(b) of Rule XXI of \n     the House of Representatives.\n       Clause 5(b) of Rule XXI sets special passage requirements \n     for measures that amend subsections (a), (b), (c), (d), or \n     (e) of section 1 or section 11(b) or 55(b) of the Internal \n     Revenue Code in a manner that imposes a new percentage rate \n     of tax and thereby increases the amount of tax imposed by \n     such section. H.R. 1 amends the relevant sections by \n     eliminating the 10-percent bracket, which is obviated as a \n     marginal rate as a result of the increase in the standard \n     deduction provided in section 63(c) and makes general changes \n     to the income thresholds at which the varying tax rate \n     brackets apply and eliminating several other tax rates of \n     present law. These changes combined with the increased value \n     of the child tax credit (in section 24) result in virtually \n     every taxpayer who formerly would have been in the 10-percent \n     tax bracket having a lower tax liability under the changes \n     that would be effectuated by H.R. 1 than they would under \n     present law.\n       Similarly, H.R. 1 eliminates the present-law 33-percent \n     marginal tax bracket. As a result there are some taxpayers \n     who would claim the standard deduction and had his or her \n     last dollar of income taxed in the 33-percent tax bracket \n     under present law but under H.R. 1 after claiming the \n     increased the standard deduction would have their last dollar \n     of income taxed in the 35-percent tax bracket. However, in \n     each such case the taxpayer's total income tax liability is \n     lower under H.R. 1 than under present law. For taxpayers who \n     eschew the standard deduction under present law there is \n     substantially greater variability in resulting tax \n     liabilities. With the elimination of some deductions that \n     taxpayers may elect to itemize under present law, it is not \n     possible to say in all cases that these taxpayers have lower \n     total income tax liability under H.R. 1 than under present \n     law. However, by comparison to the case of a taxpayer \n     claiming the standard deduction, the variability of these \n     results is clearly a consequence of the changes to the tax \n     base effectuated by H.R. 1 rather than a consequence solely \n     of the elimination of the present-law 33-percent bracket.\n       Because the House rule does not contemplate changes to the \n     Internal Revenue Code as a whole and the interactions such \n     changes have on tax liability, H.R. 1 requires a waiver of \n     the rule's provisions. In its totality, the combined effect \n     of the tax rate and income threshold amendments made by the \n     bill, along with the increase in the standard deduction, \n     would not, in and of themselves, result in an increase in the \n     amount of tax imposed on virtually any filer as a result of \n     these changes.\n       I hope this discussion is helpful. Please contact me with \n     any questions.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Thomas A.

On March 15, 1909, a member of the \n     majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated \n     the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to \n     a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to \n     recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (R-Illinois) said: \n     ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman \n     from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to \n     yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first \n     recognition.''\n       The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous \n     question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an \n     immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no \n     substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.'' \n     But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the \n     Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in \n     the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition, \n     page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the previous \n     question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is generally \n     not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member \n     controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of \n     offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by \n     voting down the previous question on the rule. . . . When the \n     motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the \n     time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering \n     the previous question. That Member, because he then controls \n     the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for \n     the purpose of amendment.''\n       In Deschler's Procedure in the U.S. House of \n     Representatives, the subchapter titled ``Amending Special \n     Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on \n     such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on \n     Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further \n     debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues: \n     ``Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a \n     resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control \n     shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous \n     question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who \n     controls the time for debate thereon.''\n       Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does \n     have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only \n     available tools\n\n\n     for those who oppose the Republican majority's agenda and \n     allows those with alternative views the opportunity to offer \n     an alternative plan.\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 68}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "S000250", "text": "  Mr. SESSIONS.
