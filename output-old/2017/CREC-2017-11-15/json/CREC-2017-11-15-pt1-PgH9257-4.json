Mr. Speaker, on his recent trip to Asia, President \nTrump reminded us and our international trading partners that our \ncommercial agreements must be honest, fair, and reciprocal. With this \nadmonition, he called on our Asian friends to build automobile plants \nthat would employ American workers. Three cheers for him for doing \nthat.\n  The United States already has experienced the benefits and the \nliabilities of foreign-controlled multinational automobile companies \nmanufacturing in our country. These companies have provided good jobs \nfor America's working people, but having these foreign companies here \nhasn't always worked.\n  A few years ago, we discovered that one of the world's preeminent car \nmanufacturers, Volkswagen Group of America, had engaged in an illegal \nand clandestine strategy to circumvent U.S. emissions laws.\n  Volkswagen has a longstanding relationship with the American people. \nLike so many young people in my generation, my first car was a \nVolkswagen Beetle, so Volkswagen enjoyed an enormous goodwill in our \ncountry. Despite that, Volkswagen Group of America intentionally did us \nwrong. Volkswagen intentionally violated our emissions regulations and, \nby many accounts, they even engineered their systems to falsely \nindicate that they were complying with the emissions standards.\n  This was nothing more than pure arrogance and a hostile intent and an \negregious violation of our best legislative efforts to regulate our way \nto clean air. Unfortunately, this issue with Volkswagen has not been \ntotally dealt with and put behind us.\n  The deal with the German Government that got them off the hook \nremains cloaked in mystery and left many questions unanswered. We do \nnot know yet, for example, whether Volkswagen will compensate Americans \nin a full and just manner. Those uncompensated Americans may include \nthe owners of the bogusly engineered cars, as well as auto importers, \nas well as, perhaps, service stations who officially were authorized to \nrepair Volkswagens.\n  Mr. Speaker, the VW deal between the Obama administration and the \nMerkel government needs to be revisited with a full airing of the \ndetails. We need to know if Volkswagen has complied fully and if the \nsettlement was demonstrably fair to Americans who relied on their good \nfaith.\n  Wolfgang Porsche, the family who owns 52 percent of Volkswagen, he \nwas the chairman during this time of the emissions scandal; as well as \nMatthias Mueller, the CEO of Volkswagen Group, they need to be put on \nthe record about what the details of this subterfuge of American law \nwas all about.\n  We need to send a message also. By putting them on the record, we \nneed to send a message to all the multinational corporation executives \nwho, when they do business in the United States of America, have to \nplay by our rules.\n  I applaud the President for trying to encourage people to invest in \nbuilding factories here, but that means all of us must make sure that \nthat works out for the best for the American people.\n", "turn": 1, "speaker": "Mr. ROHRABACHER", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "187", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H9257", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "15", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "INTERNATIONAL TRADE AGREEMENTS MUST BE HONEST, FAIR, AND RECIPROCAL", "id": "CREC-2017-11-15-pt1-PgH9257-4", "title": "INTERNATIONAL TRADE AGREEMENTS MUST BE HONEST, FAIR, AND RECIPROCAL"}
