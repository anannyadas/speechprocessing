Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the tax \nbill.\n  Again, we find ourselves faced with a bill that will impact every \nAmerican, but my Republican colleagues are rushing through. They won't \neven wait for the Congressional Budget Office to show us what the cost \nwill be, to assess what this bill will do to our economy, to our \nchildren and our grandchildren.\n  Why the hurry, Mr. Speaker?\n  Is it in hopes that Americans won't notice the repeal of the estate \ntax, a tax that only applies to people so wealthy that entire States \ndon't have someone affected by it in some years.\n  Is it so that Americans won't notice that this bill repeals the State \nand local tax deduction for families, but not for businesses?\n  Or is it so that Americans won't notice that it won't tax businesses \nearning income abroad, but it does tax individuals working abroad?\n  Eighty percent of the tax cuts in this bill go to the top 1 percent \nof Americans. Republicans may pretend to hope that the money will \ntrickle down to the average American, but we know it won't work. \nTrickle-down does not work.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "187", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H9265", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "15", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "WHY THE HURRY?", "id": "CREC-2017-11-15-pt1-PgH9265-4", "title": "WHY THE HURRY?"}
