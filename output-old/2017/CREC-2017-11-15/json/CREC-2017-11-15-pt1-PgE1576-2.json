Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge my \ncolleagues to join me in cosponsoring the Recidivism Reduction Act to \nhelp streamline our Social Security system and reinstate fairness for \nex-offenders who have served their time.\n  The Recidivism Reduction Act will quickly restore federal disability \nbenefits for eligible individuals after incarceration. Access to \nfederal disability and health care benefits is a critical component of \nsuccessful re-entry into the community when individuals are released \nfrom prison or jail, especially among the mentally ill.\n  Typically, federal disability benefits are either suspended or \nterminated depending on the length of incarceration. However, upon \nrelease these benefits should be reinstated promptly to help provide \naccess to essential treatment services and supports, housing and \nnecessary income. Currently, due to barriers in federal law, it often \ntakes several months to reinstate benefits. Addressing this delay will \nhelp foster successful transitions into the community and reduce the \nlikelihood of recidivism.\n  The bill does not grant individuals new benefits; rather it removes \nbureaucratic hurdles to ensure that individuals promptly receive the \nbenefits to which they are entitled in order to break the cycle of \nrecidivism.\n  When individuals have prompt access to disability and medical \nbenefits after incarceration, they are better equipped to transition \nsuccessfully into the community, which would help reduce prison \novercrowding and save taxpayer money. By cosponsoring the Recidivism \nReduction Act, we can make the technical corrections to current law \nthat will make a real difference.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. CARSON of Indiana", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 3}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "187", "extension": true, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "E1576", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "15", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "INTRODUCING THE RECIDIVISM REDUCTION ACT", "id": "CREC-2017-11-15-pt1-PgE1576-2", "title": "INTRODUCING THE RECIDIVISM REDUCTION ACT"}
