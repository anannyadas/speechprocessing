Madam Speaker, we have heard a lot in this \ndebate today. One thing is abundantly clear. Virtually every \nhardworking citizen in this country recognizes our genuine need for tax \nreform.\n  Let me summarize some of the facts that have been presented today.\n  The burdensome 70,000-page U.S. Tax Code has grown to be unreasonably \ncomplex, increasingly unfair, and filled with special interest \nloopholes. American companies are taxed at the highest rate in the \nindustrialized world, and the government takes even more from our \nsmall-business owners and our entrepreneurs. As a result, our economic \ngrowth is stagnant, companies have gradually shifted their \nmanufacturing and operations overseas, and families are struggling just \nto keep up.\n  Today, the hurdles in our system seem almost insurmountable for \nhardworking people as they are afforded fewer and fewer opportunities \nfor economic mobility.\n  For previous generations, it was a different deal. We had the \nAmerican Dream. The American Dream was defined by a simple promise: if \nyou were willing to work hard and sacrifice and play by the rules, you \ncould make a better life for yourself and your family. But today, our \noutdated Tax Code has pushed that dream beyond the grasp of more and \nmore people.\n  The good news is we can fix this problem, and we are going to do that \nin this Chamber tomorrow. For the first time in over 30 years, Congress \nhas a historic opportunity to pass landmark tax reform that will be a \nturboboost to this economy, and it is going to lead us to a fairer \nsystem, as we said so many times, with more jobs and bigger paychecks \nfor everyone.\n  Our Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, H.R. 1, will deliver significant tax \nreductions for low- and middle-income earners, and it will help \nAmericans in every level of our economy. The bill, which draws from 6 \nyears of intensive work and expert analysis from more than 40 different \ncongressional hearings, lowers individual income taxes by consolidating \nthe existing seven brackets into four and doubling the standard \ndeduction for everyone.\n  It also establishes a new family tax credit. It provides higher \neducation benefits. It repeals the death tax. It preserves deductions \nfor mortgage interest and charitable donations and property taxes, and \nit incentivizes saving for retirement.\n  Tax returns will become incredibly simple for the first time in my \nlifetime because 9 out of 10 Americans will be able to complete their \nannual filing on a form the size of a postcard.\n  The bill's business tax reforms are equally seismic because we are \ngoing to slash our draconian corporate tax from 35 percent, the highest \nin the world, to 20 percent, and we are going to institute the lowest \nrates for small business job creators since World War II. U.S. \ncompanies will finally be allowed to compete again on a level playing \nfield and bring their jobs and operations back home from overseas.\n  The independent Tax Foundation estimated that our plan will result in \nthe creation of approximately 975,000 full-time American jobs and an \nincrease in family incomes of 4.4 percent, on average. In Louisiana, \nfor example, that would mean 13,293 new jobs and $1,857 of additional \nafter-tax income for our average middle class families.\n  The American people have long deserved a simpler, fairer, and \neffective system that rewards hard work and allows taxpayers to keep \nand invest more of what they earn. Our plan will finally provide that \nrelief and spark the dramatic economic growth our Nation has so \ndesperately needed.\n  The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is about more than just smart legislation. \nIt is about a revival of that American Dream I referenced. That has one \nagenda that should unite every single one of us, and we hope all of our \ncolleagues will support this historic landmark piece of legislation \ntomorrow.\n  Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. \nBudd), a great American small-business owner himself.", "turn": 3, "speaker": "Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana", "itemno": 6}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "B001305", "text": "  Mr. BUDD. Madam Speaker, I thank my friend, the gentleman from \nLouisiana, for yielding.\n  Madam Speaker, as my colleagues in this body know very well, it has \nbeen many years since we have reformed our Tax Code. Over the last few \ndecades, Congress has cut some taxes here and there, but we are overdue \nfor meaningful tax reform.\n  Hardworking taxpayers in North Carolina are right to ask why it has \nbeen so long since we have even reformed our Tax Code. The unfortunate \ntruth is that, for many years, Congress has thrown up the white flag in \ndefeat against K Street lobbyists, and they settled for preserving the \nstatus quo. However, tomorrow, we have a rare opportunity to finally \ndeliver a tax bill that puts working families first. The Tax Cuts and \nJobs Act would be the biggest overhaul to our Tax Code in 30 years.\n  To quickly summarize, this bill would collapse our tax brackets from \nseven to four; it would double the standard deduction and get rid of \nmany lobbyist loopholes; and it would slash the corporate tax rate to \n20 percent, which would allow America to compete and to win.\n  The nonpartisan Tax Foundation found that, if we passed this bill \ninto law, American workers would see a 3 percent increase in their \nwages, and our country would see nearly 1 million full-time jobs \ncreated\n  Madam Speaker, yesterday, my office received a letter from a \nconstituent of mine that said: ``As a manufacturer and constituent, I \nurge you to support tax reform and legislation that will fix our Tax \nCode that has held manufacturers back for far too long.'' This is just \nan example of the many letters I have received in favor of this reform \neffort.\n  In addition to letters of support that I have received, studies show \nthat, if we pass this bill, a typical household would see their taxes \ncut nearly $2,000.\n  Let's think for a second what this means. Instead of the IRS taking \nit, families could spend it on their children. They could put it in \ntheir savings, or they could pay off debts.\n  I am supporting this bill so we no longer hold manufacturers back \nfrom success. I am supporting this bill because it would make life \nsimpler and easier for job creators, savers, and hardworking families.\n  Last week, in this body, I addressed the fact that there are certain \nprovisions within this bill that my colleagues and I may differ on, and \nI noted that that is just always going to be the case, but I also \nsuggested that we ask ourselves three questions.\n  The first question was: Does this bill cut taxes for the vast \nmajority of hardworking American families?\n  The second was: Will it bring back jobs?\n  And the third question was: Will this bill simplify the tax filing \nprocess for working families next year and in the years to come?\n  Madam Speaker, the answer to all three of those questions was \n``yes.'' I urge my colleagues to vote tomorrow in favor of the Tax Cuts \nand Jobs Act.\n  Last year, President Trump promised to cut taxes for working \nfamilies, and that is exactly what this bill will do.", "turn": 4, "speaker": "Mr. BUDD", "itemno": 7}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "J000299", "text": "  Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana.

Madam Speaker, I thank my dear friend and \ndistinguished colleague from the State of Louisiana\n\n\nfor his strong leadership and for hosting us this evening, this Special \nOrder, on such an important issue.\n  Madam Speaker, tax reform in west Texas and in rural America is about \ngiving our hardworking and middle class families a break in allowing \nthem to keep more of their hard-earned money. According to the \nnonpartisan Tax Foundation, our plan would increase wages by over 3 \npercent, create roughly 1 million new jobs, and raise the after-tax \nincome of the average middle-income family by nearly $2,600.\n  It is about simplifying the Tax Code and reducing the burden on \ntaxpayers so that they don't have to spend a combined almost 9 billion \nhours and $100 billion just to prepare their taxes every year. Under \nour plan, 9 out of 10 Americans, as my colleague mentioned, will be \nable to file their taxes on a form as simple as a postcard.\n  It is about getting off the backs of our job creators, which are our \nsmall businesses, and letting them create more jobs for their \ncommunities. Our plan would reduce the tax rate on our Main Street job \ncreators to the lowest it has been since World War II.\n  It is about making America competitive again by leveling the playing \nfield for American producers and manufacturers.\n  Our plan would lower the corporate tax rate and bring jobs back to \nAmerica, and it would also boost the average American household income \nby $4,000 and, in some studies, as high as $9,000.\n  It is about giving our family farmers and ranchers a reason to invest \nin new tractors and equipment, combines and cotton strippers, so they \ncan do what they have been doing: be more productive even at feeding \nand clothing the American people.\n  This plan allows our farmers and ranchers, as well as our small \nbusinesses, the ability to write off the full cost of new technology \nand equipment immediately, and it is about eliminating the duplicative, \nunfair, and un-American death tax that prevents family farmers, \nranchers, and small-business owners from passing down their hard-earned \nAmerican Dream to the next generation after they paid taxes on it their \nentire lives.\n  Today, more than 70 percent--listen to this--more than 70 percent of \nfamily businesses don't make it to the second generation; 90 percent \ndon't survive to the third generation. That is unacceptable.\n  Tomorrow, Madam Speaker, marks an historic moment, the likes of which \nwe haven't seen in over 30 years, to change the current economic \ntrajectory of this country and restore freedom and opportunity for all \nhardworking American families. Let's seize it. Let's deliver on our \npromise, and let's give much-deserved relief to the American people and \na much-needed boost to the American economy.", "turn": 6, "speaker": "Mr. ARRINGTON", "itemno": 9}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "J000299", "text": "  Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana.

Madam Speaker, it has been more than 30 years since \nCongress passed meaningful tax reform. In those three decades, we have \nseen unbelievable progress in technology, communications, \nmanufacturing, and so much more. I am thrilled we now have a chance to \npass meaningful tax reform, an opportunity to finally move to a Tax \nCode that works for families, small businesses, and Americans across \nthe board.\n  We have a once-in-a-generation chance to bolster middle class \nprosperity, strengthen our economy, and help America's global \ncompetitiveness. These are not just abstract concepts. These are real \npeople, families, businesses, and workers.\n  Over this past year, I have traveled through the 35 counties that I \nrepresent, and I have been so impressed by the countless Kentuckians \nwho are working to bring jobs of the future into rural America. Unlike \nthese innovative entrepreneurs, our Tax Code is, unfortunately, stuck \nin the past.\n  Like many of my constituents in the First District, I run a family \nfarm and have experienced the challenges of dealing with an outdated \nand cumbersome Tax Code. know firsthand the difficulties small \nbusinesses face when they try to operate, grow, and hire more workers \nwhile battling a Tax Code that does not work for them. Passing tax \nreform is finally within reach, and I enthusiastically support swift \npassage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.\n\n  Throughout our Nation's history, small businesses have served as the \nbackbone of our communities. These companies provide high-quality jobs, \ncontribute to their local communities, and invest money right here at \nhome. That is why I am dedicated to enacting tax relief that allows \nAmerican small-business owners to keep more of their hard-earned tax \ndollars, to grow their businesses, and to compete globally.\n  This bill will create almost 13,000 new jobs in the Commonwealth of \nKentucky and will raise after-tax income for middle class families by \nalmost $2,000. More than 59,000 taxpayers in the First District itemize \ntheir taxes, and because of the near doubling of the standard deduction \nand other simplifications, many of our taxpayers will have much simpler \nreturns. And for our Nation, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act will generate \neconomic growth adequate to increase Federal tax receipts by $1 \ntrillion.\n  In the First District of Kentucky, there are nearly 44,000 taxpayers \nwho earn small business income. Under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, small-\nbusiness owners will benefit from the new lower 9 percent tax rate on \nthe first $75,000 of their business income for owners earning less than \n$150,000. Families and small businesses will have more opportunities to \nsucceed with this framework.\n\n\n  Additionally, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act reduces the number of \ndeductions and credits aimed at special interests and other well-\nconnected groups, which will create a simpler, more level playing field \nfor American taxpayers. Getting rid of these special privileges in the \nTax Code will ensure that all Americans, not just those who can afford \ntheir own tax preparers, get to keep more of their own money.\n  President Trump, my colleagues in Congress and I have promised to \ndeliver tax reform in a big way. I am proud to be keeping this promise \nnow. My constituents deserve a system that enables them to keep more of \ntheir hard-earned money and spend less of their time dealing with our \noverly complicated Tax Code.\n  I think it is important to address a concern that I have heard \nthroughout the tax reform debate, one that I take very seriously: our \nnational debt, which currently tops $20 trillion and is growing every \nday. The debt is a serious problem that poses an impediment to growth, \na burden on our future, and a threat to our national security.\n  While I am glad to finally hear bipartisan interest in addressing \nthis challenge and getting the deficit under control, I think it is \nclear that any solution must include reducing government spending, \nparticularly on mandatory programs that are the major drivers of our \ndebt. I look forward to continuing to work towards this goal.\n  The last time we addressed our Tax Code was when President Reagan was \nin office. Sticking with the Tax Code we have had for decades, one that \nleaves U.S. businesses and workers behind, is not an option. Now, I \nhave high hopes for the future with this tax reform framework.\n  I will continue fighting for reform that will benefit Kentuckians and \nour Nation as a whole, and I look forward to supporting progrowth \nsolutions that have proven to benefit our Nation and our citizens.", "turn": 8, "speaker": "Mr. COMER", "itemno": 11}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "J000299", "text": "  Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana.

Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Louisiana for \nyielding.\n  Madam Speaker, the last time this Nation passed major tax reform, \nyours truly weighed 112 pounds at the beginning of wrestling season. I \nhad a full head of hair, I never set foot west of Mississippi, nor \noutside the United States of America.\n  Madam Speaker, the last time this country addressed tax reform, the \nSoviet Union was welcoming a new leader\n\n\nnamed Mikhail Gorbachev. It has been too long.\n  It is an honor to represent the Fifth District of Virginia because I \nthink it is historically unique. I have spoken from this podium and \nthis floor about the amazing characteristics of that particular \nhistorical region.\n  Among the great individuals from the Fifth District of Virginia was a \nflawed man, an imperfect man, a slaveowner named Jefferson, who gave us \na near-perfect document, named the ``Declaration of Independence.''\n  While not perfect, Jefferson had perfect insight, and, perhaps, you \ncould argue he was prescient when it is said that he said: ``I predict \nfuture happiness for Americans if they can prevent the government from \nwasting the labors of the people under the pretense of taking care of \nthem.''\n  It has been enlightening tonight to stand on this floor. If you are \nwatching at home, I suppose that you can turn the volume down on C-\nSPAN, because I don't intend to yell, as so many others have before me. \nAnd I will tell you that it is funny to listen to my colleagues across \nthe aisle who say: This is a 429-page bill.\n  I would point out that saying the number of pages doesn't actually \nmake the bill longer and that the Affordable Care Act, that they had us \npass, so that we could find out what was in it, was 2,300 pages with \nover 20,000 pages of regulation. So there is a little disingenuity, at \nthe very least, for them to lament the first real overhaul in our \ndraconian tax structure in nearly two generations by suggesting that \n429 pages is a long document, when such a hearty and robust undertaking \nis afoot.\n  Madam Speaker, I would submit that the government needs the people \nand not the other way around. That is what makes us the United States \nof America.\n  It is a clever ploy to attack the rich and the job creators, but let \nme point out the fact that 97.3 percent of taxes are paid by the top 50 \npercent of wage earners. So, therefore, when you attempt to cut taxes \nfor working class people, someone who is in the 51st percentile will, \nindeed, receive a tax cut, but they are, by no means, rich.\n  It is a clever ploy to attack corporations, because corporations \ndon't have faces, but people do.\n  And who do corporations provide jobs for?\n  People.\n  President Obama acknowledged that our corporate tax structure was \namong the most backward in the world, and it needed to be addressed, \nbut he didn't address it. President Obama acknowledged that the \nAffordable Care Act had ``real problems,'' but no one on the other side \nof the aisle will address them. So, too, did President Clinton. That is \ntwo Presidents from the other side of the aisle in a row, but no one \nwill address them. Instead, we will create fear and demagoguery and \nattack faceless corporations, because faceless corporations don't have \nfaces, but people do.\n  We need to stop destroying jobs and opportunity and prosperity \nthrough the demagoguery of class warfare, attacking corporations, \nwithout acknowledging that the very people who benefit from their \nexistence are the people who have the opportunity to send their \nchildren to college, to make memories on a vacation, to pursue and \nachieve dreams, to marry the love of their life with the very incomes \nachieved by these corporations.\n\n  Now, let's talk a little bit about corporations, because I know \nsomething about corporations, and we know something about corporations \nin Virginia's Fifth District.\n  Dan River Mills stood in Danville, Virginia--a company started in \n1881. It closed its doors in 2006. In 2008, the smokestacks from Dan \nRiver Mills that had been a symbol not only of the skyline of that once \nthriving town, but also an identifying factor in the landscape of the \ncity, were torn down as jobs went away.\n  Another corporation, Burlington Industries, Klopman Mills, in \nPittsylvania County, hurt Virginia, and prospered from 1940 through \n2007. When they left, over 1,000 jobs went with them as well. And the \nreal estate for the property that once employed generation after \ngeneration, sending innumerable children to college, and fulfilling the \nhumble dreams of working class Virginians, sold for a paltry $750,000.\n  Vaughan-Bassett Furniture--and I would commend to anyone watching at \nhome, the book ``Factory Man,'' by Beth Macy, which chronicles John \nBassett, III's struggle to keep 700 furniture jobs in this country, in \nmy district--that corporation changed people's lives and gave them \njobs.\n  Lane Manufacturing, for generations it was a tradition--in my part of \nthe world, at least--that a young woman, prior to being married, might \nreceive a Lane cedar chest--a hope chest. In fact, no less an \niconoclast than Shirley Temple was used to peddle Lane cedar chests as \nsomething that would be an aspirational goal for a young, working class \nwoman, as she set forth on pursuing the dreams of her life. From 1902, \nuntil just about 15 or 20 years ago, hundreds and hundreds of jobs, in \nAlta Vista, Campbell County, Virginia, left.\n  Broyhill. So many companies--some still around--all shadows of their \nformer selves, as corporate money and jobs went offshore.\n  And why?\n  Because we have incentivized the departure of the very means by which \nour families have prospered and done so in order to vilify an entity \nincapable of defending itself, while neglecting to understand that the \nbeneficiaries of the opportunity created thereby were their very \nneighbors and those who, in their demagoguery, they said they worked to \nprotect.\n  Last year, in Danville, Virginia, the Goodyear Tire and Rubber \nCompany, who is still there--God bless them--had a cookout for the \nemployees of Goodyear Tire, and the family members, thereof, and \nanybody who had ever worked for Goodyear Tire. They thought maybe there \nwould be 800 or 1,000 people who attended this cookout. By the time it \nwas over with, you couldn't get a pack of hotdog buns from a Food Lion \nwithin 30 miles, because that 1,000 people became 2,000 people, and \nbecame 3,000 people, and became nearly 4,000 people. These people \ndidn't come to eat a hotdog with Goodyear Tire. They came to eat a \nhotdog with their family, their friends, and their community.\n  I stood last week at Piedmont Precision Machine Company, in Danville \nPittsylvania. I looked at $1.6 million worth of new equipment that \nallowed this American small business to continue to compete with \ncompetitors abroad. And the rich man, who owned the company, said: Tom, \nI am going to have to take a loan to pay my taxes. But if you pass this \nbill, we will make some money, I will get more equipment, and we are \ngoing to hire some more people.\n  So understand that people don't come to eat hot dogs with Goodyear \nTire and Rubber Company, they come to eat hot dogs with their family \nmembers, their community, and people who have seen generation after \ngeneration receive opportunity, by virtue of their hard work, and \nopportunity provided by the very entities vilified by our opponents, \nwithout acknowledging the beneficiaries of the opportunity they provide \nare the very ones they purport to protect.\n  So Piedmont Precision Machine Company toils on. We work to attract \nmore employers in Danville and Pittsylvania, and Henry County, and \nMartinsville area. Maybe Kyocera is going to come. We hope so. We think \nthat if we get those jobs, we think that we might be able to move \nmanufacturing jobs in high-tech to southside Virginia from Northern \nVirginia and California. But what I am hearing from the job creators is \nthey want to see this thing get done. And when those jobs come from \nCalifornia, Northern Virginia, China, and India to Campbell County, \nBedford County, Lunenburg County, and Mecklenburg County, it will be \nbecause we acted in a brave, bold manner, despite the divisive rhetoric \nthat denies the reality that people benefit from opportunity, and \nopportunity is best provided, not by the government, but by people of \ninitiative.\n  Now, I have heard so much rhetoric about what you oppose if you \nsupport this tax bill, so let's see if we can't flip that shoe onto the \nother foot. If you oppose this bill, you oppose lowering rates for \nworking and middle-income families, while retaining the highest rate. \nThat doesn't sound like a tax cut for the rich to me.\n\n  If you oppose this bill, you literally oppose doubling nearly the \nstandard\n\n\ndeduction from $6,350 to $12,000 for an individual filer; and you \noppose, if you oppose this bill, doubling the standard deduction from \n$12,700 to $24,000 for a married couple.\n  Why would people oppose that? Do they think the government can make \nbetter decisions with the money they earn than they can?\n  If you oppose this bill, then you oppose simplifying the Tax Code by \neliminating years of carve-out deductions made for special interests.\n  Quite literally, a convoluted Tax Code benefits who?\n  Tax attorneys and accountants.\n  I suppose that the other side of the Chamber is the party that has a \nvested interest in keeping tax attorneys and accountants at work. I \nwant to see people in Mecklenburg County at work.\n  If you oppose this bill, you oppose establishing a family tax credit; \nyou oppose raising the child credit by $600 per child; and you oppose \nestablishing a new credit of $300 per family member so that you might \nbe able to help your mom, dad, aunt, uncle, or a disabled relative, who \nyou choose to help in your home.\n  Why would people oppose that?\n  If you oppose this bill, you oppose reducing small business taxes to \nthe lowest rate since the Second World War.\n  If you oppose this bill, you oppose establishing a super low \nnonpercent rate for small startup businesses making less than $75,000 a \nyear in income.\n  Why would you oppose startups?\n  If you oppose this bill, you oppose removing incentives that drive \nbusinesses to take money and jobs overseas. Don't talk to me about \nthat. We know something about that in Virginia's Fifth.\n  So, finally, let me submit this: for the folks at home, who are smart \nenough to figure this out on their own, if you pay $100 more because a \ndeduction is eliminated and your taxes are cut by $1,000 or more, as \nwould be the case for a family of four making $58,000 a year, that is \nnot a tax increase.\n\n\n  I have never, to my knowledge, other than the United States Army, \nworked for anything resembling a corporate entity in my life, but I \nknow a lot of human beings who have, and I have seen what happens when \nwe, through our divisive rhetoric, drive them away.\n  This isn't about corporations. This isn't about the rich. This is \nabout human beings.\n  I think it was succinctly summarized, if perhaps by accident, by my \ncolleague in the other Chamber, Senator Schumer, who said:\n\n       It is our research that indicates that if you pass this, \n     some people's taxes might go up by 2023.\n\n  Think hard. What that acknowledges is that between now and then, \npeople's taxes go down.\n  While Mr. Jefferson also said that:\n\n       The fruits of the working class are safest when the \n     assembly is not in session.\n\n  I would submit that if indeed these problems exist, they should work \nwith us to improve our Tax Code, which hasn't been touched since I \nliterally weighed 112 pounds and had a full head of hair, and to start \nbeing part of the solution and stop being part of the problem.\n  Again, the government depends upon Americans, not Americans upon the \ngovernment.", "turn": 10, "speaker": "Mr. GARRETT", "itemno": 13}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "J000299", "text": "  Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana.

When we pass this bill and we get this \nto the President's desk, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act will lead to the \ncreation of an additional 975,000 new full-time jobs across this \ncountry.\n  It will raise after-tax income for middle class families by $2,598 \neach. That is an increase of 4.4 percent. That is real money to \nfamilies who are struggling to make ends meet around this country.\n  It will generate economic growth sufficient to increase Federal tax \nreceipts by $1 trillion. That is real money. That is a real boost to \nthe American economy.\n  I brought another graphic here to show what this will mean in my \ndistrict, by way of example, in Louisiana. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act \nwill mean a whole lot for my State.\n  It will lead to the creation of an additional 13,293 jobs in my State \nof Louisiana alone. Those are good-paying, full-time jobs. It will \nraise after-tax income for middle class families in Louisiana by \n$1,857. That is real money. That will mean a lot to the families in my \nState.\n  More specifically, let me talk about the Fourth Congressional \nDistrict in northwest and west Louisiana, 15 parishes, about one-third \nof our State by land area; good, hardworking, God-fearing Americans. \nLet me tell you what it will mean to the people of Louisiana's Fourth \nCongressional District.\n  Here are just four highlights. It will be a larger child tax credit. \nIn my district, there are 53,918 taxpayers who claim the child tax \ncredit every year. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act will increase the child \ntax credit from $1,000 per child to $1,600 per child for each of those \nfamilies.\n  Let me give you another one: the tax relief for small businesses. \nThis is a big thing in my district. 49,929 taxpayers in the Fourth \nCongressional District of Louisiana have small business income, and \nthat is a business that a taxpayer operates. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act \nreduces taxes for small-business owners.\n  First, the bill implements a new, lower 9 percent tax rate on the \nfirst $75,000 of net business income for active small-business owners \nearning less than $150,000 through their businesses. That is a whole \nlot of people, a whole lot of LLCs and small companies in my district.\n  Second, the bill lowers taxes on small business investment by \ncreating a new 25 percent small business tax rate. That is capped at 25 \npercent. That is a big deal to people who are struggling to make ends \nmeet.\n  Number three, a third feature, the elimination of the alternative \nminimum tax, the AMT. 4,049 taxpayers in the Fourth Congressional \nDistrict of Louisiana are impacted directly by the AMT. The Tax Cuts \nand Jobs Act eliminates that factor.\n  Another one is simpler taxes. Listen to this number: 67,543 taxpayers \nin the Fourth Congressional District, in my district back home in \nLouisiana, itemize their taxes.\n  As a result of the near doubling of the standard deduction and other \nsimplifications, many taxpayers will have much simpler returns. It is \nestimated, as we have said so many times tonight, that nine out of ten \nAmericans will be able to file their taxes on a form the size of a \npostcard. That is a big change and a great simplification for the \npeople of my district. We owe this to them.\n  I wanted to share a few other facts that I think are important to \nhighlight tonight, Mr. Speaker.\n  The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is more than just a win for our American \neconomy. It is a win for our American values. Let me give you a couple \nexamples of that.\n  First, it is a win for free speech. The bill incorporates the \nlanguage of our Free Speech and Fairness Act, which we filed as a \nstandalone piece of legislation earlier this year in February. That \nwill stop the IRS from policing the speech of churches and charitable \norganizations. That is a huge relief for men and women of faith, in \nparticular, who watched the IRS breathe down the necks of nonprofits \nand religious entities, threatening to take away their tax-exempt \nstatus if they dare talk\n\n\nabout the moral and social and political issues of the day. That is a \nbig win for free speech and a big win for them.\n\n  This bill is also a big win for American families. Let me give you a \nfew examples of important features of how this helps the family in this \ncountry. The adoption tax credit has been restored. This is section \n1102 of the bill. Now, this is a critically important thing to advance \nthe policy, to advance and encourage and incentivize adoption in this \ncountry. This is something that all of us should agree on.\n  Over 60 percent of adopted children are adopted by middle- and low-\nincome taxpayers in this country. Almost half of the children adopted \nfrom foster care live in families with household incomes at or below \n200 percent of the Federal poverty level.\n  Listen to this statistic: a study reported by the Federal Children's \nBureau showed that the government saves between $65,000 and $127,000 \nfor each child who is adopted rather than placed in long-term foster \ncare.\n  Studies comparing children who remain in foster care to children who \nare adopted show that adopted children are 54 percent less likely to be \ndelinquent or arrested, 19 percent less likely to become teen parents, \nand 76 percent more likely to be employed.\n  Can we all agree that the adoption tax credit being restored is an \nimportant part of this bill?\n  I think we can.\n  Here is another way it helps families, Mr. Speaker: the family tax \ncredits. This is something that everybody back home should pay \nattention to. The child tax credit, section 1202 of the bill, this \nincreases the child tax credit, as I mentioned a moment ago, from \n$1,000 per child to $1,600 per child. It provides a credit of $300 for \neach parent and nonchild dependent to help all families with their \neveryday expenses.\n  The child dependent care tax credit helps families care for their \nchildren and other dependents, such as a disabled grandparent who may \nneed additional support.\n  Here is another feature: unborn children are recognized in the 529 \neducation savings account provisions of the Tax Code. Our tax reform \nbill allows a 529 education savings account to be opened, for the first \ntime, for an unborn child or a child in utero. We recognize the \nhumanity and the sanctity of life of the unborn child.\n  Here is another feature: the marriage penalties are finally removed. \nFor too long, we have effectively penalized married couples in this \ncountry simply for being married. Our Tax Cuts and Jobs Act changes \nthat. In most cases, married couples will no longer be penalized just \nfor their choice to be married.\n  Mr. Speaker, I will close with just a few more remarks. A lot has \nbeen said here tonight, more will be said in the morning preceding our \nvote, but this is a big day for Congress and a big day for the country.\n  It has been over 30 years since we last updated our tax system. For \nreference, I was in the eighth grade the last time tax reform was \naccomplished in this Chamber. Many of those entering the workforce \nweren't even born yet the last time Congress fulfilled this \nresponsibility.\n  Today, Americans are struggling to make ends meet, to find decent-\npaying jobs, and to prepare for retirement.\n  We must do right by our children and our grandchildren and give them \na better future than our own. Fortunately, my Republican colleagues and \nI have put forth a framework to do just that.\n  We have discussed for the last few hours in this Chamber as we have \nbeen talking that our plan will create more jobs, fairer taxes, and \nbigger paychecks for working class Americans and small businesses.\n  When businessowners are able to keep more of their profits, they will \ninvest that money in their companies and in their employees, and that \nwill spur economic growth, because they will expand their facilities, \nthey will create and expand new product lines, they will add more jobs, \nand that is good for all of us.\n  Passing meaningful tax reform isn't about sticker shock talking \npoints that we have heard so much about. It is about real everyday \nAmericans who want to grow their businesses, offer better wages to \ntheir employees, provide for their families, but who have struggled to \ndo so because of our oppressive and outdated tax policy.\n  Our plan puts Americans first and it offers real relief to those who \nneed it most.\n  The Federal Tax Code today is more than 70,000 pages long. For \ncontext, that is more than 60 times longer than the King James Bible, \nand it contains none of the Good News.\n  It is time to simplify this Code and it is time to unleash the free \nmarket in our American economy again. We have that chance. This will be \nthe biggest Christmas gift to the American people in over 3 decades. It \nis truly historic and it is long overdue.\n  Mr. Speaker, we urge our colleagues on both sides of the aisle to \nvote for the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act on this floor tomorrow. Let's make \nhistory together. Let's do right by the American people.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n", "turn": 11, "speaker": "Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana", "itemno": 14}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 15}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "187", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H9361-H9365", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "15", "month": "November"}, "related_bills": [{"type": "HR", "context": "OTHER", "congress": "115", "number": "1"}], "doc_title": "HISTORIC TAX REFORM FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE", "id": "CREC-2017-11-15-pt1-PgH9361"}
