Mr. Speaker, I will vote against the conference \nreport to accompany H.R. 2810, the National Defense Authorization Act \n(NDAA) for Fiscal Year 2018 (Roll no. 631). This bill is far from \nfiscally responsible.\n  We've yet to reach a bipartisan budget agreement, thus, this NDAA's \nbase budget authority is $77.4 billion above the cap set in the Budget \nControl Act. The GOP has demonstrated no concern for what this \ncontinued policy of budget-busting will do to our country's deficit. It \nwill inhibit our ability to respond to future threats and will hollow \nout benefits for military personnel and veterans.\n  Of deep concern to me is the bill's full funding of nuclear weapons \nmodernization and maintenance programs. The Congressional Budget Office \nreleased a report just last month highlighting that the true cost of \nthese programs over the next 30 years will be $1.2 trillion dollars. \nThat's more than 20 percent higher than earlier estimates. This bill \nfails to make the tough decisions it needs to about our defense \nspending.\n  The legislation does take several steps in the right direction. It \nexpresses a sense of Congress that climate change is a direct threat to \nnational security, raises military pay by 2.4 percent and includes \nmeasures to counter Russian aggression. The bill also authorizes 3,500 \nvisas to the Afghan Special Immigrant Visa (SIV) program--a program I \nworked to establish to help our Afghan allies seek refuge in the United \nStates after they become the target of threats because of their \nassistance to U.S. personnel.\n  However, the fiscal reality of enacting this legislation is deeply \ntroubling. On balance, the costs of this bill outweigh its benefits and \nI cannot support it.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. BLUMENAUER", "itemno": 4}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 5}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "187", "extension": true, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "E1569", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "15", "month": "November"}, "related_bills": [{"type": "HR", "context": "TITLE", "congress": "115", "number": "2810"}, {"type": "HR", "context": "OTHER", "congress": "115", "number": "2810"}], "doc_title": "CONFERENCE REPORT ON H.R. 2810, NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2018", "id": "CREC-2017-11-15-pt1-PgE1569-4"}
