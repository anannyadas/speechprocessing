FDA shares your goal of \n     protecting our Nation's military service men and women by \n     advancing safe and effective medical products, strengthening \n     our partnerships with the DoD on behalf of our Nation's \n     warfighters, and ensuring that this critical work is \n     prioritized by the Agency.\n       Our Nation's troops face unique risks on the battlefield, \n     and my colleagues and I at the Agency are committed to \n     implementing a lasting framework that not only considers \n     these unique risks, but prioritizes the warfighters' needs by \n     expediting the development and review of medical \n     countermeasures needed in the face of emerging threats. The \n     bipartisan bill that will be considered alongside the \n     National Defense Authorization Act of 2018 would codify these \n     commitments to ensure that the warfighters' needs for safe \n     and effective medical countermeasures are met on a priority \n     basis and in strong partnerships with DoD.\n       For instance, I believe this new authority and enhanced \n     collaborations with DoD will help enable FDA to approve \n     freeze dried plasma as soon as 2018, addressing a key medical \n     priority. Further, it will put in place a permanent process \n     for strong engagement between FDA and DoD on any future \n     medical products DoD determines are necessary to address \n     military emergencies. Additionally, under these provisions, \n     FDA would be able to recognize military threats in advance \n     and provide an emergency use authorization for a fuller range \n     of medical products that could help save lives on the \n     battlefield.\n       Thank you again for your dedication to our Nation's service \n     members and for working with FDA on this meaningful framework \n     to better serve and protect our warfighters. Please be \n     assured that I am personally committed to this effort. I will \n     make it one of my highest priorities as Commissioner to \n     rapidly implement the framework that is called for under this \n     legislation and work with my colleagues at FDA and DoD to \n     create an enduring pathway for the efficient development and \n     prioritization of products intended to help save the lives of \n     military personnel on the battlefield.

Mr. Speaker, our men and women in uniform have put their \nlives on the line for this country, and they deserve to have the \nearliest possible access to medical products that could save their \nlives on the battlefield.\n  H.R. 4374 will establish important new authorities for the Food and \nDrug Administration, the FDA, and the Department of Defense, DOD, to \nensure that our warfighters have the benefits of new treatments and new \ndevices.\n  Mr. Speaker, currently the FDA has the authority to authorize the \nemergency use of an unapproved medical product for a specific set of \nmilitary emergencies. They have that authority. This emergency use \nauthority requires two things, though. First, the Secretary of Defense \nmust make a determination that there is a risk of attack on military \nforces with a chemical, biological, radiological, or nuclear agent. \nNext, the Secretary of Health and Human Services must make a \ndeclaration that there is, in fact, an emergency or threat justifying \nthe emergency use authorization of a product.\n  To ensure there are no unnecessary delays in this process, this \nlegislation, H.R. 4374, establishes a deadline for the Secretary of \nHealth and Human Services. Once the Secretary of Defense\n\n\nmakes a declaration of an imminent risk of attack, the Secretary of \nHealth and Human Services has 45 days--that is the maximum--to make a \ndeclaration that such a risk exists.\n  Limiting the threat under which an emergency use can be authorized to \nchemical, biological, radiological, or nuclear agents, frankly, has \nbeen too narrow to incorporate all the serious threats of harm to our \ntroops.\n  To address this problem, H.R. 4374 establishes a new category under \nwhich the emergency use authorization process can be triggered. H.R. \n4374 expands this authority to include situations where the Secretary \nof Defense makes a determination that there is risk of attack with any \nagent that may cause an imminently life-threatening and specific risk \nto the United States military forces.\n  In addition to creating new pathways for emergency access to \nunapproved medical devices, H.R. 4374 also creates a new breakthrough \ndesignation to expedite actual FDA approval of medical products for \nmilitary emergencies.\n  Currently, the breakthrough pathway exists only for products intended \nto treat serious, life-threatening conditions where the Secretary \ndetermines such a product may demonstrate significant improvement over \nexisting therapies.\n\n\n  Mr. Speaker, this expedited approval is based on the successful \nbreakthrough designation created by Congress back in 2012. This has \nworked. It has accelerated oncology drug reviews by more than 2 years.\n  Now, in short, H.R. 4374 addresses the critical issue of military \naccess to the newest available products by expanding the circumstances \nunder which emergency use authorizations can be issued and by \nestablishing an expedited pathway to full approval of products that the \nSecretary of Defense requests.\n  Mr. Speaker, policies in this bill are bipartisan. They were \ndeveloped with the input from the administration as well as the \nauthorizing committees in the House and the Senate. Additionally, CBO \nhas indicated that H.R. 4374 will have no impact on direct spending or \nrevenue. So, Mr. Speaker, this is not only a good bill, it is an \nimportant bill for our men and women in uniform, and I urge my \ncolleagues to support H.R. 4374.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.", "turn": 5, "speaker": "Mr. WALDEN", "itemno": 12}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "P000034", "text": "  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, today we are considering legislation that would \nauthorize additional emergency uses for medical products in response to \nthe needs of the Department of Defense in the instance of a military \nemergency.\n  Like all of my colleagues, I want to ensure that our military \npersonnel who put their life in harm's way for our freedom have access \nto the medical products that they need, and I have supported and will \ncontinue to support policies that further the goal of protecting our \ntroops from life-threatening risks.\n  However, these policies also have to be balanced to ensure that, in \nour effort to protect troops from harm, we are not inadvertently \nexposing them to additional risk from unproven products. That is why I \nwas disappointed to learn that the National Defense Authorization Act \nconference report included a policy supported by the Senate that would \nhave given the Secretary of Defense authority to authorize emergency \naccess to unapproved medical products, an authority that solely rests \nwithin the Food and Drug Administration today.\n  This provision was not the subject of hearing and debate, did not \nreceive the congressional oversight it should have, and I believe \ndecisions of such consequence should go through regular order, \nproviding Members and stakeholders with the opportunity to learn fully \nof the risks and benefits associated with transferring regulatory \noversight of medical products to an agency that is not equipped with \nthe expertise and medical product knowledge of the FDA.\n  While I am not pleased with the process and how it has unfolded, I do \nsupport H.R. 4374 because I believe it will maintain emergency use \nauthority with the agency that has the resources and scientific \nexpertise needed to make decisions about access to unproven medical \nproducts. It is solely the FDA that has been charged with weighing the \nrisks and benefits of medical products and making determinations as to \ntheir safety and effectiveness, and this legislation maintains the \nFDA's important role in that process.\n  Mr. Speaker, H.R. 4374 not only addresses the Department of Defense's \nconcerns about access to medical products in instances of military \nemergencies, but it also goes further by providing them with additional \nsupport, in this instance, to expedite the development and review of \nmedical products that are of priority to the Department. It also \ncommits FDA to regularly meeting with the Department of Defense to \ndiscuss their priorities and product pipelines.\n  So I just want to thank FDA Commissioner Gottlieb, Chairman Walden, \nSenate Health Committee Chairman Alexander, and Ranking Member Murray \nfor working to find a compromise that will maintain proper regulatory \noversight over emergency uses of unproved medical products, while also \nensuring that our Nation's military has access to the products that \nthey need in a military emergency situation.\n  I do urge my colleagues to vote in support of this legislation, and I \nreserve the balance of my time.", "turn": 6, "speaker": "Mr. PALLONE", "itemno": 13}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "W000791", "text": "  Mr. WALDEN.

Our servicemembers going into harm's way must be \nconfident that their corpsmen, medics, docs, and health professionals \nare equipped with the latest technology to save lives every time.\n  Freeze-dried plasma is used during the initial resuscitation of \ncombat casualties. Since 2011, 24 severely injured U.S. troops have \nbeen treated with freeze-dried plasma provided by the French, who have \nused this successfully since 1994. Of those patients, 17 lives were \nsaved due to rapid treatment with freeze-dried plasma.\n  H.R. 4374 is important because it puts a process in place to broaden \nthe definition of military emergencies and provides the Department of \nDefense with access to expedited FDA processes for the investigational \nproducts like freeze-dried plasma.\n  I support Chairman Thornberry's unwavering leadership on this issue. \nWith rapidly developing medical technology, the FDA must be part of the \nmodernization and readiness of our Armed Forces. We are committed to \nensuring that the FDA does the best it can for our deployed forces, and \nI hope that we can find a way to enable the FDA to consider approved \nresearch and clinical studies from our allies in an effort to aid their \napproval process.\n  The future will likely bring more medical devices and drugs that can \nsave lives. Having a process to approve and implement emerging medical \ntechnologies is a matter of life and death, especially for our brave \ntroops.", "turn": 17, "speaker": "Mr. WENSTRUP", "itemno": 24}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "P000034", "text": "  Mr. PALLONE.

Mr. Speaker, you have heard from my colleagues the \nimportance of this legislation.

What matters \nmost to Americans is that we take care of our warriors on the field \nwhen they are injured, and when they are in harm's way that we are \ndoing the best possible thing we can for them.\n  Mr. Speaker, I think this is important legislation.
