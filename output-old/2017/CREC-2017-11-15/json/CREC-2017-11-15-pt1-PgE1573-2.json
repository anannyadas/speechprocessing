Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor \nAmanda Grady Sexton, the Director of Public Affairs for the New \nHampshire Coalition Against Domestic and Sexual Violence, for receiving \nthe 2017 Sandra Matheson Award for Exemplary Commitment to Victims of \nCrime.\n  Amanda is incredibly deserving of this recognition; having worked \ntirelessly at the New Hampshire Coalition for 15 years to ensure \nprotections for survivors of sexual assault in the Granite State. She \nled the effort in the state legislature to pass legislation that \nstrengthens New Hampshire's Rape Shield Law and established critical \nprotections for survivors of sexual violence. She has also supported \nother initiatives to extend the statute of limitations in cases of \nchild sexual abuse and criminalized acts of human trafficking and \ndomestic violence in state law.\n  Though Amanda's voice is essential in New Hampshire, her advocacy \nextends beyond the Granite State. She regularly advises me and other \nmembers of the New Hampshire Congressional Delegation, and assisted \nCongress with the reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act and \nthe passage of the Sexual Assault Survivors' Rights Act.\n  Through her incredible work, Amanda has given hope and a voice to \ncountless victims of crime in New Hampshire and nationwide, and has \nhelped reduce the stigma associated with sexual assault.\n  On behalf of New Hampshire's Second Congressional District and all \nthose who have benefitted from Amanda's work, I thank her for \neverything she has done and will continue to do for our state, and \ncongratulate her on this well-deserved recognition. I look forward to \nour continued work together to make New Hampshire be an even better \nplace to live, work, and raise a family.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Ms. KUSTER of New Hampshire", "itemno": 4}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 5}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "187", "extension": true, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "E1573", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "15", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "IN RECOGNITION OF AMANDA GRADY SEXTON FOR BEING AWARDED THE 2017 SANDRA MATHESON AWARD FOR EXEMPLARY COMMITMENT TO VICTIMS OF CRIME", "id": "CREC-2017-11-15-pt1-PgE1573-2", "title": null}
