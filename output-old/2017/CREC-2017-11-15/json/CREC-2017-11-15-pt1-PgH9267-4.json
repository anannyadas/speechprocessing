Mr. Speaker, I am honored to be here today to \nrecognize three National Blue Ribbon schools in my district.\n  Each year, the Department of Education recognizes some of the top \nschools from across the United States. The Blue Ribbon award is a \nremarkable achievement that recognizes the outstanding work done by \nexceptional educators and the hard work of dedicated students.\n  I would like to congratulate Hamlin Elementary School; Brewster \nElementary School; and my own alma mater, Rochester Adams High School, \nfor being recognized as being some of the best educational institutions \nthere are.\n  I know this personally, as two of my children attend Rochester Adams \nHigh School. From my experience with these schools, what sets them \napart is the teachers don't wait to generate enthusiasm for learning. \nEach and every student is empowered to do things for themselves, to \ntake on challenges, to push their minds, and to think of things in \ndifferent ways.\n  All of these schools are exceptional and are filled with the love of \nlearning and are devoted to preparing students for all stages of life. \nAll three schools serve the Rochester community and my hometown of \nRochester.\n  Mr. Speaker, congratulations again to all these outstanding schools. \nTheir selfless devotion to their students is something for which we all \ncan take to heart. Our children are our future, and these Blue Ribbon \nschools are committed to making it a bright one.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. BISHOP of Michigan", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "187", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H9267", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "15", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "RECOGNIZING THREE NATIONAL BLUE RIBBON SCHOOLS IN MICHIGAN", "id": "CREC-2017-11-15-pt1-PgH9267-4", "title": "RECOGNIZING THREE NATIONAL BLUE RIBBON SCHOOLS IN MICHIGAN"}
