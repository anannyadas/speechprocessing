Mr. Speaker, just calling this tax bill a middle class \ntax bill does not make it so. You actually have to read the bill. And \nif you do, you will find that the vast majority of the benefit goes to \nthe people at the very top: the wealthiest Americans, multinational \ncorporations. They are the beneficiaries of this Republican tax scam.\n  Saying it benefits the middle class does not make it so, and, in \nfact, many in the middle class, tens of millions of people in the \nmiddle class, will pay more taxes so that we can do what? Give huge tax \nbreaks to the people at the very top.\n  And how do they pay for that? They borrow money.\n  All these deficit hawks, all these people over here who have said \nover and over again that it is immoral to pass debt on to our children \nand grandchildren will walk to the floor of this House and they will \nvote to send $1.5 trillion in debt to their kids and grandkids to give \ncorporations and the wealthiest Americans a tax break.\n  It is immoral. It is immoral.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. KILDEE", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "187", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H9266", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "15", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "REPUBLICAN TAX SCAM", "id": "CREC-2017-11-15-pt1-PgH9266", "title": "REPUBLICAN TAX SCAM"}
