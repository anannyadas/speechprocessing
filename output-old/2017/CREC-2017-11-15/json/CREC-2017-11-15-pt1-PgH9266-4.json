Mr. Speaker, for 110 years, the Lower Yellowstone \nIntake Project has provided a dependable supply of water to over 58,000 \nacres of family farms in Montana and North Dakota. It has created over \n10,000 acres of wildlife habitat.\n  To protect the endangered pallid sturgeon, Congress funded a bypass \nchannel and weir improvement so that the fish could circumvent the \ndiversion that had been there for 110 years. The proposed construction \nwould also protect regional groundwater, the environment, and \nagricultural communities.\n  Unfortunately, a U.S. district judge blocked the project this summer \nbecause, as he claims, it does nothing for the sturgeon. His ruling to \nhalt construction does nothing to help the sturgeon. His ruling does \nnothing to help the communities that rely on the project's irrigation \nwater.\n  I urge the Army Corps of Engineers to move forward with the work on \nthe Lower Yellowstone Intake Project. The completion of this project is \nurgent to protect species' habitats and agricultural activities in \nMontana.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. GIANFORTE", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "187", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H9266", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "15", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "CONSTRUCTION TO LOWER YELLOWSTONE INTAKE PROJECT MUST BE COMPLETED", "id": "CREC-2017-11-15-pt1-PgH9266-4", "title": "CONSTRUCTION TO LOWER YELLOWSTONE INTAKE PROJECT MUST BE COMPLETED"}
