Mr. Speaker, while House Democrats continue to focus on \nbetter jobs, better wages, and a better future for the American people, \nHouse Republicans have put forward a phony, fraudulent, and fake tax \nreform plan.\n  The Republican tax scam will raise taxes on 36 million middle class \nfamilies, undermine Medicare, and explode the deficit. It will saddle \nour children and grandchildren with more than $1 trillion in additional \ndebt simply to pay for massive tax cuts for millionaires, for \nbillionaires, for special interest corporations, and for the privileged \nfew.\n  It is all being done simply to subsidize the lifestyles of the rich \nand shameless.
