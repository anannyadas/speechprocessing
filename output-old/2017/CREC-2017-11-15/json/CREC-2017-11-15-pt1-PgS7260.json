Mr. President, today I wish to honor a great \nOhioan, Dave Dilly.\n  Dave is here in Washington this week to fight for the pensions he and \nthousands of Ohioans earned over a lifetime of hard work. You may have \neven seen him and his union brothers and sisters donning the camouflage \nt-shirts that have become the trademark of their cause. Dave is a \nmember of the United Mine Workers of America. He has served as the \npresident of his own UMWA Local 1188 in Coshocton County and for \nseveral years has represented his fellow miners from all over our State \nand Nation to lobby for permanent healthcare and retirement security \nfor our miners.\n  That is how I came to know Dave well, through his many trips here to \nstand up for these workers. This May, the Senate passed a bill to \nfinally give our miners permanent healthcare. No doubt, Dave and his \nfellow miners were responsible for that victory. If we have the same \nsuccess this year in securing their pensions, we will owe it once again \nto Dave and hundreds of workers from around the country.\n  Dave's service on behalf of our miners would be enough to earn him \nall of our respect and gratitude, but that is not why I rise to honor \nhim today. His UMWA shirt is not the first time he has worn camo \nattire. Like many of our miners, Dave is also a veteran. This past \nweekend, Dave was inducted into the Ohio Veterans Hall of Fame.\n  If you know Dave, it comes as no surprise to learn that service runs \ndeep in his family. It is just who they are. Dave had four older \nbrothers who served in the Korean war and inspired him to serve.\n  Dave signed up for the Air Force, where he was a weapons mechanic and \nsystems specialist from 1965 to 1968. He served in Thailand and South \nVietnam. For part of Dave's service, he was in Da Nang, known as Rocket \nCity, for the number of times it was attacked during the war.\n  Dave received many military honors and carried on his service by \nworking on behalf of his fellow veterans in so many ways. He served as \na veterans service officer for Coshocton County. He is active in local \nveterans organizations, including the Veterans of Foreign Wars and the \nDisabled American Veterans.\n  Every Memorial Day since 2000, Dave has helped lay flags on the \ngraves of veterans. Right now, he is the vice president of the \nCoshocton County Veterans Service Commission. Dave has helped organize \nand chaperone Honor Flight trips to Washington, DC, so other veterans \ncan see the memorials built in their honor.\n  There seems to be no limit to what Dave will do for his fellow \nveterans, fellow workers, and fellow Ohioans.\n  Dave, thank you for your service to our country, to your fellow \nveterans, and to our State. So many of us are proud of you and honored \nto call you a friend. Congratulations, Dave, on your induction to the \nOhio Veterans Hall of Fame.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. BROWN", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 3}], "header": {"chamber": "Senate", "num": "187", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "S7260", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "15", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS", "id": "CREC-2017-11-15-pt1-PgS7260", "title": "ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS"}
