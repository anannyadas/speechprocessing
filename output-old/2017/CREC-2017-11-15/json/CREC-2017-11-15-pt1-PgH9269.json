Mr. Speaker, I want to share with you a letter that was \nreceived in the Rules Committee last night.\n  It is a letter actually addressed to Chairman Kevin Brady of the Ways \nand Means Committee. It is from the Joint Committee on Taxation. It is \na long letter. I will not read all of it. Some of it is difficult to \nunderstand, but let me pick out the important points.\n  In each case, the taxpayers' total income tax liability is lower. \nHere is their concluding paragraph:\n\n       In its totality, the combined effect of the tax rate and \n     the income threshold and amendments made by the bill, along \n     with the increase in the standard deduction, would not, in \n     and of themselves, result in an increase in the amount of tax \n     imposed on virtually any filer as a result of these changes.\n\n  Translation: no one's taxes go up; not 36 million; not 3,600; not 36. \nAccording to the Joint Committee on Taxation, that number is zero, Mr. \nSpeaker.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. BURGESS", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "187", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H9269", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "15", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "INDIVIDUAL TAXES WILL NOT GO UP", "id": "CREC-2017-11-15-pt1-PgH9269", "title": "INDIVIDUAL TAXES WILL NOT GO UP"}
