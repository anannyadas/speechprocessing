Mr. President, this month, I am proud to recognize \nLinda Saunders Paquette, of Contoocook, as our Granite Stater of the \nMonth in recognition of her years of leadership and steadfast \ncommitment to combating the fentanyl, heroin, and opioid crisis in New \nHampshire, which remains our most pressing public health challenge and \nthreatens the health and safety of our fellow Granite Staters.\n  Through her decades of service to the people of New Hampshire, \nincluding at the New Hampshire Department of Health and Human Services \nand starting in 2010 as executive director of New Futures--a \nnonpartisan, nonprofit organization advocating, educating, and \ncollaborating in the fight against substance misuse--Linda has made an \nenormous difference in the lives of countless people and families \naffected by this crisis.\n  During my time as Governor and now as Senator, Linda has been a \ntremendous partner and relentless advocate. Thanks in part to Linda's \nadvocacy, we were able to increase funding for critical prevention, \ntreatment, and recovery services in New Hampshire, extend substance use \ndisorder coverage to the Medicaid Program, and pass and reauthorize \nMedicaid expansion--providing quality, affordable health coverage to \nmore than 50,000 Granite Staters. As the State legislature debated \nwhether to reauthorize Medicaid expansion, Linda fought for the program \nat every step along the way, calling it ``the most important tool New \nHampshire has in its fight against the opioid epidemic and more broadly \nthe substance misuse crisis we are facing in our state.''\n  Linda has also strongly spoken out in defense of the Essential Health \nBenefits that require insurers to cover substance misuse and mental \nhealth treatment, she has stood up against cuts to\n\n\nMedicaid and other programs that Granite Staters struggling with \nsubstance use disorder rely on, and she has worked effectively to help \nreduce the stigma that has hurt our efforts to combat this crisis for \nfar too long.\n  People like Linda perfectly exemplify New Hampshire's all-hands-on-\ndeck spirit, where we roll up our sleeves and work together to \nstrengthen our communities. Linda's dedication to supporting those \nstruggling with substance use disorder, first responders, and treatment \nproviders has strengthened our State's response to the substance misuse \ncrisis, and her advocacy will continue to help us stem and ultimately \nreverse the tide of this epidemic. I join all Granite Staters in \nthanking Linda for her service and congratulating her on a well-\ndeserved retirement.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Ms. HASSAN", "itemno": 0}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 1}], "header": {"chamber": "Senate", "num": "187", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "S7260-S7261", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "15", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "TRIBUTE TO LINDA SAUNDERS PAQUETTE", "id": "CREC-2017-11-15-pt1-PgS7260-2", "title": "TRIBUTE TO LINDA SAUNDERS PAQUETTE"}
