He was known as a man who could always be counted on by his \ncommunity, a man who felt a calling to public service. He joined the \nArmy, entering Active Duty in July of 2012.\n  Sergeant Riney was deployed as part of Operation Enduring Freedom \nfrom July 2014 to February 2015. In June of 2016, he was again deployed \nto Operation Freedom's Sentinel.\n  As part of the Support Squadron, 3rd Cavalry Regiment, 1st Cavalry \nDivision from Fort Hood, Texas, Sergeant Riney excelled at his work.\n  Throughout his time in the Army, Sergeant Riney was repeatedly \nrecognized with commendations, including the Purple Heart, the Bronze \nStar, and the Army Commendation Medal.\n  At home, Sergeant Riney lived with his wife, Kylie, and their two \nchildren, Elea and James.\n  He is survived by his loving family: his father and his stepmother, \nDave and Kristie Riney; his mother and stepfather, Pam and Don Boland; \nhis brother, Jeff Budd; his sister, Stacey Budd; two stepbrothers, \nBryce and Kole Vaughn; and one stepsister, Ashlie Herrin.\n  On the fateful day of October 19, 2016, our Nation lost one of its \nfinest, and the community of Fairview lost one of its best.\n  The naming of the Fairview Post Office is just a small token of our \nappreciation for Sergeant Riney, who made the ultimate sacrifice for \nour Nation.\n  While we can never fill the hole left in the family, the Fairview \ncommunity, or the Nation, I hope this post office will serve as a proud \ncommemoration of a man who dedicated his life to serving others and as \nan inspiration for those who just hear his name.\n  On behalf of the hardworking men and women of the Illinois 17th \nCongressional District, I will never forget the service of Sergeant \nDouglas Riney, and we will always honor his sacrifice.\n  Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues for the consideration of this \nbill.", "turn": 8, "speaker": "Mrs. BUSTOS", "itemno": 13}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "W000822", "text": "  Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN.
