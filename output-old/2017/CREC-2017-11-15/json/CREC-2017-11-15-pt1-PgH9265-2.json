Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my strong \nopposition to the Republican tax bill.\n  Mr. Speaker, how much can the American people take? How many \nalternative facts will we ask them to believe? How many broken promises \nwill we ask them to overlook?\n  The proposed tax bill is camouflaged as a tax break for the middle \nclass, but you and I both know the only permanent tax breaks are for \nthe richest people and corporations in America. As a matter of fact, \nover 36 million families will see a tax increase.\n  Now, there is a new flimflam on the table. Mr. Speaker, you are well \naware that Republicans have voted over 50 times to repeal the \nAffordable Care Act. All attempts failed. But now a repeal of the \nmandate that all Americans have healthcare has mysteriously been added \nto the tax bill. Is it possible that tax reform is just a ruse to \nrepeal the Affordable Care Act?\n  Enough is enough. Mr. Speaker, I believe the American people are \npaying attention, and I believe the American people will hold those \naccountable who vote against them.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mrs. DEMINGS", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "187", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H9265", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "15", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "ENOUGH IS ENOUGH", "id": "CREC-2017-11-15-pt1-PgH9265-2", "title": "ENOUGH IS ENOUGH"}
