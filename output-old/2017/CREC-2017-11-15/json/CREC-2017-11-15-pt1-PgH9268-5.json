Mr. Speaker, I rise today on behalf of veterans of the \nUnited States Armed Forces who have been unceremoniously deported.\n  In the 1990s, the immigration law changes eliminated judicial \ndiscretion and reclassified many low-level, nonviolent offenses as \naggravated felonies mandating deportation. As a result, the United \nStates has banished an unknown number of veterans. In many cases, these \nwere minor offenses committed by veterans who succumbed to the \ndifficulties of readjusting to civilian life.\n  Many are combat veterans who sustained physical wounds and emotional \ntrauma in conflicts going back to the war in Vietnam. This banishment \neffectively denies these men access to often critically needed medical \ncare.\n  Regardless of immigration status, all U.S. military veterans are \nentitled to treatment at the Department of Veterans Affairs medical \nfacilities, yet very few of these deported veterans are granted the \nnecessary waivers to access the care either in the States or abroad.\n  In fact, most of these veterans, the only way they are going to \nreturn is in a box, dead, because they do have the right to be buried \nin a veterans' cemetery. Let's do the right thing and bring these \nveterans home so they can get the care they need.\n\n\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. VARGAS", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "187", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H9268-H9269", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "15", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "DEPORTED VETERANS", "id": "CREC-2017-11-15-pt1-PgH9268-5", "title": "DEPORTED VETERANS"}
