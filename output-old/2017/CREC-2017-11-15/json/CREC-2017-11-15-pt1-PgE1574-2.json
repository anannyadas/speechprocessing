Mr. Speaker, I rise today to join Minnesota Muslims in \nrecognizing the 10th anniversary on the founding of the Council on \nAmerican-Islamic Relations--Minnesota Chapter (CAIR-MN). CAIR-MN is \namong the 35 Regional Offices and chapters across the United States \nthat are working to enhance reinforce core American values by \nencouraging dialogue, promoting social justice, protecting civil \nliberties and fostering freedom of religion. CAIR-MN is to be commended \nfor their advocacy work to advance civil rights and ensure that America \nremains a beacon of hope, freedom, opportunity and respect for people \nof all backgrounds.\n  At a time when Muslim Americans and Muslim immigrants face \nunprecedented levels of intolerance and abject bigotry, the work of \nCAIR-MN is vital. Minnesotans treasure our diversity and the desire for \nopen and meaningful dialogue as we work together to strengthen our \ncommunities. Our growing and vibrant Muslim community in Minnesota is \nan important part of the fabric of this country, and I am pleased that \nCAIR-MN is actively engaged with our local communities across our \nstate.\n  Mr. Speaker, it is an honor to represent Minnesota families of many \ncultures, ethnicities and faiths. CAIR-MN plays an important role in \nprotecting our state's culture and tradition of respect for all. Please \njoin me in recognizing CAIR-MN for 10 years of advocacy and dialogue on \nbehalf of Minnesota Muslims.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Ms. McCOLLUM", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "187", "extension": true, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "E1574", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "15", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "HONORING THE 10TH ANNIVERSARY OF CAIR--MINNESOTA CHAPTER", "id": "CREC-2017-11-15-pt1-PgE1574-2", "title": "HONORING THE 10TH ANNIVERSARY OF CAIR--MINNESOTA CHAPTER"}
