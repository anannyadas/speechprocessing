Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge my \ncolleagues to join me in cosponsoring a resolution recognizing the \nneeds of children of incarcerated parents.\n  The U.S. continues to lead the world in the rate of incarceration \nwith over 2.3 million people behind bars. Not only does the system \ndisproportionately impact the lives of low income families and \nminorities--it also hurts the goals of rehabilitation and breaking the \ncycle of violence in our communities.\n  As Congress works to address the problems facing our criminal justice \nsystem, we should do so with more than just the offenders and ex-\noffenders in mind. We need to raise awareness of the unique problems \nfaced by children of incarcerated parents. When families are separated \nby the criminal justice system, it turns their whole world upside down. \nThe family often loses a source of income and child care. Some children \nare forced to enter the foster care system. Without the proper \nresources and nurturing, these children are more likely to follow in \nthe footsteps of their parents and face a life of crime themselves.\n  Mr. Speaker, I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting this \nimportant resolution.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. CARSON of Indiana", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 3}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "187", "extension": true, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "E1573", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "15", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "INTRODUCING A RESOLUTION RECOGNIZING CHILDREN OF INCARCERATED PARENTS", "id": "CREC-2017-11-15-pt1-PgE1573", "title": "INTRODUCING A RESOLUTION RECOGNIZING CHILDREN OF INCARCERATED PARENTS"}
