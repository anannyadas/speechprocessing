Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the month of \nNovember as National Alzheimer's Disease Awareness Month and to \nhighlight the need for continued funding to find a cure.\n  In 1983, when President Reagan designated this month to help raise \nawareness for Alzheimer's, there were less than 2 million Americans who \nsuffered from this disease. Today, there are nearly 5.4 million \nAmericans with Alzheimer's.\n  Finding a cure to this disease is a smart health policy decision we \ncan make, and it might also be the most critical economic proposal. The \ncost of caring for Alzheimer's patients in the U.S. was estimated to be \n$236 billion in 2016, which is more than $200 billion greater than the \ntotal funding for research provided by the NIH for all diseases.\n  Investments in research have led to some great news in Kansas. The \nUniversity of Kansas announced that it will participate in the trial of \na new drug intended to prevent or delay Alzheimer's. Further, KU \nresearchers are continuing to work on other preventative studies.\n  Mr. Speaker, as we must continue to provide resources that we need to \nfind a cure for this disease, I am proud of the work being done at KU \nand across the Nation. We will continue to be relentless in our fight \nto cure Alzheimer's.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. YODER", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "187", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H9268", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "15", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "NATIONAL ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE AWARENESS MONTH AND FINDING A CURE", "id": "CREC-2017-11-15-pt1-PgH9268-4", "title": "NATIONAL ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE AWARENESS MONTH AND FINDING A CURE"}
