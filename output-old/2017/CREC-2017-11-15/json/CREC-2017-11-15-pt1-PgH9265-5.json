Mr. Speaker, the Pew Research Center recently \nstudied how the media covered the first 60 days of each recent \nadministration. Not surprisingly, 62 percent of the media coverage of \nPresident Trump was negative, compared to 20 percent for President \nObama and 28 percent for Presidents Bush and Clinton.\n  As Investor's Business Daily put it: ``The media from the get-go had \ndecided Trump was a bad President--before any of his policies had a \nchance to take hold.''\n  Now that his policies have taken hold and improved the economy, the \nmedia still does not want President Trump to succeed. You have seldom \nheard or read a word about our strong economic growth, the record-\nbreaking stock market, high consumer confidence, and the record-high \nhousehold income.\n  The liberal media seldom highlight this news because they would have \nto credit President Trump's successful policies. When the liberal media \ngive the American people the facts and present the news objectively, \nthey will have earned our trust. Until then, they just serve as another \nbiased source of information.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. SMITH of Texas", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "187", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H9265", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "15", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "MEDIA WANTS TRUMP TO FAIL", "id": "CREC-2017-11-15-pt1-PgH9265-5", "title": "MEDIA WANTS TRUMP TO FAIL"}
