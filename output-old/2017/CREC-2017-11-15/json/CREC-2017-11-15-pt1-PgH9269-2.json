Mr. Speaker, this wretched Republican tax bill threatens \nthe health of millions. That is why Republicans are rushing this sham \nthrough in record pace. They want to pass it before most Americans know \nwhat has hit them.\n  It is amazing that, on this Alzheimer's Awareness Month, they \ncelebrate it by imposing a new Alzheimer's tax. Families paying \nthousands of dollars to care for a loved one would lose the right that \nthey have today to deduct those huge expenses. It is not just a tax on \nAlzheimer's, but on any substantial healthcare expense.\n  As if that were not bad enough, they pursue with their fanatical zeal \nthe destruction of ObamaCare. Again, they would remove one of the key \npillars that will lead to denying coverage for those with preexisting \nconditions because their insurance premiums will soar.\n  It will mean that millions of Americans will lose their healthcare \ncoverage. Protect your health. Reject this sorry Republican tax bill.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. DOGGETT", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "187", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H9269", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "15", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "SAVE HEALTHCARE, REJECT REPUBLICAN TAX BILL", "id": "CREC-2017-11-15-pt1-PgH9269-2", "title": "SAVE HEALTHCARE, REJECT REPUBLICAN TAX BILL"}
