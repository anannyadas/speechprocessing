Mr. Speaker, I thank my \ncolleague from not too far away in Trenton, New Jersey, as well as my \ncolleague from the Commonwealth of Kentucky.\n  Today, I rise in support of H.R. 2873, a bill to designate the \nfacility of the United States Postal Service located at 207 Glenside \nAvenue in Wyncote, Pennsylvania, as the Staff Sergeant Peter Taub Post \nOffice Building.\n  Staff Sergeant Taub, a constituent of my 13th Congressional District \nof Pennsylvania, was a shining example of the best our country has to \noffer. He exemplified unwavering patriotism and heroic bravery.\n  Peter made the ultimate sacrifice for his country when a suicide \nbomber took his life in Afghanistan in December 2015. Renaming the \nWyncote Post Office in his hometown is really the least we can do to \nhonor him. It is a small but important symbol of our eternal thanks. I \nam here today urging the House to pass my legislation to do just that.\n  Peter was born on November 2, 1985, in my hometown of Philadelphia, \nto his parents, Joel Taub and Arlene Wagner. Peter was then raised in \nWyncote,\n\n\nPennsylvania, and graduated from Cheltenham High School in 2004.\n  His mother, Arlene, and brother, Jonathan, run the very popular \nWashington, D.C., sandwich shop called Bub and Pop's.\n  Peter was inspired by his grandfather's service in World War II, so \nhe enlisted in the Air Force in December of 2007 after attending \ncommunity college for some time.\n  During his career in the military, Peter was assigned to a base in \nJapan, where he loaded missiles onto F-15 fighter jets. Three years \nlater, he was transferred to Ellsworth Air Force Base in South Dakota, \nwhere he specialized in arming B-1 bombers.\n  Peter went on to obtain a bachelor's degree in cybersecurity and was \nhired as a special agent in the Air Force Office of Special \nInvestigations in December 2013. During his service, Peter participated \nin more than 12 combat missions in hostile areas.\n  Peter was killed, along with four other airmen, in a suicide ambush \nattack in Afghanistan on December 21, 2015.\n  Peter is survived by his wife, Christina; their 3-year-old daughter, \nPenelope; and another daughter, Petra, who was born after Peter's death \nin the summer of 2016.\n  President Obama paid tribute to Peter, as well as the other troops \nwho were killed in the attack, calling their service ``outstanding'' \nand ``brave.'' I second those descriptions.\n  Posthumously, Peter was awarded the Bronze Star, the Purple Heart, \nthe Air Force Commendation Medal, and the Air Force Combat Action \nMedal.\n  It is my hope that, with this legislation, the 13th District of the \nCommonwealth of Pennsylvania will pay daily tribute to the memory of \none of our heroes, Staff Sergeant Peter Taub.", "turn": 8, "speaker": "Mr. BRENDAN F.
