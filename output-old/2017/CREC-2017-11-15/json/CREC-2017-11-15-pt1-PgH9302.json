Con. Res. 92\n\n       Whereas the Jewish people have had a homeland in modern-day \n     Israel for more than 3,000 years;\n       Whereas, on November 2, 1917, United Kingdom Foreign \n     Secretary Lord Arthur Balfour wrote to Lord Walter \n     Rothschild, to be declared to the Zionist Federation, a \n     letter declaring, on behalf of the Government of the United \n     Kingdom, support for a home for the Jewish people in the \n     former Ottoman district of Palestine;\n       Whereas this letter, known as the Balfour Declaration, was \n     ratified by the League of Nations on July 24, 1922;\n       Whereas, on September 21, 1922, President Warren G. Harding \n     signed House Joint Resolution 322, after unanimous support \n     from the House of Representatives and the Senate, favoring \n     the establishment, in the former Ottoman district of \n     Palestine, of a national home for the Jewish people;\n       Whereas the Balfour Declaration clearly recognized and \n     sought to uphold the ``civil and religious rights of the \n     existing non-Jewish communities in Palestine,'' as well as \n     the ``rights and political status enjoyed by Jews in any \n     other country'';\n       Whereas the Balfour Declaration was a significant part of \n     the chain of events that led to the establishment of the \n     modern State of Israel on May 14, 1948;\n       Whereas since Israel's founding, it has been a strong and \n     steadfast ally to the United States, and the relationship is \n     built on a mutual commitment to shared values;\n       Whereas Israel serves as a beacon for democracy by holding \n     free and transparent elections and promoting the free \n     exchange of ideas;\n       Whereas in April 1998, the United States designated Israel \n     as a Major Non-NATO ally and in 2014 was elevated to the \n     status of a Major Strategic Partner; and\n       Whereas the 100th Anniversary of the Balfour Declaration \n     offers an opportunity for recommitment to strengthening the \n     relationship between the United States and Israel; Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate \n     concurring), That Congress--\n       (1) affirms its commitment to maintaining the strongest of \n     bilateral ties with the State of Israel;\n       (2) recognizes the importance of the establishment of the \n     modern State of Israel as a secure and democratic homeland \n     for the Jewish people, without prejudice to the rights of all \n     people to live within or alongside Israel in peace; and\n       (3) supports efforts to continue to increase economic, \n     security and cultural ties between the United States and \n     Israel.\n\n\n              Amendment Offered by Mr. Royce of California\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "The RECORDER", "itemno": 4}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "R000487", "text": "  Mr. ROYCE of California.
