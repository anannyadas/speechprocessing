Mr. Speaker, in this season of trying and tough times made \neven tougher by the skullduggery of the Republican Members of this \nbody, I rise today to pay tribute to my personal hero and longtime \nfriend, Ms. Jewel Barker, who recently celebrated her 90th birthday.\n  Mama Jewel, as she is affectionately known to so many, was born \nNovember 3, 1927, in Solgohachia, Arkansas. She grew up in Wardell, \nMissouri, and attended Central High School in Hayti, Missouri, and \nlater she attended the Lincoln University in Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. Speaker, Mama Jewel always felt a strong drive to improve her \nlife which led to her residing and working in Kansas City and St. \nLouis, Missouri, before settling in our hometown of Chicago, Illinois, \nin 1956.\n  Though she worked several jobs, her aspiration was to return to \nschool to earn her teaching credentials. She attained this goal by \nreceiving a master's degree in education from the Chicago Teachers \nCollege and, in later years, a master's degree from DePaul University \nin Chicago.\n  Her love of justice for all people did not stop there. Her support \nfor civil rights and equality culminated in her serving as ``Mama'' to \nthe Illinois Chapter of the Black Panther Party.\n  During Mama Jewel's 38 years as an educator, she served as a teacher, \nmentor, counselor, role model, and as a mother figure to many. She \nworked tirelessly, Mr. Speaker, with students and family members in \nprograms that met before school, after school, and even on weekends. \nShe provided housing and financial support for several young people so \nthey could further their education.\n  Mama Jewel's passion has always been focused on helping others and \nencouraging people to realize their full potential. This led her to \nplaying an active part in the civil rights movement, a role that she \nfirst accepted when she organized a boycott in\n\n\nWardell, Missouri, in the 1950s, after its board of education failed to \nuse money allocated there for indoor toilets in the African-American \nschool.\n  Mr. Speaker, her passion for this cause was so great that Mama Jewel \nwent door to door asking parents not to send their children to school, \na decision that ultimately led to an installation of those very same \ntoilets. Even after retiring in 1994, she volunteered her time and her \ntalents at her former school and at other schools where her former \nstudents taught.\n  In addition to her love for family and her love for service, Mama \nJewel has always been a well-rounded enthusiast, displaying many of her \ntalents and interests, which include sports, theatrical performances, \ncooking, and baking. To this day, Mr. Speaker, she remains very active \nin her church and in her community.\n  I know I am so blessed to know Mama Jewel. I am so blessed that Mama \nJewel poured her all into my late son Huey's life. I am so blessed that \nshe still is the matriarch of the family and of the movement.\n  So on behalf of the citizens of the First Congressional District of \nIllinois, I would like to congratulate my friend, Mama Jewel Barker, on \nthis milestone and wish her many, many, many more birthdays.\n  May the Lord continue to bless Mama Jewel. May the Lord continue to \nshine His Shekinah glory upon Mama Jewel's countenance and upon her \nfamily.\n", "turn": 1, "speaker": "Mr. RUSH", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "187", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H9262-H9263", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "15", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "HONORING MS.
