Mr. Speaker, tomorrow the House will vote on H.R. 1, the \nso-called Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which Republicans say will support \nAmerica's middle class. Unfortunately, that is not the case.\n  Middle-income Americans will receive, at best, one-fifth of the \npromised benefit of these tax cuts.\n  According to the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center, H.R. 1 will raise \ntaxes on 36 million hardworking middle class American households.\n  It scraps benefits our families depend on, like the student loan \ninterest and medical expense deductions. Imagine, in a time when access \nto higher education is critical to a family's economic well-being, \nmaking it even more expensive.\n  This legislation was written behind closed doors, in secret, without \nDemocratic input and without any hearings.\n  Mr. Speaker, a bill to overhaul the Tax Code, the results of which \nwill affect every American for decades to come, deserves open and \ntransparent consideration. I urge my colleagues to work together to \ninstead craft a tax reform bill that truly lifts up the middle class \nand invests in our future.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Ms. TSONGAS", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "187", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H9267", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "15", "month": "November"}, "related_bills": [{"type": "HR", "context": "FIRSTPARAGRAPH", "congress": "115", "number": "1"}, {"type": "HR", "context": "OTHER", "congress": "115", "number": "1"}], "doc_title": "LET'S WORK TOGETHER TO CRAFT A TAX REFORM BILL", "id": "CREC-2017-11-15-pt1-PgH9267"}
