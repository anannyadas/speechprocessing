Mr. President, all year the majority has tried to ram \nthrough legislation to repeal the Affordable Care Act and replace it \nwith proposals that, in effect, cut healthcare for millions of people \nto finance tax cuts for those who make millions of dollars in income. \nAll year the American people have made it perfectly clear that this was \nthe opposite of what they wanted. Fortunately, those repeal efforts \nfailed.\n  Now, instead of listening to the American people and learning from \nthat failure, the majority has doubled down on its tax plan. Like \nhealthcare, they have made no attempt to bring both sides together. In \nthe Senate, we only saw the bill last Thursday. I am on the Finance \nCommittee. I have been on there for years. It wasn't even in \nlegislative language on Thursday.\n  I remember back in the healthcare debate, 9 years ago, when people \nwere saying: Read the bill. Read the bill. We came to the markup \nyesterday to offer amendments. There still wasn't a bill. There was not \na bill.\n  Thomas Jefferson used to say--and it didn't happen--that he hoped \nthat when these legislatures were put together in the U.S. Congress, \nyou would have to introduce a bill and, then, it would take 365 days \nbefore it could be enacted into legislation. Maybe that is where the \ntea party got the idea in 2009. Where are they now? We have not had a \nsingle hearing on this bill.\n  Now they are marking up the most consequential tax policy in 31 \nyears, one affecting every single American and moving around trillions \nof dollars in this economy.\n  Remember back during the healthcare debate when it was 16 percent of \nour economy and people were saying: Read the bill. You had better read \nthis bill. There is not a school board in Colorado that would accept \nthis process. There is not a city council that would accept this \nprocess. We have more process for a small decision about where parking \nmeters should go than we have had in this process.\n  People are upset for good reason. When you rush big things, when you \ndon't listen to different views, you get bad policy. I have heard the \nmajority leader say that on this floor.\n  There is a reason why they are trying to rush it through. There is a \nreason why they don't want America to have a chance to read the bill or \nfor their representatives to this Chamber to read the bill. That is \nbecause, just like the healthcare proposals they made, the majority's \ntax plan is fundamentally flawed. Over the course of the campaign, \nPresident Trump--then Candidate Trump--promised the American people: \n``No cuts to Social Security, Medicare, or Medicaid.'' That is not fake \nnews. That is what he said.\n  He said that ``everybody's got to be covered,'' speaking of health \ninsurance.\n  He said:\n\n       Everybody's got to be covered. . . . Everybody's going to \n     be taken care of much better than they're taken care of now.\n\n  He promised the public: ``You're going to end up with great \nhealthcare for a fraction of the price.'' That is what he told the \nAmerican people.\n\n\n  Yesterday, a year after the election, and after 8 years of saying \nrepeal and replace, repeal and replace, repeal and replace, it turned \nout that, because there was no idea how to replace it--there was no \nconsensus on the Republican side about how to replace it; they failed \ntwice to do it until yesterday--they added changes to a tax bill, \nliterally in the middle of the night, that would cause 13 million \npeople, according to the Congressional Budget Office, to lose health \ninsurance. It would increase premiums by up to 10 percent, according to \nthe Congressional Budget Office, on the individual market each year. \nYou can't make it up. It would lead to a $25 billion cut in Medicare. \nThat is what is happening here while people are distracted by what is \ngoing on in the Senate race in Alabama.\n  How does this proposal in any way square with the President's \npromises during the campaign? All year we saw tax cuts masquerading as \na healthcare point.\n  I went home to Colorado and people said: Michael, you work with \npeople in a bipartisan way all the time. Why aren't you working on this \nhealthcare bill? There is no one in Colorado, including the critics of \nthe Affordable Care Act, who said to me: Michael, I have a good idea \nfor helping me with my healthcare: Give the wealthiest people in \nAmerica a tax cut. Nobody came and said: Let's cut Medicaid by 40 \npercent when we are facing the opioid crisis that we are facing.\n  So they masqueraded it as a healthcare plan, and now we have a \nhealthcare plan masquerading as a tax plan. On top of that, this plan \ndoubles down on the claim that tax cuts for the wealthiest people in \nAmerica and businesses not only trickle down to everyone else but also \npay for themselves. That part is not surprising because that has been \nthe Republican answer for what ails our economy.\n  When our economy was up and our deficit was down, they cut taxes for \nthe top 1 percent of Americans, making an average of $2 million. When \nour economy was down and our deficit was up, they cut taxes on the top \n1 percent, making an average of $2 million. Now, they are embracing \nexactly the same game plan in their tax plan.\n  The Senate bill overwhelmingly benefits people and businesses who \nhave done extremely well in this economy. As a former businessperson \nmyself, I have nothing against that success. In fact, I embrace that \nsuccess. My issue is that trickle-down economics as a theory for \neconomic growth has been entirely discredited by our own experiences. \nThis is not a theoretical exercise anymore. It is not as if these \narguments haven't been made time and again and then proven to be false. \nThat leaves me to wonder why this plan or at least the version we \ndebated yesterday--I am not as sure about it today--gives roughly \n$50,000 in tax cuts to those making over $1 million.\n  For Americans earning under $200,000, which is 19 million households, \nthey would actually see a tax increase. Another 54 million households \nwould see virtually no benefit at all.\n  I agree that America needs tax reform. It is not about a political \nimperative for doing tax reform. America needs tax reform. That is why \nI joined the Finance Committee. Tax reform means we should clean up \nspecial interest carve-outs.\n  I have to stop for a minute and pause on that point. For years, as \npart of the Gang of 8, as the Simpson-Bowles Commission came through \nand was crushed, and as there were bipartisan discussions, always what \npeople said was that, on the corporate side, what we are going to do is \nto lower the rate and broaden the base. That was the plan. The way we \nwere going to do that was by getting rid of a whole bunch of special \ninterest loopholes.\n  What this bill does is to lower the rate, but it forgets about the \nsecond part of the equation. If you look at the broadening of the base, \nyou actually have to take away someone's loophole, and that is hard to \ndo. So instead, what they are doing is lowering the rate and leaving \nthe loopholes where they are--what a disaster. It took 31 years to get \ntax reform in this Chamber, and that is the answer?\n  Today, if you don't like the situation, we have the highest published \ncorporate rate in the world. I don't like that because that is \nuncompetitive for the United States at 35 percent. But one of the \nthings we know about it is that, because of all those loopholes, very \nfew people pay the 35 percent. Some do, and that is very unfair. The \naverage effective rate is more like 23 percent, not 35 percent, and \nthat is because companies can use loopholes. They can move money \noverseas. If you are a newspaper company or you are a trucking company \nhere, you can't do that. That is why you pay the 35 percent. That is \nnot fair, but this bill does nothing to take on those challenges--\nnothing.\n  We need tax reform to get rid of those special interest carve-outs. \nWe should take steps to help our businesses compete, to unlock our \nenergy economy, and to modernize the electric grid. We need \ncomprehensive and bipartisan reform.\n  This cannot be done. I want to give Republicans the chance to blame \nDemocrats for things they don't like and Democrats to do the same, so \nwe can actually get a result that is real reform, not something crammed \nthrough with 51 votes and a healthcare bill on top of it. It has been a \nterrible thing to see this Senate slide into the place where it is \ntoday.\n  Mr. President, I say to the Presiding Officer, I know enough about \nyou to know that you are not satisfied with the fact that we have been \nrunning this government on 30 continuing resolutions for the last 10 \nyears and that we can't pass a proper budget. We don't have an \nappropriations process anymore in the Senate. It is disgraceful. We \nwould not accept it for any other institution of government or business \non the planet. Certainly, we wouldn't accept it in Colorado.\n  When I was superintendent of schools, if I had told people: Well, we \nhave a little bit of a disagreement; so I am going to shut the \ngovernment down until we can deal with this continuing resolution, they \nwould have thrown me out. But that is what we have been doing here for \nthe last 10 years.\n  Now we have sunk to a new low. There has been no attempt to bring the \nparties together on this--none. The result is a deeply flawed proposal, \ncompletely at odds with what our economy needs.\n  If you accept the logic of the Republican plan, the problem with our \neconomy is that the wealthiest institutions and individuals in the \nUnited States don't have enough money to invest and create high-paying \njobs for everyone else.\n  Sometimes I hear people at home say: I don't have anything against \nrich people--neither do I. But the logic that somehow, if you give \nsomebody at the top a tax cut, that is going to result in an increase \nto other people's income is completely contradicted by the facts.\n  Here is what has happened in America since 1987, over the last 30 \nyears. This is the median family income. This is middle class in \nAmerica, which basically for 40 years hasn't had a pay raise--has not \nhad a pay raise. This can't be blamed on some Socialist who is named \nBarack Obama; this is 40 years of American economic history--no pay \nraise.\n  Over that period of time, here is what has happened to corporate \nprofits. If the logic were true, if the logic were correct or right, we \nwould see the middle-class income rising more and doing better as \ncorporate income statements and balance sheets hit alltime highs, which \nthey have. Shown here is the great recession. Here is where we are \ntoday. Here is where we were before the great recession. Here is median \nhousehold income--stubbornly flat.\n  The balance sheets of the biggest companies in this country are awash \nin cash--awash in cash. It has not led them to help lift this line. The \nresult of this has been a huge widening of the income gap in America.\n  If trickle-down economics really worked, every American would do \nbetter as incomes at the top rose. Instead, what has happened is that \nthe top 10 percent, which is roughly 11 million people out of a total \nof 330 million people in America, are earning an average of $475,000. \nThat top 10 percent now represents a larger share of America's wealth \nthan everyone else.\n  Look at this. Here is the 10 percent. These are the folks who on \naverage are making $475,000. Obviously, many people in here make a lot \nmore than that, but that is the average. They now earn more than the \nbottom 90 percent of earners in America. That is not the way this \ncountry has been. You have to\n\n\ngo back to 1928--the year before the Great Depression--to see that \nlevel of income inequality in America. In between then and now, what we \nsaw was a rise in the middle class, an economy that benefited everybody \nand lifted up everyone and gave them a chance to save and provide for \ntheir families. That is not happening anymore. The top 1 percent are \nearning about 20 percent of the income.\n  It seems to me that the challenge with our economy is not that the \nfolks at the very top don't have enough. They have more than they have \never had by a lot. The top 10 percent have over 50 percent of the \nincome in America. The bottom 90 percent--it seems crazy to even say \nbottom 90 percent. It is not the bottom 10 percent; it is the rest of \nAmerica, it is 90 percent of America who earns less. That is the \nchallenge we confront, the challenge that incomes for everyone else \nhaven't kept pace with the rising costs of housing or healthcare or \nhigher education or childcare.\n  Several months ago, I met a mom in Rifle, CO, at an early childhood \ncenter. That is on the West Slope of Colorado. She and the other moms \nwere so happy that they had this early childhood center because before \nthat, they had to drive 30 miles to Glenwood Springs for childcare. \nThis mom said to me during the course of our conversation: ``I have a \njob so I can have health insurance, and every single dollar I earn goes \nto pay for this early childhood center so I can work.''\n  There are families all over my State who are stuck in that place, \nwhere at the end of every month, they have to decide what they are \ngoing to go without. They can't afford housing. They can't afford \ncollege. They can't afford early childhood education. Their not being \nable to afford housing is increasingly becoming a huge issue. There are \ntoo many Americans who are facing those unbelievably difficult choices.\n  Those of you who are here might say: Well, just tough it out. That is \nyour issue. Work harder.\n  These folks are killing themselves. They are killing themselves, but \nthey are having to make choices and decisions because our economy is \nnot working well enough for everybody and not working at all for \neverybody. They are having to make choices their parents and \ngrandparents never had to make.\n  Erin Barnes is another one of my constituents. She lives in Thornton, \nCO, with her husband and two kids. Both Erin and her husband have \ncollege degrees and middle-class jobs. They are working. They are \neducated. Erin works in marketing, and her husband runs an IT \ndepartment.\n  Earlier this month, she wrote to my office, describing how they \n``don't have luxuries like cable television, haircuts, lattes, \nmanicures, or even new clothes. . . . My children all wear hand-me-\ndowns from friends. And yet, we make $1,200 less per month than we \nspend. . . . It's not that we're irresponsible: our monthly mortgage \npayment is only 25 percent of our income. How are the pieces not \nfitting together?''\n  As the Presiding Officer knows, in America, consumer spending drives \n70 percent of our economy. When costs rise and middle-class families' \nwages stay flat, families like Erin's cut back, forgoing books for \ntheir kids, birthday presents, healthcare. Multiply that across \nmillions of Americans--the 90 percent we are talking about here--and \nthat has a dramatic effect on our economy because they are the folks \nwho drive the 70 percent of our economy that is driven by consumer \nspending. That is the problem we need to solve. That should be our \nfocus for their sake but also to drive our economy, not folks who have \ndone the best in the economy and who are doing great. I am glad they \nare doing great.\n\n  One way to help families like Erin's is the American Family Act, \nwhich I wrote with Senator Sherrod Brown, which triples the tax credit. \nUnder our plan, Erin's family would gain $300 per child each month. Not \nonly does the Republican plan largely ignore families like Erin's, it \nburdens her children with another $1.5 trillion in debt for the favor \nof doing nothing for them.\n  You will hear over and over again the Republicans' claim that their \ntax cuts pay for themselves. We heard that in the committee today. \nAnybody who has lived through what has happened since President Clinton \nwas President of the United States knows that is false. It was the \nlogic that was used in 2001, the logic that was used in 2003, and it is \nwhat took us from having a $5 trillion projected surplus--you don't \nhear that word around here very often--when Bill Clinton finished being \nPresident to the record deficits we have today.\n  Let me make sure I have the right chart up here. I do.\n  In 1981, Ronald Reagan signed major tax cuts and claimed they would \npay for themselves. By the end of his term, our national debt had risen \n62 percent.\n  In the 1990s, President Clinton raised taxes at the top and cut \nspending to balance the budget, and the economy boomed. That was with a \nRepublican Congress, I was reminded today by Chairman Hatch--one of the \ntruly decent people in this place.\n  By 1999, the U.S. Senate, believe it or not, actually held hearings \non what to do with a $5.6 trillion projected surplus. I am not making \nthis up.\n  I know that Democrats have a reputation for not caring about fiscal \nmatters and that Republicans have a reputation for taking them \nseriously. I don't know how that happened, but that is not the history. \nThat is not the history.\n  When George Bush was elected President, he passed two tax cuts, \nprosecuted two wars that were not paid for, and signed a $400 billion \nprescription drug benefit without paying for any of it. Medicare Part \nD--didn't pay for a dollar of it. The reason that today we collect $1 \nfor every $3 we spend in Medicare is largely because of what was done \nunder President Bush.\n  When President Obama assumed office, from day one, he inherited a \n$1.2 trillion annual deficit and an economy in free fall. We were \nlosing 800,000 jobs a month, and unemployment was climbing to 10 \npercent.\n  Back then--and I was here--during the worst downturn since the Great \nDepression, Republican leaders all of a sudden remembered their \nconservative fiscal discipline, just when the American people needed \ntheir help the most. It was not when the economy was going well at the \nbeginning of the Bush administration, not when we had a surplus, but \nwhen we had a $1.2 trillion deficit caused by the policies of the \nprevious administration and a failure in the housing market. That drove \nus into the worst recession since the Great Depression.\n  Citing the debt that we had then, which Barack Obama had not put on \nthe balance sheets of the U.S. Government, every Republican opposed \nPresident Obama's economic recovery package to stabilize our economy, \nand not only that, they called it a Bolshevik takeover of the United \nStates of America.\n  Now, after inheriting a booming stock market and 4 percent \nunemployment, Republicans propose to add $1.5 trillion to our debt to \ngive roughly $50,000 in tax cuts to those making over $1 million in \nthis country--again, to this line, as shown on the chart.\n  Today, America's debt is over $20 trillion. We could face another \neconomic downturn 4 months from now or 6 months from now or an armed \nconflict on the Korean Peninsula. The debt suffocates our ability to \nrespond, just as it has suffocated our ability to deal with the opioid \nepidemic.\n  When I got here, there was barely an opioid epidemic in America, and \nover the last decade, it has flooded our country. But if you live in a \nrural part of my State, if you live in the San Luis Valley in Colorado, \nyour access to addiction treatment is the same as it was 10 years ago \nbecause we are broke, because we can't work in a bipartisan way to deal \nwith these issues. It is disgraceful, just as it was disgraceful to cut \ntaxes in 2003 just after we sent our troops into Iraq. That was maybe \nthe height of disgraceful.\n  When we know there may be something imminent on the Korean Peninsula, \nwhen we know the Middle East is in the turmoil it is in, is this really \nthe moment we want to do this?\n  I will say this on this floor: If my colleagues vote for this plan, \nthey forfeit any right to claim they are fiscal conservatives. And I am \nsad to say this--I really am; I think my colleague from Colorado would \nknow I am telling the truth when I say I am sad to say this--but I have \nlearned over the past 9 years that the only time the majority seems to \ncare about fiscal responsibility is when they are not actually \nresponsible\n\n\nfor it. In a sense, it is a devastatingly brilliant political strategy. \nYou come to Washington arguing that the government is incompetent, then \nyou explode the debt, then you point to the debt as evidence of \nWashington's incompetence. And here is how it all ended in 2016: You \nelect a President who promised that he would eliminate our debt ``over \na period of 8 years,'' that he would deliver ``a giant, beautiful, \nmassive'' tax cut, pass ``one of the largest increases in defense \nspending in American history,'' while saying, ``I'm not going to cut \nSocial Security . . . and I'm not going to cut Medicare or Medicaid.'' \nWhy not, he told the American people, since our national debt can be \nsolved by ``eliminating waste, fraud, and abuse in the federal \ngovernment, ending redundant government programs, growing the \neconomy,'' and ``renegotiating all of our deals.''\n  Here is the real problem. And I realize my colleagues are here. I am \ngoing to take a few more minutes, if that is OK.\n  Last year, two-thirds of the Federal budget went to Medicare, \nMedicaid, Social Security, and other mandatory spending. Of the \nremaining third, half goes to national defense. After interest on the \ndebt, that leaves just 10 percent for all of our investments in the \nfuture--in our future and our children's future--in infrastructure, \nresearch, innovation, and education.\n  Over the years, because of the insanity around this place, Washington \nhas slashed that part of the budget--which is called the domestic \ndiscretionary part of the budget--by 35 percent as a percentage of GDP. \nWe have been really good at hacking on the stuff that is easy to get \nto.\n  This should all seem deeply unfair to Americans in their twenties and \nyounger to know that we are investing--simultaneously, we are investing \nless in them than our parents and grandparents invested in us, and then \nwe have the nerve to say you need to pay back the debt we accrued; we \nare not going to pay it back. We are not going to invest in you, and we \nare going to make you pay it back. We are going to live in the house, \nbut you are going to be stuck with the mortgage.\n  When I served as the superintendent of the Denver Public Schools, we \nhad to make hard choices to close schools, to modernize curriculums, \nand to fix unfunded pensions. We had intense fights. Like here, people \nhad strong and principled disagreements, but unlike here--unlike in \nWashington--in Denver, the next generation was cause enough for us to \nset aside our differences and move forward. We understood that our \nchildren had no voice in our townhalls. Their future had no votes at \nthe school board meetings. They only had us to do it for them.\n  We have forgotten that here in Washington, in these marbled halls and \non the carpeted floors of the Senate and the House. We have abdicated \nour duty completely to the next generation. Instead, we impose on them \nall the hard questions we fail to answer in our time.\n  We are burdening the future with our debts. We are burdening them \nwith the hard choices we avoid, with the easy path we follow, with the \nbaseless claims we accept that tax cuts for folks who are doing great \nsomehow trickle down and pay for themselves. That is false.\n  If this plan passes, Washington will once again encroach on the \nrights of our children and our grandchildren to enjoy the same freedom \nand opportunity our parents and grandparents handed us. What a shameful \nlegacy that would be. What a surrender of our responsibility as \nAmericans.\n  We have to set aside this flawed proposal and this broken process and \ninstead have an honest, bipartisan effort that contends forthrightly \nwith the substantive challenges of our fiscal condition and the \npolitical difficulties attendant to solving them. I may be wrong, but I \nsuspect what history will prove is, no meaningful solution can be found \nby one party alone.\n  I thank my colleagues for their indulgence, especially my friend from \nMissouri who is here.\n  I yield the floor.", "turn": 2, "speaker": "Mr. BENNET", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cotton).

Mr. President, for 8 years, working families have seen \ntheir wages stay pretty much exactly where they were and, in some \ncases, they have seen their wages go down and their income go down.\n  I will say again that the goal of this tax proposal should be to \nimmediately do what we can to see an increase in take-home pay for \nthose families and to do everything we can in the Tax Code to make us \nmore competitive, to see that they have better jobs to start with and \nmore competition for the good work they do.\n  Our Tax Code clearly is broken. It is taking money out of the pockets \nof hard-working families and standing in the way of stronger economic \ngrowth, and we can and should and must do something about that. That is \nwhy the Senate is moving toward the passage of a bill that will address \nthat Tax Code from both ends--more take-home pay now, better jobs with \nmore pay to start with, and more take-home pay later.\n  According to the Tax Foundation, under the Senate's proposal, middle-\nincome families in Missouri will see an estimated increase of about \n$2,400 in their aftertax income. When we consider the fact that nearly \n6 in 10 Americans say they don't have enough savings to cover a $500 \nemergency or a $1,000 emergency, $200 a month really matters. There may \nbe people talking about how the Tax Code doesn't do enough of this and \nenough of that, and at the higher end we should do more or we should do \nless, but no family who is working hard every day in the middle range \nof income in our country doesn't think that $200 a month makes a \ndifference to them. At another level--at the $50,000 level--I think for \nthat family, it is about $1,100 a year, so $100 a month makes a \ndifference as well.\n  This proposal would make our Tax Code simpler and easier to \nunderstand by just simply cutting out all of the deductions that only a \nfew people are able to take advantage of so everybody looks at the Tax \nCode and has more reason to believe that everybody is not only going to \nbe treated fairly, but everybody is being treated the same.\n  There are deductions in this bill we should keep where they are. \nThere are deductions like the child tax credit that we should increase. \nIn fact, the Senate proposal that that committee will start, with the \nopportunity to amend further tomorrow--the Senate proposal doubles the \nchild tax credit to $2,000 per child.\n  Senator Klobuchar, my friend from Minnesota and the cochairman of the \nadoption caucus, and I were on the floor yesterday, pleased to be \ntalking about tax credits, and certainly I am pleased to see that the \nadoption tax credit continues to be in this bill.\n  The new mark also reduces individual rates. The current rate of 22.5 \ngoes lower. The 25-percent rate goes to 24 percent, and the 32.5 goes \nto 32 percent. What does that mean? That is all very complicated, but \nwhat people know, or at least their accountant knows, is that everybody \nsort of pays the same percentage on the first amount of income and then \nthey pay a little higher percentage if they make it into the second \nbracket and a little higher if they make it into the third bracket. \nWhen all of those percentages go down, the total tax benefit for \ntaxpayers is impacted by that.\n  There are direct benefits in this bill but also benefits that \ncontinue to encourage small business. The estimation for small business \nis that 97 percent of all business in Missouri are small businesses, \nand the average tax cut for those businesses would be about $3,000 a \nyear. These small businesses are the engines that drive the economy. \nThey are the engines that drive growth. This bill understands that.\n  This bill understands working families who haven't had a break in \ntheir paycheck in 8 years now, and it is time for them to be able to \ntake home more of the money they earn.\n  It is also time for us to do everything we can to see that they are \ngoing to have more competition for the good work they do in the future. \nMore competition and more ability to compete with other countries and \nother companies mean better jobs. That is what this is about. It is a \ntax bill about families and jobs.\n  I look forward to everyone in the Senate having a chance to amend the \nbill on the floor and to watch what I think has been a significant \nimprovement in the bill as the Finance Committee has had a chance to \nlook at it. They will have a chance to amend it.\n\n\nThen we have a chance--those of us not on that committee--to look at \nwhat they have done and see what we can do to make it even better \nbefore we go to conference with the House and put a bill on the \nPresident's desk. We will do that.

I believe the \nFord LTD station wagon was rolling off the assembly lines that year. \n``Top Gun'' was No. 1 at the box office.\n  That was 1986. It is important because that is the last time we did \ntax reform in this Chamber. That is the last time we enacted \nmeaningful, comprehensive tax reform.\n  This Congress has an incredible opportunity before us today. Our \ncolleagues have an opportunity to grow this economy, to get wages \ngrowing again, and to create opportunity for the American people that \nthey haven't seen in far too long.\n  Over the past decade, Americans have been working harder than they \never have before, but they have watched as the haves have more and the \nhave-nots have less, and they are tired of it. We have seen stagnant \nwages and work hours growing. That is what this debate is about. It is \nabout people who want to stand up for Coloradans and people around this \ncountry to make sure we grow this economy so people can stop working \ntwo or three jobs that they have to now just to try to make ends meet, \nso they can finally start to see wages grow.\n  I am going to be joined throughout this afternoon's debate by the \nclass of 2014, Members of the Senate who were elected in 2014 as a \nresult of a message of economic opportunity--Senators from Georgia and \nNorth Carolina and West Virginia and Arkansas elected because we \nbelieved in an America that was growing again. We believed in an \nAmerica that didn't have to settle for second place, it didn't have to \nsettle for mediocrity or decline, but an America that with the right \neconomic policies, the right tax policies, we could lift the burdens \noff the backs of the American people, off the backs of American \nbusinesses, and get this country back to work. That is what this debate \nis about.\n  Over the past several weeks, we have heard a lot of debate about what \nthe Senate bill is going to be, what the House bill is going to be. \nOver the past several years, the Senate Finance Committee has held over \n70 committee hearings on the issue of tax reform, countless reports, \npaperwork done, economic models to show what this tax reform needed to \nlook like. We have had open debates from both sides of the aisle, a \nchance to say how do we reduce the tax burden on the American people \nand get this economy moving again.\n  What the Senate has come up with is a package that is estimated to \ncreate 1 million jobs across this country--1 million jobs across this \ncountry--according to the Tax Foundation. In Colorado, that means a \n$3,000-plus increase in average aftertax income. If you don't think \n$3,000 is a heck of a lot of money to people, look at the statistics.\n  The statistics show that the average American family--a significant \npercentage of them; percentages of American families--don't have 24-\nhour access to just a few hundred dollars. They can't find--they don't \nhave access to just a couple hundred dollars in a 24-hour time period. \nOne-third of Americans, if they had to come up with $500 today, it \nwould be a fiscal crisis for their household.\n  We are talking about an opportunity to grow wages. In fact, the Tax \nFoundation says a 4.4-percent increase in average aftertax income will \noccur as a result of the Senate bill.\n  I will yield to my colleague from Georgia. We are going to get this \neasel out of his way, but first I want to show one chart that shows how \nwage growth can happen.\n  If you look across the world and you see nations that have low \nstatutory tax rates and you see nations that have high statutory tax \nrates, you will see that those nations that have the lowest statutory \ncorporate tax rates see the highest wage growth. People who work in \nthese countries with low statutory tax rates, they see the highest \naverage wage growth. Countries with high statutory tax rates--this red \nline right here--their wage growth is less than 1 percent. Do you know \nwhere the United States falls? The United States falls as the highest \nstatutory corporate tax rate in the industrialized world. Our wage \ngrowth is at the bottom.\n  Low tax rates result in high wage growth. This fight is for the \nmiddle class of America. This fight is for hard-working American \nfamilies. This fight is to grow wages across the State of Colorado, \nfrom the Eastern Plains to the Western Slope, and around the country. I \nhope all of us will be engaged in this fight.\n  I am going to turn this debate over to our colleague from Georgia who \nhas experience in business and who understands how taxes work and who \nunderstands how to make sure he is providing for the people of Georgia.", "turn": 8, "speaker": "Mr. GARDNER", "itemno": 8}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "P000612", "text": "  Mr. PERDUE. Mr. President, I wish to thank my colleague from \nColorado. I will not tell him what I was doing in 1986, the last time \nwe adjusted the tax rate, but I just want to remind our colleagues \ntoday that we are in a moment of crisis in the United States.\n  Today we have a national debt crisis. I have been to this floor many \ntimes, and many of my colleagues have as well, to talk about this debt \ncrisis. It affects our ability to do the things that we know are right \nto do--to deal with the victims of hurricanes, with national security, \nand with our healthcare situation.\n  Folks, we are losing the right to do the right thing.\n  To solve this national debt crisis, we have to do many things. But \none of the ways we can deal with this debt crisis--and one of the first \nthings we have to do--is to grow our economy. The way to grow the \neconomy is to roll back regulations, unleash our energy potential, and, \nyes, finally, once and for all, fix this archaic tax system, which \nkeeps us from being competitive with the rest of the world.\n  In 1986, we had the third lowest corporate tax rate in history, in \nthe world, and over the next 15 years we benefited from that. But at \nthe same time, the more our economy grew, the lower the tax rates were \ntaken in the rest of the world. Today, American businesses are taxed at \none of the highest rates in the developed world: 35 percent. Meanwhile, \nfor example, Japan's statutory corporate rate is just 23 percent; \nGermany is at 16 percent; Mexico is at 30 percent; the U.K. reduced \ntheirs in 2009 from 30 percent to 19 percent, and they are about to go \nto 17 percent as we speak. As a matter of fact, the average rate in \nEurope is just 18 percent, while in Asia the average corporate tax rate \nis 20 percent.\n  Why is the corporate tax rate so important to an American worker? The \ncorporate tax rate we have in America is the greatest burden the \nAmerican worker has today. Why? Because it makes that American \ncorporation less competitive with the rest of the world. It also makes \nthat American corporation vulnerable to foreign acquisitions of U.S. \ncompanies and then the moving of those headquarters and factories and \njobs offshore.\n  The No. 1 thing we can do for the American worker is to become \ncompetitive from a tax standpoint with the rest of the world. I have \nlived this. I have lived in Asia; I have lived in Europe. I have worked \nhere most of my career, and I know when this gets out of balance, and \nit is out of balance today. We are penalizing the American worker \nbecause of it.\n  It is no secret, a lower corporate tax rate would make us more \ncompetitive globally. Our tax plan fixes this. We are one of the last \ncountries that still has a tax on unrepatriated earnings. In other \nwords, if we have a U.S. company that makes money overseas, it pays \ntaxes over there; when they bring it over here, they have to pay tax \nhere. We are the last country in the world that really has double \ntaxation. We need to end that repatriation tax so\n\n\nthat we can free up almost $3 trillion of U.S. profits overseas and \nbring them back and invest in training, in plants, in facilities, and \nin research and development. Our plan makes that happen.\n  We have an individual tax code that is 2.4 million words in length. \nLet me say that again: 2.4 million words in length. Wasn't that the tax \nsimplification law of 1986? I think it was. It is 2.4 million words in \nlength. That is ridiculous, and it is entirely too complex. We all know \nthat. Our plan will fix this.\n  It is also estimated that, if we can get it enacted, this tax plan \nwill create over 1 million new jobs because of the changes that we are \nenveloping into this Tax Code right now.\n  In addition, it is estimated that the GDP growth will be more like \n3.7 percent, instead of the 1.9 percent we have become used to over the \nlast 8 years. Frankly, I believe there is no reason it can't be \nsignificantly more.\n  We are getting closer to getting this done, but I realize there is a \nlot more to do. It is more important now than ever that we don't get \nbogged down in this Washington dysfunction and gridlock.\n  Last week, I mentioned that many Democrats supported the changes we \nare talking about in the Tax Code, right up until President Trump took \noffice. In fact, over the last several years--in fact, over the last \nseveral decades--many Democrats on the other side of the aisle and \npeople in their place before agreed.\n  This is not a partisan issue. This is about national security, if you \nwant to get right down to it. It is about making America competitive \nagain. Who would be against that? There are decades of quotes from \nDemocrats and Republicans about this issue. This should be a bipartisan \nissue.\n  In 1963, a very famous American made this quote:\n\n       A tax cut means higher family income and higher business \n     profits and a balanced federal budget.\n       Every taxpayer and his family will have more money left \n     over after taxes. . . . Every businessman can keep a higher \n     percentage of his [or her] profits in his [or her] cash \n     register or to put it to work expanding or improving his \n     business, and as the national income grows, the Federal \n     Government will ultimately end up with more revenues.\n\n  That noted American was President John F. Kennedy, in 1963. If he \nwere here today, I think he would admonish all of us to put our \npartisan bickering aside and get something like this done for the \nAmerican people.\n  Another quote:\n\n       I think [the corporate rate] should be lowered. We should \n     try to get it as close to the international average as we \n     can, so we'll [once and for all] be competitive.\n\n  That was Bill Clinton last year, 2016.\n  Another quote:\n\n       Get rid of the loopholes. Level the playing field. And use \n     the savings to lower the corporate tax rate for the first \n     time in 25 years.\n\n  That was President Barack Obama in 2011, believe it or not. This is \nnot a partisan issue.\n  There are more minority party leaders in the House and the Senate who \nhave also come out and spoken on this point:\n\n       Today, 28 OECD countries and every other G-7 country has \n     adopted some form of territorial tax system--and all these \n     countries have lower corporate tax rates than the United \n     States. This means that no matter what jurisdiction a U.S. \n     multinational company is competing in, they are competing at \n     a disadvantage.\n\n  That was the current Senate minority leader in 2015. This is not a \npartisan issue.\n  Another quote: ``It is long past time for tax reform that would lower \nthe corporate tax rate.''\n  That was House Minority Leader Pelosi last year. This is not a \npartisan issue.\n  This tax bill is being done under regular order, including a \ncommittee markup this week, with plenty of amendments, and it will go \nto the floor as soon as we can get it there for debate and more \namendments.\n  I urge all my colleagues: Let's put partisan politics aside once and \nfor all and collaborate through the amendment process to do something \nhistoric, something that American workers deserve, and that is to \nbecome competitive with the rest of the world again. Renew your support \nfor the same tax changes your party has supported for years.\n  I want to close with another quote from an individual I have long \nadmired, President John F. Kennedy, in 1962.\n\n       I repeat: our practical choice is not between a tax-cut \n     deficit and a budget surplus. It is between two kinds of \n     deficits: a chronic deficit of inertia, as the unwanted \n     result of inadequate revenues and a restricted economy, or a \n     temporary deficit of transition, resulting from a tax cut \n     designed to boost the economy, increase tax revenues, and \n     achieve, I believe--and I believe this can be done--a budget \n     surplus. The first type of deficit is a sign of waste and \n     weakness; the second reflects an investment in the future.\n\n  Again, these are words from President John F. Kennedy, while he was \nPresident, in 1962. This is not a partisan issue.\n  Our tax plan is an investment in our future, just as John F. Kennedy \nsaid. It is an investment that will help all Americans.\n  I know there is a lot of disinformation going on: This is only a tax \nbreak for the wealthy, and so forth. When the facts come out--and they \nhave already come out; four Pinocchios have been given to those \ncomments. Our tax plan will prove that when we get into the details.\n  Equally important, getting this tax plan done to help all Americans \nis a critical part of developing a long-term plan to solve the national \ndebt crisis.\n  I am proud to serve here with my colleague from North Carolina, \nSenator Tillis. I think, in North Carolina, they actually did this, and \nthey had the results we are talking about here.", "turn": 9, "speaker": "Mr. PERDUE", "itemno": 9}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "T000476", "text": "  Mr. TILLIS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Georgia and my \ncolleague from Colorado for their comments--and the future comments of \nsome of my colleagues who are in the class of 2014.\n  Ladies and gentlemen, I want to talk a little bit about facts and \nfiction and some of the things we will observe here. In fact, I think \nprobably the Kennedy Center is the only place you can go to see a \nbigger theatrical performance than what you are going to see on this \nfloor over the next couple of weeks, because they are simply not \nconsistent with what we are trying to do here, and I want to talk a \nlittle bit about it. Let's start with some of the fiction.\n  I was just presiding before I came off the dais about 30 minutes ago, \nand I heard a 30-minute speech from someone who said that they haven't \nseen the bill, said that it had been passed in the dark of night, that \nit is not being discussed in committee. But then they went on to have a \n30-minute description of why the bill is bad\n  How could you not have seen something and have such a definitive \nposition on the provisions of the bill? To me, it is just curious.\n  Here is something that is even more curious. There are so many \nMembers--many of them friends--on the other side of the aisle who are \nsimply making a false claim that we are somehow going to raise taxes on \nworking families, the middle class. Why would that make sense? What on \nEarth would the voters of the United States and my voters in North \nCarolina do to me next year if I came out and declared victory because \nI raised taxes on middle-income and working families? It doesn't make \nsense, and it has been proven to be false.\n  The Washington Post has a rating system they use. They call it the \nPinocchio system. One Pinocchio means you are probably stretching the \ntruth a little bit; four Pinocchios means there is not a shred of truth \nin what you are saying. These claims about raising taxes on working \nfamilies and middle-income families earned four Pinocchios; they are \nfiction.\n  What we are trying to do is provide a tax break to the people who \nneed it the most--to the people who are trying to pay their bills, \nstruggling to go to school, actually struggling just to pay the rent. \nThat is what this tax bill is about. This tax cut is about getting the \neconomy back on track so that we can also drive up wages.\n  Not only do we want to provide you with more money in your pocketbook \nand in your wallet at the end of the month by reducing your tax burden, \nbut we also want to make it more likely that you are going to make more \nmoney, you are going to get a better job, and you are going to have \nmore income at the end of this process. I firmly believe that it will \nwork.\n  Let's talk about the facts of this plan. The facts are that we have \nto have tax relief. We have one of the highest corporate tax rates in \nthe world. There is no way the greatest economy that has ever existed \nshould\n\n\nbe one of the least welcoming and least hospitable to job growth. That \nis why we have to reduce the corporate tax rate.\n  We also have to reduce the tax rate on small businesses. Eighty \npercent of all jobs created in North Carolina are created by small \nbusinesses. The people whom the gentleman from Colorado referred to as \n``the rich people'' are small business owners who actually file their \ntaxes through their individual income. So perhaps they have a fair \namount of revenue, but a lot of it has to go to pay for the business, \nand a little bit is left behind for them and their families and their \nemployees. We have to reduce the tax burden on small businesses so that \nthey can create more jobs and, hopefully, some day, become very large \nbusinesses--hopefully, corporations--creating more and more jobs and \nmore opportunities for more workers.\n  At the end of the day, the middle-income tax break is going to be \nsomewhere between $1,500 and $2,000 a year. It will vary a little bit \nfrom State to State, but that is a lot of money in these very difficult \ntimes. More important than that are the opportunities that will be \ncreated through economic growth. That is what I will leave you with. I \nhave seen this happen.\n  First, I have seen the false claims before. They were waged against \nme when I was the speaker of the house in North Carolina, and we had \nthe courage in the middle of a fiscal crisis to cut taxes and grow \njobs. We had all the liberal media, and we had some of my good friends \non the other side of the aisle whom I agreed with on many other issues \nbut who disagreed with us on tax reform. But in North Carolina, no one \nis complaining about the tax reform results. In fact, we have one of \nthe fastest growing State economies in the United States today, after \nbeing in the fourth quartile just 5 or 6 years ago. We have seen our \nmedian incomes go up, and we have seen a number of people lifted out of \npoverty at high levels. I know it works.\n  It is not easy, but it is a promise we made to the American people \nlast year, and it is a promise we are going to keep--this Congress is \ngoing to keep--in the coming weeks. When we do this, then we can start \nworking on an economy that can pay down the debt and make sure that \nthese young people who are pages here and the young people here in the \ngallery right now--you may not know this, but you owe about $70,000, on \naverage, to the Federal Government. That is your share of the national \ndebt. I don't want you to have to pay it back.\n  I want an economy that is growing, that can ultimately resolve our \ndebt problem. But you can do it only by producing growth, you can do it \nonly by becoming economically competitive, and you can do it only by \nlifting the tax burden on businesses and working families so that money \ncan flow back through the private economy and out of the coffers in \nWashington.\n  I thank my colleagues for their hard work on this bill. I look \nforward to voting for the bill. I know it is going to produce a result \nbecause I have seen it produce a result in my experience as speaker of \nthe house. It will work for America. It will be one of the great things \nwe are going to do in this Congress.\n  At this point, again, I thank my colleagues. I am going to pass it \noff to the Senator from Louisiana, Mr. Kennedy.", "turn": 10, "speaker": "Mr. TILLIS", "itemno": 10}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, it does not take a genius to see that \nsomething is stalling the American economy. The economy has been better \nlately, I think, frankly, in anticipation of the Congress's passing \nthese tax cuts. The fact remains that 2016 was the 11th straight year \nthat our economy--the greatest economy in the history of the world and \nthe strongest economy in the history of the world, even when it has the \nflu--failed to achieve 3 percent annual growth, which has been our \naverage every year since 1960.\n  Something is wrong. The experts I have talked about tried everything. \nThey tried monetary policy, changing interest rates. They tried deficit \nspending. Do you remember President Obama's stimulus program? The \nFederal Reserve has tried quantitative easing out the wazoo. The \nexperts have tried everything except what they should have done first; \nthat is, to let the American people keep more of the money they earn, \nbecause they can spend that money they earn better than the government \ncan.\n  We have two groups of policymakers in Washington, DC. I am sorry, but \nthis is what it has come down to. I am not talking about liberals or \nconservatives. I am not talking about Republicans and Democrats. The \ntwo groups I am talking about are as follows. We have one group of \npolicymakers in Washington who believe in more freedom, and we have \nanother group of policymakers in Washington who believe in more free \nstuff.\n  I am not criticizing policymakers for wanting to help people who are \nless fortunate than us. The fact of the matter is that the U.S. \ntaxpayers at the State and the local levels spend $1 trillion a year \nhelping people less fortunate than us. That money didn't just fall from \nheaven. We thank heaven for it, but it came out of people's pockets. We \nspend $1 trillion a year in our country helping people who are less \nfortunate than us. In our country, if you are homeless, we house you. \nIf you are hungry, we feed you. If you are too poor to be sick, we will \npay for your doctor. I am very proud of that. I am not criticizing. In \nfact, I join my colleagues in wanting to help people who are less \nfortunate than us. The fact of the matter is, it takes money, and that \nmoney is generated by the American taxpayer. The American taxpayer is \nnot generating very much because the American taxpayer is not making \nvery much.\n  Let me talk to you about the middle class.\n  I can talk about the business side of this bill, and this is going to \nhelp every business in America. It is going to help C corps, LLCs, Sub \nS corps, family farms, and single proprietorships. It is going to help \nlarge businesswomen and businessmen, and it is going to help small \nbusinesswomen and businessmen.\n  But I want to talk about the personal income tax side. This bill will \ngive a tax cut to just about every American. Our opponents can probably \nfind one or two people under certain circumstances who aren't going to \nget a tax cut, but the fact remains, if you look at the numbers of the \njoint committee on the budget, if you make between $20,000 and $30,000 \na year on average, you are going to get a 10-percent tax cut. If you \nmake between $50,000 and $70,000 a year, you are going to get right \naround a 7-percent tax cut. If you make $1 million or more a year, you \nare going to get roughly a 5-percent tax cut. As for the middle class, \nwe can debate what the middle class is, but I consider the middle class \nto be somewhere between $30,000 and $100,000 a year. You can pick your \nown definition. They are the ones that I am concerned about the most--\nnot exclusively, but the most. Let me tell you what this bill is about \nin terms of the middle class: this, the wallet--their wallet--because \nthe middle class is angry in this country, and they ought to be angry.\n  Every day, they say: Kennedy, I get up every day. I go to work. I \nobey the law. I pay my taxes. I try to do the right thing by my \nchildren. I try to teach my kids morals. I try to save for retirement. \nBut I am getting fed up.\n  They tell me: Kennedy, I look around, and I see a rigged economy. I \nsee too many undeserving people at the top getting bailouts, cutting \ncorners, and making deals. I see too many undeserving people at the \nbottom getting handouts. I am in the middle, and I get stuck with the \nbill. I can't pay it anymore, Kennedy. My health insurance has gone up, \nthanks to the Affordable Care Act, and my kids' tuition has gone up. My \ntaxes have gone up. I will tell you what has not gone up--my income.\n  These are the American people, the middle class. They are busy \nearning a living. They may not read Aristotle every day, but they are \nsmart and they get it. They know the median household income today is \nbasically the same as it was in 1999, and for that, every policy maker \nresponsible for that fact in Washington, DC, and elsewhere ought to \nhide their heads in a bag.\n  This bill is going to fix that, and that is why it is so incredibly \nimportant that we pass it. Yes, it is important for our business \ncommunity. Yes, it is important for the large corporations. Yes, it is \nimportant to repatriate those trillions of dollars. But at the end of \nthe day, it is important primarily for ordinary people, you and me--the \npeople\n\n\nwho get up every day and go to work, obey the law, pay their taxes, and \nmade this country great. They have hurt long enough.\n  Mr. President, I yield to my colleague from Colorado.

Thank you very much.\n  Mr. President, I wish to thank the Senator from Colorado for his \nleadership in bringing us, the class of 2014, to the floor to talk \nabout the commonsense tax reform measure that we have, the opportunity \nof decades to make a difference--a big difference--in many of the lives \nof the people we represent. I would even say most lives.\n  This is about the sixth time I have been to the floor to talk about \nwhat I think is the best tax reform package I have seen in my time here \nand also the different aspects of tax reform that I think are great for \nthe country and great for my State. I represent a small State, the \nsmall State of West Virginia.\n  I have talked about small businesses and families and what it means \nfor them--simplification and creating a competitive environment. But \nthere is nothing like going home and talking to people, whether we are \nat the grocery store or, as in this past week, when we were all in \nVeterans Day parades. People are generally so respectful and very happy \nat a Veterans Day parade. I can't say the same for every parade, but I \nwill say that for the Veterans Day parade, they are generally pretty \nhappy. I was really surprised because I had several constituents--not \njust one or two but several--say to me: Pass this bill; we want tax \nrelief.\n  It was totally unsolicited. So West Virginians are paying attention \nto what we are doing in the Senate.\n  Right now, our colleagues on the Finance Committee are working to \nadvance this bill as early as tomorrow. We are very hopeful that we \nwill be able to consider this bill on the floor of the Senate the week \nwe get back from Thanksgiving, as our colleagues in the House are \npassing their bill this week. Do you know what? It has been \ndisappointing to me and really to everybody, I think, involved in this, \nas tax reform has become a partisan issue, an exercise. We have shared \ngoals. We all want to go to the same place in this country--a \nprosperous place where everybody can thrive and succeed--but to turn \nyour back on what I think is a well-thought-out, much studied plan on \ntax relief, I think, is to turn a blind eye to every working American, \nevery American business, and every American family, and, personally, I \ndon't think it is fair.\n  Our goals are shared by many Americans, regardless of their party, \nbecause we want to grow small businesses. I am in a State where 95 \npercent of our businesses are small businesses. We want to allow those \nsmall businesses to make the decisions to grow employment opportunities \nor raise wages. We want to make our bigger companies competitive \nglobally.\n  People say: You know, what is a big company really going to do for \nme, working and living here in West Virginia?\n  I think if we looked at the major companies that are invested in our \nState, we know that making those companies more competitive will result \nin those companies creating more jobs, investing more capital, buying \nmore products, and raising wages for workers. So making our companies \ncompetitive globally is exceedingly important.\n  I have heard many of my colleagues say that statistics show that many \nAmerican families can't even come up with $400 for an emergency \nexpenditure in their family. That is almost a flat tire and the towing \nexpense to get your car fixed so you can go to work or take your kids \nto school or get to your job and get to your church. I think the tax \nreform bill in the Senate meets many of these objectives.\n  The nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation has found that the bill \nwould provide tax relief to Americans in every single income category, \nwith the largest percent--and this was after working the bill over \nseveral months--going where it should go, which is to the middle-income \nearner.\n  The Tax Foundation has also found that with the Senate bill, as many \nas 925,000 new jobs can be created. That is significant. That is \nsignificant because, I believe, some of those jobs--and I would hope a \ngreat deal of them--would land in the great State of West Virginia.\n  In West Virginia, the studies showed that the average middle-income \nfamily would gain $1,952 in after-tax income, and the job creation for \nthe State of West Virginia would be 4,784 jobs in our State. For some \npeople, that might not sound like very much, but in our State, that is \nsignificant. It is almost 5,000 more jobs. I will take them. We will \ntake them, and we will provide good workers for them, too. And $1,900 \nmore from your taxes is a major infusion of cash into a family, to make \nthe decisions they want, which they make around their kitchen tables, \nnot the decisions that we are making here on the floor.\n  Yesterday I heard from members of the West Virginia Chamber of \nCommerce. Steve Roberts, who is the president of that group, said that \nthe current system is full of ``negative consequences'' and reduces a \nbusiness's ability to hire new workers, invest in inventory and \nequipment, and boost employee pay.\n  These are the hallmarks. What he is saying here is that the \n``negative consequences'' are the hallmarks of what we are fixing and \nwhat we are reforming in this bill. He noted:\n\n       Employers are eager to grow, reinvest and reward employees \n     with better wages. We hope Congress will act quickly to \n     reduce and simplify taxes ensuring a stronger [and] more \n     economically vigorous nation.\n\n  This is something I don't think we talk about, either. If we had \neconomic security in our families and economic security in this \ncountry, we would be stronger in a lot of ways that go beyond being \nstronger economically. In your family, if you have a decision that you \nhave to make and you have to come up with some emergency funds, if you \nhave to borrow or try to figure out a way to make ends meet, it makes \nyou feel weaker. If you can do it yourself, you are stronger. That is \nwhat we are doing in this bill.\n  Also, I want to talk about the transparency here. We are hearing \ncriticisms that this is coming in the dead of night, that nobody has \never heard of it. Nothing could be further from the truth. The Finance \nCommittee alone has held 70 hearings on this since the year 2011. \nSenators from both parties have had the opportunity to weigh in, \nexperts from both inside the Capitol and outside the Capitol. Right \nnow, it is undergoing a full markup in committee, and the House has \ngone through the same procedure. This has been done in the total light \nof day. This is how legislation is made. So I am very pleased that \nthese tax reform principles in this bill are moving through our Senate.\n\n  We know that the President is very enthusiastic about this. He will \nsign a bill that will grow our economy and benefit whom he wants it to \nbenefit and whom we all want it to--middle-income families.\n  Each Senator has a choice here. We all have our choices. My friends \nfrom South Dakota and Oklahoma and Louisiana and Colorado, who are on \nthe floor with me, as well as the Presiding Officer, who is from \nArkansas, have choices every day. You can either cling to the status \nquo and say that, yes, everything is working well or you could really \ngrab this and say that this is good--this is good policy; this is good \npolitics; it will make our country stronger and our families stronger. \nThis will help our small businesses thrive, create more jobs, and raise \nwages. Above all else, this will benefit our families. I think that it \nallows for more growth and more opportunity.\n  The people whom I represent want this. They want to have more of \ntheir money at the end of the day to be able to make their own \ndecisions. They want their good, hard work rewarded. They want to see a \ncountry that grows and is optimistic and is strong and powerful. \nEconomic strength can give us that.\n  I just heard from a 70-year-old postal worker from Wheeling, WV. He \nwrote to me: ``The Senate needs to get these tax cuts and tax reform \ndone.'' That is the simple way that most people communicate in this \ncountry. I understand that. I hope our friends on the other side of the \naisle understand that.\n\n\n  It would be great to have us join together as a Senate, as a country, \nto do something we know is going to have the right consequences and the \nright results of growing this country and providing the relief that \npeople want with a well-studied process, with well-researched data, and \nwith the power of the American people behind us.\n  Thank you.\n  I now yield to my colleague from Colorado and thank him again for \nleading this.", "turn": 14, "speaker": "Mrs. CAPITO", "itemno": 14}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "G000562", "text": "  Mr. GARDNER.

Mr. President, our economy has been stuck between 1.4- \nand 1.9-percent growth over the last 10 years. Compare that to the 10-\nyear cycles before that, over and over again, all the way back to the \nGreat Depression. Every group in a 10-year block was at 3 percent or \nmore growth. Literally, we have had half the growth in our economy over \nthe last 10 years than we have had in any 10-year time period, going \nall the way back to the Great Depression. We have to be able to deal \nwith that.\n  I hear people over and over again say that regulations are choking \nour businesses and are driving up the cost of products for consumers. \nYet our Tax Code is full of loopholes, and it is full of confusion. It \nis complicated. When I go through to fill out my individual taxes, it \nseems as though there are deductions for everybody else but for me, and \npeople want to get that fixed. Quite frankly, no one likes paying \ntaxes, and everyone wants to make sure that whatever taxes they pay are \nspent efficiently and are the lowest possible. I cannot tell them that \nright now because the spending is not on track and is not efficient. I \nalso cannot tell them that they are as low as possible. We need to fix \nthat.\n  The tax reform that we are discussing in the Senate right now deals \nwith some very basic things. It begins with more take-home pay for \nindividuals. You can either be paid more by an employer or you can be \ntaxed less by the government. Either one of those increases the take-\nhome pay. This solves the ``tax less'' by the government so that \nindividuals can have more take-home pay--around $100 a month. That is \nserious money for most Oklahomans to have going back to their families.\n  The way that happens is by starting with the standard deduction that \ndoubles, which is $24,000. To say it flat, if you make between zero and \n$24,000 as a family, you wouldn't have any tax at all on that first \n$24,000. That is a great help. Your tax does not even begin at all \nuntil after $24,000. You would be in that zero percent bracket.\n  We double the Child Tax Credit. For families who are raising kids, it \nis exceptionally helpful for them to have a larger tax credit.\n  Then we take out the individual mandate in ObamaCare.\n  We have already had folks who have asked: What does ObamaCare have to \ndo with tax policy?\n  Let me tell you, very simply, that the individual mandate is a tax. \nThat is what the Supreme Court labeled it as, and that is what \nindividuals understand it to be. If you don't buy the type of insurance \nof which Washington, DC, approves--and you may sign up for different \ninsurance--you will get an additional tax penalty on your taxes.\n  Who pays for that?\n  In Oklahoma, 81 percent of the people who pay the individual mandate \ntax penalty make $50,000 or less a year. It is a tax aimed directly at \nthe middle class.\n  I think that this is unfair. We want to remove that tax penalty from \nthe middle class and say that they do not have that penalty and that \nthey are allowed to buy insurance they can actually afford.\n  What does this mean for jobs?\n  If small businesses have a better Tax Code and their passthroughs, \nthen they are able to hire additional people. That means more jobs.\n  Based on where our economy is right now, the unemployment rate has \ncontinued to drop over the last several years. At the spot it is right \nnow, that means that there is more competition; there is more hiring; \nand more people have to compete for those jobs. That means that \nemployers have to pay a little bit more money to get the people to be \nable to do it. That raises wages for people all around the country and \nmeans additional people who are not working will actually get back to \nwork. With more people working and actually paying taxes, it pays for \nitself.\n  Getting a growing economy going is essential to us. The way you do \nthat is you take care of the Tax Code for small businesses, and you \ntake care of the Tax Code for corporate businesses.\n  I have had folks who have asked me: If you drop the corporate rate \nfrom 35 percent to 20 percent, what does that really do?\n  Again, it allows those big companies, as well as the small companies, \nto hire more people, to engage in more investment, to build more \nfactories, and to buy more machinery. That is what it allows them to be \nable to do to grow their businesses. Yet, on the international stage \nright now, our Tax Code is 35 percent. Compare that to those in other \ncountries that are somewhere around 22, 23, 24 percent. Some of them \nare less than that.\n  Let me make this simple. If you are going online to buy a shirt and \nif you can see that shirt for $20 on one website or $35 on another \nwebsite, where do you buy the shirt? It will probably be from the one \nthat is selling it for $20. If you are starting a business or founding \na business, and you can go to one spot where the tax rate is 20 percent \nor to another spot where it is 35 percent, guess where you will found \nthe business. It will be where it is lower.\n  We are the higher rate right now. If we don't fix that, businesses \nare going to continue to move overseas. We can make fun of them in the \nnews. We can yell at them and tell them that they are un-American, but \nthey are going to continue to move where they pay less, exactly as \nevery American does with his online shopping. That is fixable.\n  In the middle of all of this, we have to deal with the debt and \ndeficit. We cannot ignore that reality. The things that I am still \ngoing through in the proposal that we are working through right now are \nthe things that are unrealistic in the proposal because, at the end of \nthe day, we have to get the economy growing again, but we have to deal \nwith half a trillion dollars in overspending from this government right \nnow. We can do both. We have to be able to do both.\n  I am encouraging this body to take seriously a proposal to be able to \ndeal with how we get our economy going again. Let's figure out how to \nget it done, and then let's actually solve this for the American \npeople.\n  I yield to the Senator from South Dakota.", "turn": 17, "speaker": "Mr. LANKFORD", "itemno": 17}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "R000605", "text": "  Mr. ROUNDS.

Mr. President, the last 8 years were really hard for a \nlot of families. They have seen their wages stagnate and their benefits \nnot go up. Indeed, what they have been paying for health insurance and \nflood insurance and many other things has risen even though their wages \nhave not. So the goal of this bill is to decrease taxes on those \nmiddle-income, working families in order to give them the opportunity \nto have better wages, better benefits, and to bring relief to \nsituations that are peculiar. Are they peculiar to Louisiana? No, they \nare not peculiar to Louisiana, and I will elaborate on that in just a \nsecond.\n  What could middle-class families in Louisiana do with better wages? \nThey could pay off debt. They could provide more for their children. \nThey could just live life a little bit more robustly and not have to, \nperhaps, move out of one home and into another because they can no \nlonger afford the mortgage on the first. The goal of this is, first, to \nbring tax relief to working families and middle-class families. It is \nall part of an effort to cut taxes particularly for them.\n  Now let's talk about raising their wages. Folks want to have more \nmoney in their take-home pay after taxes, but\n\n\nthey also want to have higher wages and better benefits. This bill \ndefinitely creates that.\n  Our current Tax Code encourages companies to move overseas. When they \nearn money overseas, they keep it there and build plants and factories \nin other countries. They employ folks in other countries but do not \nbring that money home, employ Americans, or raise wages or give better \nbenefits to those Americans. This changes that. Not only do we have tax \ncuts for the middle class, for working families, but we also encourage \nbusinesses to invest here, to create better paying jobs here.\n  I have heard some say: Well, wait a second. Unemployment is low now. \nWhy does it matter?\n  Now is the time when workers most benefit if there is investment that \ncreates more opportunity for those here in the United States. If there \nis a worker who is a welder and if he can either work here or there, \nbusinesses are going to bid for his services. They are going to pay \nmore to get him to work. As they do that, just from supply and demand, \nwages will go up for the average American worker, for the average \nAmerican family. Benefits will rise for those families, and the \nchildren of those families will have more opportunity. This is what \nthat is about.\n  There is another way in which we bring relief to those middle-income \nfamilies. Part of what we are doing here is repealing the mandate of \nthe Affordable Care Act. Americans hate the government's telling them \nwhat to do. Yet, as part of the ObamaCare mandate, it tells someone: \nEven if you cannot afford that insurance, even if you don't buy it, we \nare going to make you pay a fine.\n  In 2015, more than 100,000 folks in Louisiana paid a fine for not \nhaving health insurance, and 37 percent--almost 40 percent--of those \nfolks had an adjusted gross income of less than $25,000; 78 percent had \nless than $50,000. Think about this. The families who report incomes of \n$50,000 or less cannot afford insurance, and they are having to pay a \nfine because they have not. They are not millionaires or billionaires. \nThese are families who are trying to make ends meet, who make a \ndecision because the exchange policies are too expensive for them to \nbuy, and now they are getting fined. This is part of the relief we are \nbringing to those working families by getting rid of that mandate.\n  Lastly, there is another form of relief. Louisiana had its great \nflood of 2016, which was similar to Maria, Irma, and Harvey, but this \nwas an unnamed storm that affected tens of thousands of people. Through \nthis bill, we bring disaster relief to the folks in Louisiana. They \nwill be able to deduct their losses from their incomes, which will \nallow them to rebuild their homes and allow them to rebuild their \nbusinesses. As they rebuild those businesses, it will allow them to \nemploy those who need jobs so that they may rebuild their homes and \ntheir lives.\n  This bill will cut taxes for those families. It will increase their \nwages and bring relief not only from economic stagnation but also from \na natural disaster that was one of the most expensive storms in our \nNation's history.\n  I am very pleased that this bill is advancing, and I look forward to \nit being passed. I look forward, most of all, to the increased wages, \nlower taxes, and the relief that it will bring to those families in \nLouisiana.\n  I now yield the floor to the Senator from South Dakota.", "turn": 20, "speaker": "Mr. CASSIDY", "itemno": 20}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "R000605", "text": "  Mr. ROUNDS.

A lot of my colleagues are \nfrom the class of 2014.\n  Mr. President, there has been a theme in this colloquy. We have been \ntalking about economic growth and about this challenge of what I have \nbeen referring to as a lost decade of economic growth. When talking \nabout tax reform, we have to go back through the history and see what \nis meant by a lost decade.\n  I have been coming down to the floor for a couple of years now with \nthis chart. This chart says a lot. This chart looks at the history of \nthe United States and where we have been with regard to economic \ngrowth. It is bipartisan--Democratic and Republican administrations--\nshowing decade after decade, starting with Presidents Eisenhower, \nKennedy, Johnson, Nixon, and what this chart states is that right now, \nsomething is wrong.\n  When we talk about GDP growth, GDP growth is a proxy for the health \nof the economy. Unfortunately, we have had a sick economy. GDP growth \nis a proxy for the American dream, and unfortunately I think that a lot \nof people over the last 10 years started to worry about whether it was \nsomething that can be obtained.\n  Let's look at the chart. Every administration, Democratic or \nRepublican, shows strong levels of growth. My colleagues were talking \nabout at least 3 percent or higher since the Great Depression. Some of \nthese years, during Kennedy and Johnson, right here, the red line is at \n3 percent, which is not great, but it is pretty good. Looking at Reagan \nand Carter, there were years in which we were growing at 4, 5, 6, and 7 \npercent.\n  The pages are looking at this chart, and they don't even know what \nthat means. They don't know what that means because of what has \nhappened over the last 12 years. Boom. Look at this. Everything is \nunder 3 percent for the entire Obama administration years. It never hit \n3 percent GDP growth--not once.\n  We want to talk about what makes America great. If we want to see \nwhat makes America great, look at these years of growth. It doesn't \nmatter whether it was Democratic or Republican--3, 4, 5, 8 percent \nduring the Johnson administration. Now look--3 percent.\n  What is surprising to me is that nobody talks about this issue. \nNobody talks about this issue of a lost decade of growth. Certainly, \nunfortunately, my colleagues--I have been here 3 years. I don't think I \nhave heard my colleagues once come down to the Senate floor and say: \nHoly cow, we have to fix this lost decade of growth, this sick economy. \nThe proxy for the American dream is going away, and nobody talks about \nit.\n  Former Senator and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton recently wrote \na book titled ``What Happened.'' Well, I think what happened is that \nthere has been no growth for over 10 years, and nobody was talking \nabout it. I think a lot of people in this country said: I am not going \nto throw away the American dream.\n  I believe in the American dream. The American dream means we have to \nstart growing at traditional levels of U.S. economic growth, at least \nabove this depicted red line of 3 percent. I am optimistic because \nright now, for the first time in a long time, this body is very focused \non this issue with policies that will hopefully get us there, including \ntax reform, regulatory reform, taking advantage of our huge energy \nopportunities, and many other measures. That is why this discussion and \nthis debate we are having now with regard to tax reform is so \ncritical--tax relief for middle-class families, tax relief for small \nbusinesses. And this bill, as we have heard, has many provisions that \nwe think are going to help jump-start this economy and get us back to \nat least 3 percent growth, at least this number where the red line is \nthat we haven't seen in well over a decade.\n  The kinds of policies that we are pursuing now, that the White House \nis focused on--tax reform, energy, permitting reform--I would think and \nhope that every Member of this body views this as probably the most \nimportant thing we can do--growing the U.S. economy with policies that \nhave widespread support across the country. They certainly have support \nin my State of Alaska.\n  I am also optimistic because the Trump administration is off to a \ngood start. This chart goes to the end of the Obama administration, and \nwe can see that we never came even close to 3 percent. But the last two \nquarters of 2017,\n\n\nwe actually hit 3 percent--3.1 percent and 3 percent. We are off to a \ndecent start.\n  But this body must do much more, and I am hopeful that my colleagues \non the other side of the aisle will come down and talk about how \nimportant this is because every American agrees with this. Growing the \neconomy again and tax reform are going to be critical components of \ngetting us there.\n  I say to Senator Rounds, I appreciate the opportunity to say a few \nwords on this important topic.

Mr. President, thank you very much.\n  Mr. President, I appreciate the point made by the Senator from South \nDakota, and I am glad to join in this conversation this afternoon.\n  About a decade ago, the worst economic recession since the Great \nDepression devastated our middle class households and families across \nthe country. In its aftermath, our economy consistently underachieved.\n  Last year, the United States saw less than a 2-percent increase in \nthe amount of goods and services we produce. The reason is our stagnant \neconomy, which suffers from an outdated tax system that stifles \neconomic growth through high tax rates and an unreasonable compliance \nburden. Small businesses, which I am partial to because they make up \nabout 97 percent of employers in Iowa, are taxed as much as 44.6 \npercent on their profits. Every year, these job creators spend over $18 \nbillion just to comply with Federal tax laws and regulations.\n  Middle-class families and individuals around this country need some \nrelief. By streamlining our cumbersome tax system and eliminating \nloopholes that primarily benefit the wealthy, Congress has an \nopportunity to lower tax rates for middle and lower income wage \nearners. Likewise, by creating a more competitive tax system for \nbusinesses, we can foster greater growth and investment in the United \nStates and boost wages for more Iowans.\n  Tax reform also provides Congress with an opportunity to lead by \nexample and offer up its own unnecessary tax break. That is why I \nintroduced the Stop Questionable, Unnecessary, and Excessive Allowances \nfor Legislators Act, also known as the SQUEAL Act. This legislation \nwould eliminate a provision of the Tax Code that allows Members of \nCongress to deduct up to $3,000 annually in living expenses that they \nincur while in Washington, DC. As we seek to achieve the ultimate goal \nof lowering rates for families and small businesses, Congress should \nstart by eliminating handouts to our politicians.\n  It is long overdue for our country to pursue a simpler tax code that \nprovides much needed relief for hard-working Iowans and that puts our \neconomy back on track. I look forward to working with my colleagues on \na path forward that reduces the burden of a complicated tax system--the \nburden that is placed upon our families, our hard-working individuals, \nand our small businesses.\n  With that, I will turn the floor back over to the distinguished \nMember from South Dakota, and I thank him for accommodating the Members \nof our class.

Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to \nexpress my appreciation to the Senator from Iowa for her remarks. Once \nagain, we call this midwestern common sense.\n  Let me finish this colloquy today with a few thoughts.\n  First of all, we want tax reform, but what we want first is a \nhealthier economy. That is what the people of the United States want. \nThey want the ability to compete. Over the last 10 years, there have \nbeen 4,700 businesses that have left our shores and moved overseas. The \nreason is that they can survive better by leaving our country and going \nsomeplace else because of the tax consequences of doing so.\n  When we talk about the direction in which we want to go in this \ncountry, we want the people of America to understand that our goal with \nthis entire package is to make things better for the American public. \nThat means a healthier economy for them. It also means, by doing so, \nthat they will see the bottom line in their own pockets--more money \nthat they can spend that otherwise would go to the Federal Government.\n  At the same time, businesses that may have left and taken their jobs \nand the opportunities to invest their dollars--we want them back in the \nUnited States again, hiring more people and paying better wages. We \nthink that over the last 10 years, the American public hasn't seen \nthose higher wages because the competition for jobs has moved offshore \ninto other parts of the world where there is a more competitive tax \nclimate.\n  There is something else we have to point out. We recognize at the \nFederal level that we have a deficit and that we have not been able to \nbreak that deficit.\n  Today we have a deficit that is in excess of $500 billion. Out of the \n$4.1 trillion in total payments that are out there, that we spend on an \nannual basis, our omnibus bill, as we call it--that is for the defense \nand nondefense discretionary side of the formula--we vote on $1.1 \ntrillion of the $4 trillion. There is about $3 trillion that is \nautomatic, that is on auto pilot--Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security, \ninterest on the debt.\n  If we want to close that gap, then we have to see an economy which is \ngrowing, an economy which can support the programs that we believe are \nnecessary, the safety nets that we in America have decided are very \nappropriate for those who have no place else to go. If we want to close \nthe deficit, we need to have more revenues coming in. The only way we \ncan pick up more revenues is by having an economy that is strong enough \nto support that.\n  By actually reducing taxes, we bring in more businesses, and those \nbusinesses will make more profits. We are able to lower the rate of tax \non profits, and that is returned to the American people in a number of \nways--a lower tax burden through lower personal income taxes and \nthrough subchapter C and S corporations, through lower business taxes.\n  Finally and just as importantly, in terms of how we support the \noperations of government, we support that because with a growing \neconomy, the revenue coming from that growing economy can be utilized \nto eliminate the debt, which is a threat to our national defense.\n  Mr. President, at this time, I thank my colleagues who have patiently \nworked their way through this process.

I think, on this side, we are just a little bit less \nsure that you grow the economy by growing the share of the economy that \ngoes to the superrich and to big corporations or that you grow the \neconomy by growing benefits to corporations that move jobs from America \noverseas, and I am pretty confident that on our side we don't believe \nthe\n\n\nsolution to the deficit is a tax bill that raises the deficit.\n\n\n                             Climate Change\n\n  Mr. President, I am here to talk about the U.N. Climate Change \nConference that we just got back from in Germany, where the United \nStates stood alone as the only Nation in the world--Syria and Nicaragua \nhaving left us--not a party to the historic Paris Agreement. Led by \nSenator Cardin, my colleagues Senators Markey, Schatz, Merkley, and I \nwent to Bonn to tell the nations gathered there that the Trump \nadministration does not represent American views on this issue, nor \nAmerican determination to tackle the climate challenge. It was not just \nus who went there to say we are still in. American Governors, mayors, \nuniversities, and major corporations all brought the same message that \nnotwithstanding the Trump administration's efforts to separate us from \nthe Paris goal, we are still in.\n  The urgency of the experts at our Nation's universities and Federal \nagencies is reflected in a major multi-agency climate report that was \nreleased last week and makes an astounding contrast to the position \ntaken by the Trump administration. The ``Climate Science Special \nReport'' will serve as the scientific backbone for the ``Fourth \nNational Climate Assessment'' due next year. The authors list is a \nwho's who of top university scientists and Agency experts from NOAA, \nthe EPA, NASA, our National Labs, the National Science Foundation, and \nthe Departments of Agriculture, Defense, Energy, Commerce, Interior, \nand State--in all, 13 Federal Agencies and Departments. This report was \nalso peer-reviewed by our American National Academy of Sciences. The \nNew York Times properly described it as ``the United States' most \ndefinitive statement on climate change science.''\n  The report wastes no time getting to the heart of what is causing \nclimate change. It states:\n\n       This assessment concludes, based on extensive evidence, \n     that it is extremely likely that human activities, especially \n     emissions from greenhouse gases, are the dominant cause of \n     the observed warming since the mid-20th century.\n\n  It goes on to say:\n\n       The magnitude of climate change beyond the next few decades \n     will depend primarily on the amount of greenhouse gases \n     (especially carbon dioxide) emitted globally.\n\n  Further it says:\n\n       There is broad consensus that the further and faster the \n     Earth system is pushed towards warming, the greater the risk \n     of unanticipated changes and impacts, some of which are \n     potentially large and irreversible.\n\n  In a 2016 interview, President Trump said there is ``some \nconnectivity'' between human activity and climate change, but, he said, \n``you can make lots of cases for different views.'' Well, the President \nought to read his administration's own report. There is more than just \n``some connectivity.'' To quote the report, ``For the warming over the \nlast century, there is no convincing alternative explanation supported \nby the extent of the observational evidence,'' but this \nadministration's industry hacks are not paying attention, and instead \nof helping, they are out busily doing things like deleting the words \n``climate change'' from Agency websites. The Washington Post reported \nin September that EPA public affairs officer John Kronkus ``told staff \nthat he is on the lookout for `the double C-word'--climate change--and \nrepeatedly has instructed grant officers to eliminate references to the \nsubject in solicitations.''\n  Maybe they think if they crawl under the bed and scrub out the words \n``climate change,'' the scientific phenomenon will disappear, but in \nscience it actually doesn't work that way.\n  Over at the Department of Energy is Secretary Rick Perry, who called \nclimate change a ``contrived, phony mess'' in his 2010 book. He \nbacktracked his position in his January confirmation hearings but still \nsaid he ``believe[s] some of it is naturally occurring, but some of it \nis also man-made activity.'' Well, the Energy Secretary might want to \nread the report. Manmade activity is not some of it; it is the dominant \ncause.\n  Then there is EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt, who said about human \nactivity causing climate change: ``There's tremendous disagreement \nabout the degree of impact, so no, I would not agree that it's a \nprimary contributor to the global warming that we see.'' The EPA \nAdministrator needs to read the report too. He is wrong and wrong. \n``Dominant'' is what the report says with ``no convincing \nalternative.''\n  If Perry or Pruitt bothered to look at the report their staffs helped \nwrite, they would see this graph: ``Human Activities Are the Primary \nDriver of Recent Global Temperature Rise.'' This is the human activity \ncolumn, this is solar effects, and this is volcanic effects.\n  Every once in a while somebody says: Oh, it is the volcanoes that are \ndoing it; it is not us. It turns out volcanoes are actually having a \nslight cooling effect.\n  People say: No, it is solar radiation; it is not us. You can barely \nsee the amount of solar radiation warming.\n  All of this is human-caused climate change. It is more than dominant. \nYou can barely see other factors up against it.\n  As for Pruitt's claim that humans are not ``a primary contributor to \nthe global warming that we see,'' well, you can turn to the report's \npage 31: ``Human activities are now the dominant cause of the observed \ntrends in climate.'' Flip forward to page 36, and it states: ``Many \nlines of evidence demonstrate human activities, especially emissions of \ngreenhouse gases, are primarily responsible.''\n  So, Administrator Pruitt, humans are not a primary contributor. The \nactual science shows ``human activities, especially emissions of \ngreenhouse gases, are primarily responsible for the observed climate \nchanges in the Industrial era, especially over the last six decades.''\n  You could flip to the next page where it says: ``[T]here are no \nsuggested factors, even speculative ones that can explain the timing or \nmagnitude'' of what is happening in the climate or ``that would somehow \ncancel out the role of human factors.''\n  Just last week, Kathleen Hartnett White rolled into the Environment \nand Public Works Committee out of the President's climate denial clown \ncar. White is a prolific climate denier from the fossil fuel-funded \nTexas Public Policy Foundation. She wrote that carbon pollution in the \natmosphere is ``unquestionably a huge social benefit.'' Unquestionably \na huge social benefit? OK. She also compared climate science to a \n``cult,'' which kind of lines her up a little bit with that Heartland \nInstitute that has compared climate scientists to the Unabomber, just \nto give you an idea of the intellectual rigor of the climate denial \narguments. Now she is up for consideration as chair of the White House \nCouncil on Environmental Quality.\n  In responding to our questions, Ms. White was, let's just say, a \nlittle at a loss. She responded, for instance, that she has ``a very \nsuperficial understanding'' of ocean issues. She said on ocean \nacidification that there ``are different perspectives'' and that \nacidity ``changes up and down are not inherently a problem.'' Well, \nKathleen Hartnett White needs to read this report too.\n  According to the Climate Science Special Report, ``The world's oceans \nare currently absorbing more than a quarter of the CO2 \nemitted to the atmosphere annually from human activities, making them \nmore acidic . . . with potential detrimental impacts to marine \necosystems.''\n  How much more acidic are the oceans being made by the absorption of \nCO2? The report goes on to say that ``the rate of \nacidification is unparalleled in at least the 66 million years.''\n  Sixty-six million years is way before humankind even existed. That is \nthe kind of dice we are rolling with ocean acidification.\n  I pressed Ms. White on how much of the heat greenhouse gas emissions \nadd to the atmosphere is absorbed by the oceans. She couldn't even tell \nme if it was more or less than half of it. Yet she insisted she knew \nthere ``are differences of opinion on that, that there's not one right \nanswer.'' So, in a nutshell, she doesn't know what the science is, but \nshe sure knows that it is wrong.\n  Well, there actually is one right answer, and wouldn't you know it, \nit is in the Climate Science Special Report, which says: ``Not only has \nocean heat content increased dramatically, but more than 90 percent of \nthe energy gained in the combined ocean-atmosphere system over recent \ndecades has\n\n\ngone into the ocean.'' In fact, to be more precise, it is 93 percent. \nBy the way, that is heating the oceans at a rate greater than setting \noff a Hiroshima-style nuclear bomb in the oceans and having all of the \nheat of the nuclear explosion absorbed by the oceans, more than one \nexplosion per second. So it is quite a heat transfer.\n  I asked Ms. White about a basic scientific principle: Do you think if \nthe ocean warms it expands? Does the law of thermal expansion apply to \nseawater?\n  After a long pause, she replied, ``Again, I do not have any kind of \nexpertise or even such layman's study of the ocean dynamics and the \nclimate change issues.'' For somebody who wants to lead the White House \nCouncil on Environmental Quality and help guide the science in this \narea, it is a pretty rudimentary scientific principle that water \nexpands as it warms. If you can't grasp that, good luck grasping the \nrisks that sea level rise poses to coastal communities like ours in \nRhode Island.\n  The ``Climate Science Special Report'' states that ``it is virtually \ncertain that sea level rise this century and beyond will pose a growing \nchallenge to coastal communities, infrastructure, and ecosystems.'' \nRhode Island has coastal communities, infrastructure, and ecosystems so \nthis challenge is very real for my home State.\n  Climate change, sea level rise, and ocean acidification are \nchallenges that require smart leadership and initiative. We need to \ntake action to bolster our infrastructure, fortify our coasts, and help \ncommunities prepare for those challenges on the horizon. Instead, in \nthis administration, we get the likes of Perry, Pruitt, and White.\n  I wish ignorance were what is driving these administration officials. \nIgnorance can be rectified with education, with information. We could \nassign them to read the ``Climate Science Special Report,'' for \ninstance. They might find it illuminating and realize that what they \nhave been saying is factually false. Unfortunately, it is a much more \nnefarious condition than ignorance that afflicts this administration on \nclimate change, and it is a condition that cannot be cured with facts.\n\n  This is about fossil fuel money. The malady of fossil fuel money in \npolitics is what prevents the stark warnings in the ``Climate Science \nSpecial Report'' from being a call to action in Congress.\n  In Bonn at the COP23 gathering, we saw that the rest of the world is \nnot turning a blind eye to climate change. The rest of the world is \nconfronting it head-on, along with many American States, many American \ncities, major American corporations, and virtually every major American \nuniversity. Those are all very hopeful signs.\n  While our President and his administration have bound themselves to \nthe fossil fuel polluters, the American people have not. Rhode \nIslanders and Americans everywhere care deeply about getting ahead of \nthis problem--about achieving the goals of the U.N. framework. And the \nAmerican people will carry forward American leadership in combating \nclimate change, no matter how evil the continuing influence of the \nfossil fuel industry is in Congress.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.", "turn": 28, "speaker": "Mr. WHITEHOUSE", "itemno": 28}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, the Senate Finance Committee is working \nthis week on the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. It is a very important piece of \nlegislation that the country is looking forward to having passed.\n  This is a Republican plan to give tax relief to the American people. \nJust as the name of the legislation says, it actually addresses both \nissues: tax cuts and jobs.\n  First of all, the legislation will cut the taxes for American \nworkers. One of the biggest cuts in the plan is that it roughly doubles \nthe standard deduction that people take. Right now, the standard \ndeduction for a married couple is about $12,000. If we double it, \npeople will not pay any Federal income taxes at all on the first \n$24,000 they earn. That is a big tax cut. It is aimed squarely at lower \nincome and middle-income families in this country.\n  A lot of people will decide to take this deduction instead of going \nthrough the painstaking process of itemizing deductions on their income \ntax returns. It saves people a lot of time. It also saves them the cost \nof accountants and lawyers who help them figure out the complicated \ntaxes that they end up paying in this country each year.\n  Republicans are also working to preserve other deductions that are \nimportant to American families. When we put all of these together, we \nare going to cut taxes for people and put money back in their pockets \ninstead of sending it to Washington.\n  The second thing to know about this tax relief legislation is that it \nis going to be a big boost for jobs in America. In fact, it will help \nAmerica create more than 900,000 new jobs.\n  It is also going to lead to higher pay. That is because the \nlegislation will cut the taxes that small businesses have to pay. Small \nbusinesses create most of the jobs in America. If we let them keep more \nof their money, they can hire people and grow their businesses. That is \nwhat happens in this country. That is how our economy works; people \nhiring people matter to grow the economy. They can also give workers a \nraise and offer better benefits. When Washington takes less and \nbusinesses keep more, workers are better off every time.\n  Republicans also want to bring down the rates that Washington charges \nother businesses. A lot of people work for small businesses, but a lot \nof people also work for large businesses as well. If we are able to cut \ntaxes for those businesses, then those workers can get the same raise. \nHow much more money are we talking about? Well, according to the Tax \nFoundation, it amounts to about $2,600 for a typical middle-income \nfamily. That is what you get when you combine the tax cut and the pay \nraise that people will see across the country. For that family, an \nextra $2,600 is going to be a very big deal. A majority of Americans \nsay that they don't have enough savings today to cover a $500 emergency \nexpense if one came up.\n  Millions of American families will be far better off because of the \ntax relief that Republicans are working on this week. It will boost the \neconomy, help individual workers, and help their families. This is \nabout tax cuts, and it is about jobs. That is how you keep the economy \ngrowing. That is how we keep American families thriving.\n\n\n                      Protecting Veteran Memorials\n\n  Mr. President, I also want to speak about an issue that is very \nimportant to our veterans in Wyoming and across the country. The 2018 \nNational Defense Authorization Act conference report includes a \nprovision that allows America's veteran memorials to be used as a \npolitical bargaining chip. I think it is a very bad idea.\n  There is a specific provision in this report that allows the \nSecretary of Defense to dismantle a veteran memorial and move it to a \nforeign nation.\n  We have one of these memorials at the F.E. Warren Air Force Base in \nCheyenne, WY. This memorial honors American soldiers who were massacred \nmore than 100 years ago in a town called Balangiga in the Philippines. \nOn September 28, 1901, a group of 400 Filipino insurgents, armed with \nmachetes, attacked American soldiers in Company C of the 9th Infantry. \nIt was a sneak attack while the Americans were mostly unarmed and \nhaving breakfast.\n  The insurgents signaled the attack by ringing the bells of the local \nchurch. Company C had 75 soldiers, and 48 of them were killed in this \nattack or died of their wounds or went missing in action. It was the \nworst defeat for the American Army since the Battle of the Little \nBighorn in 1876. These bells were used in an act of war against \nAmerican soldiers.\n  The Army legally brought the bells back to America to honor the \ntroops of Company C who were lost in this massacre. The 11th Infantry \nRegiment brought them to Cheyenne, WY, and today the bells of Balangiga \nare part of the memorial at F.E. Warren Air Force Base.\n  Over the years, the Department of Defense and the State Department \nhave tried a few times to move these\n\n\nbells to the Philippines. In 2012, President Obama's Department of \nDefense even tried to cover up the fact that it was secretly making \nplans to move the bells. I have opposed these efforts every step of the \nway.\n  The majority of veterans in Wyoming oppose dismantling this veteran \nmemorial. The Wyoming Veterans of Foreign Wars and the American Legion \nhave both passed resolutions against moving the bells. The American \nLegion has also taken a stand on the national level. It has opposed the \nremoval and encouraged Congress to pass legislation to protect veteran \nmemorials.\n  During the confirmation hearing for Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, \nI asked him specifically about the bells of Balangiga. He made a \ncommitment to me that he would include Congress and our veteran \norganizations in any conversations regarding war memorials.\n  I recently received a letter from the State Department, and they said \nthat they are unaware of any plans to move the bells to a foreign \ncountry. We need to make sure that no plans ever develop.\n  This conference report will take away any lines of communication \nbetween the administration and the Congress on this issue. America \nneeds to make clear that we will never stop honoring our war dead, no \nmatter where or when they sacrificed. To dismantle this memorial would \nbe an insult to the memory of the men who were massacred that day in \nthe Philippines.\n  Wyoming has a strong tradition of honoring our veterans, especially \nthose who gave their lives. The United States should not be using our \nveteran memorials as bargaining chips to negotiate with foreign \nnations. For these reasons, I oppose section 2864 of the conference \nreport on the National Defense Authorization Act.\n  I will continue my work to protect our veteran memorials. I will \ncontinue to use my voice for the soldiers of Company C who have no \nvoice of their own.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the following be printed \nin the Record: the names of the 48 soldiers who were massacred in 1901; \na letter from the Wyoming Veterans of Foreign Wars; a resolution from \nthe Wyoming American Legion in opposition to moving the bells; National \nAmerican Legion Resolution No. 56; a letter from the National American \nLegion in support of Barrasso amendment No. 738; a letter from the \nState Department saying that they are currently not planning to move \nthe bells; and Secretary Tillerson's commitment to include Congress and \nour veterans in any discussion of our veteran memorials", "turn": 32, "speaker": "Mr. BARRASSO", "itemno": 32}, {"kind": "recorder", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in ", "turn": -1, "speaker": "The RECORDER", "itemno": 33}, {"kind": "recorder", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "the Record, as follows:\n\n   U.S. Army Casualties at Balangiga, Samar, Philippine Islands, 28 \n                             September 1901\n\n       Filipino insurgents overran Company C, 9th Infantry, at \n     Balangiga, Samar, on 28 September 1901.

Military monuments honor those \n     servicemen and servicewomen whose sacrifice for this country \n     has preserved the nation and recognizes those who have \n     sacrificed their lives in service to their country.

Mr. President, I came to the floor yesterday to speak on \nthe devastating impact the Republican tax plan would have on working \nfamilies in my home State of Illinois and other States across the \nNation.\n  It is no secret that the Republican plan would finance massive tax \ncuts for the wealthiest people in America. They just can't help \nthemselves. Every time they look at the Tax Code, they think there has \nto be a way to help the wealthiest people in our country. They usually \nlook at the estate tax, which is paid for by 1 out of every 1,000 \nAmericans, and say: We have just got to spare these poor people who \nhave a net worth of over $11 million from paying any taxes to the \ngovernment. We have to spare them from paying this government for the \nbenefit that this great Nation has brought to them and their families \nand businesses. That is where they start.\n  Then they do the alternative minimum tax, which is a tax that was \ncreated so that if your accountants and bookkeepers and lawyers are the \nsharpest on Earth and ended up finding that you had no tax liability, \nyou still paid a fair share for sustaining this great Nation that you \ncall home. They want to get rid of that, too, or at least dramatically \nmodify it.\n  They start off with the premise of making these tax cuts for the \nwealthiest people in America the beginning point of tax reform, these \ngiveaways to people who are not even asking for them. They can't help \nthemselves. They always start there, and the American people know it.\n  When you ask the American people, what is this tax reform all about, \nthey say it is tax cuts for wealthy people. That is where it always \nstarts, and it does when the Republicans are the authors. That is what \nwe face again.\n  They try to argue that it is going to help working families. It will \nhelp some--let me be honest about that--and yet you are going to find \nmany working families who are going to pay more instead of less because \nof this so-called tax reform. Why would we ever do that?\n  Why would we give tax breaks to the wealthiest people in America--\npermanent tax breaks--and then turn around and say to working families: \nSorry. Some of you will get help, but many of you will not.\n  In my home State of Illinois, the elimination of the State and local \ntax exemption is going to be devastating to our State. We are in the \ntop five of States where the people in my State who pay income tax, \nsales tax, and property tax can deduct those taxes from their Federal \nincome that is subject to taxation.\n  That is not a new idea. It has been around for decades. It really is \npremised on the following: Americans should not have to pay tax on a \ntax. If I pay $100 a month, and I pay my local property taxes, I \nshouldn't be taxed on that $100. It is a double hit. It is not fair, \nbut the Republican plan believes that is what we should do.\n  I will tell the seven Republican Congressmen in my State, they ought \nto go home and ask the people whom they represent what they think about \nthis one, the idea of double taxation that they would vote for and go \nhome and try to defend. I think it is going to be tough, very tough.\n  It is no secret that these tax cuts for the wealthy and large \ncorporations will end up raising taxes on a lot of Americans and \nblowing a massive hole in the deficit.\n  I am going to quote a fellow who has been retired a few years from \nCongress. His name is Dave Obey. He was a Congressman from Wisconsin. \nDave Obey used to say over and over again--and I am going to repeat it, \nand I have credited him with it: Too many times politicians are posing \nfor holy pictures, but when it comes to the deficit and the debt, many \nof my colleagues on the other side of the aisle pose for holy pictures \nabout the national debt whenever there is a Democratic President and \nthen get a swift case of amnesia whenever there is a Republican \nPresident.\n\n\n  Here we go again. They are ignoring the reality that the tax cuts \nthey are promoting for the wealthiest and biggest corporations are \ngoing to end up blowing a hole in the deficit--a hole in the deficit, \nwhich is going to have to be paid for by future generations.\n  I used to watch as my Republican colleagues would get red in the face \ntalking about our national debt, but that, of course, was under a \nDemocratic President. Under a Republican President, it doesn't seem to \nbe a major issue. Incidentally, there is a way to plug that hole, and \nsomewhere along the way someone slipped and told us what it was.\n  If you want to plug the hole of $1.5 trillion in tax cuts to the \nwealthy and big corporations, they propose cutting Medicare benefits \nand Medicaid benefits, cutting the basic health insurance plans that \nseniors and people in low-income categories use. Is that a sound \npolicy, to try to patch a hole in the deficit by taking healthcare \nprotection away from senior citizens in America--the 40-plus million \nwho count on it--or those who are under Medicaid? I think it is not.\n  It turns out that Chairman Hatch had a new surprise for us this week. \nAt 10:30 p.m. last night, Chairman Orrin Hatch released additional \nchanges to this bill, which is evolving before our eyes. It is a bill \nwhich was not publicly announced until last Friday and is currently \nbeing debated in the hopes that when we return a week after our \nThanksgiving recess, we will take it up and vote on it.\n  Does it seem like it is a hurried operation? Of course, it is. They \nknow that if these bills sit out long enough and people read them and \nconsider them, there will be a lot of questions asked that they can't \nanswer.\n  Chairman Hatch released additional changes to the bill, and they \ndecided to fund permanent tax cuts for some corporations. That is a \nhigh priority for the Republicans--wealthy people, big corporations. So \nhow do they pay for permanent tax cuts for the biggest corporations? It \nturns out that in addition to raising taxes on working families, the \nSenate Republican tax bill would also raise health insurance premiums \non middle-income families. That is right. The Republicans propose that \ntheir tax bill would also repeal parts of the Affordable Care Act. As a \nresult, the Congressional Budget Office tells us that an estimated 13 \nto 14 million Americans will lose their health insurance protection \nbecause of the Republican tax giveaway plan. I thought that plan was \nsupposed to help working families. It ends up taking away their health \ninsurance.\n  For those who can still remain in the market buying health insurance, \nthey can anticipate their premiums for health insurance going up 10 \npercent. What kind of tax cut is this that ends up raising the cost of \nhealth insurance for working families and ends up eliminating health \ninsurance for many middle-income families?\n  I find it hard to believe the satisfaction so many Republicans take \nto be able to boast and brag that they passed a bill that took away \nhealth insurance for Americans. You are proud of that? I wouldn't be. \nWe should be doing the opposite--expanding the reach of health \ninsurance, making sure every American has the peace of mind and health \ninsurance they need for them and their families.\n  Remember when Republicans campaigned on the promise of increasing the \nnumber of people with insurance and decreasing premiums? This tax bill \ndoes just the opposite.\n  Haven't my Republican colleagues learned the lessons of the ACA--\nAffordable Care Act--repeal by now? We spent the whole year in a vain \neffort by the Republicans to repeal and barely replace. The American \npeople don't want it. Overwhelmingly, they are against it.\n  My hospitals in Illinois and across this Nation don't want what the \nRepublicans are proposing in their bill. Patients don't want it. Nurses \ndon't want it. Clinics don't want it. The disabled community doesn't \nwant it. The Republicans are determined to do it anyway.\n  Senior leaders are against it, faith leaders are against it, the \nAmerican people are against it, but this is going to be the feather in \nthe cap for the Republican majority; that by the end of this year, they \nhope to pass a tax reform bill that is going to give tax breaks to the \nwealthiest, give a permanent tax break to the biggest corporations, \nmake the middle-income families pay for it, eliminate 13 to 14 million \nAmericans' health insurance, and raise their premiums. What a package. \nYou have to work overtime to put together a package that damaging to \nworking families in America, but that is what they are pushing. That is \nwhat they are determined to do.\n\n\n                        Drug Price Transparency\n\n  Mr. President, maybe it is the time I turn on my television, but it \nseems to me I just can't escape drug advertising on television. It just \ncomes one after the other, all kinds of drugs--many of which I can't \neven pronounce their names, can't remember their names. I can't \nremember why they are being advertised, and then I listen to all of the \nthings that follow when all these drug ads come on.\n  My favorite--favorite of all time--is one of these drugs in which it \nsays: Be sure to tell your doctor if you have had a liver transplant. \nBe sure to tell your doctor if you have had a liver transplant. Imagine \ngoing to your doctor for a checkup or physical and talking about your \ncondition and failing to mention you had a liver transplant. That is \nwhat one of the ads say, and many of the ads are just as baffling as to \nthe warnings and side effects.\n  One ad says: Don't take Xarelto if you are allergic to Xarelto. Well, \nhow do I know if I am allergic if I don't take it? So many questions \nand so many warnings.\n  How many other countries in the world do you think go through this? \nHow many other countries in the world are there where, when you turn on \nthe television, you get ads for drugs? There must be a lot of them, \nright? No. It turns out there is only one other country in the world \nthat does this--New Zealand. The United States of America and New \nZealand are the only two countries in the world that allow direct-to-\nconsumer pharmaceutical advertising.\n  You ask yourself, when did this come about? It seems relatively new, \nand it is. This direct-to-consumer advertising was legalized in 1985, \nbut it didn't take off until 1997--that is about 20 years ago--when the \nFood and Drug Administration eased the requirements for detailing the \nside effects of the drugs that were being advertised.\n  After the FDA made that ruling, the drug companies decided to dive \ninto this in a big way. Now you see these fancy commercials with \npopular music, with celebrity actors, golf clubs, lofty treatment \npromises. Every hour on television--every hour on television--an \naverage of 80 drug ads are aired. The average American sees nine of \nthese pharmaceutical ads every day--nine of them. In fact, drug \ncompanies spend more each year on advertising and sales than the entire \nbudget of the Food and Drug Administration. These ads saturate our \nairways so much that there is now a national conference on drug ads and \na hall of fame for the best drug ads. Can you believe it?\n  As common as these direct-to-consumer drug ads are, drug companies \nspend four times as much as the cost of these ads on an army of sales \nrepresentatives who target doctors who write prescriptions. These \ncompanies in America spend $20 billion a year trying to get these drugs \ninto the doctors' offices and to get the doctors to prescribe them.\n  I once talked to a young lady who did that for a living for a while. \nI said: How does that work? She said: I knew the birthday of every \nnurse in every doctor's office in my territory. I had a standing order \nevery day for birthday cakes, which I delivered on behalf of my drug \ncompany in the hopes that that nurse and that doctor would prescribe my \ndrug, and therefore I would be financially rewarded.\n  I said: How did you know if they ever prescribed it? Well, it turns \nout the drug companies can go to the local pharmacies, and although \nthey can't get the names of people receiving them, they can test the \nvolume of sales at each of the pharmacies close to the doctors' \noffices, and that is one of the ways they measure their success.\n  So let me ask and answer an obvious question. Why do the biggest \npharmaceutical companies in America spend billions of dollars to \npromote and advertise their drugs? For one reason--it increases sales. \nIt increases their profits. You see, patients are more likely to ask \ntheir doctor for a specific drug\n\n\nwhen they have seen the ad for it, whether they need it or not. That is \nwhy most countries have banned direct-to-consumer drug advertising. As \nI mentioned, only New Zealand and the United States make it legal.\n  Why is that a problem? One reason is, it promotes overuse of \nmedication for often benign conditions. That bit of dry skin that you \nhave on your elbow, that little stiffness in your knee, hooray. There \nis a drug for it, and you are going to find out on your television set \ntonight exactly what it is.\n  They push pills for every natural condition or cosmetic issue, and we \nwaste money on unnecessary drugs, costs that every one of us pays for \nwhen the overall cost of healthcare goes up.\n  Over the past 20 years, since these direct-to-consumer ads have been \nallowed, the number of people with five or more prescriptions--five or \nmore in America--has nearly tripled. A primary problem with these ads \nis that they steer patients toward the most expensive drugs, and that \nraises the cost of healthcare.\n  Drugs with ads have nine times more prescriptions than those without. \nIt just stands to reason. What are the most advertised drugs? Let's \ntake a look at a couple of them here.\n  Humira--incidentally, a prescription for Humira, from the disclosure \nof the drug company, costs $3,743 a month.\n  Here is one you probably had to write down three times before you \ncould pronounce it, Xeljanz. That costs $3,100 a month, a Pfizer drug. \nHumira costs $3,700 a month; Xeljanz, $3,100. Both are for rheumatoid \narthritis.\n  The drug industry spent over $100 million in advertising for each of \nthe top 16 brand-name drugs in 2015, which means 50 percent of all \ndirect-to-consumer advertising was just for these 16 medications.\n  Do you ever see an advertisement during the Super Bowl for a generic, \nlower cost medication? Of course not. It is the same story when it \ncomes to the $20 billion the same companies spend to butter up doctors \nso that they will prescribe these drugs. Doctors are more likely to \nprescribe a specific brand-name drug if they have been marketed by drug \ncompanies, while they are more likely to prescribe cheaper generics if \nnot targeted with these ads.\n  These ads often urge patients to ``ask your doctor if this drug is \nright for you.'' Well, we asked the doctors whether direct-to-consumer \ndrug advertising was right for America, right for the health of \nAmerica. We went straight to the American Medical Association, the \nlargest medical society in the United States. The American Medical \nAssociation has called for a ban on direct-to-consumer prescription \ndrug advertising. Here is what they said: ``Direct-to-consumer \nadvertising inflates demand for new and more expensive drugs even when \nthese drugs may not be appropriate.''\n  If a patient finally figures out how to spell Xeljanz or Xarelto on \nthe third try and comes to the doctor demanding these drugs, the doctor \noften has a choice. He or she can spend valuable time explaining why \nthe patient doesn't need the drug or why there is a cheaper generic or \njust write the prescription. It is sad that too many doctors just write \nthe prescription.\n  Sometimes, with these drug ads it is hard to tell whether the \ncommercial is for a pharmaceutical or a sports car, except you know the \nprice of a BMW before you go buy it. With billions in targeted spending \non drug advertising, patients and doctors are bombarded with \ninformation--all of those side effects, and ``be sure and tell the \ndoctor if you had a liver transplant''--but they are kept in the dark \nabout one major, important element: What do these drugs cost? \nUltimately, somebody is going to pay for them--maybe your insurance \ncompany, if you are lucky. If not, maybe it is you and your family. \nPrice disclosure is absent from virtually all of these drug ads.\n  So when a patient sees an advertisement for Xeljanz or Xarelto, or \nhis family doctor writes a prescription for it, the moment of truth may \nonly occur when the patient finally goes to the pharmacy and sees for \nthe first time what they are facing. No other industry conceals its \nprices when it comes to consumer goods this way. I think that needs to \nchange. I think American consumers have a right to know--in front, on \nthe ads.\n  That is why I will be introducing a bill, the Drug-price Transparency \nin Communications Act, or DTC Act, to require the disclosure of prices \nin direct-to-consumer ads and promotions to doctors.\n  The American Medical Association recently adopted a resolution \nsupporting me. In addition to that, my bill is endorsed by the American \nCollege of Physicians and the Consumers Union. It is a simple thing: Do \nAmerican consumers have the right to know when it comes to the cost of \nthese drugs? Do they have the right to know that if you take Xeljanz \nfor rheumatoid arthritis, you are going to spend $3,100 per month? This \nbill would have the FDA and the Federal Trade Commission oversee these \ncommunications, requiring drug makers to disclose the wholesale \nacquisition cost, known as the WAC, of the drug.\n  Now, I am sure the response from Big Pharma, which makes a lot of \nmoney, will be to say: Well, that is just not the right price for every \npatient.\n  I agree, but when we ask the pharmaceutical companies for better \nprice information, they clam up. They will not answer. As long as they \nrefuse to disclose the true cost of drugs and refuse to provide any \ntransparency in the shell games they run between charging different \npatients different amounts, we have to stick with the one industry-\nreported, verified number--the WAC--and that price is what we have put \nin as the required advertising on each of these drug ads on television.\n  I have asked a lot of stakeholders for their suggestions about other \napproaches. I am open to them, but everyone understands this price \nestablishment--this price bottom line--and that is why we used it.\n  Further, my legislation allows drug companies to explain that \npatients would pay less than the amount they advertise. But let's also \nremember that somebody has to pay this high cost. If patients don't pay \nthe WAC price out-of-pocket to the pharmacy, their insurance company \njust might, which is why health premiums keep going up.\n  Blue Cross Blue Shield of Illinois told me that they spend more on \nprescription pharmaceuticals than they do on in-patient hospital care. \nThis is one of the big drivers in the cost of healthcare.\n  Is it important that we disclose to consumers what the real costs are \nof the drugs they are being bombarded with on television? I think so. \nDoctors, patients, and families agree. If drug makers can fill the \nairways with pharmaceutical ads, then they should tell the whole story \nand provide clear information about drug costs.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.", "turn": 39, "speaker": "Mr. DURBIN", "itemno": 47}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gardner).

Mr. President, our Constitution starts with those three \nbeautiful and powerful words: ``We the People.'' Our Founders \nenvisioned a nation with a form of government that wouldn't result in a \ngovernment by the powerful and the privileged but instead would really \ndeliver for the American people a form of government that is the \nfoundation for every American to thrive. What a contrast that is to \nmany of the governments of Europe that they had seen function on behalf \nof the privileged and the powerful.\n  Well, we have an issue before us that certainly is about government \nof, by, and for the people. It is the issue of the Children's Health \nInsurance Program, often referred to as CHIP. This program has been \nexpired for 46 days--46 days--putting children's healthcare at risk \nthroughout our country.\n  Why isn't this bill on the floor right now? Why isn't it being passed \nby unanimous consent right now, or at least being debated and amended \nand passed? We have five States--five States--that are running out of \nmoney in this quarter. Oregon, my home State, is one of them. We are \ngoing to be out of money next month. We have another 25 States that are \ngoing to be running out of money in the first 3 months of 2018, \ndisrupting the continuity of essential services for our little ones.\n\n\n  For 20 years, the Children's Health Insurance Program has ensured \nthat no children fall through the cracks of our healthcare system. It \nhas covered checkups, immunizations, dental visits, and doctors' \nvisits, assisting our struggling and low-income families who make too \nmuch to qualify for Medicaid but not enough to be able to actually \npurchase health services or healthcare for their children. Every single \nState in America--50 States out of 50--has a program. Now, they tend to \noperate at different levels. Forty-six States cover children up to or \nabove 200 percent of poverty. We have 24 States that cover families up \nto incomes of 215 percent of poverty. So 24 States go a little further. \nWe have a handful of States that expand coverage up to 300 percent of \ncoverage. In my home State of Oregon, 140,000 children rely on the \nChildren's Health Insurance Program.\n  It is just not acceptable that Members of this body come to this \nfloor to talk about how to do trillions of dollars of tax benefits for \nthe very wealthiest of Americans while we are failing to get a bill on \nthe floor for health insurance for America's poor and struggling \nchildren. There is a lot I could say about that tax bill. It is really \na bank heist. It is designed to deliver trillions of dollars to the \nrichest 1 percent of Americans, while doing virtually nothing for the \nmiddle class and absolutely nothing for the bottom third of Americans. \nBut doesn't there seem to be something wrong in a ``we the People'' \ndemocratic republic when we have a bill on the floor that is a bank \nheist on the Federal Treasury to deliver benefits--trillions of \ndollars--to the richest Americans and we can't have a debate on this \nfloor on healthcare for the poorest children in America? Well, \ncertainly, I think it is a perversion of the principle of a government \nthat serves the people to put the privileged and powerful ahead in \nline.\n  We have seen, certainly, many renditions of this. We have seen a \nbroader bill, a set of bills, including the TrumpCare, zombie \nhealthcare bill that came to this floor. It was going to wipe out \nhealthcare for 22 million Americans. Then it came back in a different \nform that was kind of the fake insurance form, and it was defeated \nagain. Then it came back as the skinny bill, and it was defeated again. \nAll of these bills wiped out healthcare for millions and millions of \nAmerica's families.\n  Well, now we have a tax bill coming to the floor that, once again, \nhas a provision put in it to wipe out healthcare for millions of \nAmerican families. That is why we call it the zombie bill--the fact \nthat we kill this thing, try to put a stake through its heart, knowing \nthat we are supposed to be here serving the people--not the most \nprivileged, the people. That is what is in our Constitution. That is \nthe vision of this Nation, but apparently it is not the vision for \nthose who control the bills that come to this floor because this bill \nhas been waiting for 46 days to be addressed.\n\n  There is a bipartisan bill ready and waiting to be brought to the \nfloor right now. Senator Hatch and Senator Wyden have worked together. \nThey passed this bill out of their committee. It would extend the \nChildren's Health Insurance Program through 2022. We could take up that \nbill right now and pass it. It had the full support of the committee. \nThe Republicans and the Democrats were on board. So why isn't it here? \nWhy are we disrupting healthcare for America's children?\n  To my colleagues: Set aside your ambition of ripping off the Federal \nGovernment to deliver benefits to the top 1 percent of Americans and \npay some attention to America's children. That is our responsibility. \nThat should be our mission. That is the purpose of our Constitution. \nLet's get it done.

Mr. President, I rise to speak in opposition to the \nnomination of Joseph Otting to be Comptroller of the Currency.\n  I appreciate Mr. Otting's willingness to enter public service. That \nsaid, he is not the person we need in this very important financial \nwatchdog roll. We have learned lessons from the quality, the attitude, \nand the work of the person in this office, and I am virtually sure he \nis not the right person. We have made a lot of progress in the last 7 \nyears since we passed Wall Street reform. The last thing we need is \nsomeone leading the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency working \nto weaken or eliminate important safeguards, instead of looking out for \nworkers, borrowers, and the stability of our financial system.\n\n  The financial watchdogs, including the previous Comptroller, Thomas \nCurry, took significant steps to right the wrongs that led to the 2008 \nfinancial crisis. It is important that we not have this collective \namnesia that seems to permeate this body about what happened to this \ncountry 10 years ago. Working together, Comptroller Curry and other \nfinancial watchdogs strengthened rules for the largest banks. \nIndependently, the OCC enhanced the supervision and examination of \nthese banks, took enforcement actions against bad actors, and took \nsteps to address concerns that the agency had been captured by the \nindustry. There was clear evidence of that by previous people in this \njob.\n  This administration is putting the banking industry back in charge of \npolicing itself. We should have learned from that a decade ago. Mr. \nOtting is yet another bank executive who profited from the financial \ncrisis and is being rewarded by the Trump administration with a \npowerful job overseeing our Nation's banking system. This is a man who \nworked at OneWest and made a fortune kicking military servicemembers, \nseniors, and working families out of their homes, all while pocketing \n$2.5 billion--that is billion with a ``b''--from the FDIC to protect \nhis bank from any losses.\n  The bank, OneWest, in this behavior, in this money from FDIC, in this \naction of kicking military servicemembers and seniors and working \nfamilies out of their homes--this all might sound familiar to my \ncolleagues; it certainly sounds familiar to the people in the Finance \nCommittee and the Banking Committee. It is the same place that Mr. \nMnuchin--now-Secretary of the Treasury--worked, doing the same kinds of \nthings and work that Mnuchin did.\n  Mr. Otting and his former boss, Secretary Mnuchin, refused to provide \nSenators State-by-State data on OneWest's foreclosures on seniors, \nservicemembers, and other borrowers. They refused to answer questions \nabout OneWest loan modifications. I think Ohioans--and I hope enough of \nmy colleagues to constitute a majority--would like to know what they \nare hiding.\n  It was pretty amazing to sit in the Finance Committee and listen to \nSecretary Mnuchin and watch Secretary Mnuchin--then-Secretary-Designee \nMnuchin--refuse to release information, refuse to disclose information. \nIn fact, he had forgotten about a $100 million investment he had when \nhe testified in front of the committee. We found out later that he had \nthis investment that he forgot to disclose; $100 million is a lot of \nmoney. Even to Secretary Mnuchin I think that is a lot of money. Even \nto this administration, that is a lot of money.\n  What we do know, thanks to important work by our independent press, \nis not pretty. What we do know about what OneWest did is not pretty. In \nJanuary, the Columbus Dispatch--the most conservative newspaper in my \nState, the second largest paper in our State--ran a front-page story on \nthat bank's abuses. Their investigative journalism found that OneWest \nused so-called robosignings on mortgage documents. According to the \nDispatch, in its fine investigative work, under Mr. Otting's watch from \n2009 to 2015, nearly 2,000 Ohioans in our six largest counties were \nforeclosed on by OneWest. The abuses were so bad that Mr. Otting signed \nan OCC consent order--a legal agreement that a bank and its regulator \nenter into when illegal practices at the bank force the government to \nstep in.\n  If you are signing an OCC consent order, it is a pretty serious \nproblem. In any other administration, this would\n\n\nhave been disqualifying. In any other administration, Mr. Otting--or \nfor that matter, Mr. Mnuchin, who was engaged in the same kind of \npractices--would have withdrawn their name. In any other \nadministration, if the nominee didn't withdraw their name, the \nadministration would have told them to withdraw their name, but not in \nthis White House. Frankly, when you walk into this White House, it \nlooks like a retreat for Wall Street executives and people like OneWest \nexecutives and people who foreclosed on home after home and, frankly, \nhave almost no contrition and paid almost nothing, suffered almost no \nconsequences for their action.\n  The consent order documented OneWest's breathtaking list of \nforeclosure abuses, gouging borrowers with excessive fees and unfairly \nevicting servicemembers on Active Duty. Think about that. They not only \nevicted servicemembers, they evicted servicemembers on Active Duty. In \nsome cases, I assume the wife was serving overseas and the husband was \nevicted because he couldn't make the payments, partly because his wife \nis paid so little as a member of the Armed Forces.\n  Mr. Otting was held accountable for one of the major abuses, \nrobosigning, by the bank's regulator in 2014. But during his Senate \nBanking Committee confirmation hearing, he continued to deny \nwrongdoing, even when faced with a legal document proving otherwise.\n  One of the things that amazes the American public is that nobody went \nto jail for what they caused in the last decade, what they caused in \n2007, 2008, and 2009--the pain and the hardship, the pain of plant \nclosings and lost jobs, the hardship of losing your home, the terrible \nconsequences of losing much of your retirement savings. The people who \ncaused this suffered almost no consequence. The American public, first \nof all, can't believe none of them went to jail. Maybe they are not so \nsurprised anymore that there is no contrition. Then, we reward these \npeople by making them Secretary of the Treasury or Comptroller of the \nCurrency.\n  Mr. Otting was held accountable. In all of these legal proceedings--\nand I am not a lawyer so maybe I don't exactly understand this, but \nthese people signed some document, but they never really admitted they \ndid anything wrong. Mr. Otting followed that process. Even though we \nhad this documentation, he continued to deny wrongdoing, even when we \npresented him with that legal document.\n  Instead of helping families recover from the financial crisis as CEO \nof Secretary Mnuchin's--not Secretary then--OneWest Bank, Mr. Otting \ncontributed to devastation. So this administration has chosen him to be \nin charge of one of the key agencies protecting ordinary Americans from \nWall Street. I will say that again. He was a big part of the problem, \nas CEO of OneWest Bank. He has committed wrongdoing; we presented him \nwith a legal document proving that. Yet the administration chooses him \nto be Comptroller of the Currency.\n  It is a job most of America doesn't know much about. I didn't either \nuntil I came here. I acknowledge that. It is a job that most Americans \ndon't think much about. It is a job that most Americans don't think has \na great impact in their lives, but Americans know what happened 10 \nyears ago. I live in ZIP Code 44105, Cleveland, OH. My ZIP Code in 2007 \nhad more foreclosures than any ZIP Code in the United States of \nAmerica. I can't leave my house, if I go more than about 300 yards, \nwithout seeing the devastation caused by people like Mr. Otting--people \nwho lost their homes, people who lost their jobs, people who have \nsuffered and lost their life savings because of Wall Street \nmalfeasance, because of companies like OneWest. I am guessing that Mr. \nOtting doesn't think about this, and I am guessing that most people \nhere don't think about this.\n  Pope Francis, soon after assuming the Papacy, admonished parish \npriests to go out and smell like the flock. It wouldn't hurt all of us \nto do that a little more around here, to talk to somebody who has lost \na job. It typically happened, in my neighborhood near Slavic Village, \nCleveland, OH, where the spouse lost her job, and then the husband's \nplant closed, and then they couldn't keep up with the payments. Then \nthey had to tell their teenage daughter: Honey, we are going to lose \nour home. First, they had to give away their family dog, probably, \nbecause owning a dog costs money, and they were squeezed. They knew \nthey were in trouble. Then they had to explain to their daughter that \nshe is going to go to a different school district--and all the things \nof life have turned upside down. Your life turns upside down if you are \nforeclosed on or if you are evicted.\n  I am guessing Mr. Otting doesn't think a lot about that. I am \nguessing Secretary Mnuchin doesn't think a lot about that, as he \ntravels on private planes and his wife brags about her expensive \nclothes. I am guessing very few in this White House think about that, \nbut maybe they should. If he is confirmed--and I assume he will be \nbecause the Republicans in this body generally do whatever Wall Street \nand whatever companies like OneWest want them to do in confirming \nnominees like Mr. Otting, but I wish Mr. Otting would think about a \nlittle bit more about the devastation to which he contributed.\n  Right now at the OCC, Keith Noreika--previously, a big bank lawyer--\nhas spent his time rolling back rules to protect Americans from \npredatory payday lenders. He has worked against a Consumer Financial \nProtection Bureau rule that would have allowed customers to take their \nbanks to court when they were cheated.\n  Mr. Noreika has done all this as Acting Comptroller. He wasn't \nconfirmed by this body. Get this: His temporary role as a special \ngovernment employee means he doesn't have to live up to the same ethics \nor conflicts of interest rules as everyone else. He takes this job as \nActing Comptroller while we wait for Mr. Otting; he takes this job as \nActing Comptroller, and he does the bidding of all of these financial \nservice interest groups, all of the payday lenders, and all of the \npeople who are preying on working families and preying on low-income \npeople. He leaves and joins some of these companies, and he is very \namply rewarded, and he doesn't have to live under any ethics rules.\n  The people who run watchdog agencies are supposed to be independent \nvoices who protect workers in the economy from financial crisis, not \nbanking industry lapdogs who help their former boardroom buddies on \nWall Street. If his record is any guide, certainly Mr. Noreika didn't \nserve the public. He served as a lapdog. He served the banking \nindustry. If his records are any guide, I am concerned that Mr. Otting \nwill be no different, that the OCC's independence will be compromised \nunder his leadership. He worked side by side with Secretary Mnuchin at \nOneWest Bank. Mr. Mnuchin hand-picked Mr. Otting for this job.\n  We are already seeing signs of Wall Street influence at some of the \nagencies, consistent with Secretary Mnuchin's agenda. They have pulled \nback on Wall Street reforms. They have attacked other agencies for \ndoing their jobs.\n  For wealthy bank executives and private investors like Mr. Otting, \nthe crisis wasn't a life-changing event. Think about that. The crisis \nfor Mr. Otting wasn't a life-changing event, but those people who live \nin ZIP Code 441, in Slavic Village in Cleveland, for those people whose \nhomes I drive by every day, people who lost jobs because of the \nfinancial crisis, people who lost homes because of the financial \ncrisis, people who lost their life savings because of the financial \ncrisis, those weren't just life-changing; those were life-destroying \nkinds of events. Yet Mr. Otting and Mr. Mnuchin go forward, and they \npocket their tens of millions of dollars, and then they are appointed \nby the President of the United States to watch over these financial \nwatchdogs.\n  They saw the crisis. The crisis was life-changing to my neighbors. \nThey saw a crisis as an opportunity to profit by flipping failing banks \nbought at rock-bottom prices, but not before foreclosing, as the \nColumbus Dispatch said, all while raking in taxpayer dollars.\n  If confirmed, Mr. Otting will be in charge of ensuring that all \nnational banks, including Wells Fargo--we certainly heard about Wells \nFargo's abuse of millions of its customers. His job will be to ensure \nthat all national banks, including banks like Wells Fargo, are \ncomplying with the law, that they operate in a safe and sound\n\n\nmanner, and that they protect customers.\n  To be real, do we think we can trust him to do that after the worst \nfinancial crisis since the Great Depression, the financial crisis that \ndevastated Ohio, Colorado, and Massachusetts families? After people \nlost their jobs, their homes, and their savings, Mr. Otting clearly \nisn't the right person for this job.\n  Yesterday, the Chair of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, \nMarty Gruenberg, said:\n\n       I confess to having a certain sense of deja vu. Banking \n     conditions today are strong and the possibility of a serious \n     downturn anytime soon is generally viewed as remote. That was \n     certainly true during the pre-crisis years as well. If I have \n     one key point to make today, it is that we should guard \n     against the temptation to become complacent about the risks \n     facing the financial system.\n\n  I would comment on Mr. Gruenberg's comments that 11 years ago or so--\n10, 11, 12 years ago--it didn't seem all that likely to many, at least \nto those in the Bush administration, that there would be an implosion \nof the economy and an implosion of the banking system, a crisis; that \nthere was, in fact, the new head of supervision at the Federal Reserve \nwho pretty much said, as late as 2007: We really shouldn't be concerned \nabout a housing crisis. It is only going to hit the higher, upper end \nof homeowners, and it will not affect the economy. Those are the people \nthis President has put in charge to be the watchdogs of our financial \nsystem.\n\n  Again, Mr. Gruenberg said: If I have one key point, it is this. We \nshould guard against the temptation to become complacent about the \nrisks facing our financial system.\n  We need to take Chair Gruenberg's warning seriously. Confirming a \nbanker to the OCC--a banker who will give Wall Street its wish list--is \na high price for working families to pay who are still feeling the \nimpact of the last financial crisis.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote no on Mr. Otting.", "turn": 47, "speaker": "Mr. BROWN", "itemno": 57}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Ohio for his \nleadership in impressing on the American people to take a look at Mr. \nOtting, who has been named to be the head of the OCC. I rise and join \nmy voice with his in saying that this is a bad nomination for America.\n  Donald Trump promised during his inaugural address to fight for the \n``forgotten men and women of our country.'' Yet, even before his bags \nwere unpacked at the White House, he started bringing Wall Street to \nWashington, importing the worst of the worst bankers who had gambled \naway the economy, putting them in charge of regulating the same \ncompanies they once worked for. It is a long list.\n  It is the former Goldman Sachs president, Gary Cohn, to lead the \nNational Economic Council and Wall Street fat cat Wilbur Ross to lead \nthe Commerce Department. Randal Quarles went straight from his private \nequity fund to the Federal Reserve, where he is now responsible for \nregulating our biggest banks.\n  Maybe the most important and most ridiculous of all of the Wall \nStreet imports is Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. Mnuchin spent 17 \nyears at Goldman Sachs. As the financial crisis was sweeping across the \ncountry, Mnuchin organized a team of billionaires to purchase IndyMac \nBank out of Federal receivership. He rebranded the bank as OneWest and \nput himself in charge. Then Mr. Mnuchin and OneWest acted swiftly and \ndecisively to boot more than 36,000 families out of their homes all \nover the country.\n  The Senate should never have confirmed that kind of person to run the \nTreasury Department, but it did. Now, among other things, he leads the \nCouncil that is responsible for making sure Wall Street does not blow \nup our economy again. I know it actually sounds like a joke, but the \nrisks for the rest of us are way too serious.\n  Republicans don't seem to have any problem with any of this. In fact, \nthey are doubling down. Today, they plan to confirm Mnuchin's former \nOneWest business partner, Joseph Otting, to lead the Office of the \nComptroller of the Currency and take another seat on that same Council.\n  The OCC is one of the most important regulators you have probably \nnever heard of. It is the main bank overseer of the United States. It \ncharters, regulates, and supervises more than 1,400 banks. The OCC \nwrites rules to make the economy more secure, and it puts examiners \ninside the big banks in order to catch new tricks and scams before they \nharm consumers or, worse, before they crash the economy, and when banks \nmess up, it is the OCC's job to enforce the law.\n  Mr. Otting is buddies with the Treasury Secretary from their days of \nleading OneWest Bank. I guess that is why he got this nomination, but \nif you care about making sure regulators watch out for families, \nbusinesses, and our economy, it is hard to think of anyone worse for \nthis job other than Steve Mnuchin. We all know a segment of the banking \nindustry specialized in squeezing American families, particularly after \nthe financial meltdown, but OneWest may have been the worst of the \nworst, especially when Otting was president and CEO from 2010 to 2015.\n  What happened on Mr. Otting's watch?\n  OneWest ran a notorious foreclosure mill that threw thousands of \nfamilies out of their homes and illegally--underline ``illegally''--\nforeclosed on dozens of servicemembers. The OneWest crew didn't just \nhurt families; it destroyed whole communities when it foreclosed on \ndozens of properties in the same neighborhoods, making it even harder \nfor families to start over and rebuild. OneWest stole homes out from \nunderneath families, lying to homeowners who were legally entitled to \nmodify their mortgages and keep their homes under a government program \nand telling them the only way forward was through foreclosure.\n  OneWest treated all of its homeowners like garbage, but its treatment \nof minority homeowners was particularly disgusting. OneWest was nine \ntimes more likely to foreclose on a homeowner who was in a community of \ncolor than to offer him a mortgage.\n  All of this went down while the bank was busy vacuuming up more than \n$1 billion in taxpayer bailout money during the financial crisis. These \nscams at OneWest devastated a lot of American homeowners and, at the \nsame time, put Mr. Otting in the same room with a lot of regulators.\n  After an investigation by the Treasury Department found that OneWest \nsystematically cheated in foreclosure proceedings, including by lying \nin sworn statements to judges, cutting corners, and failing to check to \nmake sure they had the right documents before foreclosing on families, \nMr. Otting signed a consent decree with the government to agree that \nOneWest would pay more than 10,000 people for improperly throwing them \nout of their homes, but that is not all. In 2015, OneWest forked over \nmore than $89 million in fines to the Department of Justice for \ndefrauding the government and illegally putting taxpayers on the hook \nfor the loans if they went bad.\n  So what happened to Mr. Otting after hurting all of those families, \nafter lying to judges, after admitting to defrauding the U.S. \nGovernment? He got a nice $12 million severance check and a call from \nDonald Trump, asking if he wanted a corner office right here in \nWashington.\n  It is crazy to expect a banker who has broken the law to turn around \nand fight to enforce it. It is like putting criminals in charge of the \npolice station and expecting them not to look the other way while their \nbuddies keep stealing. There is nothing in Mr. Otting's record to \nsuggest he would protect consumers from financial fraud or take the \nsteps needed to rein in the banks or avoid future financial meltdowns.\n  You may not have heard of the OCC, but I promise you that when this \nagency refuses to stand up to the big banks and enforce the law, \nAmerican families get hurt. It is as simple as that. Before the \nfinancial crisis, the OCC buddied up with the banks they were supposed \nto regulate, and everybody knew it. The result was the 2008 financial \ncrisis that cost our economy $14 trillion. Millions of families lost \ntheir homes. Millions lost their jobs. Millions lost their savings and \ntheir retirement money. Nearly a decade later, many American families \nare still hurting. Now the Trump administration is ready to take us \nback to the bad old days, in which banks made gobs of money off risky \nbets while the regulators just looked the other way.\n\n\n  Confirming Mr. Otting is kicking dirt in the faces of every one of \nOneWest's victims. It is a gut punch to every American who was hurt in \nthe financial crisis. Even if none of that matters to you, it is a \nterrible idea because leaving Mr. Otting in charge of bank regulation \nwill endanger our economy. American families and businesses need and \ndeserve a cop on the beat who will fight hard to keep them safe. \nEverything we know about Mr. Otting says he will be out there fighting \nfor the big banks.\n  I will be voting no on Mr. Otting's nomination, and I urge all of my \ncolleagues to do the same.\n  I yield the floor.", "turn": 49, "speaker": "Ms. WARREN", "itemno": 59}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, we are at a critical juncture in our \ninvestigation into Russia's interference in last year's election and \npotential collusion by Americans with Russia's meddling and obstruction \nof justice that may have occurred. Those issues are under investigation \nby the Judiciary Committee, which has a unique responsibility because \nwe exercise oversight concerning the Department of Justice and the FBI. \nSo the firing of James Comey, among other actions that raised issues \nregarding potential collusion and obstruction of justice, is very much \nappropriate and necessary for our inquiry to determine.\n  We also have a unique responsibility because only the Judiciary \nCommittee can make public for the American people to know and \nunderstand what happened that may involve obstruction of justice and, \nequally important, what can be done to prevent it in the future. The \nCommittee on the Judiciary of the Senate can legislate.\n  There are other investigations ongoing involving the special counsel, \nwho will determine criminal culpability, and the Intelligence \nCommittees of both the House and the Senate, which have a \ncounterterrorism responsibility, but they rarely legislate in the way \nthat the Judiciary Committee does.\n  I am proud to serve on the Judiciary Committee. I greatly respect the \nleadership of our committee: Chairman Grassley, who is a straight \nshooter, cares deeply about the integrity of our judicial process, and \nhas a longstanding and distinguished record of protecting \nwhistleblowers; and our ranking member, Senator Dianne Feinstein of \nCalifornia, who has been a steadfast champion of judicial integrity.\n  Every week we are seeing cascading disclosures that reflect potential \ncollusion or cooperation between the Trump campaign and Russian \nofficials. These disclosures reflect on the obstruction of justice that \nis front and center of the Judiciary Committee's investigation.\n  Just this week, through a stunning expose in The Atlantic, later \nconfirmed by Donald Trump, Jr., himself, the American people learned of \nsecret exchanges between WikiLeaks and Donald Trump, Jr., during the \n2016 Presidential campaign. The exchanges began in September 2016--2 \nmonths before the election. Over the course of those exchanges, \nWikiLeaks sent literally dozens of messages to Trump Junior, who sent \nback at least three messages. He acted at WikiLeaks' behest at least \none time, tweeting out a link to the hacked emails of John Podesta, \nJr., at WikiLeaks' suggestion. He told other high-ranking officials on \nthe Trump campaign that WikiLeaks had reached out to him in an \nextraordinarily revealing message. At no point did he rebuff the \nadvances--in fact, just the opposite. At no point did he reject those \novertures from WikiLeaks. And what we are seeing, particularly in the \nfamiliar tone, almost intimate nature of these exchanges back and \nforth, is the possibility that what we have discovered is just the tip \nof the iceberg in those exchanges.\n  These revelations are stunning. They are jaw-dropping. The son of the \nPresident of the United States--then candidate--actively engaged and \nmay have coordinated strategy with a group that the current CIA \nDirector has called a ``hostile intelligence service.'' The present \nDirector of the CIA, appointed by the President of the United States, \nDonald Trump, characterized WikiLeaks as a ``hostile intelligence \nservice''--and that is a direct quote--and then observed that it is \noften abetted by hostile Nation states like Russia.\n  Without subpoenaing Donald Trump, Jr., to testify in public, we \ncannot be sure we have the full record.\n  One of the most stunning aspects of this exchange, indeed, was its \nvery personal tone. Many who read the coverage may sense and feel, \nunderstandably and rightly, that we are reading fragments of a longer \nand larger conversation that may have involved other participants or \nrelied on other means of communication. We are inevitably and \ninexorably left with some very key questions:\n  How did Donald Trump, Jr., know of WikiLeaks' plan to leak Podesta's \nemails before they were even released?\n  Why did WikiLeaks feel confident it could inform Trump Junior that \nthey had hacked Podesta's emails without worrying that he would turn \nthis information over to law enforcement? Hacking is a crime. How could \nWikiLeaks be in the least bit confident that Donald Trump, Jr., would \nnot report that crime to the proper authorities? And he did not.\n  Perhaps most crucially, why would Trump Junior see an invitation from \nWikiLeaks to coordinate efforts as anything other than inappropriate, \nunethical, and a potentially illegal act?\n  Given the stakes, my expectation was--and the American people could \nlikewise expect the same--that our committee would act quickly and \ntransparently to answer those questions raised by these messages as \nwell as the interview conducted by our committee staff of Donald Trump, \nJr. That is what I was expecting when these messages were first \nprovided to the Judiciary Committee roughly 2 months ago. My \nexpectation was that Donald Trump, Jr., would be compelled to testify \nand that he would be subpoenaed to provide a full record of his \ncommunications relating to Russia's interference in our elections. \nSurely those subpoenas that were discussed, even issued over the \nsummer, would now be reissued and enforced.\n\n  The lack of action has been frustrating to me. Likewise, I have been \ndisappointed that we have made virtually no progress toward scheduling \na public hearing with Donald Trump, Jr., and other key individuals \ninvolved in this investigation. The subpoenas have not been reissued. I \nhave called repeatedly for that action to be taken. The documents have \nnot been subpoenaed. Those key documents that are so relevant and \nnecessary to our investigation have not been subpoenaed, as I have \nasked to be done repeatedly.\n  That is why I am here today to raise concerns about the Senate \nJudiciary Committee's investigation into Russia's interference in our \nelection, possible collusion by the Trump campaign, and obstruction of \njustice.\n  The threat is that the investigation is stalling. The danger of lack \nof progress is depriving the American people of information they \ndeserve. I recognize that congressional investigations must operate \nmethodically, systematically, and in some cases confidentially until \nthe committee is ready to release its findings. But that \nconfidentiality can serve an important purpose if it aids an \ninvestigation--not if it engenders the kind of lack of trust that is \nclearly a possibility here, not if it engenders that lack of trust, not \nif it endangers confidence and trust in the process. There may be a \nneed for confidentiality to encourage cooperation of witnesses, but \nultimately the American people deserve disclosure.\n  There is a need for impetus and urgency in this investigation. The \nAmerican people must be made aware of key facts and issues raised by \nthese documents and the interviews conducted so far. My hope is that \ncolleagues will join me in asking for more progress, more disclosure, \nand more transparency, because the American people need and deserve \nthat kind of disclosure.\n  Without the exposure provided by a free and independent press, \njustice delayed could have extended into justice denied. That is the \ndanger. Secrecy threatens to stall the investigation, and my hope is \nthat we will have the kind of transparency in greater measure that is \nnecessary for trust and confidence in this investigation.\n  I hope my colleagues on the Senate Judiciary Committee will join me \nin demanding that Donald Trump, Jr., and other key figures in the \ninvestigation testify under subpoena, in public,\n\n\nunder oath, and that documents be subpoenaed as well. The Senate \nJudiciary Committee has a particularly critical role in exposing the \ntruth. Even if criminal charges are never brought, the American people \nhave a right to know whether their public officials have held \nthemselves to the standard of honesty, loyalty, and integrity that they \nhave a right to expect. This body is in the best position to provide \nthat measure of truth--hopefully the whole truth--to the American \npeople.\n  There are many Members whose leadership on this issue I appreciate. \nAs I mentioned, Senator Feinstein is sending a second tranche of \nletters this afternoon on this investigation. But we are allowing time \nto pass without progress. That opportunity, once lost, cannot be \nrecovered with the measure of importance that it deserves. We must \nissue subpoenas. We must hold public hearings. We must get to the \ntruth, and it must be done now.\n  Thank you.\n  I will refer these remarks to my colleagues with great respect for \nthem and for the leadership of this committee. And I will come back to \nthe floor. I will return to this subject because I think it is so \ncritically important.

Mr. President, we are having a chance now to take a \nlook at the House and Senate Republican tax plans. Both of these plans \nwere cooked up largely in secret, and as more information comes out, we \nsee more and more how much damage they are going to do to our country.\n  The plans have many features that overlap, and one of those \noverlapping features is that both of them provide a massive tax \ngiveaway to big corporations and powerful special interests. The Wall \nStreet Journal, in an article just a little while back that was looking \nat the House plan, talked about a provision that is also in the Senate \nplan. They said that, at a 20-percent corporate tax rate, banks stand \nto be among the biggest winners from tax reform according to S&P Global \nMarket Intelligence. The five biggest diversified U.S. banks alone \nmight have had tax savings of $11.5 billion in 2016 at that rate. In \nother words, if that 20 percent rate had been in place back in 2016, \nthose big banks--the biggest banks--would have seen that huge windfall, \nthat huge additional profit.\n  A recent analysis from Bloomberg Law estimates that banks could see a \n12-percent drop in their effective tax rates and an 18-percent increase \nin their profits. This is at a time that the biggest banks in the \nUnited States--not the community banks, but the biggest banks in this \ncountry--are already making huge profits, and this just provides them \nwith an extra tax windfall that is going to be paid by millions of \nmiddle-class taxpayers and paid by increasing our national debt.\n  Of course, as the national debt goes up, people will come around and \nsay: OK, let's also pay for them by cutting Medicare and Medicaid. In \nfact, that is right there in the Senate Republican budget. So the \nbottom line is that both the House and the Senate Republican tax plans \nare big giveaways to big corporations, paid for by many other \nAmericans.\n  Now, this is not the only way the Trump administration is working to \nprovide big giveaways to the biggest banks. We remember back during the \nfinancial crisis and the meltdown that taxpayers had to be brought in \nto save big financial institutions in order to protect the larger \neconomy. It was a terribly difficult decision people had to make to \nprotect the economy, and at that time we said: Never again are we going \nto allow the big banks on Wall Street to gamble in a way that leaves \ntaxpayers--all of our constituents--on the hook. They can take risks, \nbut they shouldn't be taking risks with taxpayer money. That was the \nwhole purpose of the Wall Street reforms.\n  Now comes the Trump administration, and in addition to a tax plan \nthat wants to provide big corporate breaks to the biggest banks, they \nwant to take down a lot of the guardrails that prevent banks from \ntaking big risks that taxpayers will end up paying for. One of the ways \nthey are trying to bring down those guardrails is by appointing people \nto very important positions within the government who oversee the big \nbanks but who have a history of very cozy relationships with those big \nbanks, so that they can bring down the guardrails which, once again, \nwill expose taxpayers to the risks of gambling on Wall Street.\n  Mr. President, that brings me to the nomination that is before the \nSenate today, the nomination of Joseph Otting to be the next \nComptroller of the Currency. With so much going on right now, I wish to \ntake one moment to step back and talk about what the Comptroller does, \nbecause the Comptroller of the Currency plays a critical role in \nensuring the stability of our national banking system. It is there to \nmake sure that our banks don't blow up our financial system in the kind \nof way we saw happen in 2008 and the years leading up to that.\n  The OCC has been an independent agency since the Civil War. The \nComptroller has to be confirmed with the advice and consent of the \nSenate, and the reason that process was put in place was to make sure \nwe preserved the agency's independence and safeguarded our financial \nsystem from the whims of the executive branch. You don't want somebody \nat the head of the OCC who is simply the lackey for the \nadministration--whatever administration might be in power.\n  Now, the OCC is responsible for the supervision of more than 1,400 \nnational banks and Federal savings associations and about 50 Federal \nbranches and agencies of foreign banks in the United States. These \ninstitutions together comprise nearly two-thirds of the assets of the \ncommercial banking system. They require prudent, smart, reasonable \nregulation to ensure that they comply with the laws that Congress has \npassed to prevent another financial crisis--to prevent another \nfinancial crisis in which it was not Wall Street executives who, at the \nend of the day, were left holding the bag, but it was the American \npeople who had to pay the bill and who took it on the chin in the form \nof a collapsing economy and lost jobs and wages.\n\n  Yet we see this President and the Secretary of the Treasury, Mr. \nMnuchin, continuing down the path to lower those guardrails and expose \ntaxpayers to greater risk. One of the things they need to do that is to \nhave somebody at the head of OCC who is not going to be an independent \nperson but somebody who is willing to do the bidding of the Secretary \nof the Treasury and the President of the United States.\n  As I said, normally the OCC leader is supposed to go through the \nconfirmation process to preserve that independence, but under the Trump \nadministration, they wanted to get going right away in lowering the \nguardrails and giving big banks more running room even if that put \ntaxpayers at risk. So rather than offer a Senate nominee early in the \nyear, the President and Secretary Mnuchin used an underhanded tactic to \ninstall a person by the name of Keith Noreika as Comptroller.\n  By using this procedure, they sidestepped the Senate confirmation \nprocess and, by the way, also allowed Mr. Noreika to sidestep the Trump \nadministration's ethics pledge and ethics requirements. So that is who \nis there right now--Mr. Noreika--and he has spent most of his career, \nprior to taking that position, telling big banks how they can avoid \nregulations that are designed to protect taxpayers and protect the \neconomy. In fact, if you look at the ethics forms that he did file, he \nhad to recuse himself from virtually all the major banks that the OCC \nregulates. His work in the private sector created an unprecedented \nseries of conflicts of interests far more than any other person in that \nposition and underscoring the need for someone to have to go through \nthe Senate confirmation process, rather than trying to short-circuit \nthat process with underhanded tactics.\n  I was very concerned about the use of this runaround and asked the \nSecretary's inspector general to initiate an investigation into the \nmeans and\n\n\nmanner of that appointment, because what happened was that Mr. Noreika \nwas designated what is called ``a special government employee,'' or an \nSGE. When you use that mechanism, you are only supposed to have the \nperson serve in that position for 130 days of the year. It is a very \nunusual type of appointment and almost never used when it comes to the \nhead of an agency. In fact, this may be close to the first time.\n  Well, that 130-day deadline, if you count by calendar days, expired \nin September. Yet now we have a new interpretation of the law, which is \na wild stretch, saying: Well, it is not calendar days. We are going to \ncount it as business days. But the whole point here is that this \nmechanism--this underhanded mechanism--has been used to allow this new \nperson, Mr. Noreika, at the OCC.\n  In that period of time, by looking at what he has done, we can see he \nwasn't installed there just to be a caretaker. He has been very active \nin those early months in working very hard to lower many of the \nprotections we have put in place for taxpayers and for our financial \nsystem. He was in the middle of the effort to repeal the Consumer \nFinancial Protection Bureau's mandatory arbitration rule, to roll back \nthe OCC's Community Reinvestment Act supervisory guidance, and to \neliminate the deposit advance guidance rule, which is a rule that makes \nit more difficult for national banks to provide payday loans at \noutrageous rates that are unaffordable to the people who take them out.\n  Since Mr. Noreika has been at the OCC, the OCC has been involved in \nhelping one of his former clients circumvent Federal guidance intended \nto prevent banks from shopping around for hands-off regulators who will \nnot scrutinize their activities--in other words, forum shopping for \nbank regulators.\n  Just this morning, the Wall Street Journal reported that on November \n7 the Bank of Tokyo converted the license of its New York State branch \nfrom a State license to a Federal license. So why did they do that? Why \ndid they do that at this time? Well, this decision to change regulators \ncame in the middle of an ongoing investigation by the New York \nDepartment of Financial Services into that bank's lack of scrutiny of \nits clients, some of whom are suspected of evading U.S. sanctions on \nIran and North Korea.\n  Now, the OCC's licensing manual says that it draws heavily on \ninformation received from the Office's current U.S. supervisor and \nother confidential and supervisory information available to the OCC \nwhen considering the application from a financial institution that \nwants to switch from State supervision to Federal supervision. That \ncourtesy and that guideline were not applied in this case. That \ninformation and that notice were not provided to the New York \nDepartment of Financial Services, and the OCC has refused to act in \nresponse to this effort by the financial institution to evade \noversight.\n  As a result, the Bank of Tokyo--which is a former client of the \ncurrent head of the OCC, Mr. Noreika--is now going to be supervised by \nhis office. It appears to have successfully dodged an active \ninvestigation into its clients' potential evasion of U.S. sanctions on \nforeign adversaries--in this case, North Korea and Iran. So that is the \nperson who was installed by the Trump administration during these first \nmonths, from the beginning of the year until now, using this \nunderhanded method.\n  Finally, we now have the nomination put forward for the person who \nwill permanently be proposed to head up the OCC, Joseph Otting. In Mr. \nOtting, we have another example of somebody whose entire career has \nbeen spent working with banks and other major financial institutions to \ntry to evade important consumer protections and taxpayer protections.\n  In fact, Mr. Otting and his bank were able to profit very handsomely \nfrom the mortgage crisis. The CEO of OneWest during part of that crisis \nwas the person who is now Secretary of the Treasury, Stephen Mnuchin. \nHe was the head of OneWest during the foreclosure crisis. During that \ntime, OneWest had what many have called a foreclosure machine in place. \nMr. Otting, who is going to be the head of the OCC--and whom we would \nhope would be more independent, as required by the charter of the OCC--\nwas there working for the Secretary of the Treasury, Steve Mnuchin, at \nOneWest. Mr. Otting was there working at OneWest when the bank \nforeclosed on nearly 40,000 Americans. OneWest received more than $1 \nbillion in taxpayer money to cover OneWest's losses.\n  Those are exactly the kind of losses we are trying to avoid in the \naftermath of the crisis; that we are trying to avoid by adopting the \nWall Street reform bill Dodd-Frank so taxpayers--our constituents--\naren't left holding the bag for decisions made by people like Mr. \nOtting or Mr. Mnuchin.\n  According to one media summary, OneWest Bank ``rushed delinquent \nhomeowners out of their homes by violating notice and waiting period \nstatutes, illegally backdated key documents, and effectively gamed \nforeclosure auctions.''\n  In the reverse mortgage business, OneWest-controlled firm Financial \nFreedom engaged in practices that led to more than 16,000 foreclosures, \na far greater number than would be expected based on the company's \nmarket share.\n  Elderly individuals who had recently suffered the death of a spouse \nwere victimized. In one case, Financial Freedom attempted to evict a \n90-year-old woman from her home over a 27-cent error on her insurance \npayment.\n  In another case, a New York State Supreme Court judge called \nOneWest's foreclosure practices ``harsh, repugnant, shocking, and \nrepulsive.'' Yet the person who has now been nominated to lead the \nOCC--Office of the Comptroller of the Currency--a person who is \nsupposed to be looking out for consumers' and taxpayers' interests and \nproviding for a sound banking system that doesn't melt down our \neconomy, is Mr. Otting. He was the person who was in the middle of \nthese OneWest foreclosure transactions.\n  I hope this body will not support that nomination.\n\n\n                          Republican Tax Plan\n\n  Mr. President, I started by talking about the tax bill. I want to get \nback to making a few more remarks about that tax bill. There is one \nthing that is in common between the nomination of Mr. Otting to oversee \nmuch of the banking system and the tax bill. Both of them are part of \nan effort to provide big gifts to big banks and to corporate America. \nWe are seeing the Trump administration trying to use government power \nto help these large financial institutions at the expense of consumers \nand at the expense of taxpayers.\n  Let's just take a look at what happened yesterday and is continuing \nto happen in the Senate Finance Committee. Republicans on that \ncommittee and the Republican tax plan couldn't have sent a clearer \nmessage than they did just yesterday; that the Republican tax plan puts \nbig corporate interests first and leaves the rest of the country \nbehind, including millions of people in the middle class who will be \nleft holding the bag.\n  Under the new tax plan, the tax cuts for corporations--those big tax \ncuts, reducing the rate from 35 percent to 20 percent--go on forever. \nThey go on for the first 10 years. They go on for the next 10 years. \nThey go on forever, but for everybody else, for those other Americans \nwho get some tax cut under this bill, all those tax cuts go away after \n10 years. They get sunsetted.\n  If you are one of the folks in the middle where Republicans say: Hey, \nthis bill is for you; you will get some benefit, it is going away, but \nthe corporate tax cut is there forever.\n  I want to be clear. There are lots of folks in the middle--millions--\nwho aren't going to get to see any initial tax benefit. In fact, they \nare going to be paying more in taxes. We also saw, as part of this bill \nyesterday, an effort to repeal important provisions of the Affordable \nCare Act, changes that will result in 13 million Americans losing \naccess to the Affordable Care Act and premiums being jacked up by 10 \npercent on the individual market.\n  Let's do the math here. Thirteen million Americans lose access to the \nAffordable Care Act; premiums go up by 10 percent; middle-class \nfamilies--millions of them--pay higher taxes, all to finance a \npermanent corporate tax cut.\n  Let's take a moment and look at who these multinational corporations \nare because ultimately the benefits, the profits, go to the CEOs, the \nexecutives, and of course they go to the shareholders.\n\n\n  Let's look at who some of these shareholders are who are going to get \nthis whopping big tax benefit from cutting the corporate tax rate. When \nyou dig under here a little bit, you discover that 35 percent of U.S. \ncorporate stock is owned by foreigners--people who aren't Americans. So \n35 percent of the people who get the benefit of that gigantic corporate \ntax cut are foreign stockholders. According to the Institute of \nTaxation and Economic Policy, those foreign stockholders are going to \nget a $31 billion windfall from the Republican tax plan in 2019 alone. \nYou have the sunset of the individual taxes, but corporate tax breaks \ngo on forever. Millionaires and billionaires are the biggest winners \nunder the plan.\n  President Trump reportedly made this phone call to a number of \nSenators just the other day, saying: Hey, guess what. I am going to be \na ``big loser'' under this Republican tax plan. That is what President \nTrump said. Well, Mr. President, prove it. President Trump, release \nyour tax returns, as Presidents have routinely done for decades, and \nshow the American people that this plan doesn't enrich the Trump family \nand the Trump businesses because here is what the Chicago Tribune says: \n``Trump says he's a `big loser' in GOP tax plan; experts say it could \nsave him tens of millions.''\n  In fact, just one part of the Republican tax plan--cutting the taxes \non large estates--could give President Trump's heirs a windfall of $4.4 \nmillion. That is because the plan doubles the amount of money that is \nexempt from estate taxes. I am talking about the Senate plan. The \nSenate plan can provide that $4.4 million windfall because the \nexemption today is for estates under $11 million. In other words, if \nyou are a couple with an estate under $11 million, you don't pay a \nsingle penny in Federal estate tax. The Senate Republican plan takes \nthat up to $22 million, and in doing so will provide President Trump's \nheirs with a big windfall. In fact, if you use the House plan--which \nrepeals it entirely--we are talking about a windfall of over $1 \nbillion.\n  The Republican plan also eliminates the alternative minimum tax. That \nwas a provision put in the Tax Code to provide some equity because a \nlot of wealthy people with good lawyers are able to take advantage of \nlots of deductions that many Americans in the middle are not able to \nclaim. We wanted to make sure folks who made a ton of money couldn't \nescape all of their responsibility to the rest of the country and paid \ntheir fair share of taxes. That is why we adopted the alternative \nminimum tax.\n  Well, we know that back in 2005, President Trump, when he filed his \ntax returns, had to pay a tax in that year because of the alternative \nminimum tax. In fact, in that year it was $31 million. So let's get rid \nof that provision. That will help a lot of very wealthy people escape \nany tax obligation--even as folks in the middle pay theirs.\n  There is another way the Trump enterprises will benefit from this \nRepublican tax plan, and that is through the so-called passthrough \nbusiness provisions. These are businesses that don't pay corporate \ntaxes. Their profits are passed through and taxed on the individual \nreturns of their owners. A lot of people want the public to think all \nthese passthroughs are small mom-and-pops.\n  I want to be there. We want to help mom-and-pops. We should be \nproviding some tax benefits and relief to mom-and-pops, but everyone \nwho looks at this knows a lot of those passthroughs are not mom-and-\npops. Many of them are on the Fortune 500 list in the United States--\nthe 500 wealthiest entities. In fact, some of these passthrough \nentities are in the Fortune 100 list--not mom-and-pops. Guess who owns \nmore than 500 passthrough entities--the Trump Organization. They will \nget a big windfall.\n  President Trump, show the American public your tax forms before you \ngo around telling people you are going to be a ``big loser'' from this \nplan.\n  Now, it is not just about President Trump; it is just one example of \nthe very wealthy Americans who are going to get a windfall under this \nplan.\n  A provision that was put into the Senate Republican plan will help a \nlot of very well-heeled lobbyists here in Washington, DC. Under the \nSenate Republican plan, if you are a married lobbyist making up to \n$500,000 a year, you get to claim a deduction for 17.4 percent of your \nincome. That is an $87,000 tax deduction if you are making $500,000 a \nyear. But if you are the secretary working for that lobbying firm or if \nyou are somebody hired to help clean up the firm, sorry--you are out of \nluck. You don't get that special lobbyist passthrough tax rate.\n  The question is, Who is going to pay for all of this at the end of \nthe day? We are providing this huge tax giveaway to big corporations. \nWe are providing tax breaks to the very wealthiest estates in the \ncountry--which, by the way, are only about 2 out of 1,000 taxpayers. \nThere are fewer than 5,000 taxpayers in the country each year who end \nup paying that estate tax, the very wealthiest in the country. Who is \ngoing to pay for all of this? Well, millions of middle-class taxpayers \nare going to pay under this plan.\n  We know from the Joint Committee on Taxation that in 2019, the Senate \nRepublican plan will raise taxes on more than 13 million middle-class \nfamilies, people with incomes below $200,000. By 2025, more than 21 \nmillion middle-class families are going to get a tax hike. This is a \nplan that is being sold to the public as something that provides \nmiddle-class tax relief, but the Joint Committee on Taxation--the pros, \nthe nonpartisan experts here in Congress--tells us that plan is going \nto raise taxes on 21 million middle-class families.\n  One of the biggest sources of this increase in taxes for middle-class \nfamilies is the complete repeal in the Senate bill of people's ability \nto deduct State and local taxes. More than 100 million American \nfamilies use this deduction today. Repealing it is double taxation, \npure and simple. Those taxpayers now pay a dollar in tax to their \nState, whether it be the State of Maryland, the State of Oklahoma, \nwhatever it may be. Now they are going to be paying Federal taxes on \nthe dollar that they sent to support the State government.\n  The Senate bill is even worse than the House bill. The House bill is \nbad on this issue, but it is hard to believe that the Senate actually \nmade this provision even worse.\n  If you look at this chart, it is interesting because what you find is \nthat the huge corporate tax cut helps a lot of foreign investors. In \nfact, as I indicated, approximately 35 percent of all the stockholders \nare foreign investors. So that is going to give them, in just the year \n2019, a $31 billion tax break. This is money we are sending to \nforeigners, foreign stockholders. In that same year, we find out that \nAmericans--many folks who are in the middle, middle-class Americans--\nare going to pay $34 billion more in taxes. So you are asking middle-\nclass American families to finance big tax cuts for foreigners who own \nstock in American corporations. What a gift to American middle-class \ntaxpayers. That is a direct transfer from them to foreign stockholders.\n  When you deny people the ability to deduct their State and local \ntaxes, you are also taxing decisions by State and local governments, \nwhich is ironic since our Republican colleagues have always said that \nit is best to leave most decisions to our local and State leaders \nbecause they are close to the people. Now you are taxing the decisions \nthat they make to support their schools, to support their firefighters, \nto make investments locally. Now taxpayers in those communities have to \npay their local government or pay their State, and then they have to \npay the Feds on that same money that they just paid to their city or to \ntheir State for important services, such as schools for our kids.\n  Here is the crazy thing about this Republican tax plan. Even after \nyou ask middle-class American families to pay more--millions and \nmillions of them--so that foreign stockholders get can get a tax break, \neven after you do you all that, it raises the national debt by $1.5 \ntrillion.\n  For many years, I served as the senior Democrat on the House Budget \nCommittee. At that time, the current Speaker of the House, Paul Ryan, \nwas the chairman of that committee, and he talked all the time about \nthe dangers and risks of adding to our national debt. You know what. \nThat is actually an area in which we found some agreement, because we \nshouldn't have an\n\n\never-rising national debt. Yet this Republican tax plan is calculated \nto increase the national debt by a whopping $1.5 trillion.\n  People cared about our national debt when that was used as a reason \nto propose cuts to Medicare and Medicaid and Social Security, but when \nit comes to financing tax breaks for foreign stockholders and big \ncorporations, apparently that debt doesn't matter.\n  I have a prediction to make. I have a prediction that if this tax \nbill goes through and we blow up the national debt by $1.5 trillion, \nSpeaker Ryan and everybody else who told us about the risks and dangers \nof a big national debt--all of a sudden, they are going to rediscover \ntheir commitment to reducing the national debt. They forgot about it \nwhen it came to financing big tax breaks, but you know what--gosh, \nreally, it is a big deal. And then they are not going to talk about \nrolling back the tax breaks they just gave the big corporations; they \nare going to go about cutting important investments--cutting Medicare, \ncutting Medicaid, cutting education.\n  Do you know why I am very confident that we can predict that is what \nis going to happen? Because our Republican colleagues have told us. It \nis right there in the budget. It is in their budget that passed the \nSenate and passed the House. Just open up those budgets. There is \nalmost a $500 billion cut to Medicare--$473 billion to be exact. There \nis a $1 trillion cut to Medicaid in the Republican budget. There are \nbig cuts to domestic investments, and that is the category of our \nbudget that funds education, modernizing our infrastructure, and \nmedical research. It is all right there in the Republican budget.\n  I hope that the American public is going to have a chance to focus on \nthis. I understand why people are trying to speed this through--speed \nit through the House before Thanksgiving, speed it through the House \nand Senate before the end of the year--but people are beginning to wake \nup to this. I can assure my colleagues that when they find out exactly \nwhat is in this Republican plan, they are going to be very, very angry \nbecause all those middle-class families who were sold a bill of goods, \nthinking they are going to get this big tax cut--uh-uh. Millions of \nthem are going to see a tax increase to finance tax breaks for big \ncorporations and very wealthy Americans and will pay for it by rising \nnational debt and ultimately cuts to important health and retirement \nand security programs, as well as education.\n  I hope people will turn back now. The way to do this is the way tax \nreform was done in 1986--in a bipartisan, transparent fashion.
