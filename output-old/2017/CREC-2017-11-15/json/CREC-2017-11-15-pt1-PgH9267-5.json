Mr. Speaker, in a nationwide competition, \nRollins College achieved one of the highest student voter turnout rates \nin the 2016 Presidential election.\n  I want to recognize the hardworking students and faculty at the \nRollins Democracy Project for this accomplishment, which reflects the \nschool's commitment to preparing the next generation of engaged \ncitizens and global leaders.\n  As Justice Brandeis once observed, the only title in our democracy \nsuperior to that of President is the title of citizen.\n  Our democracy withers when our citizens are disengaged from and \ncynical about the political process. However, it is strongest when our \ncitizens are engaged and informed. Our democracy works best when our \ncitizens use their voice and their vote to hold elected leaders \naccountable. It thrives when our citizens understand that, while the \nright to vote is sacred, it is only powerful if it is exercised.\n  Mr. Speaker, that is why what this school accomplished is so \nimportant and why I am so proud to represent Rollins College in \nCongress.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mrs. MURPHY of Florida", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "187", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H9267", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "15", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "ROLLINS DEMOCRACY PROJECT IS A SUCCESS", "id": "CREC-2017-11-15-pt1-PgH9267-5", "title": "ROLLINS DEMOCRACY PROJECT IS A SUCCESS"}
