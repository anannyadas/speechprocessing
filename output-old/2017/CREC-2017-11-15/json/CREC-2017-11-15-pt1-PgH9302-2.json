results in its regulated books of account, reduces \n     the excess tax reserve more rapidly or to a greater extent \n     than such reserve would be reduced under the average rate \n     assumption method.\n       (2) Alternative method for certain taxpayers.--If, as of \n     the first day of the taxable year that includes the date of \n     enactment of this Act--\n       (A) the taxpayer was required by a regulatory agency to \n     compute depreciation for public utility property on the basis \n     of an average life or composite rate method, and\n       (B) the taxpayer's books and underlying records did not \n     contain the vintage account data necessary to apply the \n     average rate assumption method,\n     the taxpayer will be treated as using a normalization method \n     of accounting if, with respect to such jurisdiction, the \n     taxpayer uses the alternative method for public utility \n     property that is subject to the regulatory authority of that \n     jurisdiction.\n       (3) Definitions.--For purposes of this subsection--\n       (A) Excess tax reserve.--The term ``excess tax reserve'' \n     means the excess of--\n       (i) the reserve for deferred taxes (as described in section \n     168(i)(9)(A)(ii) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 as in \n     effect on the day before the date of the enactment of this \n     Act), over\n       (ii) the amount which would be the balance in such reserve \n     if the amount of such reserve were determined by assuming \n     that the corporate rate reductions provided in this Act were \n     in effect for all prior periods.\n       (B) Average rate assumption method.--The average rate \n     assumption method is the method under which the excess in the \n     reserve for deferred taxes is reduced over the remaining \n     lives of the property as used in its regulated books of \n     account which gave rise to the reserve for deferred taxes. \n     Under such method, if timing differences for the property \n     reverse, the amount of the adjustment to the reserve for the \n     deferred taxes is calculated by multiplying--\n       (i) the ratio of the aggregate deferred taxes for the \n     property to the aggregate timing differences for the property \n     as of the beginning of the period in question, by\n       (ii) the amount of the timing differences which reverse \n     during such period.\n       (C) Alternative method.--The ``alternative method'' is the \n     method in which the taxpayer--\n       (i) computes the excess tax reserve on all public utility \n     property included in the plant account on the basis of the \n     weighted average life or composite rate used to compute \n     depreciation for regulatory purposes, and\n       (ii) reduces the excess tax reserve ratably over the \n     remaining regulatory life of the property.\n       (4) Tax increased for normalization violation.--If, for any \n     taxable year ending after the date of the enactment of this \n     Act, the taxpayer does not use a normalization method of \n     accounting, the taxpayer's tax for the taxable year shall be \n     increased by the amount by which it reduces its excess tax \n     reserve more rapidly than permitted under a normalization \n     method of accounting.\n\n                       Subtitle B--Cost Recovery\n", "turn": -1,

Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Speaker, today the full House begins consideration of H.R. 1, the \nTax Cuts and Jobs Act, historic tax reform legislation that will \nrevitalize our economy and provide lasting tax relief to Americans of \nall walks of life.\n  Over 30 years have gone by since the last overhaul of our Nation's \ntax system. In that time, our Tax Code has become one of the most \ncomplicated, unfair, and uncompetitive in the world. Today it is \nimpacting nearly every aspect of Americans' lives, and not for the \nbetter.\n  The overwhelming complexity of today's system forces American \ntaxpayers to spend billions of hours and billions of dollars every year \njust filing their taxes. Trillions of dollars in carve-outs and \nloopholes give favoritism to Washington special interests while \nhardworking Americans get nothing but frustration.\n  With some of the highest tax rates in the world for our businesses, \nwe are seeing good-paying American jobs and manufacturing plants move \noverseas one after the other.\n  Today, with the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, we change all of this. With \nthis bill, we have an opportunity to deliver the most transformational \ntax overhaul in a generation. But make no mistake, this bill is not \nabout us. It is not about Congress. This bill is about--for the first \ntime in decades--providing the American people with a simple and fair \ntax system, so much so that nine out of ten Americans will be able to \nfile using a simple postcard-style system. It is about finally \nrewarding hard work, growing jobs and paychecks, and allowing Americans \nto keep more of their hard-earned money to use on whatever is important \nto them.\n  So if you are one of the millions of Americans who is sick of today's \nTax Code, you are going to see a remarkable difference. You will see \nthe standard deduction doubled, increasing to protect more of every \npaycheck from taxes. You will have a larger child tax credit, providing \nmore support as you raise a family and care for your loved ones. More \nAmericans will get help raising their kids.\n  You will have peace of mind when it comes to life's most important \ninvestments because this bill preserves tax benefits to help you afford \nyour home, to pay your property taxes, and put your kids through \ncollege.\n  So if you are a typical middle-income family of four making $59,000 a \nyear, you are going to get a tax cut of nearly $1,200. More than that, \nyou are going to enjoy the benefits of a strong, healthy, and growing \nAmerican economy. You are going to see more jobs on Main Street.\n  With this bill, our small businesses will finally have low tax rates \nand a fair Tax Code that works with them as they grow and create jobs. \nYou are going to see our larger businesses--our iconic American brands \nand our major manufacturers--win throughout the world and create new, \ngood-paying jobs right here at home because, with this bill, we are \ngoing to have one of the most modern and one of the most competitive \nTax Codes on the planet. That includes lowering our corporate rate from \n35 to 20 percent, which beats many of our international competitors.\n  Not only are you going to see jobs stop leaving the United States, \nyou are going to see our Nation become a 21st\n\n\ncentury magnet for job creation and business investment.\n  With the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the American people will see and help \nlead the way in launching a new era of Made in America innovation. In \nthe end, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is a striking alternative to the \nbroken Tax Code we have today. It represents a bold path forward that \nwill allow us as a country to break out of the slow-growth status quo \nonce and for all.\n  Mr. Speaker, the American people have waited years--decades--for a \nfair, simple, and competitive Tax Code. Right now, in this moment, we \nstand on the doorstep of delivering the most sweeping tax overhaul \nsince President Reagan's reforms in 1986. Like President Reagan back \nthen, President Trump is now putting his full support behind this \neffort.\n  Let's pass this historic bill and take another step forward in \ndelivering bold, pro-growth, pro-family tax reform for Americans \nthroughout this Nation.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.", "turn": 5, "speaker": "Mr. BRADY of Texas", "itemno": 266}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "N000015", "text": "  Mr. NEAL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I am delighted the chairman mentioned President Reagan. \nBut he made it sound as though President Reagan did tax reform on his \nown. Tax reform in 1986 was done in a bipartisan manner. I guess we \njust leave out Speaker O'Neill and we just leave out Chairman \nRostenkowski and we just leave out Senator Bradley or Congressman \nGephardt. The reason that they are left out is because even though it \nwas accomplished in 1986, it started in 1982 when Mr. Gephardt and Mr. \nBradley introduced the first tax reform act.\n\n\n  What happened in those intervening years?\n  The Ways and Means Committee took testimony from 50 witnesses. They \nheld 30 markups and an untold number of hearings.\n  Contrast that with what we did in the Ways and Means Committee: not \none witness, not one hearing, not one opportunity to hear from renowned \neconomists, labor leaders, or individuals who would have great \nknowledge not just of what happened in 1986, but what could happen in \nthis Chamber. Instead, we are going forward with this ill-considered \neffort.\n  This is a missed opportunity. This is a bad deal for millions of \nAmericans in the middle class. The legislation puts the wealthy, the \nwell-connected, and the strong, once again, at the top. Thirty-six \nmillion Americans are going to receive a tax increase.\n  When they talk about tax simplification, take a look at the phase-ins \nand phase-outs of this measure. That is hardly simplification. It is \ngreater complexity.\n  Oh, by the way, the corporate rate is made permanent. The individual \nissues phase out after 5 years.\n  Consider this: 13 million people will lose their health insurance \nbased on what Republicans are doing in the United States Senate. They \nare going to lose their healthcare to pay for a tax cut for people at \nthe very top.\n  Let me just walk you through some of these provisions because I think \nthat they deserve our attention and the magnifying glass of critical \nanalysis.\n  We are being asked tonight to borrow $2.3 trillion to pay for this \ntax cut. This is from people who regularly lecture the American \nelectorate on the need for fiscal austerity and balanced budgets.\n  When Barack Obama was President, the budget should be balanced. When \nBill Clinton was President, the budget should be balanced. But in the \nintervening period of time, apparently, we don't have to balance the \nbudget.\n  Also, $2.3 trillion is being added to the debt and deficits. We are \nwitnessing what they are attempting to do because they are going to \nscale back the tax benefit for buying a new home by lowering the cap on \nmortgage interest deduction to $500,000. That is going to lower home \nvalues.\n  H.R. 1 repeals the new markets tax credit. The historic tax credit \nthat has transformed American cities is being eliminated. They beat up \non the municipal bond market.\n  As a former mayor, I have some knowledge of the municipal bond \nmarket.\n  They are getting rid of the private activity bonds. Years ago, I \nraised the cap so that we might do more intervention and innovation in \nterms of rebuilding our airports across the country. Private activity \nbonds are a key for financing affordable housing. It is going to go by \nthe wayside if they have their way. It is going to have a profound \nimpact on the housing market.\n  They eliminate several deductions and exclusions that help pay for \ncollege education, including a deduction for interest on student loans.\n  Pay attention to this number. Student debt in America is at $1.3 \ntrillion, and they are taking away the ability of students to deduct \nthat interest on those loans.\n  They also impose a new tax on universities and colleges.\n  They repeal the above-the-line deduction for teachers' out-of-pocket \nexpenses. You know, those teachers who, in September, might be short \nsome school supplies and they are good enough to pack the car up and \nbring it to school? We give them a $250 deduction. They are going to \ntake it away.\n  They create a health tax, an Alzheimer's tax, by repealing the \nmedical expense deduction. This change basically scraps a family's \nability to receive financial relief when dealing with serious medical \nconditions.\n  Think of it this way: We celebrate annually the increases in life \nexpectancy in America--80 for a male, 81 for a female. But if we are \ngoing to celebrate that, we also have to acknowledge something else: \nmore dementia and more Alzheimer's as people grow older in America. So \ntheir decision is: Let's take away the ability of individuals to deduct \nthose expenses.\n  They also want to write off a very important consideration for the \nmiddle class in their ability to deduct real property tax costs up to \n$10,000.\n  Contrast this with what these tax cuts do for the wealthy.\n  H.R. 1 repeals the estate tax, which is paid by a small number of \nfamilies in America. They are going to repeal it. I guess the slogan \nbecomes: We are rich, and we are not going to take it anymore. That is \nnot a tax on Conrad Hilton; it is a tax on Paris Hilton. That is what \nwe should be considering with the greater efforts on their side to \nfurther concentrate wealth.\n  By the way, there is an issue I have worked on for decades here, \nsuccessfully, because 27 million middle class families no longer pay \nthe alternative minimum tax. But guess what they are going to do? They \nare going to eliminate it for 4.5 million of the richest families in \nAmerica. They are going to take away that payment.\n  This is a missed opportunity, Mr. Speaker. This could have been done \nthe way Chairman Brady indicated in 1986: hearings, markups, a genuine \neffort to find common ground on this.\n  On our side, I have waited all these years to do this. Tonight and \ntomorrow, what you are witnessing is that they need a victory. That is \nwhat this is about.

There was no \ncomprehensive offer of an amendment in the nature of a substitute that \nwould have been transformational.\n  There is no exclusion here. We debated. We are now here, and for the \nfirst time since 1986, we are on the cusp of seizing an opportunity and \nhaving a transformational moment.\n  Here is the transformation:\n\n\n  When the Tax Code was last amended 30 years ago--think about it--the \ninternet didn't exist as a commercial enterprise. Yes, it has fully \ndeveloped, and we have got a Tax Code that was built for yesterday.\n  The global nature of supply chains were nowhere nearly as intricately \ninterlinked, yet we have got a Tax Code that was built for yesterday.\n  The shared economy--Airbnb, Uber, Lyft, all of those things--didn't \nexist, yet we have got a Tax Code that was built for yesterday.\n  Who does the status quo benefit, Mr. Speaker? It benefits the few. It \nbenefits the privileged. It benefits the folks at the top of the \neconomic scale of things.\n  So what this is doing is proposing a very different approach. It says \nwe are going to make the United States the most competitive \njurisdiction in the world by giving business tax relief and welcoming \nback commercial enterprise and growth and prosperity and ingenuity and \ninvestment--that does what? It creates paychecks and it expands \nopportunities.\n  Kids graduated from college shouldn't have to grub around piecing \ntogether two jobs and living in their parents' basement. How absurd. We \ncan do much better. We are the biggest, best economy in the world, and \nit is time we acted like it.\n  This is transformational. To lean back and away from this and say, \noh, this Tax Code is a natural disaster; it is too big and too \noverwhelming and we can't deal with it is nonsense. We fundamentally \nreject that.\n  We are going to be measured in the future, Mr. Speaker, by this \nmoment.

Mr. Speaker, everyone knows that the Republican tax \nscam gives massive tax cuts to millionaires and billionaires and \ncorporations, and they do it, in part, by increasing healthcare costs \nfor millions of Americans. Over 36 million middle class households will \nsee a tax hike under this bill.\n  Families with big medical bills will take the hardest hit. That is \nbecause Americans will no longer be able to deduct major medical \nexpenses such as cancer treatment or Alzheimer's from their Federal \nincome taxes.\n  This is a middle class tax hike. Seven in ten households using the \nmedical expense deduction make under $75,000 a year. Repealing the \ndeduction would especially hurt seniors who use it for long-term care \nexpenses.\n  The bill takes a second swipe at American seniors and people with \ndisabilities. According to the Congressional Budget Office, by not \npaying for tax cuts for the wealthy, Republicans would trigger \nautomatic cuts to Medicare, slashing $25 billion from Medicare in 2018 \nalone.\n  But the $25 billion cut to Medicare is just the beginning. The same \nRepublican budget that cleared the way for $1.5 trillion in tax cuts \nfor the superwealthy proposed cutting Medicare and Medicaid by, no \ncoincidence, $1.5 trillion.\n  Now, Senate Republicans want to pay for additional tax cuts by \nrepealing a key part of the Affordable Care Act.

Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Brady for the \ntime and for his leadership as we continue our efforts to pass this \nhistoric legislation.\n  Mr. Speaker, after nearly 7 years of work in the Ways and Means \nCommittee and more than 31 years since our last true tax reform, many \nhearings along the way, it is time to pass historic comprehensive tax \nreform. Our current Tax Code is antiquated, as we know. It is complex, \nand it ignores many of the improvements and competitiveness, which have \nbeen adopted by every other major economy worldwide.\n  The time for tax reform is now. Others have already outlined many of \nthe highlights of this bill, but I think they warrant mentioning again.\n  Simplified compliance and rates for individuals and families means \nmore than 95 percent of Americans will be able to file their returns on \na postcard. Lower rates for small businesses recognize the important \nrole they play as job creators in our economy. A 20 percent top \ncorporate tax rate and transitioning to a territorial system will \nensure our businesses remain competitive with the rest of the world.\n  In addition to lower rates, expanded expensing will further encourage \nentrepreneurs to invest in capital to grow their businesses, and full \nrepeal of the death tax, including the continuation of step-up in \nbasis, will ensure our Nation's farmers, ranchers, and small \nmanufacturers can continue creating opportunity for generations to come \nwithout the threat of double taxation.\n  Our Tax Code shouldn't reward businesses and investors because they \nhired accountants and lawyers to help them avoid taxes, and the estate \ntax does exactly that right now. I think it is equally important to \npraise what the bill leaves alone in the Tax Code. With our impending \nentitlement crisis, we want Americans to save everything they can for \nretirement. This bill leaves those incentives intact.\n  It also excludes a proposal, which had initially been included in the \nbill, to apply self-employment taxes to rental income. This could have \nhad serious repercussions for ag land rental, and I am glad it was \ndropped. And I particularly appreciate how this bill continues the \ndeductibility of State and local taxes for businesses, including \nfarmers and ranchers.\n  U.S. producers have made great strides in increasing production on a \nper-acre basis, but land remains a primary input as they work to feed \nthe world. Ensuring the property tax on land and production remains \ndeductible as business cost is vital to their continued success.\n  This is the moment to finally provide the tax relief Americans have \nbeen asking for and to make our country competitive again.

It has led to a \nstagnant economy and sluggish growth. American businesses of all sizes \nhave some of the highest tax rates in the world, sending our jobs, our \nmanufacturing, our research, and our headquarters overseas.\n  And you know, the economic recovery hasn't been all that great since \nthe Great Recession--not that great for a lot of Americans. Half the \npopulation is living paycheck to paycheck. Many either have or are at \nrisk of having a lower standard of living than their parents. Young \npeople, like my daughter's generation, will go backwards if this \ncountry is not fundamentally more competitive. And then seniors and \nthose baby boomers preparing for retirement, who have a lifetime of \nsavings, are now at risk without a growing economy.\n  The reforms in this bill today will help real people with tax cuts \naimed to help middle-income families that want to save for the future \nand improve their own standard of living. The bill focuses on helping \nsmall businesses, Main Street Minnesota businesses with a simpler, \nclearer, and fairer Tax Code that is critical for job creation. It \nlowers small business rates to 25 percent and even provides a 9 percent \nrate for the smallest Main Street startups.\n  Modernizing the Tax Code is essential to allowing American businesses \nof all sizes to compete around the world and bring those jobs home. We \nneed to be able to sell where the customers are, and 95 percent of the \nworld's customers are outside the United States. The international \nreforms in this bill will incentivize businesses to bring their money \nhome to invest in our communities.\n  And importantly, this bill includes bipartisan legislation that I \nauthored, the Empowering Employees through Stock Ownership Act, which \nhelps those entrepreneurs and startups attract and retain talent. \nHardworking taxpayers, Mr. Speaker, deserve a Tax Code that is simpler, \nflatter, and fairer so that every American family and employer can file \ntheir taxes without having to hire an Army of lawyers and accountants.\n  Mr. Speaker, we have a choice. The choice is Americans. We can either \ntruly grow the economy and put ourselves back on the path to real \nprosperity, or we can continue the actual trend we have right now of \nweak economic growth, which only benefits the few and the privileged \nand will do nothing for regular folks when the next economic downturn \nhits.\n  Tax reform for me is about one thing and one thing only.

Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding.\n  Mr. Speaker, today I rise in support of H.R. 1, the Tax Cuts and Jobs \nAct of 2017.\n  We have worked hours--literally hundreds of hours--on this \nlegislation, and I commend Chairman Brady and the staff of the Ways and \nMeans Committee for all of their hard work.\n  Mr. Speaker, we have gone through this bill line by line. I have \npersonally fought for policies and ideas in this bill to make sure that \nit works for families, to make sure that it increases wages, and \ncreates more opportunity for folks all across America.\n  My goal in this was two-fold. Number one, I wanted to strengthen \nfamilies. Number two, I wanted to create a stronger future for America. \nThis tax reform package puts us well on our way to achieving these \ngoals and achieving some remarkable wins for the American people.\n  I say this because this plan simplifies the Tax Code. It simplifies \nit to the point that most people can file their taxes on a form the \nsize of a postcard. It also gives significantly lower rates. It \ndramatically expands the child tax credit. It keeps the child care \ncredit. It protects flexible spending benefits.\n  These provisions for working families are important to me. My home \nState of South Dakota has the highest rate of working families in the \nNation. The moms and dads in my State aren't working just for fun. They \nare working to pay the bills to provide for their families. They need \nmoney to put food on the table and to put a roof over their kids' \nheads. These provisions are going to help them pay their bills, take \ncare of their kids, go to work, and maybe, just maybe, get a little \nextra money that they can take their kids off for a weekend and do \nsomething fun together. That is important.\n  When these kids grow up, I want them to be able to find good, high-\npaying jobs. So I fought hard to make sure that our farmers, our \nranchers, and our small businesses could thrive under this new Tax \nCode. We got some pretty big wins for those folks.\n  In this bill, we fully and permanently repeal the death tax--that un-\nAmerican, unfair double tax. W give people better expensing tools and \nwe drive down the rate for small businesses. If we are going to make \nsure that our kids can thrive, we need to create opportunities for them \nto make sure that they can do it right here in America, and this tax \nreform package lets hardworking job creators do that better.\n\n  Mr. Speaker, I understand that no tax reform plan is going to be \nperfect in everybody's eyes, but this proposal is a strong step \nforward. It reflects real, sustainable policy changes that are going to \nlet people keep more money in their pockets.\n  I have heard from many throughout this debate, who have spoken up \nagainst these tax cuts and these reforms--people who trust the \ngovernment with this money more than they trust the American people.\n  Mr. Speaker, I fundamentally disagree. The American people deserve \nmore control over their paychecks.\n\n\nThey have worked hard to earn that money. They have taken time away \nfrom their families to earn that money. They ought to be the ones \ndeciding how, where, and when to spend it.\n  So for the purposes of strengthening families and offering folks a \nstronger future here in America, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. \n1.", "turn": 41, "speaker": "Mrs. NOEM", "itemno": 302}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "N000015", "text": "  Mr. NEAL.

This is a cut on taxes for \ncorporate America, the corporate friends and my friends on the other \nside of the aisle, and they had to squeeze all kinds of things in to \njustify it and pay for it. That is why the middle class is going to \nsuffer. That is why their kids in college are going to start losing \ntheir ability to deduct interest on student loans, and they are going \nto pay taxes on waived tuition when they get a teaching assistant \nposition or a benefit from the university.\n\n\n  That is why your local municipalities are going to lose tax exemption \nfor private activity bonds that fund tens of billions of dollars of \npublic improvements all over the United States.\n  That is why 8.8 million Americans are going to lose the ability to \ndeduct medical costs. Good luck to families who have to put people in \nnursing homes for long-term care, patients suffering dementia. How will \nthey work that financing out when they lose this deduction, and how \nwill they feel when they know the reason they are losing this deduction \nis to finance a corporate tax rate?\n  What about homeowners losing the ability to deduct mortgage interest \nor to have it capped artificially so corporate America can get the \nbiggest tax cut in history?\n  And, by the way, they get to continue to deduct State and local taxes \nand other kinds of financial interest-related expenses, but not you, \nnot you the middle class.\n  It adds $1.5 trillion, and that is with dynamic scoring. Dynamic \nscoring is another way of saying: We kind of fudged the real number. It \nis more than that, at least $200 billion more than that.\n  I thought my friends on the other side of the aisle were fiscal hawks \ndedicated to making sure we didn't have deficits.\n  This is an inconsistent bill.

Berea \npairs its strong academics with a student labor program, honoring the \ndignity and utility of all work.\n  Berea could not fulfill its unique and special mission of providing \nfree tuition to all students without a healthy endowment. The Tax Cuts \nand Jobs Act includes a 1.4 percent excise tax on private college \nendowments over $500,000 per student. There are two federally \nrecognized work colleges with endowments above this level, including \nBerea College in my district.\n  I was pleased to learn that the Senate version of the bill exempts \nschools with fewer than 500 tuition-paying students from the excise \ntax. This provision would effectively exempt work colleges from the \ntax, because they do not charge tuition.\n  I understand it was never the committee's intent for this legislation \nto negatively impact work colleges that use their endowments to provide \ntuition-free education. In fact, I understand the intended purpose of \nthe excise tax is to encourage colleges to use their endowments to keep \ncollege costs down.

Madam Speaker, a lot has been said today on \nthe floor about the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act from my friends on the other \nside of the aisle. They think that this bill before us will make losers \nof the American workers or of the American economy. The truth is the \nstatus quo--our current broken Tax Code--is causing our workers and our \neconomy to lose.\n  Back in southeast Missouri--I will give you an example under the \ncurrent Tax Code--a machinist in Poplar Bluff, Missouri, working 40 \nhours a week is fearful to work harder because the more money that they \nmake, the less that they will have percentagewise unde our current Tax \nCode. That is simply not right, Madam Speaker.\n\n  Back in southeast Missouri, a cotton farmer in Hayti has worked for \ndecades to build his family farm hoping to pass it on to his daughter. \nYet, under the current system, his daughter would have to sell portions \nof the farm or take out a massive loan to continue the family \noperation.\n  The status quo in our Tax Code is rigged against the American \ntaxpayer. They can't afford an army of lawyers, accountants, and \nlobbyists to find all of the loopholes and the bailouts available only \nto a select few.\n  The status quo are tax rates for businesses that are so high that the \nAmerican companies are not able to grow, hire new workers, or be \ncompetitive with other countries around the world.\n  The other side of the aisle was arguing to keep a broken Tax Code \nthat is punishing hardworking taxpayers. All of the grandstanding \nleaves us with one question that needs to be answered for the American \npeople: What do these tax cuts mean for you? It means that the \nhardworking family in southeast Missouri will keep more of their \npaycheck.\n  Instead of being penalized for success, this bill is about employees. \nIt is about wages. It is about getting to keep more of what you earn. \nFor families and couples, the first $24,000 you earn under this bill \nwill be tax free. You get to keep it. You get to decide how to spend \nyour own money, not the government.\n  It means that the small businesses and family farms won't feel the \nsting of the IRS and the death tax when tragedy strikes their family.\n  It means that lobbyists and special interests become the losers. We \nclose loopholes in handouts that the hardworking taxpayer can't get.\n  We are ending a Tax Code that isn't built for the everyday American. \nWe are making it simple and fair. It means that America can now compete \nand win again.\n  With this bill, we lower the business rate to historic levels. We are \nmaking our economy healthy again. We know from history that a healthy \neconomy takes care of itself. It is more stable and sustainable. It \nprovides for full employment, better jobs, and higher wages.\n  Former President John F. Kennedy knew this when he said: ``Our true \nchoice is not between tax reduction, on the one hand, and the avoidance \nof large Federal deficits on the other. It is increasingly clear that \nno matter what party is in power, so long as our national security \nneeds keep rising, an economy hampered by restrictive tax rates will \nnever produce enough revenue to balance our budget just as it will \nnever produce enough jobs or enough profits.''\n\n", "turn": 115, "speaker": "Mr. SMITH of Missouri", "itemno": 377}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

People in the middle-income rate got relief. This happened \nright across the board to everyone we kept talking to.\n  So I would say that, before you come down and yell and scream and try \nand scare people on something you might have heard from a talking head, \nactually work with your people. It works.\n  Madam Speaker, if this bill is enacted, it will result in economic \ngrowth across the country, especially in my home State of California. \nThe lower rates for individuals, families, businesses, and the tax \nsimplicity and certainty offered by this bill will provide net tax \nrelief to the middle class and our country's job creators.\n  We expect this bill to create nearly 1 million jobs nationwide, and \nnearly 10 percent of those in California.\n  While the bill makes commendable strides toward a fair, simpler Tax \nCode, I am concerned about how the bill could impact some of my \nconstituents as a result of the high level of income taxes imposed on \nthem by our State government.\n  I would ask the Chairman of the Ways and Means Committee if he can \nassure me that we continue our work and ensure the families in my \ndistrict are protected from such unintended consequences and that they \nwill be able to fully enjoy the benefits of this bill.", "turn": 147, "speaker": "Mr. KNIGHT", "itemno": 410}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "B000755", "text": "  Mr. BRADY of Texas.

Madam Speaker, I thank both the gentlewoman and \nthe gentleman for stepping forward and being such strong advocates for \ntaxpayers in a State that taxes its families and businesses, I think, \nalmost beyond belief.\n  Our goal in tax reform is to achieve tax relief for families and \nindividuals across the country, regardless of where you live, and \nacross all incomes, while, at the same time, unleashing the economic \nengine for American economic growth.\n  California, by the way, under tax reform, is the number one job \ncreator under the new Tax Code.\n  So I agree with the gentleman and the gentlewoman.

Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Madam Speaker, 33 percent of Mr. Knight's constituents derive a \n$16,000 annual benefit from the State and local tax deduction.\n  In the case of the gentlewoman from California, 37 percent of her \nconstituents enjoy an $18,200 State and local tax deduction benefit.\n  Madam Speaker, in closing, more than anything else, this is, as I \nopened with, a missed opportunity.\n  We all know what is wrong with this Tax Code. We could have found \nareas of compromise emphasizing the middle class and middle-income \nearners. We understand that the Tax Code that American corporations use \nis not competitive now internationally, but we wanted some relief for \nmiddle-income people.\n  So here is where the investment could have taken place. We could have \nbegun an investment in human capital. You have heard it tonight. We \nshould all be alarmed by labor participation rates in America. We all \nshould be alarmed by what has happened in the post-war period where, at \none time, it was 63 percent, and now it is 63.8 percent.\n  It is about technology; it is about globalization, for sure; but it \nis also about skill set. Eighteen thousand precision manufacturing jobs \nin New England go unanswered, the smallest geographic region of the \ncountry. The Department of Labor reported this week that 6 million jobs \nin America go unanswered. It is part of a skill set issue.\n  You know what else we need to be concerned about?\n  Two million people in America are addicted to opioids. That is what \nwe should be concerned about as well as getting them back into the \nworkplace through the trampoline effect, where they hit it and bounce \nback up into the mainstream. But that is not what we did.\n  Without any hearings, without any chance for the minority to \nparticipate, in terms of substance, we moved forward.\n  I want to say to the last two speakers, they are sincere enough. We \nhave heard now four different people come to the well of this House on \nthe other side and say to the chairperson of our committee and a \nfriend: Are you going to fix this after the bill leaves here?\n  Four different people asked for a fix. I want to tell you, based on \nlong experience in this House, the path gets more narrow as it leaves \nthis House. It doesn't grow more expansive. It will be harder to fix \nthese things because of the budget score that was embraced.\n  In 2001, we were promised widespread economic growth when President \nBush took the Clinton surplus and offered $1.3 trillion worth of tax \ncuts. When you look at the distribution tables, they were right about \none thing: everybody did get a tax cut. But then you look at those \ntables and you say: Let me examine who got what.\n  In 2003, we came back and the President proposed $1 trillion worth of \ntax cuts based on the premise of economic growth, which didn't happen.\n\n\n  By the way, in 2004, there was repatriation, which may be the \ngranddaddy of them all. Well, we are going to repatriate those holdings \noffshore at 5\\1/4\\ percent o the premise of job growth. And there was \nnone.\n\n  We had this opportunity to do this together, as I described with \nworker participation rates, understanding that most families now are \nnot having large numbers of children any longer. This should have been \nabout immigration reform attached to it as well. We all know skilled \nworkers from overseas are going to be an important part of the American \neconomy, and we should be embracing that, along with sensible tax \npolicies based upon some relief for the middle class.\n  Instead, we are taking away the ability of American students to \ndeduct interest on their loans to pay for a tax cut for people at the \ntop?\n  We are taking away a medical expense deduction for people who have \nAlzheimer's disease to pay for the tax cut for people at the top?\n  We are assessing universities and colleges a new, special tax to pay \nfor tax cuts for people at the top?\n  We could have had this conversation. We acknowledge what President \nReagan and Speaker O'Neill did because it was based upon good will and \ncommonality and not needing just a political victory. Day after day \nthey plowed through with 450 witnesses in front of the Ways and Means \nCommittee.\n  How many witnesses did we have in front of the Ways and Means \nCommittee?\n  Zero.\n  How many hearings did we have on this tax bill?\n  Zero.\n  We saw the manager's amendment and were given 20 minutes to review \nit. I don't mean 25 minutes. I mean 20 minutes. Back to regular order. \nWe should scrap this bill.\n  To those who are vulnerable on the other side, I would not be \ntrusting of the idea that these issues are going to be fixed after you \ncast this vote tomorrow morning. There will be an opportunity to go \nback and redo this if the other side would say: Let's find a meaningful \npath to cooperation between the two parties.\n  That is all we are asking for on this side: include us in this \ndiscussion so we might invest in community colleges, vocational \neducation, internship programs, skill set training, and answer the call \nof globalization.\n  We still have innovation and creativity that far surpasses the rest \nof the world. There is nothing we can't answer in America without those \nhealthy investments that we need.\n  Instead, when you look at these distribution tables that are proposed \nas to who is going to get what; taking away the alternative minimum tax \nfor the 4.5 million families that pay it; asking students to give up \ntheir student interest deduction; the estate tax, which we are \nrepealing; and we are asking that loved ones who have Alzheimer's and \nbeing cared for at home to give up that medical deduction to pay for \nall of that, it makes no sense whatsoever. But there is an opportunity, \nMadam Speaker, to reverse course.\n  In my years here, I can tell you this: Anybody who thinks that the \nUnited States Senate is going to accommodate their wishes, when they \nsee the goalpost and the goal line of a handful of Members of this \nHouse, they are making a miscalculation.\n  We have heard tonight they are going to do something about state and \nlocal tax deduction, they are going to do something about the historic \ntax credit, and they are going to revisit these issues.\n  Do you know how difficult that is going to be, Madam Speaker?\n  That is going to be nearly impossible.\n  On top of that, they are going to go back and try to appeal the \nAffordable Care Act again and take 13 million people away from their \ninsurance so that we can have a tax cut that further concentrates \nwealth for a handful of people in America?\n  This is the House of Representatives, Madam Speaker, not the House of \nLords. We don't serve here by peerage. We are not entitled to anything \nhere. Most of us come from pretty modest backgrounds. That is the \nprinciple we should be honoring in this tax debate as we discuss who is \nabout to pay what and what the rewards ought to be for the hardworking \nmen and women.\n  This is last note I am going to express before I yield back my time. \nWhat about those 1 million veterans who have served us honorably in \nIraq and Afghanistan?\n  New veterans, what about them?\n  Are we going to eventually cut their benefits with Social Security \nand Medicare and Medicaid and put it all on the chopping block as we \nattempt to further concentrate wealth in America, particularly for \nunearned income, by the way?\n  That is where we are heading.\n  We should honor the skills of those men and women who get up every \nday and strive and work hard in this country with a sense of purpose \nand great patriotism. That is what we should be acknowledging in this \ndebate.\n  I am looking forward to tomorrow morning, when we conclude this \ndebate and spend the 2 hours discussing more of what we have witnessed \nhere tonight. There will be more than enough enthusiasm on our side. \nThey will be lined up to RFK Stadium to participate tomorrow morning in \nthis debate. That is how important this is to the future of the \nAmerican people.\n  Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.", "turn": 151, "speaker": "Mr. NEAL", "itemno": 414}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "B000755", "text": "  Mr. BRADY of Texas. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Madam Speaker, Washington is just hilarious.\n  Lawmakers back home tell everyone they are for tax reform, until it \ncomes actually time to do it. Everyone says they want a fairer, \nflatter, simpler Tax Code, as long as you keep every special interest \nprovision in this big, fat, messed-up Tax Code.\n  Everyone says they want to give people back more of what they earned \nand get Main Street businesses going, as long as you don't change \nanything in the Tax Code. As long as the lobbyists win and the American \npeople lose, they are willing to talk about it.\n  House Republicans are actually acting on tax reform for the first \ntime in 31 years.\n  In Washington, they sneer at that family of four back home making \n$59,000 a year. That is the average household. Under our tax reform, \nthey pay $1,182 less that they keep in their pocket. Washington makes \nfun of that. That is real money for families.\n\n  A firefighter making $48,000 a year keeps over $1,300. That single \nmom working hard every day making $30,000 a year has a $700 larger \nrefund than she gets today.\n  That Main Street startup business working I don't know how many \nhours, making $62,000 a year--that was my Chamber of Commerce member \nright there--in that startup business, they keep $3,007 more than they \ndo today. Washington just laughs at that. But it is real money for real \npeople.\n  In my district, a family of four making $90,000--two teachers--keeps \n$2,176 more every year of their life from this.\n  My friends on the Democrat side now worry about the debt. I remember \nthe first year Democrats took control of the House, they doubled the \ndeficit. The second year, they tripled it. The third year, it went to \n$1 trillion. It stayed that way until the American people gave the \nHouse back to Republicans.\n  They love spending money and raising the deficit when they let \nWashington grow, but when it is time to grow jobs and paychecks, all of \na sudden they are worried about the debt.\n  The truth of the matter is we want to keep this debt and deficits \ngoing. Don't change anything. Keep this slow-growth economy, keep \nspending, and I guarantee you debts and deficits will grow.\n  We are talking about growing jobs, growing paychecks, and getting \nback to a balanced budget by getting this economy moving in a big way.\n  At the end of the day, it is time to end the status quo in \nWashington, D.C. Americans deserve a fair, flatter Tax Code, one that \ncloses loopholes and ends special interest deductions so that Americans \ncan keep more of what they earn, so their paychecks can raise and our \nbusinesses can compete and win anywhere in the world, especially here \nat home America.\n  It is time our jobs start coming back to America, rather than \nwatching them go: our jobs, research, manufacturing patents, our \nheadquarters. That era is over, and it starts with H.R. 1, the Tax Cuts \nand Jobs Act.\n\n\n  We will continue this debate tomorrow, Madam Speaker, so we will \ncontinue to deliver tax reform and tax cuts for the American people.\n  Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.", "turn": 152, "speaker": "Mr. BRADY of Texas", "itemno": 415}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "  The SPEAKER pro tempore.
