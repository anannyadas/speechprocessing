Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Connect \nCharter School in Pueblo, Colorado, which was recently named a 2017 \nNational Blue Ribbon School by U.S. Department of Education Secretary \nBetsy DeVos.\n  With this award, the Connect School has been recognized as one of the \nnation's highest performing educational institutions. Members of the \nPueblo community know that this honor is well deserved. The dedication \nshown by the teachers, administrators, and school staff is \nextraordinary, and I know they have a profound impact on the lives of \neach student who attends Connect School.\n  National Blue Ribbon Schools are among the nation's highest \nperforming educational institutions, as measured by state assessments, \nnationally normed test scores, and graduation rates. Now in its 35th \nyear, the National Blue Ribbon Schools Program has recognized over \n8,500 public and private elementary, middle and high schools.
