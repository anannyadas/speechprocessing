Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize those in our military who \nhave worked tirelessly to help Americans in Puerto Rico and the Virgin \nIslands in the aftermath of Hurricanes Irma and Maria. Despite my \ncontinuing concerns about the dreadful federal response to the \ndevastation in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, I know that the \ndedicated men and women of our military have been working day and night \nto help bring much needed relief to those in need.\n  Without their help and aid, one can only imagine how much worse the \nsituation would be now.\n\n\n  In the last two weeks, the USS Wasp, the USS Oak Hill, and the USS \nKearsarge have returned home or are in the process of returning home. \nIn both Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, the sailors and Marines \naboard these ships cleared roads to ease the flow of people and relief \nsupplies, conducted search and rescue missions, helped deliver much \nneeded supplies, and most of all, were a daily reminder to those they \nmet that our country helps its citizens.\n  Speaking to the high tempo at which these men and women were working, \nthe Navy reports that during the 68-day period of its hurricane relief \ndeployment, the Kearsarge ``conducted more amphibious and flight \noperations than would be completed in a routine six-month deployment.''\n  And I would be remiss if I did not mention the invaluable \ncontribution of National Guard personnel, including those impacted \ndirectly by the hurricanes, and those from all over the United States, \nincluding my home state of Wisconsin.\n  I would urge the Defense Department, even as these ships return home, \nto continue to ensure that its considerable resources and assets remain \navailable to help Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands in the trying \nweeks and months that still lay ahead. Our citizens in Puerto Rico and \nthe Virgin Islands will need our help for many months to come and the \nmilitary must continue to be a key part of that effort.\n  And I also strongly encourage the Administration to quickly send a \nnew disaster funding request that accurately reflects the proposals \nthat affected communities, including Texas, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin \nIslands, have put forward outlining the federal aid they need to help \ncommunities rebuild better.\n  Again, I salute the men and women in and out of uniform who have been \nand continue to help their fellow Americans during this deadly and \ndevastating hurricane season. They are doing their part; now this \nAdministration and Congress need to do ours in the coming weeks.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Ms. MOORE", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 3}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "187", "extension": true, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "E1570-E1571", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "15", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "THANKING THE MEN AND WOMEN OF THE USS ``WASP,'' USS ``OAK HILL,'' AND USS ``KEARSARGE''", "id": "CREC-2017-11-15-pt1-PgE1570-5", "title": "THANKING THE MEN AND WOMEN OF THE USS ``WASP,'' USS ``OAK HILL,'' AND  USS ``KEARSARGE''"}
