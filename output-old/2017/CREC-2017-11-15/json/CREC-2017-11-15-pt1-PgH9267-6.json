Mr. Speaker, I rise today to praise President Trump and \nmy Republican colleagues in the House and Senate for coming together to \ndevelop the first major tax reform plan that our Nation has seen since \n1986.\n  The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act we are considering is going to deliver real \ntax relief to middle class families and small businesses.\n  However, there is more work to be done. Here in the U.S., we don't \nsettle for good enough. Congress can make the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act \neven better for the American people by including a repeal of \nObamaCare's individual mandate.\n  No American should ever be forced to purchase something that they \ndon't want. That is not freedom. That is not the American way. For 3 \nyears now, Federal Government bureaucrats have forced Americans to \npurchase insurance they can't afford and don't want.\n  Mr. Speaker, it is time for Congress to repeal ObamaCare's individual \nforced mandate.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. HARRIS", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "187", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H9267-H9268", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "15", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "IT IS TIME FOR CONGRESS TO REPEAL OBAMACARE'S INDIVIDUAL FORCED MANDATE", "id": "CREC-2017-11-15-pt1-PgH9267-6", "title": null}
