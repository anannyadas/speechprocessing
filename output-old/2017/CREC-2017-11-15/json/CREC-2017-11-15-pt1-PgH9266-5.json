Mr. Speaker, I rise today to share the story of Hugo \nfrom Salem, Oregon, and I continue to urge Speaker Ryan to put forth a \nclean Dream Act.\n  Hugo is an undocumented Oregonian originally from Veracruz, Mexico. \nHis only memory of Mexico is saying good-bye to his parents as a child \nbefore leaving for Salem.\n  In high school, Hugo played football, he was a JROTC commander, a \nyouth police cadet, and a firefighter explorer. He quickly moved from \nESL into honors classes, and graduated at the top of his class. Hugo \nearned the privilege of delivering the commencement speech at his \ngraduation.\n  All of this, along with his dedication to community service, led to \nthe city of Salem recognizing Hugo as Youth of the Year.\n  Because of Hugo's immigration status, however, after leaving high \nschool, his only job was a field hand. That is until DACA.\n  Hugo was able to enroll at the University of Oregon, working multiple \njobs to pay for his tuition, and earned his bachelor's degree in \neconomics. He now works as a banker, and volunteers as a teacher in \nfinancial literacy for families. But in 10 months, his work permit will \nexpire.\n  Mr. Speaker, let's protect 800,000 DACA recipients across this \ncountry, like Hugo.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. SCHRADER", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "187", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H9266", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "15", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "THE STORY OF HUGO FROM SALEM, OREGON", "id": "CREC-2017-11-15-pt1-PgH9266-5", "title": "THE STORY OF HUGO FROM SALEM, OREGON"}
