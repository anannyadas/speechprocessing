Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize twenty mining \ncompanies awarded the National Mining Association's (NMA) Sentinels of \nSafety award, the oldest occupational safety and health award in our \nnation. Presented annually, the award recognizes mines that have worked \nthe most employee hours in a year without experiencing an injury.\n  In addition to the Sentinels award, the National Institute for \nOccupational Safety and Health recognized three mining companies that \n``have made an extraordinary effort to apply technology or improve \nprocesses in innovative ways, above and beyond mandatory requirements, \nto improve mine worker safety and health.''\n  The Sentinels award was created in 1925 by a mining engineer, then-\nSecretary of Commerce and future President Herbert Hoover, who desired \nto ``stimulate greater interest in safety among the nation's mineral \nextractive industries and to encourage the development of more \neffective accident prevention programs by according national \nrecognition to operations achieving outstanding safety records.''\n  The U.S. mining industry continues to make great strides in safety \nperformance. Last year, 85 percent of the more than 11,000 mines in our \ncountry operated without a single injury. This year's Sentinels award \nwinners are the top twenty operations among the 3,500 mines operating \nwithout a single injury.\n  The National Mining Association continues to be a leader in mine \nsafety and health.\n  Our miners are indeed a precious national resource serving as the \nfront-end of the supply chain for the energy, minerals and materials \nthat are indispensable to our standard of living and prosperity. We \nshould be thankful for what they provide our great country and proud of \nthem for being both more productive and safer than ever before.\n  The following are the 2016 NMA Sentinels of Safety and NIOSH \ntechnology award winners: Freedom Mine--The Coteau Properties Co, \nBarrick Cortez--Barrick Cortez, Inc., South Arturo Mine--Barrick \nGoldstrike Mines, Inc., Barrick Cortez Underground--Barrick Cortez, \nBull Mountains Mine No. 1--Signal Peak Energy, LLC, Briggs Plant--\nFordyce Holdings, Inc., Murphy Plant--Fordyce Holdings, Inc., Ceredo \nDock--Kanawha River Terminals, LLC, Cargill Deicing Technology, \nCleveland--Cargill, Inc., St. Genevieve Facility--Tower Rock Stone Co., \nPortage Aggregate & Supply LLC, Curtin Gap Quarry--Hanson Aggregates \nPennsylvania LLC, Siderite Mine--Sidco Minerals Inc., Coon Cedar Grove \nMine--Marfork Coal Co., LLC, Buick Mine/Mill--The Doe Run Co., Decker's \nCreek Limestone Co--Decker's Creek Limestone Co., Kinross Gold, \nFreeport-McMoRan, Peabody.\n  On behalf of Alabama's First Congressional and the entire House, I \napplaud this year's winners and look forward to continuing to advocate \nfor the health and safety of our miners throughout my time in Congress.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. BYRNE", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 3}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "187", "extension": true, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "E1577", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "15", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "CELEBRATING THE SENTINEL OF SAFETY AWARD WINNERS", "id": "CREC-2017-11-15-pt1-PgE1577", "title": "CELEBRATING THE SENTINEL OF SAFETY AWARD WINNERS"}
