Mr. Speaker, I rise today to thank all those who \nhave served our great Nation in the Armed Forces. On Veterans Day, we \nreflected on the sacrifices these brave men and women have made to keep \nus safe. Yet few Americans realize that U.S. citizenship is not \nrequired for military service, and even fewer know that our Nation has \ngone as far as deporting veterans.\n  My colleagues and I in the Congressional Hispanic Caucus visited the \nDeported Veterans Support House in Tijuana, Mexico, to learn more about \nthis issue. We heard stories about their service, deportation, and \nseparation from family members.\n  Ivan Ocon was born in Mexico and came to the United States when he \nwas 7 years old. He enlisted in the Army after high school, ``to serve \nthe only country he knew to be his home.'' Ivan deployed to Iraq, \nJordan, and Korea and received an honorable discharge. Ultimately, he \nwas deported to Mexico and had to leave his family behind, including \nhis U.S.-born daughter.\n  Congress can and should pass legislation that brings these deported \nveterans home.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. CASTRO of Texas", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "187", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H9269", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "15", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "BRING DEPORTED VETERANS HOME", "id": "CREC-2017-11-15-pt1-PgH9269-3", "title": "BRING DEPORTED VETERANS HOME"}
