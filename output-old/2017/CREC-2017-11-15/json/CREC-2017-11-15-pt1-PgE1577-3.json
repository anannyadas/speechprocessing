Mr. Speaker, it is a true privilege for me to honor one of \nthe great institutions in my district, the Hebrew Home, which this year \nis celebrating its remarkable 100th Anniversary.\n  Operated by RiverSpring Health, The Hebrew Home for the Aged's \nhistory dates back to 1917, when a group of civic minded individuals \nbegan providing shelter for poor, aging immigrants in a small synagogue \nin Harlem. As the needs of the community grew, so did the Hebrew Home. \nThey expanded their reach by moving to a beautiful 32-acre campus in \nRiverdale, where they then became known as the Hebrew Home at \nRiverdale.\n  From there, the Hebrew Home's services continued to expand. Today \nthey offer many options to meet the evolving needs of older adults. In \naddition to their award winning nursing care, their care solutions \ninclude assisted living, independent living, rehabilitation services, \ncare management, home care options, and specialized programs including \nelder abuse prevention. With a comprehensive and caring approach to \nhealthy aging, the RiverSpring Health family of care solutions offers \nhelp and support to over 12,000 residents, patients, and members, \nempowering them to live the fullest lives they can each and every day.\n  Of course, to meet its mission of helping older adults live full \nlives the Hebrew Home must maintain strong leadership. It starts at the \ntop with Dan Reingold, the CEO and President of Hebrew Home, who has \nbeen instrumental in the Home's continued success and sterling \nreputation. Dan and his team have done tremendous work day after day \nand I am proud to call him a friend.\n  As Congressman for the Northwest Bronx I am truly fortunate to have \nsuch a wonderful institution working with me as a partner in the \ncommunity. With their countless years of expertise, a commitment to \nhealthy aging, and compassion for our communities, the RiverSpring \nHealth team has been dedicated to helping families live forward, every \nday. Congratulations to the entire Hebrew Home organization on 100 \nyears of exemplary service to the community.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. ENGEL", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 3}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "187", "extension": true, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "E1577", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "15", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "HONORING HEBREW HOME 100TH ANNIVERSARY", "id": "CREC-2017-11-15-pt1-PgE1577-3", "title": "HONORING HEBREW HOME 100TH ANNIVERSARY"}
