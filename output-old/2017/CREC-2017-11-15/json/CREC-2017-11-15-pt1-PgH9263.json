Mr. Speaker, I really do believe that the American \npeople deserve a tax system that invests in our people and our \ncommunity.\n  We need to have enough income and enough resources to make sure we \nare fixing our roads, our bridges, and our transit. We need resources \nto invest in scientific research for families who are wondering about \nwhat the answers just might be for their loved ones who have \nAlzheimer's or Parkinson's or whatever. We need to be able to defend \nour country. We need to be able to help people get a good education, \nhealthcare, and housing.\n  These are things that I believe are well worth investment in as a \nnation.\n  Yet when we look at the Republican tax bill, we don't see a bill that \nreflects the needs of the country to take care of our people. What we \nsee is a mass distribution from working people--middle class people--to \nthe wealthiest Americans in the country.\n  We need a tax reform--a real tax reform--that protects retirement \nsecurity for today's seniors and future generations; that provides \nquality education, job training; that researches new medical cures and \nrenewable forms of energy; and that supports our Nation's children.\n  Mr. Speaker, we need a tax bill that supports America's families and \nthat can help us do better and live higher quality lives.\n  But, instead, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act--a bizarrely named piece of \nlegislation because it doesn't do anything for jobs--is in front of us. \nIt is what Republicans offer as tax reform.\n  But here is what it does, Mr. Speaker: it moves more jobs overseas. \nThis bill gives tax breaks to corporations offshoring jobs, driving \ndown American wages.\n  How many workers lay in the bed at night looking at the ceiling \nhoping and praying that the plant doesn't close? How do we explain to \nthem that we are going to cut taxes for these big corporations that \nwould incentivize them to offshore? How do we tell them that?\n  Is that making America great again? I don't think so. It increases \ntaxes for millions of Americans. Thirty-eight million middle class \nhouseholds will see an immediate tax increase--averaging $2,000 by \n2026.\n  Is that what we had in mind when we started talking about tax reform? \nAbsolutely not.\n\n\n  This Republican tax bill doubles taxes on American families by making \nfolks pay Federal taxes on taxes you already pay to your State and \nlocal government.\n  It is a good thing when local communities say: We are going to raise \ntaxes on ourselves to meet local needs. When States and cities do that, \nthey have been expecting for literally over 100 years that that would \nbe deductible.\n  Yet the Federal Government, under the Republican tax plan, wants to \ntake that deduction away, which will have the effect of putting \ndownward pressure on what local and State governments can raise to make \ntheir citizens' lives better, beginning a downward spiral. As the \nFederal Government pays less, the States and cities will get less, and \nyou will see services for people go down the toilet.\n  At the same time, you will see money not trickle down but geyser up \nto the richest Americans. Double taxation will drive down home values \nand limit local governments' ability to fund law enforcement--which is \npolice, folks--schools, health services, and infrastructure.\n  Medical expenses, Mr. Speaker. The GOP tax bill raises taxes on \nfamilies who have children with expensive disabilities or adults who \nneed expensive lifesaving treatment for longstanding disabilities \nbecause it eliminates the medical expense deduction.\n  I had a lady named Carol, who is a senior, say: Look, I don't know \nhow I am going to make it without this. I need this.\n  She met with me in my office just Monday, and she pleaded with me to \nfight this Republican tax bill, specifically on the elimination of \nmedical expenses.\n  But what about student loans? We live in a country where there is \nmassive student debt, Mr. Speaker. If you are one of the 40 million \npeople with student loan debt, you will no longer be able to deduct the \ninterest you pay on these student loans, plus it eliminates the \nlearning credits that make your tuition affordable.\n  As we all know, if you are rich already, you don't worry about \nstudent loan interest because you don't borrow the money, you just pay \nit. But what about the middle class of America? What about the working \nclass people of America? What about folks who really need it?\n  Mr. Speaker, as I wrap up, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on \nthis Republican tax bill. It would have been nice to have real reform, \nbut we are not getting it. Our only option is to eliminate this \nparticularly sad piece of legislation.\n", "turn": 1, "speaker": "Mr. ELLISON", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "187", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H9263", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "15", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "TAX CUTS FOR MULTINATIONAL CORPORATIONS PAID BY WORKING FAMILIES", "id": "CREC-2017-11-15-pt1-PgH9263", "title": "TAX CUTS FOR MULTINATIONAL CORPORATIONS PAID BY WORKING FAMILIES"}
