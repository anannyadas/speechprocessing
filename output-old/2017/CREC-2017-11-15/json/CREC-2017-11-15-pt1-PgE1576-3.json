Mr. Speaker, this year, the Hebrew Home at Riverdale is \ncelebrating its incredible 100th anniversary, and on that special \noccasion they have chosen to honor two individuals who have given so \nmuch back to the community, Wendy and Jeff Maurer.\n  For Wendy and Jeff, philanthropy comes from the heart and is an \nintegral part of their lives. They have devoted their time and \nresources to a select group of meaningful not-for-profit organizations, \nfocusing predominately on Jewish and health causes that truly make a \ndifference in countless lives. Wendy and Jeff's ties to the Hebrew Home \nare strong and deep rooted. Jeff's great grandparents were among the \ninitial families who founded the Hebrew Home in 1917; his grandparents \nand parents, and Wendy's parents were all residents at the Home. In \n1991 Jeff joined the Board of the Hebrew Home and became Chairman of \nthe Board in 2004.\n  Under Jeff's leadership, and in collaboration with the Home's \nexecutive management and Board, the Hebrew Home has expanded \nsignificantly, evolving into RiverSpring Health. The organization has \ngrown from 1,000 older adults in its care, to 12,000 throughout New \nYork City, continuing its great legacy.\n  Wendy served as Sisterhood President and Board member of Temple \nIsrael of Great Neck, and has held a number of roles with the Manhattan \nchapter of the UJA Federation, most recently as co-chair of \nConnections, an arm of women's philanthropy. She left teaching in 1975 \nto raise their two children and to concentrate on the family's \ncharitable interests, as well as to further her own education. She \nearned her Masters in Social Work in 1991.\n  Wendy and Jeff have done so much for our community, and have helped \ncountless individuals along the way. They are most deserving of this \nwonderful recognition from the Hebrew Home and I want to congratulate \nthem both on this great honor.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. ENGEL", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 3}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "187", "extension": true, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "E1576", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "15", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "WENDY AND JEFF MAURER", "id": "CREC-2017-11-15-pt1-PgE1576-3", "title": "WENDY AND JEFF MAURER"}
