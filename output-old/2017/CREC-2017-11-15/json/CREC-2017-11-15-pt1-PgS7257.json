Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to recognize \nthe moving work of Ron Powers of Castleton, VT--a Pulitzer Prize-\nwinning author who has written about everything from Mark Twain to the \nsoldiers of Iwo Jima to broadcast news and sports.\n  Ron's latest book, ``No One Cares About Crazy People,'' concentrates \non a topic that he promised himself he would never write about: the \nsocial history of mental illness in America. This story is poignantly \ntold through his own deeply personal story of his two\n\n\nsons' struggles with schizophrenia, which tragically claimed the life \nof one of them.\n  The book's informative yet intimate approach raises awareness about a \nsubject that most are too uncomfortable to broach. When reading it, you \ncan hardly hold back tears.\n  I cannot imagine the pain Ron and Honoree went through while working \non this book. It is a truly personal journey and a triumph. I am proud \nof him for publishing this important work. He understands that mental \nillness is not an issue that will simply go away if pushed into the \ndarkness of neglect and denial. One cannot lock it up in an institution \nand expect to be rid of the problem. Mental illness in America needs to \nbe discussed openly, by those who suffer from it, the friends and \nfamilies of those affected, medical experts, and those of us Senators. \nWe must all follow the footsteps of Ron and continue to shine a light \non this extremely sensitive issue.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the October 8, 2017, Vermont Digger \narticle honoring Ron Powers and his family and recognizing his great \nwork be printed in the Record.", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. LEAHY", "itemno": 0}, {"kind": "recorder", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in ", "turn": -1, "speaker": "The RECORDER", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "recorder", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "the Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Vermont Digger, Oct. 8, 2017]\n\n            A Vermonter Questions the Nation's Mental Health\n\n                          (By Kevin O'Connor)\n\n       Pulitzer Prize-winning author Ron Powers' past works have \n     eagerly explored everything from the 1800s literary lion Mark \n     Twain to the flag-raising World War II soldiers at Iwo Jima \n     and the present-day pioneers of broadcast news and sports.\n       The Vermonter's current focus is different.\n       ``This is the book I promised myself I would never write,'' \n     Powers begins its preface. ``I have kept that promise for a \n     decade--since our younger son, Kevin, hanged himself in our \n     basement, a week before his 21st birthday in July 2005, after \n     struggling for three years with schizophrenia.''\n       The author, born 75 years ago in Twain's hometown of \n     Hannibal, Missouri, can boast of a prolific career that has \n     seen him in a columnist's chair at the Chicago Sun-Times and \n     a commentator's seat on the CBS News program ``Sunday \n     Morning,'' as well as on the best-seller list for more than a \n     dozen books that include collaborating on the late U.S. Sen. \n     Edward Kennedy's memoir ``True Compass.''\n       But after the death of one of his two boys, the Castleton \n     resident could barely think about, let alone tackle, another \n     project. He and his wife, Honoree Fleming, were finally \n     starting to heal (``adaptation, really,'' he says) when they \n     saw their surviving son, experiencing a psychotic break one \n     Christmas, tell neighbors he was the messiah before police \n     took him to a hospital.\n       And so Powers began to research mental illness--not just \n     the schizophrenia his family has faced but also all the other \n     issues the World Health Organization estimates will affect \n     one-fourth of the world's people at some point in their \n     lives.\n       ``I realized that my 10 years of silence on the subject,'' \n     he says, ``silence that I had justified as insulation against \n     an exercise in self-indulgence, was itself an exercise in \n     self-indulgence.''\n       And so Powers is talking up his new book, ``No One Cares \n     About Crazy People: The Chaos and Heartbreak of Mental Health \n     in America.'' The 384-page Hachette hardcover shares his \n     family's story alongside a historic and often horrific survey \n     of mental illness in larger society.\n       ``Studies by the National Institute of Mental Health show \n     that among Americans age 18 or older, more than 62 million \n     (26 percent of the population) require (but are not always \n     given) counseling and medical treatment,'' he writes.\n       Powers could cite too many reasons for not wanting to \n     tackle the topic: What about his family's privacy? The \n     appearance of exploitation? The fact he isn't an expert?\n       ``Book writing is hard work,'' he continues. ``And, really, \n     end of the day, who the hell wants to read about \n     schizophrenia anyway?''\n       Plenty of people, the author would discover. Nearly a \n     decade after their son's death, Powers and his wife accepted \n     an invitation to testify at a 2014 Vermont legislative \n     hearing on whether acutely mentally ill patients should be \n     medicated against their will.\n       ``At first glance, speedy `involuntary treatment' might \n     seem the least objectionable of measures, given that people \n     in psychosis are virtually never capable of making rational \n     decisions,'' he writes in his book. ``And yet opponents of \n     the process bring passionate counterarguments to the debate. \n     Among the most formidable is that `involuntary treatment' is \n     by definition a violation of one's civil liberties.''\n       Powers testified in support of shorter waits on decisions \n     about involuntary intervention, which the Legislature went on \n     to adopt as law. But the author was moved by opponents of the \n     measure.\n       ``They were there: the faces and souls of the mentally ill, \n     emerging from their prevailing invisibility to declare \n     themselves,'' he writes. ``The sheer presence of them, their \n     actualization in the room, had affected me in the gut, not \n     because I hadn't expected them, but because of the profound, \n     elemental humanity of them.''\n       Three weeks later, Powers read news of a Wisconsin \n     political aide who, responding to headlines of state mental \n     health mismanagement, emailed a colleague: ``No one cares \n     about crazy people.''\n       That's when the author started writing--for himself, his \n     household, other families, friends, neighbors and psychiatric \n     professionals.\n       ``My aim with this book is not to replace or argue with the \n     existing vast inventory of important books on mental \n     illness,'' he writes. ``Rather, I hope to reamplify a simple \n     and self-evident and morally insupportable truth: Too many of \n     the mentally ill in our country live under conditions of \n     atrocity.''\n       Powers has taken his message to National Public Radio's \n     ``Fresh Air'' program and is seeing it shared in publications \n     nationwide.\n       ``He writes with fierce hope and fierce purpose to persuade \n     the world to pay attention,'' fellow Pulitzer Prize-winning \n     journalist Ron Suskind wrote in a review for The New York \n     Times. ``I'm not sure I've ever read anything that handles \n     the decline of one's children with such openness and searing, \n     stumbling honesty.''\n       Readers can learn for themselves when Powers speaks at the \n     Brattleboro Literary Festival on Saturday at 11 a.m. at the \n     downtown Centre Congregational Church. If similar appearances \n     are any indication, he'll share a few of the book's humorous \n     family stories, too.\n       ``Why do I include these?'' he told an audience in \n     Manchester. ``Because they make me smile and bring the two \n     boys to life. I wanted to avoid a kind of cliche--the \n     afflicted loved ones described only in the context of their \n     victimhood. It's hard to feel compassion for an abstract. My \n     sons were wonderful spirited boys before this affliction \n     struck.''\n       That said, Powers isn't seeking to entertain.\n       ``I hope you do not `enjoy' this book,'' he writes. ``I \n     hope you are wounded by it; wounded as I have been in writing \n     it. Wounded to act, to intervene.''\n       ``America must turn its immense resources and energy and \n     conciliatory goodwill to a final assault on mental illness,'' \n     he concludes. ``My sons, and your afflicted children and \n     brothers and sisters and parents and friends, deserve nothing \n     less.''\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "The RECORDER", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 3}], "header": {"chamber": "Senate", "num": "187", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "S7257-S7258", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "15", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "TRIBUTE TO RON POWERS", "id": "CREC-2017-11-15-pt1-PgS7257", "title": "TRIBUTE TO RON POWERS"}
