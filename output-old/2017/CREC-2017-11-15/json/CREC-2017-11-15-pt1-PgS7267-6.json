It affects everything from our farms to \nour forests, to our fisheries. We are seeing huge impacts around the \nworld: disappearing ice in the Arctic, melting permafrost, dying coral, \nraging fires, more powerful storms. Everywhere you look it is having an \nimpact, and it is certainly an impact we need to pay a great deal of \nattention to because it is hurting human civilization, and the impacts \nare just beginning. They are going to become worse over time.\n  In response, communities across the globe are transforming their \nenergy economies. They are certainly making their energy economies more \nefficient, from increasing insulation in buildings to improving vehicle \nmileage, to greater efficiency in appliances and in replacing fossil \nfuel energy with clean renewable energy.\n  How much do you know about the changes underway, about the dramatic \nmodifications of our energy economy and the impacts of climate \ndisruption? Let's find out. Welcome to episode 8 of the Senate Climate \nDisruption Quiz. Here we go.\n  First question. Researchers predict there will be an ice-free Arctic \nby the summer of what year?\n  Will it be the year 2020, 3 years from now; the year 2030, the year \n2075, or will it be 2100, the end of the century?\n  Lock in your answers.\n  Here is the correct answer. That is B, the year 2030. Researchers say \nthat as early as 2030, the Arctic Ocean could lose all of its ice \nduring the year's warmest months.\n  We see here a map of what has been happening in the past. The red \noutlines, in addition to the white, represents where the ice was in \n1980. In 1998, less area is covered; in 2012, even less area is \ncovered; and in the last two summers, the Northwest Passage has been \nfree of ice, and that has enabled a ship called the Crystal Serenity to \nmove up and essentially take tourists through the Northwest Passage, \nwhere you can see it was ice-covered in 1980. So that is a big change.\n  If we have an effort to address the improvements made in Paris, then, \nyes, there would still be ice here in that year of 2030, in an area \nabout the size of India, but you can see it is really shrinking \nquickly.\n  OK. On to our second question. Over the next decade, the number of \nU.S. wind energy technicians is expected to decline by 10 percent; grow \nby over 100 percent, which is to double; remain about stable; or \ndisappear entirely?\n  Lock in your answers.\n  The correct answer is B, grow by over 100 percent. In other words, it \nwill double. These are good jobs. Last year, less\n\n\nthan 100,000 people were employed in some manner by the wind industry, \nand the median pay was about $51,000 a year--a good middle-class job. \nWe are seeing the jobs grow as the demand for wind energy grows \nthroughout the country. The American Wind Energy Association says that \nin just the first 3 months of 2017, 2,000 megawatts of wind power were \nadded, which is almost a fourfold increase over what happened in the \nfirst 3 months of 2016. So big changes are happening quickly.\n  Question No. 3. President Trump's administration released a study in \nNovember, the National Climate Assessment. Did President's Trump's \nstudy attribute the major cause of climate disruption to volcanic \nactivity, or did his study say that the major cause was natural cycle, \nhuman activity, or solar activity?\n  Lock in your answers.\n  The answer is, on this study from President Trump's team, not \nvolcanic activities, not solar activity, and not a natural cycle. It \nwas, in fact, human activity.\n  This is a study from the Trump administration. They produced a chart \nthat looked at the temperature increase and measured how much can be \nattributed to human-caused activity. You can see the chart here, how \nmuch was attributed to solar--very little impact--and how much can be \nattributed to volcanic activity, and that was actually negative. So the \nTrump administration has produced a huge statement that human activity \nis causing the increase of the temperature of our planet.\n  Question No. 4. Why did India shut down New Delhi's schools--that is \n4,000 schools--why did they shut down New Delhi's schools for several \ndays in November? Was it, A, lead in the water; B, religious tensions; \nC, record air pollution; or, D, population explosion?\n  Lock in your answers.\n  The correct answer is, in fact, record air pollution. This can be \nmeasured, but you can also see it. I will put up a picture of that \npollution in New Delhi. Now we can barely see these people from a short \ndistance away riding a motorcycle. The father is clamping his hand over \nhis son's face to help reduce the impact of the air pollution on the \nchildren.\n  This air pollution was considered to be equivalent to smoking 50 \ncigarettes a day. The doctors are saying kids coming in who should have \npink lungs have dark lungs--gray, black lungs. So it is having a huge \nhealth impact.\n  The U.S. Embassy in New Delhi measures the air quality by a category \nthat is known as particulate matter, PM2.5. It refers to miniscule \nparticulate matter of diameters of 2.5 micrometers or less. These are \nthe very tiny particles that can lodge deep in the lungs and cause all \nkinds of problems in the lungs as they are absorbed into the \nbloodstream.\n  The EPA standard--the Environmental Protection Agency standard--\nconsiders anything between 151 and 200 as unhealthy. What they \nregistered on this day was 1,000. It topped the 1,000 mark. You can \nunderstand then how dangerous that is. This is from burning fossil \nfuels causing this pollution and specifically burning coal.\n  That brings us to our final question, Question No. 5. What percent of \nAmerican voters support staying in the Paris Agreement? This, of \ncourse, is the international agreement in which every country in the \nworld is now involved. Recently, there were two countries that had not \nsigned up, and that was Nicaragua and Syria, but they now have both \nsigned up. President Trump has said he plans to leave. Technically, we \nare still signed up because he can't leave under the agreement until \nNovember 2020. Still, because he said we are planning to leave, it has \nproduced a lot of reaction by American citizens and those for and \nagainst.\n  What percent of American voters support staying in? Is it zero; 15 \npercent, a little more than one out of eight; or 45 percent, just shy \nof half; or 70 percent?\n  Lock in your answers.\n  Well, the Yale Program on Climate Communication did a poll which was \nreleased earlier this year, and the answer is that 70 percent, 7 out of \n10 Americans, say stay in. Now this support for the Paris Agreement is \nmore than half for every party, including the unaffiliated or \nindependent voters. It is very high among Democrats, 86 percent; among \nIndependents it is 61 percent; but 51 percent, more than one out of \nevery two Republicans say, yes, stay in. They also took a look at self-\nidentified voters for President Trump, and, there again, more than one \nout of two, a majority of them, said to stay in.\n  So there you have it, folks. Episode 8 of the Climate Disruption \nQuiz, issues ripped from the headlines on the most important issue \nfacing the survival of humankind on this planet.\n  Carbon dioxide levels are accelerating and running through the roof. \nThe temperature of our planet is accelerating. Our planet has caught a \nfever, and there is no doctor for the planet. We have to address it. We \nhave to act. We are the first generation to experience the impacts and \nthe last generation that can head off catastrophic consequences.\n  We are racing with the clock. There is no time to spare. So stay \nengaged, and in the future, I will bring you episode 9 of the Senate \nClimate Disruption Quiz.\n  Thank you.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. MERKLEY", "itemno": 0}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 1}], "header": {"chamber": "Senate", "num": "187", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "S7267-S7268", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "15", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "CLIMATE DISRUPTION", "id": "CREC-2017-11-15-pt1-PgS7267-6", "title": "CLIMATE DISRUPTION"}
