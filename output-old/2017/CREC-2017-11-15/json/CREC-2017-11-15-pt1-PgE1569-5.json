RAUL M. GRIJALVA\n\n                               of arizona\n\n                    in the house of representatives\n\n                      Wednesday, November 15, 2017\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "G000551", "text": "  Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my grave concern \nwith the constant attacks on women's access to reproductive health \ncare.\n  The women and girls currently under U.S. government custody in \nshelters, jails, and detention centers across this country who have had \nto relinquish their right to reproductive health care deserve our \nimmediate attention.\n  I was disheartened to see the mistreatment of women in detention and \nchildren at the Office of Refugee Resettlement who are being\n\n\nsystematically denied access to their Constitutional rights. The \nConstitution guarantees all women the right to access abortions and \nprohibits the government from putting an undue burden on that right. \nHowever, the recent case of Jane Doe litigated in Garza v. Hargan, is a \nstark reminder of just how far this administration will go to deny a \nyoung woman her constitutional right to access an abortion.\n  Jane Doe, a 17 year old unaccompanied minor, came to the U.S. and was \nsubsequently detained and placed in a government-funded shelter where \nshe discovered she was pregnant. She immediately sought an abortion. \nHowever, she was inhumanely and unconstitutionally denied her right to \nan abortion. This administration's Office of Refugee Resettlement held \nJane Doe hostage and barred her from leaving her shelter to access \ncare, simply because the ORR Director Scott Lloyd and the \nadministration disagreed with her health care choice to have an \nabortion.\n  Jane Doe's case is a heartbreaking one. While I am glad to see that \nthe D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals stood up for the rights of Jane Doe \nin that case and allowed her access to an abortion regardless of her \nimmigration status, we know Jane Doe is not alone, and fear that many \nother young women's rights are being denied by this administration.\n  I have heard deeply concerning reports that the U.S. Department of \nHealth & Human Services now enforces unconstitutional policies such as \nsystematically counseling young women against accessing abortion. \nSimilarly, there are reports of mistreatment of pregnant women and \nmothers in incarceration and detention. These reports illustrate that \nthere are pregnant women sitting in solitary confinement without access \nto needed food and nourishment, women are sometimes shackled during \nlabor, and others are ultimately denied adequate health care services. \nThese policies and the mistreatment of women in incarceration and \ndetention are simply shocking and represent a gross abuse of power by \nthis administration.\n  We need to know why this is happening, how often it is happening, and \nwhat can be done to prevent these situations. This is why thirty-one of \nmy colleagues and I have requested a Government Accountability Office \nreport to examine the real situation of pregnant inmates and immigrant \ndetainees in order to better understand efforts taken to protect them \nand their fetus.\n  This administration must stop denying women their constitutional \nrights. We must demand that this administration immediately end the \ncruel practices of intimidation and coercion, and uphold the rights \nguaranteed by the United States Constitution. This administration must \nallow young women currently in government custody access to the health \ncare they need, including abortion.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. GRIJALVA", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 3}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "187", "extension": true, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "E1569-E1570", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "15", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS", "id": "CREC-2017-11-15-pt1-PgE1569-5", "title": "REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS"}
