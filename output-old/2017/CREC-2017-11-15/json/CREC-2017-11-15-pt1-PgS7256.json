Mr. President, last week my home State of Illinois took a \nmajor step forward in protecting student loan borrowers.\n  On November 7, the Illinois House of Representatives voted 98 to 16 \nto override Governor Rauner's veto of the Illinois Student Loan Bill of \nRights, which was designed to protect student loan borrowers from the \nwell documented abuses of Federal student loan servicers. The Illinois \nSenate previously voted 37 to 19 to override. With the house's action, \nthe bill became law.\n  I would like to thank all of those in the general assembly who voted \nfor this bill, including Senator Daniel Biss and Representative Will \nGuzzardi, who sponsored the legislation. I would also like to thank the \nlegislation's author, Attorney General Lisa Madigan, for her leadership \nand tireless efforts to investigate and hold Federal student loan \nservicers accountable.\n  Federal student loan servicers are contracted by the U.S. Department \nof Education to handle the billing and other services related to the \nrepayment of a Federal student loan. Too often, these contractors make \nit more difficult for students to repay their loans by giving them \nincorrect or incomplete information and guidance, refusing to provide \nbenefits to which students are entitled under Federal law, or \nincorrectly processing payments. I have heard complaints about \nservicers from countless of the 1.5 million Illinoisans holding a \ncumulative total of $51 billion in Federal student loan debt.\n  Attorney General Madigan has heard those complaints too. In response, \nshe initiated an investigation which resulted in an ongoing lawsuit \nagainst the Nation's largest student loan servicer, Navient. Navient \nhas become the poster child for poor customer service and abusive \npractices that make it more difficult for struggling borrowers to repay \ntheir Federal student loans.\n  The Illinois Student Loan Bill of Rights will help to protect \nIllinois borrowers from these practices. Among other things, the law \nrequires servicers to inform borrowers about their eligibility for \nincome-driven repayment plans and other affordable repayment options. \nIt also prohibits servicers from misleading borrowers, requires them to \ncorrectly process payments, and requires servicers to inform borrowers \nabout their eligibility for loan forgiveness due to a disability or \nharmful actions by the school.\n  I have worked at the Federal level to provide similar protections for \nall student loan borrowers. I authored the Federal Student Loan \nBorrower Bill of Rights, which I will reintroduce in the coming months. \nThis bill was the basis for reforms to student loan servicing contracts \ninitiated by President Obama. Unfortunately, much of that work has been \nrolled back by Secretary Betsy DeVos.\n  Thanks to Attorney General Madigan and the bipartisan actions of the \nIllinois General Assembly, borrowers in our State will now have new \nrights and protections that neither Governor Rauner nor Secretary DeVos \ncan take away.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. DURBIN", "itemno": 0}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 1}], "header": {"chamber": "Senate", "num": "187", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "S7256", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "15", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "ILLINOIS STUDENT LOAN BILL OF RIGHTS", "id": "CREC-2017-11-15-pt1-PgS7256", "title": "ILLINOIS STUDENT LOAN BILL OF RIGHTS"}
