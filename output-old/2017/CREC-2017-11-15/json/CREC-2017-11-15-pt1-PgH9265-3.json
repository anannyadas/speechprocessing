HICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a \nremarkable individual from my home district, Mr. Ernest Walls of \nMonroe, a 93-year-old World War II veteran who was recently inducted \ninto the Georgia Military Veterans Hall of Fame.\n  Private First Class Walls joined the U.S. Army in the midst of World \nWar II at the age of 18. In a display of incredible valor, under the \n22nd Infantry Unit, he was part of the wave of troops to storm Utah \nBeach, the westernmost beach of the five landing areas of the Normandy \ninvasion, where they fought their way across a killing zone without \nhesitation. He was later wounded and captured by the Germans. He spent \na year as a prisoner of war.\n  When asked about his heroic action, he said: ``Only the grace of God \nhelped us win the war, and America came back as the most blessed and \nmost powerful Nation on Earth.''\n  Due to an unfortunate clerical error, it took Mr. Wells nearly 55 \nyears to receive his POW status and full benefits. Thankfully, since \nthen, he has been rightfully awarded the Bronze Star Medal, Purple \nHeart, French Legion of Honor, and Prisoner of War Medal.\n  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating Private \nWells and to extend our personal and sincere appreciation to him, as \nwell as all our men and women in uniform. We, as a nation, are forever \ngrateful.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. JODY B.
