DORIS O. MATSUI\n\n                             of california\n\n                    in the house of representatives\n\n                      Wednesday, November 15, 2017\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "M001163", "text": "  Ms. MATSUI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the leadership of \nRusty Selix, whose outstanding advocacy and efforts on behalf of mental \nhealth have changed, improved and saved lives. Rusty has been a leading \nexpert in mental health policy and finance for the past 30 years, and \nstate and local government policy and finance for 40 years. His work \nhas been focused on mental health since 1986, when he became the \nExecutive Director and legislative representative of the California \nCouncil of Community Behavioral Health Agencies, a statewide \nassociation of non-profit, publicly funded mental health providers. He \nalso served as the Executive Director of the Mental Health Association \n(Mental Health America) in California from 1993 until 2014 and has \nworked with every major mental health organization nationally and in \nCalifornia. He has served as Chair of the Policy Committee for the \nNational Council for Behavioral Health and Mental Health America, \nhelping to guide national mental health policy for many years. Rusty \nwas the original co-author and leader, with Senator and now Mayor \nDarrell Steinberg, of the Proposition 63 Campaign--the November 2004 \nCalifornia ballot measure which is transforming the state's public \nmental health system.\n  Beyond his innumerable and far-reaching accomplishments, I honor \nRusty for the spirit and manner in which he has achieved them. Rusty \nhas been able to intuitively and adeptly reach out and bring together \nwith a diversity of stakeholders in collaborative efforts to attain a \nunited goal. Guided by an unwavering focus on mental health, Rusty \ncombines a clear understanding of the ``big picture'' with a solid, \ngrounded sense of what can be shifted or altered to achieve change. Be \nit legislative, financial or organizational Rusty can see the necessary \nsteps ahead and present his position in a way that encompasses and \nappeals to the needs and interests of those who can impact their own \nsystems to accommodate the proposed change. With an authentic, non-\ndefensive posture, Rusty is truly open to listening and learning about \nthe others' concerns and able to skillfully propose feasible solutions \nto potential problems.\n  Rusty's tireless work has always been about creating the change that \ncan bring reality to his vision of improving lives and systems and not \nabout self-aggrandizement. He acts with great integrity and, as such, \nis trusted for his honesty and his ability to follow through. \nThroughout our work together on mental health policy, he has always \nacted as an immediate, knowledgeable, and trusted resource.\n  Mr. Speaker, I know many in the state government and the mental \nhealth and substance use disorders community will miss the work and \npresence of Rusty Selix as he takes a step back from his active role \nwith CCCBHA and will serve as the Senior Policy Consultant for this \norganization for which he has done so much. He has been an incomparable \nforce with a strong, solid voice. His legacy will live on for years to \ncome and I'm pleased that he will continue to be a voice for behavioral \nhealth care providers and those that they serve in the great state of \nCalifornia.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Ms. MATSUI", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 3}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "187", "extension": true, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "E1574", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "15", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "IN RECOGNITION OF RUSTY SELIX", "id": "CREC-2017-11-15-pt1-PgE1574-3", "title": "IN RECOGNITION OF RUSTY SELIX"}
