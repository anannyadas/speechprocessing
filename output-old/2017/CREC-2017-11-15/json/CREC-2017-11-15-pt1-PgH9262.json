Mr. Speaker, I always acknowledge the \npreeminent privilege to stand in the well of the Congress of the United \nStates of America. It is a unique opportunity accorded few in a country \nof millions. So I am honored to stand here, Mr. Speaker.\n  I love my country, but I must say, Mr. Speaker, I stand here with \nprofound disbelief--profound disbelief--because I cannot believe, Mr. \nSpeaker, that the Senate of the United States of America is considering \nremoving 13 million people from insurance in a tax bill.\n  The Senate is proposing in a tax bill--that can't solve all of our \nproblems, by the way--that 13 million people lose healthcare--13 \nmillion people without a primary care physician.\n  Perhaps not all, but it is fair to assume that millions will not have \na primary care physician. Millions will no longer get the preventive \ncare that can save dollars as well as lives. Millions will find \nthemselves in emergency rooms receiving primary care.\n  I cannot believe that the Senate of the United States of America, in \na tax bill, would remove 13 million people from the insurance rolls \nand, in so doing, acquire $338 billion. The $338 billion is not going \nto deficit reduction. The $338 billion will go to line the pockets of \npeople who can afford the best healthcare that the world can provide.\n  It is hard to believe that, in the richest country in the world, Mr. \nSpeaker, we are about to move from healthcare to sickness care. \nHealthcare provides preventive care. Sickness care, Mr. Speaker, means \nthat you show up at an emergency room.\n  By the way, that $338 billion that is claimed as a savings--we will \nspend more than that on emergency room services for the 13 million--or \nthe millions, whatever that number may happen to be--who are going to \nemergency rooms. We will spend it. People are going to get care. They \nwon't get the best care.\n  We have, in the richest country in the world, concluded that we can \ntake healthcare from those who dearly need it and provide wealthcare \nfor those who already have it. Why would we put wealthcare above \nhealthcare in the richest country in the world? I cannot believe that \nthis is happening in the United States of America.\n  By the way, Mr. Speaker, you and I know that if the Senate can do \nthis, then the House will follow suit. The House will pick up that \nlanguage, some variation of it, if not the exact language. We will find \nthat, in the House, we will be voting to eliminate insurance for 13 \nmillion people.\n  Mr. Speaker, our country is better than this. Our country is a \ncountry that cares for every person where, yes, we will care for the \nwell-off, the well-heeled, and the well-to-do. Yes. But we also care \nfor the least, the last, and the lost. In this country, we care about \npeople, and we want every person to have the best healthcare.\n  So I suffer from disbelief. I am thunderstruck. I cannot imagine the \nSenate removing 13 million people from healthcare to provide wealthcare \nfor a few.\n", "turn": 1, "speaker": "Mr. AL GREEN of Texas", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "187", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H9262", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "15", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "WEALTHCARE ABOVE HEALTHCARE", "id": "CREC-2017-11-15-pt1-PgH9262", "title": "WEALTHCARE ABOVE HEALTHCARE"}
