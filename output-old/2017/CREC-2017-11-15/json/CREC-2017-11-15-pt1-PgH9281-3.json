I want to thank Mr. \nFarenthold. I want to thank Mr. Kilmer. I want to thank Chairman Gowdy.\n  Blake Farenthold and Derek Kilmer were the key drivers of this \nmeasure, and they made it stronger by incorporating their OPEN \nGovernment Data Act.\n  Trey Gowdy and his staff--I don't know where he is. He is probably \nworking on his hair. Trey Gowdy and his staff--especially Katy Rother--\nspent countless hours working with our team--especially Ted McCann--and \nothers to turn the Commission on Evidence-Based Policymaking's vision \ninto legislation. All the members of this Commission did incredible \nwork.\n  I want to especially thank Senator Patty Murray for her willingness \nto\n\n\nwork together on this issue. We may be on different sides of the aisle, \nbut there is one thing that we passionately agree on, and that is what \nthe government does, it should do it well. The taxpayer's money should \nalways be protected, and that is exactly why we came together to write \nthis bipartisan legislation.\n  So what does this bill actually do? It protects privacy. It improves \ntransparency. It ensures that Federal agencies are protecting the data \ncollected by the government.\n  The American people deserve to know and they deserve to understand \nexactly what data the government is actually collecting. They deserve \nto know that the strictest safeguards are placed on that data.\n  The driving purpose of this legislation is very simple: we are \nrequiring Federal agencies to prioritize evidence when they are \nmeasuring a program's success.\n  Go figure.\n  Here is what we are talking about. Let's just take poverty, for \nexample. Instead of measuring success based on inputs, instead of \nmeasuring success based on how many programs we have created, how much \nmoney we are spending, how many people are on those programs, let's \nmeasure success based on results: Is it working? Are people getting out \nof poverty? Are the goals and objectives of these bills and these laws \nactually being achieved or not?\n  By directing agencies to do this, no longer will ``we don't know'' be \nan acceptable answer when asked if a program is actually working.\n  It is really just kind of crazy, but so much of what government does, \ngovernment doesn't actually see whether or not it is actually \nsucceeding at doing it. So we have got to get off of this input effort-\nbased system, this 20th century relic, and on to clearly identifiable, \nevidence-based terms, conditions, data, results, outcomes.\n  With this bill, we are asking the Federal bureaucracy to step up its \ngame. We are asking ourselves: How can we improve the lives of our \nfellow citizens by better understanding the programs that we put in \nplace? How can we make sure that the money that is being spent on \nbehalf of the hardworking taxpayers, who send the money here in the \nfirst place, is being spent wisely, efficiently, effectively?\n  We need results, not just effort. This is just good, commonsense \npolicy, and it is going to mean a real sea change in how we solve \nproblems and how government actually works.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of this bill, and I thank the sponsors \nfor all of their hard work.\n\n", "turn": 5, "speaker": "Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin", "itemno": 30}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "W000822", "text": "  Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN.

Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I am here today to support H.R. 4174, introduced by \nSpeaker Ryan and of which I am an original cosponsor.\n  The American people deserve an efficient and effective Federal \nGovernment. I think we can all agree on that. Taxpayers have the right \nto know their money is being spent wisely. All too often, \ndecisionmakers throughout the Federal Government make choices without \nsufficient evidence and data to inform them and guide them in making \nthose decisions.\n  In the previous Congress, Speaker Ryan and Senator Patty Murray \nintroduced the bicameral and bipartisan Evidence-Based Policymaking \nCommission Act of 2016. The Commission was charged with studying and \nmaking recommendations related to access and use of evidence to support \neffective policymaking. Believe it or not, they finished in about a \nyear.\n  The Commission on Evidence-Based Policymaking released their report \nSeptember 7 of this year. The Commission made 22 recommendations on how \nto improve how evidence is accessed, produced, secured, and maintained \nby the Federal Government.\n  On September 26, 2017, the House Committee on Oversight and \nGovernment Reform held a hearing entitled ``Recommendations of the \nCommission on Evidence-Based Policymaking.'' At that hearing, four \nmembers of the Commission explained the intent of the recommendations \nand the need for more evidence to improve policymaking.\n  According to Dr. Ron Haskins, the co-chair of the Commission, \nevidence showed that many of the Nation's social programs produced \nmodest to no impacts.\n  H.R. 4174, the Foundations for Evidence-Based Policymaking Act of \n2017, addresses several recommendations from the final report issued by \nthe Commission.\n  The bill lays the groundwork for critical examination of what is \nworking and what is not working in the Federal Government. Policy \ndecisions should be based on facts. Those folks of my generation will \nremember Sergeant Joe Friday in ``Dragnet:'' ``Just the facts, ma'am.''\n  That is what we are trying to get ahold of here.\n  According to the Commission on Evidence-Based Policymaking, too \nlittle evidence is produced in the Federal Government to meet this \nneed. The Commission also found cumbersome and idiosyncratic data \naccess procedures create confusion, impose unnecessary costs, and are a \nbarrier to evidence building.\n  Additionally, according to the Government Accountability Office, \nagencies' continued lack of evaluations may be the greatest barrier to \ntheir informing managers and policymakers and constitutes a lost \nopportunity to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of limited \ngovernment resources.\n  These barriers are standing between the taxpayers and the effective \ngovernment that they had paid for and that they deserve.\n  H.R. 4174 removes some of the barriers the Commission identified and \nencourages agencies to expand the use of evidence in decisionmaking.\n  First, each agency will need to designate a chief evaluation officer \nand submit annual evidence-building plans to Congress and the Office of \nManagement and Budget. This bill also establishes an advisory committee \nto review, analyze, and make recommendations on how to expand access to \nand use of data for evidence building.\n  It also includes the OPEN Government Data Act that Representative \nKilmer and I introduced. The OPEN Government Data Act addresses the \nCommission's recommendation to expand access to information about data. \nThe OPEN Government Data Act requires Federal agencies to develop a \ncomprehensive inventory of Federal data and increases access to \nspecific data assets that are appropriate for public release. This \nisn't personally identifiable, confidential, private, or classified \ninformation.\n  It also establishes an open-by-default standard for Federal data, \nmeaning data will be available under an open format and open license, \nand it will be\n\n\nin a machine-readable format. We are going to crowdsource some of this \nevidence building. We are going to let the private sector or nonprofits \nor whomever access this data, find ways to use it, build data, and, \nagain, get more bang for the taxpayer's dollar.\n  The bill further improves data management and collection by codifying \nthe position of chief data officer and clarifying the CDO roles and \nresponsibilities.\n  Finally, H.R. 4174 establishes a process by which statistical \nagencies can access data, ensure effective and consistent privacy \nprotections, and develop methods to reduce the sensitivity of data. \nThis will expand opportunities for use of the data by the evidence-\nbuilding community.\n  The Foundations for Evidence-Based Policymaking Act of 2017 was \nreported favorably out of the House Committee on Oversight and \nGovernment Reform.\n  I come back to the bottom line on this: Americans expect policymakers \nto make decisions based on facts. And decisions based on facts are \nbetter decisions that will save taxpayer money and be good for America. \nH.R. 4174 will help make these expectations a reality.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve \nthe balance of my time.", "turn": 7, "speaker": "Mr. FARENTHOLD", "itemno": 32}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "W000822", "text": "  Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN.

It reduces the burden to entry by \nlowering the cost to access and format data. It will open new business \nopportunities.\n  Making more government data public will pump up the data analytics \nboom currently driving new innovation, and I expect that access to this \ndata will lead to things that we haven't even thought up yet.\n  I am proud to work with Speaker Ryan, Chairman Gowdy, and Senator \nMurray to incorporate that bill into this broader legislation. It will \nhelp us measure how government programs are actually working or not.\n  Establishing a data inventory will help government officials \nunderstand what data they have so that they can use it, and they don't \nduplicate work that is already getting done.\n  Making the government's data searchable and accessible will help \npublic servants make better decisions, and it will help the public and \nthe press hold government more accountable.\n  Let me give you an example.

Now imagine if the House \nVeterans' Affairs Committee or the Government Accountability Office or \neven the VA had access to some of the data around wait times earlier. \nThe pain caused to veterans and their families could have been avoided.\n  Imagine if the leaders of the Veterans Administration knew that \nnewspapers were going to have access to that data, whether it be the \nKitsap Sun in my district or The New York Times or whoever. Imagine \nthat they were looking at that data, too.\n  It is time for government to move into the 21st century and start \nusing the data it is collecting to improve the services it is \nproviding.\n  Let me just speak briefly about what this bill does. This gets a \nlittle wonky, but I actually think it is pretty important. This \nlegislation sets up a way for everyone to use the government's data. We \nspent a long time working to make sure that the terms used in the bill \ndidn't trap government policy in this year or this decade. We hope that \nthis legislation will act as a building block for future technologies \nand applications of Federal data.\n  We included some important pieces to ensure that data is not only \navailable, but that it is easily used. Data has to be machine-readable. \nMany of us, I think, have gone on the internet and gotten a data set in \nPDF form that you can't really do anything with. It is so annoying. It \nis pretty obvious that in 2017 you should be able to use your computer \nto find what you are looking for.\n  Data has to be open format, and data should be malleable. \nProfessionals inside and outside of government should be able to use \nthat data in various ways. Government data should be provided under an \nopen license. If the government owns the data, that means the people \npaid for it, and they should be able to use it for free.\n  Let me quickly talk about what this bill doesn't do.\n  The bill does not take away safeguards that protect personal privacy, \nnational security, and intellectual property. The legislation would not \naffect existing contracts, so the government is not going to go to \na contractor and say: Oh, by the way, your data is now free and \navailable to the public.\n\n  Importantly, the bill does not alter the government's need to pay for \nprivate data rights in the future when it identifies private data that \nit may want to access and have ownership of. This bill only applies to \ndata that is owned and controlled by the Federal Government. It does \nnot provide an advantage to one sector or technology over another.\n  Mr. Speaker, let me just say in closing, for the past 2 years, \nseveral of us have worked on this issue and with experts throughout the \nprivate and public sector to get this bill past the finish line. I am \nproud to stand here today in support of a bipartisan bill that can move \nour economy forward, that can improve efficiency in our government, and \ncan help citizens get more involved in our democratic republic.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues' support of this bill.", "turn": 9, "speaker": "Mr. KILMER", "itemno": 34}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "F000460", "text": "  Mr. FARENTHOLD. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from \nMichigan (Mr. Mitchell), who is on the Oversight and Government Reform \nCommittee.", "turn": 10, "speaker": "Mr. FARENTHOLD", "itemno": 35}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "M001201", "text": "  Mr. MITCHELL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 4174, the \nFoundations for Evidence-Based Policymaking Act of 2017.\n  I am pleased to see the bill's sponsors and the Speaker move forward \nwith the reforms proposed by the Commission on Evidence-Based \nPolicymaking.\n  H.R. 4174 aims to create and use technology to assess and solve \nproblems; in other words, to make sure tools exist to gauge whether \nprograms work to best serve the American people. It is about utilizing \nthe data we already have to find out what works, what doesn't work, and \nwhat could work for some changes.\n  The bill requires agencies to develop evidence-building plans, key \noutcomes and return investment for the money the taxpayers pay, and \ncreates the position of a chief evaluation officer. Imagine that, we \nhave to actually create a position to evaluate because we\n\n\naren't doing it effectively now. It establishes an advisory committee \nto study the Commission's recommendation that Congress create a \nNational Secure Data Service. It includes the OPEN Government Data Act, \nwhich ensures that government aggregate data is available to consumers \nin a usable format.\n  As my colleague said on the other side of the aisle, to make the data \nmalleable, to make the data open format so that, in fact, people can \nassess not just in government agencies, but out in the public what the \ndata is saying about the programs that they pay for that we fund.\n  Finally, the bill also creates procedures to share that data across \nFederal agencies and to require protection of individual data that \nmakes up all that aggregate data.\n  All of these provisions are critical to setting our government on a \npath toward better serving the people in this country. Washington can \nno longer assess quality based on how much money we dump into programs, \nhow many people we enroll--outcomes that don't tell us whether or not \nthey are succeeding. This can only be done with quality, accessible \ndata.\n  By allowing key data to be connected and reported, we can build \nevidence to determine what does and doesn't work. More importantly, the \nAmerican people can see the evidence of what does and doesn't work \nrather than just bureaucrats in Washington.\n  I would also like to point out how the reforms are working here to \nlay the foundation for government and Congress to create new policies \nthat apply this information in novel ways.\n  This act, in its call for transparent, efficient, and well-designed \ndata systems, dovetails with other efforts in Congress for transparency \nand sharing data.\n  A bill I am working on, the College Transparency Act, would do just \nthat for student data and outcomes data from colleges and universities \nto better enable students and families to make more informed decisions \non one of the most important part of their lives: what postsecondary \neducation they pursue and what the outcome will be.\n\n\n  This bill, and my bill, streamlines and updates higher education \ninformation. It is time to utilize and make meaning out of all the data \nwe currently have and provide that to the taxpayers.\n  The Foundations for Evidence-Based Policymaking Act and the College \nTransparency Act both share a few critical goals of the Commission on \nEvidence-Based Policymaking:\n  First is the protection of the privacy of individuals that may be \nreflected in the data. That is the first priority.\n  Second is the recommendation that information be more readily shared \nacross agencies. Agencies actually will share what they already know \nabout programs.\n  Third is that agencies develop a strategy to share this data with the \npublic who pays for those programs.\n  These provisions are fundamental to responsibly and effectively \nutilizing the data that the taxpayers pay for. The Foundations for \nEvidence-Based Policymaking Act sets in motion these commonsense \npolicies that will increase the return on investment for the taxpayers \nand the outcomes of our programs.\n  The compartmentalization of data the government already collects and \nbarriers that prevent the reasonable sharing of it represent a \nsignificant missed opportunity for the government to provide value to \ntaxpayers.\n  It amazes me that we had to create a commission to tell us to share \nthis data. Taxpayers have already paid for it. Why aren't we already \nusing it?\n  Long term, these plans are essential. I urge my colleagues to support \nthe bill.", "turn": 11, "speaker": "Mr. MITCHELL", "itemno": 36}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "W000822", "text": "  Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN.
