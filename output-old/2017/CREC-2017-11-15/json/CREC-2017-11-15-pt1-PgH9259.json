Mr. Speaker, this is a pretty \nincredible week here in Washington, D.C., an incredible week for the \nAmerican people. When you look at the things that we accomplished this \nweek, we have had historic tax reform--long overdue. This is a break \nfor hardworking middle class American families. I encourage folks to \ncheck out the facts for themselves on exactly what happens.\n  But it is not the only thing we have done. Already this week we have \npassed a conference report on the national defense authorization, the \nlargest raise for our military in over 10 years, providing them the \nresources they need to be safe, to be effective, yes, to be lethal, and \nto be able to return home at the end of the day and to have their needs \nmet.\n  We did something that was very important for a State like \nPennsylvania, where we have almost 90,000 miles of streams. We did \nhistoric flood insurance reform, where we really separated and looked \ninland, the needs there, versus mixing things together, allowing local \nmunicipalities, as long as they comply with the FEMA processes, to be \nable to really determine where the actual flood risk is. We haven't had \nthat. In the past, it has all been done from Washington. It has been \ndone rather poorly.\n  But there is more than that. This week is also National \nApprenticeship Week, Mr. Speaker. I rise today to highlight \napprenticeships.\n  Apprenticeships are a part of career and technological education as a \npathway to family-sustaining careers and wages. Apprenticeships provide \nan alternative path to a high-paying job by providing opportunities to \ngain real-world skills while earning a paycheck.\n  Mr. Speaker, as co-chair of the Career and Technical Education \nCaucus, I know that a huge skills gap exists in communities nationwide. \nThere are good-paying jobs out there, but the unemployed are either ill \nprepared or lack the appropriate education to fill these vacancies.\n  That is why I am proud the House did pass my legislation, the \nStrengthening Career and Technical Education for the 21st Century Act, \nearlier this year. It passed unanimously out of this body. The bill \naims to close the skills gap by modernizing Federal investments in \ncareer and technical education programs by connecting educators with \nindustry stakeholders. Career and technical education apprenticeship \nprograms open the door for so many Americans.\n\n  Proudly, President Trump signed an executive order earlier this year \nto expand apprenticeships and skills-based education programs that put \nmore Americans back to work in the trades.\n  We have seen too many students pushed down the college-for-all \npathway that just doesn't work for some people. Obtaining an \napprenticeship or career and technical education is a viable path that \nmany high-achieving students can choose in pursuit of industry \ncertifications and hands-on skills that they use right out of high \nschool, in skills-based education programs, or should they choose, in \ncollege.\n  Mr. Speaker, we have all met young people who haven't been inspired \nin a traditional classroom setting. We all know people who have lost \njobs who are underemployed, working multiple part-time jobs, and they \nare looking desperately for good-paying, family-sustaining jobs. We all \nknow people who are aspiring for a promotion but keep falling short \nyear after year.\n  Mr. Speaker, I think we all know families that have been trapped in \npoverty for generations. An apprenticeship can change that. A career \nand technical education can change that. Mr. Speaker, by the year 2020, \nit is estimated that more than 6 million jobs will go unfilled because \nof that skills gap of not having individuals who are qualified and \ntrained to fill those positions.\n  Mr. Speaker, the legislation that will be passed off this floor \ntomorrow--and I speak of that optimistically, with confidence--is \nestimated to lead to creating a confidence that will result, it has \nbeen estimated, in a million jobs being created.\n  Through measures with career and technical education and measures \nsuch as apprenticeships, we can help Americans to be able to enter the \nworkforce, to find that on-ramp to opportunity, to give everyone the \nopportunity to earn a good family-sustaining wage and have that \nsecurity.\n  Mr. Speaker, Americans deserve no less.\n", "turn": 1, "speaker": "Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "187", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H9259", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "15", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "APPRENTICESHIPS PROVIDE AN ALTERNATIVE PATH TO HIGH-PAYING JOBS", "id": "CREC-2017-11-15-pt1-PgH9259", "title": "APPRENTICESHIPS PROVIDE AN ALTERNATIVE PATH TO HIGH-PAYING JOBS"}
