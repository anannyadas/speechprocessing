Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge my colleagues to \nsupport H.R. 3369, a bill recognizing the life and legacy of Howard B. \nPate, Jr., by naming the Spring Lake, North Carolina, Post Office in \nhis honor.\n  Born in Bladen County, North Carolina, in 1925, Mr. Pate first moved \nto Spring Lake, a town in the Eighth Congressional District I am proud \nto represent, where his father was stationed at Fort Bragg.\n  Being from a military family, when the United States entered World \nWar II, Mr. Pate answered the call to serve his country and continued \nhis service as a member of the North Carolina National Guard until \n1952.\n  After finishing his military service, Mr. Pate assumed the position \nof Spring Lake's postmaster. He served in this position for 30 years, \nuntil his retirement in 1982.\n  After retiring, Mr. Pate remained active in the community as a member \nof many civic organizations, including being named town historian in \n1994, a post he held for more than two decades. For all his efforts, \nthe local Chamber of Commerce named their Volunteer of the Year award \nafter Mr. Pate.\n  The town of Spring Lake unanimously adopted a resolution to dedicate \ntheir post office in honor of Mr.\n\n\nHoward Pate, Jr., because there was never a person who embodied the \nspirit of the community more than he.\n  Sadly, Mr. Pate passed away 1 year ago yesterday, on November 14, \n2016. On the first anniversary of his passing, I can think of no better \nway to honor his respected life than to name the post office after him \nin a town he loved and where he lived and served most of his life.\n  As any Spring Lake resident will tell you, Mr. Pate was not only a \npillar of our community, but also a cherished friend. He worked \ntirelessly to ensure we kept a strong grip on our past while making \nSpring Lake a better place for future generations.\n  It is my honor to make sure he will always be a part of our legacy in \nthe future by naming the Spring Lake Post Office in his honor.", "turn": 5, "speaker": "Mr. HUDSON", "itemno": 10}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "W000822", "text": "  Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN.
