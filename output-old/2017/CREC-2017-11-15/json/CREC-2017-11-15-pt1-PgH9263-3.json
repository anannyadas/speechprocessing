Mr. Speaker, Republicans are bound and determined to \nrush through this Congress an immense tax bill before Americans even \nbegin to know what hit them. We need to speak up and inform families \nabout this bill and its many bad parts.\n  I came here to the House a few weeks ago and said: All you need to \nknow about this tax bill is that it is good for Donald Trump and his \nbillionaire buddies. It rewards those multinational companies that have \nbeen shipping jobs and profits offshore for so many years and who think \nthey have no responsibility to pay for our national security and other \nvital public services.\n  Well, I am here today to admit that I was in error. All of those \nthings are true. It is about Donald Trump and his billionaire buddies \nand all the additional money they will pocket. It is about shipping the \njobs offshore by multinationals who get a new incentive, a giant, new \nloophole in this bill, but I was wrong to say that was all that it is \nabout. It also now begins to impact one family after another across \nAmerica in their healthcare.\n  It is the same fanaticism that drove Republicans to try to take away \nhealthcare 60-plus different times in the last Congress and the same \nfanaticism that has caused them to push forward with repeal effort \nafter repeal effort. It is the kind of fanaticism that American \ncitizens stood up to.\n  It was not only the courageous votes of John McCain, Susan Collins, \nand other Members in the Senate who stopped this wretched healthcare \nbill that passed through the House, but it was the fact that Americans \nkept saying: No, don't take the right that my family has to get access \nto a family physician. Don't take away my neighbors' or my church \nmembers' right to get access to protect their family with healthcare.\n  Today, we learn that this new tax bill is being changed to do just \nthat. It is another assault on the Affordable Care Act.\n  In the beginning of the rush to force it through the House long \nbefore Thanksgiving, before Americans even get to give it attention, \nthe first step that Republicans took here in the committee that I serve \non that considered the tax bill last week was on what we call the \nAlzheimer's tax.\n  Currently, American citizens have a right that has long existed in \nour tax law that if you have really serious medical expenses of over 10 \npercent of your income, such as a family who earns $50,000--which is \nnow, today, a modest income--and they have over $5,000 in medical \nexpenses, they can deduct those from their taxes.\n  It is called the Alzheimer's tax because so many of the families that \nrely on disability to deduct medical expenses are older people who have \na family member with Alzheimer's. They need long-term, special care, or \nthey need someone with home health care to come and help them with this \nvery serious problem.\n  Under the bill that is before us today, they will be denied any right \nto continue to do that. Under this bill, they will get an opportunity \nto pay a tax on the dollars they are having to expend for Alzheimer's \ncare.\n  Of course, it is not just Alzheimer's care. It might be a young \nfamily that has a child with a serious disability who requires home \nhealth aides or physical therapy, or it might be a woman with breast \ncancer whose medical coverage does not provide all of the treatment \nthat she needs.\n  Under this Republican bill, you will no longer be able to deduct one \ncent for all those serious, burdensome medical bills. No, they want to \ntax you on what you paid in excess of medical bills.\n  We have moved today to chapter two. The bill that the House will \nconsider will be merged with a Senate bill. The Senate has declared \nthey will end forever the individual responsibility portions of the \nAffordable Care Act. Those are the provisions that ensure all Americans \nwill participate so that we will have the largest possible risk pool \nand that people don't sign up for the Affordable Care Act just after \nthey are sick, after they have a problem. Everyone is there. It is just \nlike you don't sign up for fire insurance after your house is on fire.\n  It is essential for everyone. We must reject this bill as the wrong \nway for America to go to deny healthcare coverage and impose more taxes \non too many Americans.\n", "turn": 1, "speaker": "Mr. DOGGETT", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "187", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H9263-H9264", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "15", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "REJECT THE TAX CUT LEGISLATION", "id": "CREC-2017-11-15-pt1-PgH9263-3", "title": "REJECT THE TAX CUT LEGISLATION"}
