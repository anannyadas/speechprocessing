Mr. Speaker, after spending a bizarre week in the \nWays and Means Committee with a moving target of the Republican tax \nplan, we find out, amazingly, that it is actually getting worse and \nworse.\n  We have just discovered that the Senate is going to repeal the \nindividual healthcare mandate to to provide funding for more tax cuts \nfor America's wealthy.\n  The cost of that?\n  There will be 13 million additional uninsured Americans, and \neverybody in the individual market will see their premiums increase \nanother 10 percent next year and every year therefafter.\n  Well, tomorrow, Trump is going to come to Capitol Hill to hold a \nrally\n\n\nwith Republican Members to try to make some of these nervous people \nfeel a little more comfortable. No wonder Donald Trump is eager to see \nthis bill pass. It is designed for Donald Trump.\n  First, he is the self-proclaimed king of debt. Well, you got it in \nspades with this bill because the Republicans have raised the debt \nceiling $1.5 trillion to finance these tax cuts for people who, \nfrankly, don't need them. Because you have to pay interest on that, it \nis a $2.3 trillion additional burden on our children and grandchildren.\n  It eliminates the alternative minimum tax. Even though Trump refused \nto honor his commitment to release his tax returns, one was leaked to \nDavid Cay Johnston, and it showed the only reason he paid substantial \ntaxes in 2005 was because of the alternative minimum tax. Getting rid \nof that would save him $31 million in one year.\n  There is a special break for passthrough entities. It is, \ntheoretically, for small businesses, but many of the passthrough \nentities are not small businesses. They include hedge funds. Donald \nTrump's disclosure form lists hundreds of passthrough entities. That is \nhow he does business.\n  Of course, the biggest and most outrageous loophole is to completely \neliminate the inheritance tax over the next 10 years. This will save a \ncouple thousand people, extraordinarily wealthy people, $172 billion \nthat would otherwise come to the government to be able to fund programs \nfor our veterans, deal with the opioid crisis.\n  Donald Trump will be able to pass off hundreds of millions, maybe a \nbillion or two, tax free. Remember, most of that money had never been \ntaxed in the first place. You don't become a billionaire on W-2 income. \nIt is all appreciated, untaxed capital.\n  Well, it also shatters a bipartisan agreement for alternative energy. \nDonald Trump is doubling down on energy of the past, trying to breathe \nlife into a failing coal industry. Their bill would break a bipartisan \nagreement for wind energy, which we carefully negotiated on a \nbipartisan basis, and the industry has gone ahead and pledged billions \nof dollars.\n  Eliminating that agreement, the only retroactive provision in the \nbill, puts at jeopardy billions of dollars of investment and tens of \nthousands of jobs. Score one for Donald Trump.\n  But the worst element of this bill, I think--and there is a lot to \nchoose from--is its Alzheimer's tax. It would deny the medical \nexemption to over 9 million middle class families to be able to deduct \nextraordinary medical expenses.\n  Think of a family that is trying to cope with the challenges of a \nloved one with Alzheimer's. This costs them tens of thousands of \ndollars, sometimes hundreds of thousands of dollars in a year. It takes \naway the tax deduction from them.\n  This is an outrage. It is made for Donald Trump and large \ncorporations, but, sadly, it increases taxes on many middle-income \nAmericans, especially with the Alzheimer's tax, denying some of the \nmiddle class families in the most difficult circumstances a little tax \nrelief. It is inexcusable.\n  They couldn't defend it in committee. Let's see how the Republicans \ndefend it on the floor of the House. But more important, let's see how \nthey defend that to 9 million American families.\n", "turn": 1, "speaker": "Mr. BLUMENAUER", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "187", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H9257-H9258", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "15", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "SCORE ONE FOR DONALD TRUMP", "id": "CREC-2017-11-15-pt1-PgH9257-5", "title": "SCORE ONE FOR DONALD TRUMP"}
