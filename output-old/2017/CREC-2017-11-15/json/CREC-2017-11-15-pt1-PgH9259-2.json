Mr. Speaker, I rise to tell you a true story from \nScranton, Pennsylvania.\n  When Matty Loftus got out of the Army in 1970, he went to work for \nthe TV tube plant in Dunmore, Pennsylvania, just north of Scranton. At \nthe time, it was owned by RCA and later became Thompson Consumer \nElectronics.\n  Matty Loftus was 19 years old, and this was a great job, \nmanufacturing picture tubes where a lot of great people worked, as many \nas 1,600 men and women. The pay was good; the benefits were excellent. \nThey were union jobs, and the picture tubes they put together were so \ngood, this company was able to sell them to Sony in Japan.\n  The people working at this plant were a community. They had wonderful \ncompany picnics. They had a softball league. They organized holiday \nparties for the kids and fishing derbies. Matty Loftus worked there for \n30 years. He was able to raise four children on his salary alone.\n  Chuck Lampman is the same age as Matty Loftus, and they are friends. \nChuck went to work for the RCA plant in 1972 when he was 21. He started \nin production, and he loved that job, too. He says: We were making the \nCadillac of American televisions. By the year 2000, we were already \nstarting to make the first generation of flat screen TV panels.\n  Around that time, Thompson won a worldwide award for making the best \n27-inch TVs in the world, and everybody at the plant was so proud. \nChuck says: That wasn't just a job; that was a way of life.\n  John O'Hearn got out of high school in 1975. He got a job at the TV \nplant right away. He worked production at first, but then he got bumped \nup into the machine shop. He made lifelong friends at that factory.\n  In 1994, NAFTA went into effect. Matty, Chuck, and John, they knew \nabout it, but they didn't think too much about it. John remembers \npeople in the machine shop who were interested in politics arguing over \nthe effects of NAFTA.\n\n\n  Through the nineties, these men and women were working the factory \n24/7 in three shifts, putting out over 2 million picture tubes a year. \nThey used to say: They will never close us down. We make this company \ntoo much money.\n  And then it came, May of 2001. Management called everybody into the \nplant and gave them the news. The plant was closing in August, 3 months \nfrom then, because they were moving to Mexico.\n  People were shocked. Nobody saw this coming. They tried to negotiate \nwith the company, and Matty and Chuck remember the answer. It was: Are \nyou willing to take a $13-an-hour pay cut and work for $3.25 an hour?\n  Matty remembers the pride that these people had at the plant working \nthe last few months, the pride that they did their jobs with. There was \nno vandalism. There were no work stoppages, no slowdowns. They finished \nout their jobs showing the pride in the work that they had had for a \ngeneration. He remembers the tears on that last day and how people \npassed out lists of names and phone numbers so they could all stay in \ntouch.\n  Chuck remembers on the last day how that trophy for the best 27-inch \nTV tube was still in the company lobby.\n  All three of them remember the aftermath. They remember the divorces. \nThey remember the suicides.\n  Matty still had two daughters in public school. He went through his \nfamily savings, and he had to cash in some of his retirement money, \ntake the penalty. Now he works as a security guard making $10 an hour. \nHe is 66, and he can't afford to retire.\n\n  Chuck was out of work for years, and eventually he found a job making \nhalf the money. He is also 66, and he can't retire.\n  John can't forget having to tell his daughter, Lindsey, in May 2001 \nhe was losing his job. She was in tears. She was graduating high school \nthe next month. She wanted to go to college.\n  When Chuck found out the current Republican tax plan is to drop \ncorporate tax to 20 percent for companies doing business in America but \nto 10 percent for American companies doing business overseas, this is \nwhat he said: Haven't we lost enough already under NAFTA? Now you are \ngoing to reward companies for shipping more jobs overseas?\n  Mr. Speaker, this tax bill will ship more jobs overseas. This bill \nstinks, and I won't vote for it.\n", "turn": 1, "speaker": "Mr. CARTWRIGHT", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "187", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H9259-H9260", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "15", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "A TRUE STORY FROM SCRANTON, PENNSYLVANIA", "id": "CREC-2017-11-15-pt1-PgH9259-2", "title": "A TRUE STORY FROM SCRANTON, PENNSYLVANIA"}
