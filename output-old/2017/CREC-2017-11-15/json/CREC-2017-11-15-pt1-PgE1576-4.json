Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Barbara Bush \nMiddle School located in the Valley Ranch area of Irving, Texas. This \nprestigious school was named after America's former First Lady, Barbara \nBush, in honor of her commitment to public education and the good of \nall children. Barbara Bush Middle School opened its doors during the \nfall of 1998 as the sixth middle school in the Carrollton-Farmers \nBranch Independent School District. In 2010, the campus was authorized \nas an International Baccalaureate World School offering the Middle \nYears Program. This institution serves and celebrates a wonderfully \ndiverse community and student body.\n  As they soon celebrate their twenty year anniversary, Barbara Bush \nMiddle School, home of the Broncos, has accrued numerous accolades in \nAcademics, Fine Arts, Athletics, and individual accomplishments at both \nthe local and state levels. Students participate and compete in a wide \narray of activities within the University Interscholastic League: \norchestra, band, choir, theatre, basketball, cheerleading, football, \ntrack and field, volleyball, soccer, art, writing, oral reading, and \nspelling. The awards that the school has earned includes medals from \nthe Special Olympics Competition in bowling and track and field, \nprogression belts in the Kick Start Karate Program, and even the \nawarding of ``Ambassador of the Year'' by the Friends of Texas Public \nSchools to Principal Matthew Warnock in 2012.\n  Barbara Bush Middle School is fortunate to receive significant and \nongoing support from the community's civic organizations, churches, \nbusinesses and their own Parent-Teacher Association in the form of \nscholarships, grants, volunteer hours and donations. The school, on \naverage, has about eighty students each year take part in a mentorship \nprogram made possible by local churches and Big Hope, as well as gifts \nof school supplies and other necessities often given to students by \nlocal businesses. To help foster global caring and responsibility, and \nto show appreciation for all that is done on behalf of the school, the \nBarbara Bush Middle School Broncos have enthusiastically contributed \nthousands of dollars and other items to numerous local, national and \ninternational charities such as: The Pulsera Project-Color the World, \nLimbs International, Operation Kindness, UNICEF, North Texas Food Bank, \nMetrocrest Services, American Heart Association, Children Cancer Fund, \nand victims of natural disasters such as Hurricanes Katrina and Harvey.\n\n\n  The teachers, staff, and students of Barbara Bush Middle School \nconstantly strive to honor the former First Lady's legacy, which is \ncaptured in their school's motto, ``It's a great day to be a Bronco at \nBarbara Bush Middle School where our number one goal is high \nachievement for each student!'' Mr. Speaker, I am honored to represent \nthe fine members of Barbara Bush Middle School. I ask all my \ndistinguished colleagues to join me in wishing the school continued \nsuccess in all of its endeavors.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. MARCHANT", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 3}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "187", "extension": true, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "E1576-E1577", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "15", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "IN HONOR OF BARBARA BUSH MIDDLE SCHOOL, IRVING, TEXAS", "id": "CREC-2017-11-15-pt1-PgE1576-4", "title": "IN HONOR OF BARBARA BUSH MIDDLE SCHOOL, IRVING, TEXAS"}
