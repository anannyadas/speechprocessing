Mr. Speaker, today I rise in memory of \nfallen Mississippi Marine Lance Corporal (LCpl) Roger Wayne Deeds who \ndied while defending our great nation on November 16, 2005, during \nOperation Iraqi Freedom. LCpl Deeds was killed by enemy small arms fire \nwhile conducting combat operations against enemy forces during \nOperation Steel Curtain in Ubaydi, Iraq. Also killed were Lance \nCorporal (LCpl) John A. Lucente of Grass Valley, California, Corporal \n(CPL) Jeffrey A. Rogers of Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, and Corporal (CPL) \nJoshua J. Ware of Apache, Oklahoma. During the attack, LCpl Deeds moved \nforward under enemy fire and suppressed the enemy with machine gun \nfire. He then launched a recovery effort of his wounded comrades. He \nwas providing first aid and security for the wounded when he was \nmortally wounded. This act of courage and selflessness earned him the \nBronze Star Medal with Valor. LCpl Deeds was assigned to Battalion \nLanding Team 2nd Battalion, 1st Marine Regiment, 13th Marine \nExpeditionary Unit, I Marine Expeditionary Force (Forward), Camp \nPendleton, California.\n  LCpl Deeds was born into a military family and lived on a number of \nU.S. Air Force bases including Clark Air Force Base in the Philippines, \nMather Air Force Base in California, Rhein Main Air Force Base in \nGermany, Holloman Air Force Base in New Mexico, and Keesler Air Force \nBase in Biloxi. LCpl Deeds graduated from Biloxi High School in 2000. \nIt was there he met his future wife, Sarah French. They were married in \nFebruary 2004. ``He's been my best friend for years. My everything,'' \nSarah stated in an Associated Press news article.\n  Joyce Deeds, LCpl Deeds' mother, said her son exemplified the Marine \nCorps motto which is ``Semper Fidelis,'' meaning always faithful. \n``They have a saying that no one is left behind,'' Mrs. Deeds said. \n``And that's how my son died. He was faithful to God, country, and \nfamily.'' Scott Deeds, LCpl Deeds' father, recently said that his son \nnever saw a mountain he was not going to conquer and never backed down \nfrom a challenge, no matter how big. ``Roger followed a very long line \nof family members from his father, to uncles, cousins, grandfathers and \ngreat grandfathers, who served in every battle or conflict since the \nCivil War,'' Mr. Deeds said. ``Roger saw a calling in serving this \ngreat nation and he chose the Marines as he felt it was the best fit \nfor himself and as he said, 'I want to be on the front line to provide \nprotection for my brothers and freedom for those denied freedoms.' He \nwill always be my mini-me. He was and will always be my son, my friend, \nmy hero, and our Marine.''\n  He was buried with full military honors at the Biloxi National \nCemetery.\n  LCpl Deeds is survived by his father, Scott Deeds; his mother, Joyce \nDeeds; his sister, Gina McKnight; his wife, Sarah Deeds; his son, \nAlaric Deeds; and his daughter, Mikaleigh Deeds.\n  John 15:13 says, ``Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay \ndown his life for his friends''. LCpl Deeds distinguished himself on \nthe battlefield and in life. His service will always be remembered.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. KELLY of Mississippi", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 3}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "187", "extension": true, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "E1569", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "15", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "HONORING THE LIFE OF FALLEN MISSISSIPPI MARINE LANCE CORPORAL (LCPL) ROGER WAYNE DEEDS", "id": "CREC-2017-11-15-pt1-PgE1569-3", "title": "HONORING THE LIFE OF FALLEN MISSISSIPPI MARINE LANCE CORPORAL (LCPL)  ROGER WAYNE DEEDS"}
