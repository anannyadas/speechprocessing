Mr. Speaker, today I rise in memory of \nfallen Mississippi soldier Army Specialist (SPC) Jeremiah Joseph \nDiGiovanni who paid the ultimate sacrifice on November 15, 2003, during \nOperation Iraqi Freedom. SPC DiGiovanni was killed when two UH-60 Black \nHawk helicopters collided in Mosul, Iraq. SPC DiGiovanni was among 17 \nsoldiers killed in the collision. SPC DiGiovanni was assigned to 4th \nBattalion, 101st Aviation Regiment, 101st Airborne Division (Air \nAssault), Fort Campbell, Kentucky.\n  According to the Associated Press, SPC DiGiovanni, a Covington, \nLouisiana native, graduated from North Pike High School in Summit, \nMississippi. He joined the Army in November 2000. He later received \ntraining for his job as a Black Hawk crew chief. Joe DiGiovanni, SPC \nDiGiovanni's father, said his son's job was very important to him. ``It \nwas 250 miles an hour, pants on fire with both doors open,'' Mr. \nDiGiovanni said. ``He was a Black Hawk Crew Chief and he lived to get \nin that helicopter and fly.''\n  Tonja Ludlam, a friend of SPC DiGiovanni, wrote a post about him on a \nmemorial website. ``To all who knew DJ, we were touched deeply by a boy \nwho grew to be a man before our eyes,'' Tonja wrote. ``He was so proud \nto wear the uniform, be the best soldier he could be, and so proud to \nserve our country. He studied hard to be a Crew Chief and do what he \nloved the most. I miss his smiles and the fun we had in the short time \nI knew him.''\n  During his three years of service, SPC DiGiovanni was awarded the \nNational Defense Service Medal, the Army Service Ribbon, the Basic \nAviation Badge, and the Sharpshooter Qualification Badge.\n  The funeral was held at Calvary Baptist Church in Pricedale \nCommunity, Mississippi, where SPC DiGiovanni was raised by his father \nand stepmother, Helen DiGiovanni.\n  SPC DiGiovanni is survived by his father and stepmother, Joseph A. \nDiGiovanni and Helen DiGiovanni; his mother and stepfather, Laurie A. \nBrock and Kendall Brock; his six stepsisters, Brandy Blackwell, Misty \nBlackwell, Kaitlin Brock, Sarah Brock, Hannah Brock, and Elisabeth \nBrock; his three brothers, Brett Kennedy, Kendall Brock, and Noah \nBrock.\n  SPC DiGiovanni's service and sacrifice to protect America will always \nbe remembered.\n\n\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. KELLY of Mississippi", "itemno": 3}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 4}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "187", "extension": true, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "E1574-E1575", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "15", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "RECOGNIZING THE LIFE OF FALLEN MISSISSIPPI SOLDIER ARMY SPECIALIST (SPC) JEREMIAH JOSEPH DiGIOVANNI", "id": "CREC-2017-11-15-pt1-PgE1574-4", "title": "RECOGNIZING THE LIFE OF FALLEN MISSISSIPPI SOLDIER ARMY SPECIALIST"}
