Mr. Speaker, a wise man said that insanity is doing the \nsame thing over and over and expecting a different result.\n  The definition of public bankruptcy is not having enough public taxes \nto pay public debts.\n\n\n  This means that the current National Flood Insurance Program is both \ninsane and bankrupt. It is insane because taxpayers pay when others' \nhomes are flooded. They pay again when the same homes are flooded a \nsecond time and a third time and a fourth time.\n  The GAO confirmed that the National Flood Insurance Program has \ncreated a flood of taxpayer debt; $23 billion in March of 2016. Three \nrecent major hurricanes on the Gulf Coast doesn't help.\n  Because Texas 22 had record floods when Hurricane Harvey hit in May, \nI was proud to be one of 237 Members to vote for needed reform, the \n21st Century Flood Reform Act.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge my Senate colleagues to do the same. Give America \na Christmas present before Santa Claus comes to town.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. OLSON", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "187", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H9266-H9267", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "15", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "THE 21ST CENTURY FLOOD REFORM ACT IS NEEDED REFORM", "id": "CREC-2017-11-15-pt1-PgH9266-6", "title": "THE 21ST CENTURY FLOOD REFORM ACT IS NEEDED REFORM"}
