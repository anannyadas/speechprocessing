Mr. Speaker, the tax bill being considered, H.R. 1, is a \nfrontal assault on the middle class and it will do lasting damage to \nour country.\n  The bill is a dishonest bait-and-switch for the 36 million middle and \nlower class families who will see their taxes increase under this plan \nto pay for tax cuts for the wealthiest 1 percent of Americans and large \nmultinational corporations. It is paid for by eliminating the few \nremaining benefits in our Tax Code for the middle class and charging \n$1.7 trillion to the national credit card, leaving our children and our \ngrandchildren to pay for it.\n  This bill lets the middle class down at every turn, and it should be \ndefeated. It eliminates the deduction for medical expenses, which over \n9 million middle class Americans claimed in 2015, including over 1 \nmillion taxpayers in my home State of California. This is especially \nharmful to older Americans struggling with high medical costs and \nserious illnesses, like cancer and Alzheimer's, and Americans with \ndisabilities.\n  It takes direct aim at college students across the country, raising \nthe future costs of higher education by $65 billion over 10 years by \neliminating the deductibility of interest on student loans.\n  It taxes employer tuition assistance benefits for students and \ntuition waivers for graduate students by treating this as income, \nmaking it more expensive for future scientists, medical professionals, \neducators, and other leaders to get an education.\n\n\n  It eliminates the lifetime learning credit and the deductibility of \ninterest of student loans at a time when student loan debt in the \nUnited States just reached $1.5 trillion. This is a bitter pill to ask \nour Nation's student borrowers to swallow.\n  Very importantly for my constituents, this bill bulldozes the State \nand local tax deduction. Almost 200,000 of my constituents claimed an \naverage State and local tax deduction of $31,193 in 2015. Under this \nplan, businesses can still claim this deduction. For example, the \nNational Education Association estimates are that 250,000 education \njobs will be put at risk because of this lack of deductibility. Just \nyesterday, the Fraternal Order of Police spoke out in opposition to \nthis bill's dismantling of this deduction, noting that their salaries \nand the equipment that they use are paid for by State and local taxes \non property sales and income. The Institute on Taxation and Economic \nPolicy found that California stands to be the biggest overall loser in \nthis plan and faces a $12.1 billion tax increase in 2017 alone.\n  The bill also takes aim at the most valuable asset of the middle \nclass:\n\n\ntheir home. It limits the mortgage interest deduction used by \nhomeowners, and this is eminently unfair. Californians just experienced \nthe worst wildfires in our State's history, with over 14,000 homes \nlost. What does this bill do? It removes the deductibility for property \nlosses due to natural disasters. I find this to be especially cruel.\n  What the bill does do is take special care of the wealthiest 5,500 \nestates in this country by doubling the estate tax exemption to $22 \nmillion and then repealing it, removing the whole thing, by 2024.\n  Finally, the bill has terrible implications for the future of \nMedicare and the guarantee it has provided for Americans for over 50 \nyears. Without budget changes to offset the $1.5 trillion increase to \ndeficits over 10 years, the bill will trigger automatic spending cuts \nunder the statutory pay-as-you-go.\n  The Republican majority and the administration claim that this tax \nplan will ``pay for itself.'' It is bad math, because we were promised \nin the early 2000s that jobs would be created, that the economy would \ngrow, and the outcome was $1.8 trillion of debt.\n  The investments that pay off the most are the investments we make in \nthe American people, in education, in job creation, in infrastructure. \nThese are critical areas that always expand our economy.\n  This House should reject this unfair, unbalanced, fiscally \nirresponsible plan that dims the future of our country by attacking the \nmiddle class.\n", "turn": 1, "speaker": "Ms. ESHOO", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "187", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H9258-H9259", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "15", "month": "November"}, "related_bills": [{"type": "HR", "context": "FIRSTPARAGRAPH", "congress": "115", "number": "1"}, {"type": "HR", "context": "OTHER", "congress": "115", "number": "1"}], "doc_title": "THE GOP TAX BILL IS A FRONTAL ASSAULT ON THE MIDDLE CLASS", "id": "CREC-2017-11-15-pt1-PgH9258-2"}
