Mr. Speaker, I will vote against the Conference Report \nfor H.R. 2810, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year \n(FY) 2018.\n  The agreement includes several provisions that I strongly support, \nincluding giving servicemen and women a well-deserved raise of 2.4 \npercent. Those who serve in uniform have made extraordinary sacrifices \nfor our country and have earned and deserve a pay raise. The Conference \nReport also includes funding for Ukraine and Eastern Europe security \ninitiatives to counter Russia's heightened military provocations and \nannexation of Crimea. Additionally, it includes a provision recognizing \nclimate change as a direct threat to our national security interests.\n  Despite these important initiatives, I have strong concerns with the \nConference Report. The agreement authorizes more than $692.1 billion, \nwhich is $74.2 billion more than the FY 2017 authorized level and $26.4 \nbillion more than the president's request. This includes $65.7 billion \nto the Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) fund, an account which is \nnot counted in the budget and is not paid for. It adds to the deficit \nand is used as a slush fund by the Pentagon.\n  Unlike every other federal agency, the Department of Defense (DOD) \nrefuses to complete a financial audit so taxpayers know how the biggest \nbureaucracy in the federal government spends their money. In fact, a \nshocking report released last December exposed $125 billion in \nadministrative waste that the Pentagon tried to bury from being viewed \nby the public.\n  The Conference Report also authorizes $13 billion for the F-35 \nprogram, including 90 new planes, 20 more planes than the Trump \nAdministration requested. While I strongly support a modernized \nmilitary, I have serious concerns about the growing costs of the F-35 \nprogram. The Pentagon has projected that the lifetime operating and \nsustainment costs for the F-35 fleet will total more than $1 trillion.\n  I refuse to support increased bureaucratic waste at the expense of \nAmerican taxpayers and our men and women in uniform. A more accountable \nand transparent department would ensure taxpayer dollars are directed \ntowards the needs of our troops and the benefits they deserve, rather \nthan buying unnecessary weapon systems, sustaining a Cold War era \nmilitary force, and giving the president a blank check to fund wars \nCongress hasn't authorized.\n  I have always advocated for maintaining Congress's constitutionally-\nconfirmed prerogative to declare war under the War Powers Act and \nlimiting the President's authority to engage in armed conflict without \nthe consent of Congress. I strongly oppose the NDAA's continued \nauthorization of spending for wars that are not congressionally \napproved. The Pentagon uses the 2001 Authorization of Use of Military \nForce (AUMF) to continue to justify the more than 16 years our troops \nhave been fighting in the Middle East. In his short time in office, \nPresident Trump has already sent troops to Afghanistan, Iraq, Niger, \nSyria, and elsewhere without seeking a new Authorization of Use of \nMilitary Force (AUMF), a violation of the War Powers Act.\n  Additionally, the Conference Report prohibits the closing of \nGuantanamo Bay, which costs more than $100 million each year to house \n41 prisoners and has been used as a top recruiting tool by terrorists. \nFrankly, the prison at Guantanamo Bay has been a black eye for the \nUnited States, has eroded relationships with our allies, undermined \nU.S. missions abroad, and put U.S. citizens and our troops at risk of \nretaliation.\n  Congress can make responsible cuts to our defense budget without \njeopardizing the safety of our troops or undermining our national \nsecurity. Fiscal responsibility and accountability at the Pentagon \nwould allow for funds to be better spent supporting the basic needs of \nour troops, meeting our obligations to veterans of past wars, and \nensuring our true defense needs are prioritized.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. DeFAZIO", "itemno": 3}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 4}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "187", "extension": true, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "E1571", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "15", "month": "November"}, "related_bills": [{"type": "HR", "context": "TITLE", "congress": "115", "number": "2810"}, {"type": "HR", "context": "OTHER", "congress": "115", "number": "2810"}], "doc_title": "CONFERENCE REPORT ON H.R. 2810, NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2018", "id": "CREC-2017-11-15-pt1-PgE1571-2"}
