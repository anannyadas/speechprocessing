Mr. Speaker, most Americans would be outraged to learn \nthat hundreds, if not thousands, of veterans have been deported after \nserving honorably in the United States military, but this is the \nshocking truth about our broken immigration system.\n  These unjust deportations of veterans are still occurring. Let me \ncite the case of Chong Hwan Kim, a South Korean immigrant who has lived \nin this country since he was 5 years old. In 2009, he was deployed to \nIraq and was honorably discharged a year later. Legal permanent \nresidents qualify for citizenship if they serve just one day on Active \nDuty during a time of war.\n  Suffering from PTSD and facing the same challenges that many veterans \nface reintegrating into society, Kim broke the law, and because he \nnever completed the process of becoming a citizen, he currently awaits \ndeportation.\n  Veterans like Chong Hwan Kim deserve better. They deserve the dignity \nand respect that we afford to all who serve, and they deserve to enjoy \nthe rights they risked their lives to protect.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. TAKANO", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 3}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "187", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H9268", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "15", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "DEPORTATION OF VETERANS", "id": "CREC-2017-11-15-pt1-PgH9268", "title": null}
