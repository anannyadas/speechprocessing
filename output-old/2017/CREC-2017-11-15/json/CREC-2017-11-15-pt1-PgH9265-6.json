Mr. Speaker, New York State contributes $41 \nbillion, annually, to the Federal Government in taxation. The House \nRepublican corporate tax bill cut is being funded by tax increases on \nmiddle America and on western New York.\n  The elimination of the State and local tax deduction would be a major \nhit on local taxpayers. In fact, in Erie County, 89 percent of middle-\nincome households claimed the State and local tax deduction in 2015, \ndeducting $1.6 billion in already-paid local taxes. The average State \nand local tax deduction in Erie County was $12,866.\n  This corporate tax cut is being funded by tax hikes on middle America \nand on western New Yorkers and should be rejected.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. HIGGINS of New York", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "187", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H9265", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "15", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "CORPORATE TAX CUT SHOULD BE REJECTED", "id": "CREC-2017-11-15-pt1-PgH9265-6", "title": "CORPORATE TAX CUT SHOULD BE REJECTED"}
