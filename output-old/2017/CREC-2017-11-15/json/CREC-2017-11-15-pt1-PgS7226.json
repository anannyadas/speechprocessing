{"content": [{"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "M000355", "text": "  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, yesterday the Senate continued its \nefforts to confirm the President's talented nominees to staff the \nFederal Government.\n  We advanced the nomination of David Zatezalo to serve as the \nAssistant Secretary of Labor for Mine Safety and Health, an important \nposition to the thousands of miners in States like Kentucky. I look \nforward to confirming his nomination early this afternoon, along with \nthat of Mark Esper, who will be confirmed to another important \nposition, Secretary of the Army.\n  Also, we will turn to Joseph Otting, President Trump's nominee to \nserve as Comptroller of the Currency. This position is crucial to \nprotecting our national banking system, and Mr. Otting has the \nexperience necessary to excel there.\n  Then, the Senate will continue our efforts to ensure that our \nNation's judiciary fulfills its proper role in our democracy by \nconfirming two more talented nominees to serve as Federal district \ncourt judges. President Trump has continued to nominate individuals who \nwill interpret the law as it is actually written, not as they wish it \nwere.\n  Donald Coggins has been nominated to serve as district court judge \nfor the District of South Carolina. He has been in private practice in \nSouth Carolina for over three decades. The Senate Judiciary Committee \nreported his nomination by a voice vote. He is a talented nominee, and \nI look forward to confirming him soon.\n  Then the Senate will consider the nomination of Dabney Friedrich to \nserve as district court judge for the District of Columbia. Ms. \nFriedrich has a wealth of experience, having been in private practice \nand having served as assistant U.S. attorney in both the Eastern \nDistrict of Virginia and the Southern District of California, and she \nhas been confirmed twice by the Senate as a Commissioner of the U.S. \nSentencing Commission. The Judiciary Committee also reported her \nnomination by a voice vote. These nominees will respect the rule of law \non the Federal bench, and they should be confirmed without delay.\n  I would like to again thank Chairman Grassley for his commitment to \nbringing the President's impressive judicial nominees to the floor. \nThese are both respected nominees who have the support of Members on \nboth sides of the aisle, and I hope we can consider their nominations \nwithout any partisan procedural hurdles. We should confirm them soon.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. McCONNELL", "itemno": 0}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.
