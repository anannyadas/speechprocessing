Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from \nKentucky and the gentlewoman from New Jersey for being a part of this \ntoday.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 3821, legislation to \nname the Clermont Post Office after Lance Corporal Zach T. Addington.\n  I introduced this legislation to honor Zach, a fellow northeast \nGeorgian, for giving his life in service to our Nation during the \nVietnam war.\n  Zach Addington was born to Addison S. and Lillie Addington on \nNovember 1, 1948, in Gainesville, Georgia. He and his family lived in \nClermont, Georgia, where he attended Clermont Elementary School and my \nalma mater, which we share, North Hall High School. He graduated in \n1967.\n  Zach enlisted in the United States Marine Corps as a private, in July \nof 1967, and became a rifleman in the 3rd Marine Division of the Fleet \nMarine Force. He was promoted to private first class on December 1, \n1967, and he was deployed to Vietnam on December 19 of the same year.\n  On April 1, 1968, Zach was promoted to lance corporal. His company \nwas participating in Operation Scotland II when they engaged hostile \nforces in the vicinity of Hill 689, four kilometers west-southwest of \nKhe Sanh Airfield. On May 16, 1968, Zach Addington was killed in \naction.\n  His captain, William McArdle, stated that he was ``one of the finest \nmarines I have ever known. His exemplary conduct, leadership, and \nsingular determination to do every job well were qualities that all of \nus respected.''\n  On June 6, 1968, Mr. Addington was posthumously awarded the Purple \nHeart, the National Defense Service Medal, the Vietnam Service Medal, \nand the Republic of Vietnam Campaign Ribbon in recognition of his \nservice in Vietnam.\n  His family hopes to display these awards in the Clermont Post Office \nafter the naming.\n  He is survived by his brother, Addison S. Addington; and sisters, \nBillie Quillin and Sandra Montgomery.\n  The memory of Zach's courage and his service lives on in our corner \nof Georgia, and the naming of the Clermont Post Office in his honor \nwill be a reminder to all of us of his sacrifice and the sacrifices of \nthe armed services to us all.\n  There is a time when we come to these post offices and we read \naccomplishments, Mr. Speaker. We read accomplishments of many folks, \nbut each one has a story to tell. I think really, when you start to \nlisten to the many whom we have talked about today, there is a certain \ntheme of service that runs through each. There is a certain theme of \nsomething bigger than themselves, and especially those who gave their \nlife.\n  Zach Addington was one who went willingly. He knew that he may not \nreturn, in fact, even told people he may not, and he did not, but that \nservice and that sacrifice gives us the ability to stand here today and \nto do what we do. By standing here today, I intend to honor him for the \nnaming of this post office and would encourage my colleagues to vote in \nfavor.", "turn": 5, "speaker": "Mr. COLLINS of Georgia", "itemno": 10}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "W000822", "text": "  Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN.
