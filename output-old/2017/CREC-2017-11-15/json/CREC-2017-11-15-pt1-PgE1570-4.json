Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the \nConference Report to the FY18 National Defense Authorization Act. This \nlegislation helps ensure that our men and women in uniform are equipped \nto carry out their national security mission.\n  As the proud Representative of Naval Station Mayport--the East Coast \nhomeport for Littoral Combat Ships--I commend the Committee for \nauthorizing three more of these ships. The LCS platform currently \nprovides a much-needed U.S. naval presence in global hotspots, \nespecially in contested waters, and will do so for years to come. I \nwould also like to commend them for allowing the Navy to make common-\nsense changes to the routine and low skilled maintenance requirements \nand practices of our forward deployed Littoral Combat Ships.\n  As the Navy and we in Congress work to be good stewards of taxpayer \ndollars while meeting the global threat, we must reevaluate our \nsustainment strategies so that LCS can be utilized to the fullest \nextent possible. However, I would like to express my strong belief that \nthe more complex maintenance availabilities and modernizations still \nrequire the expertise, proficiency and experience of the U.S. ship \nrepair industrial base. Without a strong industrial base, our assets \nand sailors would be unable to meet the requirements facing our Navy.\n  I thank the Committee for including detailed reporting requirements \nand a two-year sunset so Congress can work closely with the Navy to \nbalance the importance of the U.S. ship repair industrial base and the \nflexibility needed for the Littoral Combat Ships on extended \ndeployments.\n  This bill is a strong example of Congress's commitment to the LCS \nprogram and using taxpayer dollars wisely. I again thank the Chairman \nand the Committee for their hard work on this legislation\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. RUTHERFORD", "itemno": 4}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 5}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "187", "extension": true, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "E1570", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "15", "month": "November"}, "related_bills": [{"type": "HR", "context": "TITLE", "congress": "115", "number": "2810"}], "doc_title": "CONFERENCE REPORT ON H.R. 2810, NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2018", "id": "CREC-2017-11-15-pt1-PgE1570-4"}
