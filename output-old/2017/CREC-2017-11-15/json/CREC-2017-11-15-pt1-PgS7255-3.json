Mr. President, today I wish to celebrate an \ninstitution in Spencer County marking 150 years of community journalism \nin Kentucky, the Spencer Magnet. Since the weekly newspaper began \noperations in 1867, it has covered celebrations, tragedies, wars, \nelections, and so much more. Today the Spencer Magnet is the oldest \ncontinuously operated business in Spencer County and reaches more than \n4,000 homes each week.\n  Over the years, the paper has operated under different names with \ndifferent owners. In 1925, the paper came under the ownership of Katie \nBeauchamp, and she changed its name from the Spencer Courier to its \ncurrent title. She justified the new name because it matched her \nmission for the paper, to serve as a means to draw the people of \nSpencer County together.\n  For 150 years, the paper has done just that. The publication covered \nnational and international news, but the Spencer Magnet's focus on \ncommunity journalism has endeared it to many of my constituents in the \narea.\n  As the Spencer County community looks back on its history, it \nrecognizes great successes and painful challenges, but the journalism \nfrom this newspaper has been a constant presence in community through \nit all. To properly mark its sesquicentennial anniversary, the Spencer \nMagnet is rededicating itself to its mission to draw the community \ntogether.\n  The population of Spencer County continues to grow and change. Now, \nmany residents work in Louisville and then come home to the rural \nSpencer County to escape the city. Whatever the future may bring, the \nSpencer Magnet stands ready to deliver the news to its readers.\n  Kentucky is home to many community newspapers, which have their \nfinger on the pulse of their readers. Organizations like the Spencer \nMagnet are incredibly important for chronicling our past and for \nshaping the news of tomorrow. I am proud to help the Spencer Magnet \ncelebrate this anniversary. I ask all of my colleagues to join me in \ncongratulating the Spencer Magnet on many years of reporting.\n  Mr. President, earlier this year, the Spencer Magnet published an \narticle reflecting on its years of community reporting. I ask unanimous \nconsent that excerpts of the article be printed in the Record.", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. McCONNELL", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "recorder", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in ", "turn": -1, "speaker": "The RECORDER", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "recorder", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "the Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Spencer Magnet, March 29, 2017]\n\n                Marking 150 Years of the Spencer Magnet\n\n                         (By John Shindlebower)\n\n       This community has been through a lot over the past 150 \n     years. We picked ourselves up after a devastating Civil War \n     that was especially brutal on a border state like Kentucky. \n     We survived economic hardships including a great depression \n     and a great recession and we saw our young men die in far off\n\n\n     lands in two world wars and other conflicts across the globe.\n       Through it all, the Spencer Magnet kept the community \n     informed.\n       This community has survived droughts, blizzards, floods and \n     tornadoes. We've even felt the earth shake a time or two.\n       We've endured divisive and bitter elections, political \n     scandals both small and large and we've had families \n     devastated by violent crime and tragic accidents. The Spencer \n     Magnet was here to report that news.\n       There have been grand times as well. New businesses have \n     started and flourished and the progress that changed so much \n     of American life did not bypass Spencer County. We've seen \n     the stage coach give way to the railroad and the railroad \n     give way to the automobile. Modern day luxuries often taken \n     for granted, such as running water, electric lights, radio \n     and television were greeted with fanfare when they made their \n     initial appearance in our community. The Spencer Magnet was \n     here to chronicle those changes and the ones that have \n     followed. Students worked their way through school and \n     annually marched to receive their diploma.\n       Local citizens have accomplished monumental achievements \n     and various churches and organizations have worked tirelessly \n     to serve the community, their neighbors and their fellow man. \n     The Spencer Magnet has been here to help the good.\n       Today, Spencer County continues to grow. Many families from \n     Louisville, seeking a slower pace of life and a rural \n     atmosphere, have chosen to make this their home. Many of \n     these new families simply lay their heads here at night as \n     they continue to work, shop and socialize in Louisville. But \n     increasingly, more and more of the newer residents are \n     becoming active in this community that they now proudly call \n     home.\n       The Spencer Magnet understands the role we play in this \n     pivotal era of Spencer County's history. Perhaps more than \n     ever before, this newspaper is practicing community \n     journalism by covering more meetings where decisions that \n     impact you and this community are made. More and more Spencer \n     Countians are expressing an interest in being involved \n     citizens, and it is our role as a newspaper to help those \n     same people be informed citizens.\n       Over this latest chapter of our history, the Magnet has \n     been honored on numerous occasions by the Kentucky Press \n     Association for our efforts to publish an informative, \n     quality newspaper that serves our residents. But more \n     important than awards, is the feedback we get from our \n     readers. There's nothing we like hearing better than the \n     words ``We read it in the Magnet.''\n       The Spencer Magnet is now 150 years old. We're the oldest \n     continuously operated business in Spencer County. We're proud \n     of that distinction, but we also do not take it for granted. \n     That longevity had to be earned by gaining the trust and \n     respect of readers like you. We don't take that lightly and \n     we will continue to strive to earn that trust each and every \n     week as we begin our next 150 years.\n       The next century and a half will surely be filled with a \n     mixture of tragedy and triumph. There will be achievements \n     and there will be failures. We will write stories about great \n     accomplishments, and we'll most certainly have to report on \n     heartbreak as well. But that's the nature of the newspaper. \n     It's what William T. Burton set out to accomplish in 1867, \n     and it's what we hope those who follow us will continue to do \n     decades from now.\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "The RECORDER", "itemno": 3}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 4}], "header": {"chamber": "Senate", "num": "187", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "S7255-S7256", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "15", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "150TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE SPENCER MAGNET", "id": "CREC-2017-11-15-pt1-PgS7255-3", "title": null}
