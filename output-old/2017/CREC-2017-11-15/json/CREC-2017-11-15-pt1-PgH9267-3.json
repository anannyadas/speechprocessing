Mr. Speaker, my Republican colleagues have gone too \nfar. Their tax scheme gives $1.5 trillion in tax cuts to millionaires \nand billionaires as well as wealthy corporations. It raises taxes on 36 \nmillion middle class families; makes deep cuts to Medicaid and \nMedicare, education, and infrastructure investments; and creates more \nincentives to ship American jobs overseas.\n  Now they are planning to sneak in a provision that targets the heart \nof the Affordable Care Act and strips more than 13 million Americans of \ntheir access to healthcare. This is not a tax reform plan. It is a tax \nscam.\n  Democrats and Republicans should be working together to fix an \neconomy and a Tax Code that is rigged against working people. The \nAmerican people need real tax reform that invests in middle class \nfamilies, stops corporations from shipping jobs overseas, and protects \nMedicare and Medicaid and other vital investments in healthcare, \neducation, and infrastructure.\n  Mr. Speaker, this bill does just the opposite. It deserves to be \ndefeated, and the American people deserve a better deal.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. CICILLINE", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "187", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H9267", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "15", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "THE GOP TAX PLAN", "id": "CREC-2017-11-15-pt1-PgH9267-3", "title": "THE GOP TAX PLAN"}
