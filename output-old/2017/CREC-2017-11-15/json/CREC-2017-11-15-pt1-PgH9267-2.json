Mr. Speaker, as we approach \nThanksgiving 2017, I am thankful for the change since election 2016 and \nthe positive success of President Donald Trump and Vice President Mike \nPence to cut taxes to create jobs.\n  In the House, led by Speaker Paul Ryan, there have been records set \non productivity. As of this week, there have been 458 bills passed out \nof committee, more than the last five administrations; 407 bills passed \nout of the House, more than the last five administrations; and 82 bills \nsigned by the President. There is progress for limited government and \nexpanded freedom.\n  President Trump has also restored trust in America as a beacon for \nfreedom with his strong friendship with Prime Minister Benjamin \nNetanyahu of Israel, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan, and President \nEmmanuel Macron of France. He has championed liberty with 50 Muslim \nnations in Saudi Arabia, with stunning tributes in Warsaw and with the \nNational Assembly in Seoul this week.\n  President Trump's success in creating jobs is clear with the Dow \nJones, achieving 50 new highs and soaring. Consumer confidence is at a \nrecord high, establishing 261,000 new jobs in October alone.\n  Mr. Speaker, in conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never \nforget September the 11th in the global war on terrorism.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. WILSON of South Carolina", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "187", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H9267", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "15", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "THANKFUL FOR CHANGE", "id": "CREC-2017-11-15-pt1-PgH9267-2", "title": "THANKFUL FOR CHANGE"}
