Mr. Speaker, today I rise to remember the life of Steven \nBerger, a loving son, brother, and father of three. Growing up in \nWisconsin, Steven was active in many sports. At 6'6\", Steven was a \nstandout basketball player in high school and later played in college.\n  Steven lived in Minnesota where he worked as a financial adviser and \nwas a loving father to his three children. His friends and family \ndescribe him as charismatic, full of energy, and larger than life--the \ntype of man who breathed life into every room.\n  He was also an avid fisherman and loved talking about stocks and \ncompetitive sports.\n  Steven traveled to the Route 91 Harvest music festival in Las Vegas \nwith friends to celebrate his 44th birthday.\n  Mr. Speaker, I would like to extend my condolences to Steven Berger's \nfamily and friends. Please know that the city of Las Vegas, the State \nof Nevada, and the whole country grieve with you.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. KIHUEN", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "187", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H9269", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "15", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "HONORING THE LIFE OF STEVEN BERGER", "id": "CREC-2017-11-15-pt1-PgH9269-4", "title": "HONORING THE LIFE OF STEVEN BERGER"}
