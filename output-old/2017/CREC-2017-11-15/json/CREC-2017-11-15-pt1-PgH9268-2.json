Mr. Speaker, today I rise to salute a brave, dedicated \nnurse of Ashe County, North Carolina, Mrs. Maggie McNeill.\n  Recently, the Fifth Congressional District of North Carolina \nexperienced torrential downpours and flooding, causing severe damage to \nmany residents and their property.\n  Mrs. McNeill, scheduled for her shift at Ashe Memorial Hospital, \nfound her car's path blocked by flood waters and a downed tree. \nUndeterred by this danger, Mrs. McNeill hiked on foot up a steep hill \nto her helpful father who gave her a ride to the hospital in time to \nhelp deliver two babies.\n  What a fantastic role model Mrs. McNeill is. She understood she was \nneeded, and she risked herself to get to her patients. She exemplifies \nthe best characteristics of Americans.\n  Mr. Speaker, I know I speak for many when I say that future \ngenerations of the Ashe County community are blessed by Mrs. McNeill's \ndedication to her calling.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Ms. FOXX", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "187", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H9268", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "15", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "HONORING MAGGIE McNEILL OF ASHE COUNTY", "id": "CREC-2017-11-15-pt1-PgH9268-2", "title": null}
