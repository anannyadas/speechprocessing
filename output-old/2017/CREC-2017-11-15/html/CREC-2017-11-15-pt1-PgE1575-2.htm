 INTRODUCING LEGISLATION TO UPDATE THE SELECTIVE SERVICE REGISTRATION 
                                 SYSTEM

                                 ______
                                 

                            HON. GWEN MOORE

                              of wisconsin

                    in the house of representatives

                      Wednesday, November 15, 2017

  Ms. MOORE. Mr. Speaker, I rise to introduce legislation to make a 
commonsense update to the Selective Service Registration system.
  As my colleagues know, our country has long recognized the moral 
dilemma faced by those with strong religious or moral grounds against 
serving in the military and engaging in war. As noted by the Supreme 
Court in Welsh vs. United States, there are many in our country ``whose 
consciences, spurred by deeply held moral, ethical, or religious 
beliefs, would give them no rest or peace if they allowed themselves to 
become a part of an instrument of war.''
  Historically, Congress has provided for alternative service or 
exemption from service for those whose scruples and conscience cannot 
allow them to participate in combat or in any form of military service.
  In today's all-volunteer military, those who have moral objections to 
participating in war can opt not to join the military. However, under 
the Universal Military Training and Service Act, all men between the 
ages of 18 and 26, including conscientious objectors, are still 
required to register for a national draft, should Congress authorize 
one.
  My bill would require that the Selective Service provide registrants, 
at the time of registration, with the option to indicate a desire to be 
classified as a conscientious objector.
  My bill would make clear that simply making that indication at 
registration does not bind the U.S. in any way and does not assure that 
the registrant will be so classified.
  Finally, the bill would allow the Selective Service system to also 
accept, at the time of registration, written statements in support of a 
conscientious exemption claim.
  I want to be clear that the legislation does not change current 
requirements for how such claims are handled. Under current law, those 
who pursue a conscientious exemption from military service during a 
draft can only put forward an actual claim, with supporting evidence, 
after they get an induction notice.
  Again Mr. Speaker, our nation has a history of recognizing, as noted 
by the Supreme Court in Gillette v. United States, ``the situation of 
conscientious objectors to war, who, absent special status, would be 
put to a hard choice between contravening imperatives of religion and 
conscience or suffering penalties.'' My bill simply tries to make the 
process of registering those objections more direct and 
straightforward.
