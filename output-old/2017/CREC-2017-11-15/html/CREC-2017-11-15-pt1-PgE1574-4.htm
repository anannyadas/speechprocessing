  Mr. KELLY of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, today I rise in memory of 
fallen Mississippi soldier Army Specialist (SPC) Jeremiah Joseph 
DiGiovanni who paid the ultimate sacrifice on November 15, 2003, during 
Operation Iraqi Freedom. SPC DiGiovanni was killed when two UH-60 Black 
Hawk helicopters collided in Mosul, Iraq. SPC DiGiovanni was among 17 
soldiers killed in the collision. SPC DiGiovanni was assigned to 4th 
Battalion, 101st Aviation Regiment, 101st Airborne Division (Air 
Assault), Fort Campbell, Kentucky.
  According to the Associated Press, SPC DiGiovanni, a Covington, 
Louisiana native, graduated from North Pike High School in Summit, 
Mississippi. He joined the Army in November 2000. He later received 
training for his job as a Black Hawk crew chief. Joe DiGiovanni, SPC 
DiGiovanni's father, said his son's job was very important to him. ``It 
was 250 miles an hour, pants on fire with both doors open,'' Mr. 
DiGiovanni said. ``He was a Black Hawk Crew Chief and he lived to get 
in that helicopter and fly.''
  Tonja Ludlam, a friend of SPC DiGiovanni, wrote a post about him on a 
memorial website. ``To all who knew DJ, we were touched deeply by a boy 
who grew to be a man before our eyes,'' Tonja wrote. ``He was so proud 
to wear the uniform, be the best soldier he could be, and so proud to 
serve our country. He studied hard to be a Crew Chief and do what he 
loved the most. I miss his smiles and the fun we had in the short time 
I knew him.''
  During his three years of service, SPC DiGiovanni was awarded the 
National Defense Service Medal, the Army Service Ribbon, the Basic 
Aviation Badge, and the Sharpshooter Qualification Badge.
  The funeral was held at Calvary Baptist Church in Pricedale 
Community, Mississippi, where SPC DiGiovanni was raised by his father 
and stepmother, Helen DiGiovanni.
  SPC DiGiovanni is survived by his father and stepmother, Joseph A. 
DiGiovanni and Helen DiGiovanni; his mother and stepfather, Laurie A. 
Brock and Kendall Brock; his six stepsisters, Brandy Blackwell, Misty 
Blackwell, Kaitlin Brock, Sarah Brock, Hannah Brock, and Elisabeth 
Brock; his three brothers, Brett Kennedy, Kendall Brock, and Noah 
Brock.
  SPC DiGiovanni's service and sacrifice to protect America will always 
be remembered.
