                    HONORING WASHINGTON PHOTO SAFARI

                                 ______
                                 

                       HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON

                      of the district of columbia

                    in the house of representatives

                      Wednesday, November 15, 2017

  Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to ask the House of 
Representatives to join me in recognizing the District of Columbia-
based Washington Photo Safari, which has just hosted the 35,000th 
participant in its amateur photographers training program.
  Founded by professional architectural photographer E. David Luria, 
Washington Photo Safari was the first community-based field photography 
training program in the country. With 11 instructors, the program 
provides more than 40 photography skill sets in 140 different venues 
throughout the District.
  Most of Washington Photo Safari's participants come from the D.C.-
area. The `participants' skill levels range from people who have just 
bought their first camera to seasoned professional photographers who 
value Mr. Luria's knowledge of when, where and how to capture the best 
images in the District.
  Averaging just six to seven participants per training session, the 
``photo safaris'' take place at some of the District's most iconic 
landmarks, including the National Mall, Washington National Cathedral, 
Franciscan Monastery of the Holy Land in America, Tidal Basin, Capitol 
Hill, Cathedral of St. Matthew the Apostle, Smithsonian National Zoo, 
National Gallery of Art and National Museum of American History.
  The Washington Photo Safari has received Trip Advisor's Certificate 
of Excellence Award for the past five years due to dozens of five-star 
reviews from its customers, solidifying its place on Trip Advisor's 
list of top 10 outdoor activities in the District. In addition, with 
its success, similar programs have been implemented in 20 other U.S. 
cities with guidance provided by Washington Photo Safari.
  Therefore, I ask the House of Representatives to join me in 
recognizing Washington Photo Safari for its achievements and 
contributions to the District of Columbia tourism industry, as well as 
for serving as a member organization of Destination DC, Cultural 
Tourism of DC and the National Cherry Blossom Festival.
