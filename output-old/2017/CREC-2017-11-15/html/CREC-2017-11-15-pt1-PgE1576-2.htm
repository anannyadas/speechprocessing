                INTRODUCING THE RECIDIVISM REDUCTION ACT

                                 ______
                                 

                           HON. ANDRE CARSON

                               of indiana

                    in the house of representatives

                      Wednesday, November 15, 2017

  Mr. CARSON of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge my 
colleagues to join me in cosponsoring the Recidivism Reduction Act to 
help streamline our Social Security system and reinstate fairness for 
ex-offenders who have served their time.
  The Recidivism Reduction Act will quickly restore federal disability 
benefits for eligible individuals after incarceration. Access to 
federal disability and health care benefits is a critical component of 
successful re-entry into the community when individuals are released 
from prison or jail, especially among the mentally ill.
  Typically, federal disability benefits are either suspended or 
terminated depending on the length of incarceration. However, upon 
release these benefits should be reinstated promptly to help provide 
access to essential treatment services and supports, housing and 
necessary income. Currently, due to barriers in federal law, it often 
takes several months to reinstate benefits. Addressing this delay will 
help foster successful transitions into the community and reduce the 
likelihood of recidivism.
  The bill does not grant individuals new benefits; rather it removes 
bureaucratic hurdles to ensure that individuals promptly receive the 
benefits to which they are entitled in order to break the cycle of 
recidivism.
  When individuals have prompt access to disability and medical 
benefits after incarceration, they are better equipped to transition 
successfully into the community, which would help reduce prison 
overcrowding and save taxpayer money. By cosponsoring the Recidivism 
Reduction Act, we can make the technical corrections to current law 
that will make a real difference.
