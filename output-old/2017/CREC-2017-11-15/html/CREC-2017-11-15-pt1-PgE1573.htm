 INTRODUCING A RESOLUTION RECOGNIZING CHILDREN OF INCARCERATED PARENTS

                                 ______
                                 

                           HON. ANDRE CARSON

                               of indiana

                    in the house of representatives

                      Wednesday, November 15, 2017

  Mr. CARSON of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge my 
colleagues to join me in cosponsoring a resolution recognizing the 
needs of children of incarcerated parents.
  The U.S. continues to lead the world in the rate of incarceration 
with over 2.3 million people behind bars. Not only does the system 
disproportionately impact the lives of low income families and 
minorities--it also hurts the goals of rehabilitation and breaking the 
cycle of violence in our communities.
  As Congress works to address the problems facing our criminal justice 
system, we should do so with more than just the offenders and ex-
offenders in mind. We need to raise awareness of the unique problems 
faced by children of incarcerated parents. When families are separated 
by the criminal justice system, it turns their whole world upside down. 
The family often loses a source of income and child care. Some children 
are forced to enter the foster care system. Without the proper 
resources and nurturing, these children are more likely to follow in 
the footsteps of their parents and face a life of crime themselves.
  Mr. Speaker, I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting this 
important resolution.
