                      Wednesday, November 15, 2017

  Mr. CLYBURN. Mr. Speaker, I rise to pay tribute to a great South 
Carolinian and accomplished educator who will celebrate her 100th 
birthday on November 22nd.
  Mrs. Rubie Ella Nixon Schumpert is the third of nine children born to 
Mr. Sumter Nixon and Mrs. Ella Bell Suber Nixon on November 22, 1917. 
She received her elementary education in South Carolina and Maryland, 
and her high school education at Harbison Institute in Irmo, South 
Carolina where she was class valedictorian.
  She attended Barber-Scotia and Benedict colleges and obtained her 
Masters of Education degree from South Carolina State College. She did 
further studies at Wake Forest University and the University of South 
Carolina. Mrs. Schumpert earned certification in six areas of study: 
Elementary Education, Social Studies, English, Mathematics, French and 
Counseling.
  Mrs. Schumpert began her professional career in Lexington County, 
South Carolina, where she served as an elementary and high school 
teacher, head teacher and elementary school principal. Later in her 
career, she worked in Richland County School District One at C.A. 
Johnson High School as a guidance counselor and was chair of the Math 
Department. While at C.A. Johnson, Mrs. Schumpert co-authored a 
mathematics textbook through a federal grant for non-college bound 
students through the University of South Carolina.
  She recorded television lessons for the U.S. military to help young 
soldiers achieve success in algebra courses. She also served on 
Southern Association of Colleges and Schools (SACS) committees 
evaluating schools across the state of South Carolina. Upon retiring 
from the District One School System, Mrs. Schumpert worked at Benedict 
College as a professor of mathematics for ten years. She has long been 
active in the community serving on numerous professional and civic 
organizations.
  Mrs. Schumpert was married to the late John Barton Schumpert, and 
they had two daughters, LaVerne S. (Alphonso) Bassard and LaMaris S. 
Mack. She also has four grandchildren and five great grandchildren.
  Mr. Speaker, I began my professional career as a classroom teacher in 
the public schools of South Carolina, and I have always revered the 
profession of educator, especially those at the grade school level. I 
am honored to pay tribute to this great educator, Mrs. Rubie Ella Nixon 
Schumpert and ask that you and my colleagues join me I wishing her a 
Happy 100th birthday.
