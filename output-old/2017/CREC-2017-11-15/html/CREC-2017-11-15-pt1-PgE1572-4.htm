                       HONORING JAMES HENRY FORD

                                 ______
                                 

                        HON. H. MORGAN GRIFFITH

                              of virginia

                    in the house of representatives

                      Wednesday, November 15, 2017

  Mr. GRIFFITH. Mr. Speaker, I would like to honor the life of James 
Henry Ford of Martinsville, Virginia. Jim passed away on October 28, 
2017. He was a fine man who always had the interests of his community 
at heart.
  Jim grew up in Martinsville and made his career practicing law there 
for 58 years after he studied at Roanoke College and the University of 
Virginia Law School. As an active member of the Martinsville and 
Virginia State Bar, he served two terms on the Virginia State Bar 
Council. I came to know Jim when we served together on the Blue Ridge 
Boy Scout Council, which covers 21 counties and nine cities in 
Virginia, in the 1980s and 90s. I greatly respected his contributions 
as well as his commitment; whenever the council met, he would drive 
over an hour from Martinsville to Roanoke. This level of dedication was 
typical of Jim, who found every venue he could to serve the community 
around him. Along with the Boy Scout Council, he served as president of 
the Martinsville Jaycees, the YMCA, and the Kiwanis. He helped found 
and later led the Piedmont Arts Association. As a lifetime member of 
Martinsville's First Presbyterian Church, he served variously as 
Deacon, Elder, and Clerk of Session. For many years he served as 
Chairman of the Martinsville Planning Commission and as Secretary of 
the United Fund of Martinsville and Henry County. He was also a member 
of the Board of Directors of the Patrick Henry Scholarship Fund.
  Jim garnered honors for his work with these organizations, including 
the Scout's Silver Beaver Award, the highest award a volunteer can 
receive at the council level, and the Jaycees' Distinguished Service 
Award. His service was a gift to the people of Martinsville and its 
surrounding communities. Our society counts on people like Jim, the men 
and women who dedicate their time, their resources, and their passion 
to the places they call home. They do so not in search of monetary gain 
or the acquisition of power, but out of a sense of duty to their 
community and joy in improving the lives of their fellow citizens.
  Jim is survived by his wife Sandra, his daughter Margaret, his son 
Martin, and his grandchildren Wesley, Sandra, Jimmy, and Charlotte. My 
thoughts are with them in this difficult time. The Martinsville/Henry 
County area is diminished by his passing, as we all are.
