Pennsylvania with his wife, Muriel Hart Hadley, and their children.
  He was an active volunteer in his retirement years and composed many 
memoirs of the B-24 Liberator pilots and crews for their families.
  He will be laid to rest with full military honors on November 16, 
2017 in Washington Crossing National Cemetery, Bucks County,
