                            HON. ADAM SMITH

                             of washington

                    in the house of representatives

                      Wednesday, November 15, 2017

  Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor and 
congratulate Dr. Jack Bermingham, the President of Highline College, on 
his retirement.
  Dr. Bermingham's academic career began in 1979, upon earning his 
Ph.D. in History from the University of California, Santa Barbara. 
After serving on the faculty of the University of the West Indies in 
Jamaica, he moved to Washington state where he later became the Dean of 
Social Sciences at Pacific Lutheran University. His career at Highline 
College began in 1994 when he joined the College's administration as 
Academic Vice President. His career at Highline progressed and he was 
appointed to serve as the college's President in 2006.
  During his tenure at Highline College, Dr. Bermingham fought to 
further education on many fronts. He expanded the College's 
collaborations with businesses, K-12 schools, four-year institutions, 
and local organizations in order to improve the community's access to 
education. Under his leadership, the college began offering four-year 
degree programs, among them the Bachelor of Applied Science in Cyber 
Security, which received regional, national, and international 
recognition. Dr. Bermingham also served on numerous boards and 
committees at the national and regional level.
  Dr. Bermingham has also been a leader in international education. He 
has presented at international conferences, including in Turkey, Hong 
Kong, and Botswana. He served as Chair of the Executive Committee of 
the Board of Community Colleges for International Development, which 
also recognized his outstanding work in international education in 
2005. That same year, he was also recognized by the Polytechnic of 
Namibia for his instrumental role in the success of that institution's 
international partnerships. Additionally, for the past seven years 
under Dr. Bermingham's presidency, Highline College has hosted the 
Pacific Rim Collegiate Cyber Defense Competition which attracts teams 
from international universities and institutions.
  Throughout his career, Dr. Bermingham has been an ardent champion of 
diversity and social justice. Highline College has become the most 
diverse higher education institution in Washington state. It is also a 
place where many immigrants and refugees begin their journey to achieve 
their academic and professional dreams. Highline College was awarded 
the Equity Award from the Association of Community College Trustees in 
2016, and for the last four years has been awarded the High Education 
Excellence in Diversity Award. Dr. Bermingham made it a priority for 
Highline College and their faculty to serve all students, regardless of 
color, creed, ethnicity, or economic situation.
  Dr. Bermingham's legacy is one of harmony, inclusion, and academic 
excellence. He has proven himself to be a tenacious leader, and has 
also shown to have the ability to connect with people through kindness 
and compassion. He will be greatly missed at the college by faculty, 
students, and the community.
  Mr. Speaker, it is with great pleasure that I congratulate Dr. Jack 
Bermingham on his twenty-three years of service at Highline College and 
wish him the very best in his retirement.
