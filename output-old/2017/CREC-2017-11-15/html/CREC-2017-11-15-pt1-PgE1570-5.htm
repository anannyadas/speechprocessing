 THANKING THE MEN AND WOMEN OF THE USS ``WASP,'' USS ``OAK HILL,'' AND 
                           USS ``KEARSARGE''

                                 ______
                                 

                            HON. GWEN MOORE

                              of wisconsin

                    in the house of representatives

                      Wednesday, November 15, 2017

  Ms. MOORE. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize those in our military who 
have worked tirelessly to help Americans in Puerto Rico and the Virgin 
Islands in the aftermath of Hurricanes Irma and Maria. Despite my 
continuing concerns about the dreadful federal response to the 
devastation in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, I know that the 
dedicated men and women of our military have been working day and night 
to help bring much needed relief to those in need.
  Without their help and aid, one can only imagine how much worse the 
situation would be now.

  In the last two weeks, the USS Wasp, the USS Oak Hill, and the USS 
Kearsarge have returned home or are in the process of returning home. 
In both Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, the sailors and Marines 
aboard these ships cleared roads to ease the flow of people and relief 
supplies, conducted search and rescue missions, helped deliver much 
needed supplies, and most of all, were a daily reminder to those they 
met that our country helps its citizens.
  Speaking to the high tempo at which these men and women were working, 
the Navy reports that during the 68-day period of its hurricane relief 
deployment, the Kearsarge ``conducted more amphibious and flight 
operations than would be completed in a routine six-month deployment.''
  And I would be remiss if I did not mention the invaluable 
contribution of National Guard personnel, including those impacted 
directly by the hurricanes, and those from all over the United States, 
including my home state of Wisconsin.
  I would urge the Defense Department, even as these ships return home, 
to continue to ensure that its considerable resources and assets remain 
available to help Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands in the trying 
weeks and months that still lay ahead. Our citizens in Puerto Rico and 
the Virgin Islands will need our help for many months to come and the 
military must continue to be a key part of that effort.
  And I also strongly encourage the Administration to quickly send a 
new disaster funding request that accurately reflects the proposals 
that affected communities, including Texas, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin 
Islands, have put forward outlining the federal aid they need to help 
communities rebuild better.
  Again, I salute the men and women in and out of uniform who have been 
and continue to help their fellow Americans during this deadly and 
devastating hurricane season. They are doing their part; now this 
Administration and Congress need to do ours in the coming weeks.

                          ____________________
