  Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize a medical professional 
who has done tremendous work in my district, Louis C. Rose, who this 
year will be honored at the Saint Joseph's Medical Center's Annual 
Ball.
  Louis is a native of the Bronx and a graduate of C.W. Post College. 
He received his medical degree at Rutgers Medical School and finished 
his residency in orthopedic surgery at New York Medical College. After 
becoming Board Certified in Orthopedic Surgery, he was invited to join 
the faculty in the Department of Orthopedic Surgery at NYMC.
  In 1999, Louis joined the staff at Westchester Medical Center where 
he accepted the position of Chief of the Department of Orthopedic 
Surgery at the Cornell affiliate hospital in the Bronx. There he served 
as Chief medical officer and Chairman of the Board, and he was also 
appointed to the Board of Trustees for the Presbyterian Hospital 
System. Currently, Louis serves as Chief of the Department of 
Orthopedic Surgery and Associate Director of the Department of Surgery 
at Saint Joseph's Medical Center.
  Louis has been very active in the community as well. He has organized 
many community health programs in the Bronx and his service has been 
recognized by a wide array of civic and health care leaders. Awards 
include the New York State Liberty Award, the highest award given to a 
civilian in the State of New York, the New York State Senatorial Award, 
and he has received a proclamation from the City of New York for all of 
his community work. Louis is also an appointed NYC Police Surgeon and 
has served on the Medical Advisory Board of the NYS Athletic 
Commission.
  In addition, Louis is the Founder and Executive Medical Director of 
Throgs Neck Multi Care, a comprehensive medical facility specializing 
in the treatment and care of all orthopedic trauma, injuries, and 
degenerative changes. He served as President of the Bronx Medical 
Society from June 2013 until May 2014 and is still an active member.
  As you can see, Saint Joseph's is privileged to have such an 
accomplished and outstanding physician as Dr. Louis Rose. He is most 
deserving of this recognition, and I wish to congratulate him on the 
honor.
