                     IN RECOGNITION OF RUSTY SELIX

                                 ______
                                 

                          HON. DORIS O. MATSUI

                             of california

                    in the house of representatives

                      Wednesday, November 15, 2017

  Ms. MATSUI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the leadership of 
Rusty Selix, whose outstanding advocacy and efforts on behalf of mental 
health have changed, improved and saved lives. Rusty has been a leading 
expert in mental health policy and finance for the past 30 years, and 
state and local government policy and finance for 40 years. His work 
has been focused on mental health since 1986, when he became the 
Executive Director and legislative representative of the California 
Council of Community Behavioral Health Agencies, a statewide 
association of non-profit, publicly funded mental health providers. He 
also served as the Executive Director of the Mental Health Association 
(Mental Health America) in California from 1993 until 2014 and has 
worked with every major mental health organization nationally and in 
California. He has served as Chair of the Policy Committee for the 
National Council for Behavioral Health and Mental Health America, 
helping to guide national mental health policy for many years. Rusty 
was the original co-author and leader, with Senator and now Mayor 
Darrell Steinberg, of the Proposition 63 Campaign--the November 2004 
California ballot measure which is transforming the state's public 
mental health system.
  Beyond his innumerable and far-reaching accomplishments, I honor 
Rusty for the spirit and manner in which he has achieved them. Rusty 
has been able to intuitively and adeptly reach out and bring together 
with a diversity of stakeholders in collaborative efforts to attain a 
united goal. Guided by an unwavering focus on mental health, Rusty 
combines a clear understanding of the ``big picture'' with a solid, 
grounded sense of what can be shifted or altered to achieve change. Be 
it legislative, financial or organizational Rusty can see the necessary 
steps ahead and present his position in a way that encompasses and 
appeals to the needs and interests of those who can impact their own 
systems to accommodate the proposed change. With an authentic, non-
defensive posture, Rusty is truly open to listening and learning about 
the others' concerns and able to skillfully propose feasible solutions 
to potential problems.
  Rusty's tireless work has always been about creating the change that 
can bring reality to his vision of improving lives and systems and not 
about self-aggrandizement. He acts with great integrity and, as such, 
is trusted for his honesty and his ability to follow through. 
Throughout our work together on mental health policy, he has always 
acted as an immediate, knowledgeable, and trusted resource.
  Mr. Speaker, I know many in the state government and the mental 
health and substance use disorders community will miss the work and 
presence of Rusty Selix as he takes a step back from his active role 
with CCCBHA and will serve as the Senior Policy Consultant for this 
organization for which he has done so much. He has been an incomparable 
force with a strong, solid voice. His legacy will live on for years to 
come and I'm pleased that he will continue to be a voice for behavioral 
health care providers and those that they serve in the great state of 
California.
