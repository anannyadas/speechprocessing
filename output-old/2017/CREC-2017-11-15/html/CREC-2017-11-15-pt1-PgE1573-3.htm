                    in the house of representatives

                      Wednesday, November 15, 2017

  Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I want to take a moment to acknowledge an 
individual who has been an invaluable asset to the Saint Joseph's 
Medical Center community, Mr. Michael McHugh.
  Mike, as he is better known, was born in Yonkers and graduated from 
Manhattan College where he received a degree in Civil Engineering. Upon 
graduation, Mike joined Moretech American Corp. where he remains to 
this day. At Moretech, Mike serves as the Executive Vice President and 
is directly responsible for the company's Safety Program in its 
Northern Regional Offices. He is also responsible for business 
development in New York City Metropolitan region. Moretech has worked 
on several big projections in the area, including the Second Avenue 
Subway, East Side Access, World Trade Center Recovery and Rebuilding, 
in addition to several projects for the Water Supply. Mike's activity 
on the construction industry also extends beyond Moretech. He serves as 
a trustee for The Moles in addition to several committees for the 
General Contractor's Association of New York.
  Mike joined the Board of Saint Joseph's Medical Center in June 2012. 
Since that time he has also served as member of the Board's Ball 
Committee and the Planning and Building Committee. And in June 2017 he 
became a member of the Personnel Committee of the Board. Mike's 
extensive knowledge and expertise in the construction industry has been 
a tremendous asset to Saint Joseph's for all the years he has served as 
a member of its Board of Trustees.
  In addition to serving on the Board of Saint Joseph's Medical Center, 
Mike is a member of the AOH and is currently President of the Friendly 
Sons of St. Patrick in Westchester County. He was also active in AYSO, 
CYO, and was President of the Little League when he was raising his 
family in Ardsley, another community I represent.
  This year, Saint Joseph's Medical Center is honoring Mike at their 
2017 Annual Ball with their 2017 Outstanding Service Award. They could 
not have picked a more deserving honoree. I want to congratulate Mike 
on receiving this well-deserved honor, and thank him for all he has 
done to service the community.
