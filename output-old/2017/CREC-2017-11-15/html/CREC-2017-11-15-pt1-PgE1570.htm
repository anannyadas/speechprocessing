                COMMENDING CHILD ADVOCATES OF FORT BEND

                                 ______
                                 

                            HON. PETE OLSON

                                of texas

                    in the house of representatives

                      Wednesday, November 15, 2017

  Mr. OLSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commend Child Advocates of 
Fort Bend for their continued commitment to helping foster children in 
Fort Bend County.
  Child Advocates of Fort Bend is the only program in the entire state 
of Texas that is able to match every single foster child with a 
volunteer Court Appointed Special Advocate (CASA). These CASA 
volunteers advocate for the ``best interests'' of children in foster 
care and ensure that their needs are met. Through their CASA program, 
Child Advocates of Fort Bend trains volunteers so that they can best 
serve as a voice for these children in the courtroom. The lives of 
these children and by extension our communities, are stronger thanks to 
the dedication of these committed volunteers at Child Advocates of Fort 
Bend. We thank them for their commitment to volunteering their time for 
children who truly need it.
  On behalf of the Twenty-Second Congressional District of Texas, 
congratulations to the Child Advocates of Fort Bend. I thank them again 
for their dedication to foster children in our Fort Bend community.

                          ____________________
