CONFERENCE REPORT ON H.R. 2810, NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR 
                            FISCAL YEAR 2018

                         HON. PETER A. DeFAZIO

                               of oregon

                    in the house of representatives

                       Tuesday, November 14, 2017

  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I will vote against the Conference Report 
for H.R. 2810, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 
(FY) 2018.
  The agreement includes several provisions that I strongly support, 
including giving servicemen and women a well-deserved raise of 2.4 
percent. Those who serve in uniform have made extraordinary sacrifices 
for our country and have earned and deserve a pay raise. The Conference 
Report also includes funding for Ukraine and Eastern Europe security 
initiatives to counter Russia's heightened military provocations and 
annexation of Crimea. Additionally, it includes a provision recognizing 
climate change as a direct threat to our national security interests.
  Despite these important initiatives, I have strong concerns with the 
Conference Report. The agreement authorizes more than $692.1 billion, 
which is $74.2 billion more than the FY 2017 authorized level and $26.4 
billion more than the president's request. This includes $65.7 billion 
to the Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) fund, an account which is 
not counted in the budget and is not paid for. It adds to the deficit 
and is used as a slush fund by the Pentagon.
  Unlike every other federal agency, the Department of Defense (DOD) 
refuses to complete a financial audit so taxpayers know how the biggest 
bureaucracy in the federal government spends their money. In fact, a 
shocking report released last December exposed $125 billion in 
administrative waste that the Pentagon tried to bury from being viewed 
by the public.
  The Conference Report also authorizes $13 billion for the F-35 
program, including 90 new planes, 20 more planes than the Trump 
Administration requested. While I strongly support a modernized 
military, I have serious concerns about the growing costs of the F-35 
program. The Pentagon has projected that the lifetime operating and 
sustainment costs for the F-35 fleet will total more than $1 trillion.
  I refuse to support increased bureaucratic waste at the expense of 
American taxpayers and our men and women in uniform. A more accountable 
and transparent department would ensure taxpayer dollars are directed 
towards the needs of our troops and the benefits they deserve, rather 
than buying unnecessary weapon systems, sustaining a Cold War era 
military force, and giving the president a blank check to fund wars 
Congress hasn't authorized.
  I have always advocated for maintaining Congress's constitutionally-
confirmed prerogative to declare war under the War Powers Act and 
limiting the President's authority to engage in armed conflict without 
the consent of Congress. I strongly oppose the NDAA's continued 
authorization of spending for wars that are not congressionally 
approved. The Pentagon uses the 2001 Authorization of Use of Military 
Force (AUMF) to continue to justify the more than 16 years our troops 
have been fighting in the Middle East. In his short time in office, 
President Trump has already sent troops to Afghanistan, Iraq, Niger, 
Syria, and elsewhere without seeking a new Authorization of Use of 
Military Force (AUMF), a violation of the War Powers Act.
  Additionally, the Conference Report prohibits the closing of 
Guantanamo Bay, which costs more than $100 million each year to house 
41 prisoners and has been used as a top recruiting tool by terrorists. 
Frankly, the prison at Guantanamo Bay has been a black eye for the 
United States, has eroded relationships with our allies, undermined 
U.S. missions abroad, and put U.S. citizens and our troops at risk of 
retaliation.
  Congress can make responsible cuts to our defense budget without 
jeopardizing the safety of our troops or undermining our national 
security. Fiscal responsibility and accountability at the Pentagon 
would allow for funds to be better spent supporting the basic needs of 
our troops, meeting our obligations to veterans of past wars, and 
ensuring our true defense needs are prioritized.
