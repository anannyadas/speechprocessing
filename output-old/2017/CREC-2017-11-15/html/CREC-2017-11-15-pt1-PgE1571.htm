          IN RECOGNITION OF PHOENIX FIRE ENGINE COMPANY NO. 2

                          HON. MATT CARTWRIGHT

                            of pennsylvania

                    in the house of representatives

                      Wednesday, November 15, 2017

  Mr. CARTWRIGHT. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the Phoenix Fire 
Company No. 2 of Pottsville, Pennsylvania. The fire company will be 
celebrating its 150th anniversary on November 25.
  The Phoenix Fire Company No. 2 originated from the Schuylkill 
Hydraulian Fire Company, which organized in April 1829 and was 
officially recognized the following year. This early company purchased 
a hand engine and was housed in Pottsville's original borough building. 
In 1861, a few days after the attack on Fort Sumter, the Schuylkill 
Hydraulian Company reformed into a military company called the Union 
Guards of Pottsville. They left for Harrisburg on April 24, 1861 and 
were greeted by Governor Andrew Curtin when they arrived.
  Management of Pottsville's fire apparatus was then left to the 
borough council. The Phoenix Fire Engine Company was established during 
reorganization meeting in September 1867. A hose carriage was 
purchased, and the company was headquartered at the corner of Centre 
and Norwegian Streets. In 1885, a cornerstone was set for a new fire 
house on East Norwegian Street, and this very house continues to serve 
as the station for the Phoenix Fire Company No. 2 today.
  The company operated with horse-drawn equipment until summer 1919. In 
July that year, an American La France truck with a seventy-five-foot 
aerial ladder was purchased for $18,000 and shipped to Pottsville. That 
truck saw extensive damage in 1925 when Phoenix Company responded to a 
major fire in Mechanicsville. After a six-month repair process, 
however, the engine was restored to working condition and served 
Pottsville well until 1939.
  It is an honor to recognize such a historic and distinguished fire 
company. I am grateful for the Phoenix Fire Company's 150 years of 
outstanding service to our community, and you can count me as a strong 
supporter for a successful future.
