                                 ______
                                 

                          HON. SCOTT R. TIPTON

                              of colorado

                    in the house of representatives

                      Wednesday, November 15, 2017

  Mr. TIPTON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Connect 
Charter School in Pueblo, Colorado, which was recently named a 2017 
National Blue Ribbon School by U.S. Department of Education Secretary 
Betsy DeVos.
  With this award, the Connect School has been recognized as one of the 
nation's highest performing educational institutions. Members of the 
Pueblo community know that this honor is well deserved. The dedication 
shown by the teachers, administrators, and school staff is 
extraordinary, and I know they have a profound impact on the lives of 
each student who attends Connect School.
  National Blue Ribbon Schools are among the nation's highest 
performing educational institutions, as measured by state assessments, 
nationally normed test scores, and graduation rates. Now in its 35th 
year, the National Blue Ribbon Schools Program has recognized over 
8,500 public and private elementary, middle and high schools. The 
Connect School should be proud of its inclusion in the 2017 award 
group, and I join the Pueblo community and entire state in offering my 
enthusiastic congratulations.
