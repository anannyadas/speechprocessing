                            VOTE EXPLANATION

  Mr. CRUZ. Mr. President, I was necessarily absent for the vote on 
confirmation of Executive Calendar No. 463, Mark T. Esper, of Virginia, 
to be Secretary of the Army, due to having to chair a Judiciary 
Committee hearing on judicial nominations for the U.S. Court of Appeals 
for the Fifth Circuit, the Eastern and Western Districts of Kentucky, 
and the District of Kansas. Had I been present, I would have voted yea.
  (At the request of Mr. Schumer, the following statement was ordered 
to be printed in the Record.)
