IN RECOGNITION OF AMANDA GRADY SEXTON FOR BEING AWARDED THE 2017 SANDRA 
      MATHESON AWARD FOR EXEMPLARY COMMITMENT TO VICTIMS OF CRIME

                                 ______
                                 

                           HON. ANN M. KUSTER

                            of new hampshire

                    in the house of representatives

                      Wednesday, November 15, 2017

  Ms. KUSTER of New Hampshire. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor 
Amanda Grady Sexton, the Director of Public Affairs for the New 
Hampshire Coalition Against Domestic and Sexual Violence, for receiving 
the 2017 Sandra Matheson Award for Exemplary Commitment to Victims of 
Crime.
  Amanda is incredibly deserving of this recognition; having worked 
tirelessly at the New Hampshire Coalition for 15 years to ensure 
protections for survivors of sexual assault in the Granite State. She 
led the effort in the state legislature to pass legislation that 
strengthens New Hampshire's Rape Shield Law and established critical 
protections for survivors of sexual violence. She has also supported 
other initiatives to extend the statute of limitations in cases of 
child sexual abuse and criminalized acts of human trafficking and 
domestic violence in state law.
  Though Amanda's voice is essential in New Hampshire, her advocacy 
extends beyond the Granite State. She regularly advises me and other 
members of the New Hampshire Congressional Delegation, and assisted 
Congress with the reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act and 
the passage of the Sexual Assault Survivors' Rights Act.
  Through her incredible work, Amanda has given hope and a voice to 
countless victims of crime in New Hampshire and nationwide, and has 
helped reduce the stigma associated with sexual assault.
  On behalf of New Hampshire's Second Congressional District and all 
those who have benefitted from Amanda's work, I thank her for 
everything she has done and will continue to do for our state, and 
congratulate her on this well-deserved recognition. I look forward to 
our continued work together to make New Hampshire be an even better 
place to live, work, and raise a family.

                          ____________________
