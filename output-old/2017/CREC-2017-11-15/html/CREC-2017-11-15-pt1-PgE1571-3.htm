  Mr. KELLY of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, today I rise in memory 
offallen Mississippi soldier Army Private First Class (PFC) Damian 
Laquasha Heidelberg who paid the ultimate sacrifice on November 15, 
2003, during Operation Iraqi Freedom. PFC Heidelberg was killed when 
two UH-60 Black Hawk helicopters collided in Mosul, Iraq. He served as 
an administrative specialist in the Army. PFC Heidelberg was assigned 
to 1st Battalion, 187th Infantry Regiment, 101st Airborne Division (Air 
Assault), Fort Campbell, Kentucky.
  According to the Associated Press, PFC Heidelberg, a Shubuta, 
Mississippi native, was a former choir member and church usher. He

was remembered by Staff Sergeant (SSG) Sylvester Watkins on a memorial 
website. ``I served with him in the TOC and he was always smiling and 
always spoke,'' SSG Watkins said. ``When I heard ofhis passing, I was 
home on mid-tour leave from Iraq. I felt bad because it wasn't me. That 
kind of trait found in Heidelberg is so hard to find, it must remain on 
earth. However, I realize his body planted in the ground is merely a 
seed which, after the winter, will blossom and show its wonderful 
colors. We will then know he is again among us. We love you, brother.''
  Phyllis Heidelberg, PFC Heidelberg's aunt, told the Associated Press 
that her nephew was a good man. ``He was a wonderful young man, sweet 
and mild mannered,'' Ms. Heidelberg said. ``He was slow to speak, loved 
to go to church, and always had a big smile.'' Jerry Jones, one of PFC 
Heidelberg's childhood friends, said of his determined work ethic. ``He 
told me that he was trying to make something of himself,'' Mr. Jones 
said. ``He was trying to make it for his family and his baby.''
  Prior to enlisting in the U.S. Army, PFC Heidelberg was a student in 
the auto mechanic program at the Finch-Henry Job Corps Center in 
Batesville. To this day, a plaque commemorating PFC Heidelberg's 
service is on display at the facility. Earlene Brewer, a career and 
technical training instructor, recently said PFC Heidelberg was a 
standout student. ``He was a good soul,'' Mrs. Brewer said. ``He was 
very friendly. His parents raised him right.''
  PFC Heidelberg is survived by his father, Grady Jones; his mother, 
Deborah Heidelberg; and his daughter, Stacie.
  PFC Heidelberg's service and sacrifice to protect America will not be 
forgotten.
