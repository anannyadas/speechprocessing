                                 ______

                    in the house of representatives

                      Wednesday, November 15, 2017

  Mr. KELLY of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, today I rise in memory of 
fallen Mississippi Marine Lance Corporal (LCpl) Roger Wayne Deeds who 
died while defending our great nation on November 16, 2005, during 
Operation Iraqi Freedom. LCpl Deeds was killed by enemy small arms fire 
while conducting combat operations against enemy forces during 
Operation Steel Curtain in Ubaydi, Iraq. Also killed were Lance 
Corporal (LCpl) John A. Lucente of Grass Valley, California, Corporal 
(CPL) Jeffrey A. Rogers of Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, and Corporal (CPL) 
Joshua J. Ware of Apache, Oklahoma. During the attack, LCpl Deeds moved 
forward under enemy fire and suppressed the enemy with machine gun 
fire. He then launched a recovery effort of his wounded comrades. He 
was providing first aid and security for the wounded when he was 
mortally wounded. This act of courage and selflessness earned him the 
Bronze Star Medal with Valor. LCpl Deeds was assigned to Battalion 
Landing Team 2nd Battalion, 1st Marine Regiment, 13th Marine 
Expeditionary Unit, I Marine Expeditionary Force (Forward), Camp 
Pendleton, California.
  LCpl Deeds was born into a military family and lived on a number of 
U.S. Air Force bases including Clark Air Force Base in the Philippines, 
Mather Air Force Base in California, Rhein Main Air Force Base in 
Germany, Holloman Air Force Base in New Mexico, and Keesler Air Force 
Base in Biloxi. LCpl Deeds graduated from Biloxi High School in 2000. 
It was there he met his future wife, Sarah French. They were married in 
February 2004. ``He's been my best friend for years. My everything,'' 
Sarah stated in an Associated Press news article.
  Joyce Deeds, LCpl Deeds' mother, said her son exemplified the Marine 
Corps motto which is ``Semper Fidelis,'' meaning always faithful. 
``They have a saying that no one is left behind,'' Mrs. Deeds said. 
``And that's how my son died. He was faithful to God, country, and 
family.'' Scott Deeds, LCpl Deeds' father, recently said that his son 
never saw a mountain he was not going to conquer and never backed down 
from a challenge, no matter how big. ``Roger followed a very long line 
of family members from his father, to uncles, cousins, grandfathers and 
great grandfathers, who served in every battle or conflict since the 
Civil War,'' Mr. Deeds said. ``Roger saw a calling in serving this 
great nation and he chose the Marines as he felt it was the best fit 
for himself and as he said, 'I want to be on the front line to provide 
protection for my brothers and freedom for those denied freedoms.' He 
will always be my mini-me. He was and will always be my son, my friend, 
my hero, and our Marine.''
  He was buried with full military honors at the Biloxi National 
Cemetery.
  LCpl Deeds is survived by his father, Scott Deeds; his mother, Joyce 
Deeds; his sister, Gina McKnight; his wife, Sarah Deeds; his son, 
Alaric Deeds; and his daughter, Mikaleigh Deeds.
  John 15:13 says, ``Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay 
down his life for his friends''. LCpl Deeds distinguished himself on 
the battlefield and in life. His service will always be remembered.
