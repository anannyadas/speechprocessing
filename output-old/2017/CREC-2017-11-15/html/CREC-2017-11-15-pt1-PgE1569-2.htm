                      Wednesday, November 15, 2017

  Mr. TIPTON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Mrs. Sharon Swerdfeger 
of Pueblo, Colorado and her lifelong commitment and work for Pueblo, 
Colorado and the business KR Swerdfeger Construction, Inc. she started 
with her husband, Keith.
  In 1968, Sharon and Keith went into business for themselves at the 
age of 21 after learning the construction trade from Keith's father. 
They had a loan co-signed by Sharon's father for $5,000 to purchase a 
backhoe and have some operating capital and began an excavation company 
specializing in water and sewer lines. From there, the company quickly 
expanded into natural gas distribution pipeline and telephone lines and 
has grown to a multi-million dollar business that has expanded 
throughout the Southwest United States. KR Swerdfeger Construction, 
Inc. will be celebrating 50 years in business in 2018.
  Ms. Swerdfeger is also very active in the Pueblo community with civic 
service and activism. She is the founder of the Pueblo chapter of The 
National Association of Women in Construction and is President, charter 
and emeritus member of the Pueblo South High School Alumni Foundation. 
Her involvement with other organizations includes the Pueblo YMCA, 
Pueblo Community College Foundation, Colorado Business Education 
Coalition, Parkview Hospital Foundation, the Boys and Girls Clubs of 
Pueblo County, St. Mary-Corwin Healthcare Foundation, the Sangre de 
Cristo Arts and Conference Center, Friends of the Library, Kiwanis Club 
and the Sangre de Cristo Arts and Conference Center.
  Mr. Speaker, Sharon Swerdfeger has been a tireless business leader 
and advocate for her hometown of Pueblo, Colorado. She is a dedicated 
mother, wife, business owner and a valued member of the Pueblo 
Community. It is my honor and privilege to recognize and honor her 
today.
