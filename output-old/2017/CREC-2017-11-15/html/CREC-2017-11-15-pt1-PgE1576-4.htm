                      Wednesday, November 15, 2017

  Mr. MARCHANT. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Barbara Bush 
Middle School located in the Valley Ranch area of Irving, Texas. This 
prestigious school was named after America's former First Lady, Barbara 
Bush, in honor of her commitment to public education and the good of 
all children. Barbara Bush Middle School opened its doors during the 
fall of 1998 as the sixth middle school in the Carrollton-Farmers 
Branch Independent School District. In 2010, the campus was authorized 
as an International Baccalaureate World School offering the Middle 
Years Program. This institution serves and celebrates a wonderfully 
diverse community and student body.
  As they soon celebrate their twenty year anniversary, Barbara Bush 
Middle School, home of the Broncos, has accrued numerous accolades in 
Academics, Fine Arts, Athletics, and individual accomplishments at both 
the local and state levels. Students participate and compete in a wide 
array of activities within the University Interscholastic League: 
orchestra, band, choir, theatre, basketball, cheerleading, football, 
track and field, volleyball, soccer, art, writing, oral reading, and 
spelling. The awards that the school has earned includes medals from 
the Special Olympics Competition in bowling and track and field, 
progression belts in the Kick Start Karate Program, and even the 
awarding of ``Ambassador of the Year'' by the Friends of Texas Public 
Schools to Principal Matthew Warnock in 2012.
  Barbara Bush Middle School is fortunate to receive significant and 
ongoing support from the community's civic organizations, churches, 
businesses and their own Parent-Teacher Association in the form of 
scholarships, grants, volunteer hours and donations. The school, on 
average, has about eighty students each year take part in a mentorship 
program made possible by local churches and Big Hope, as well as gifts 
of school supplies and other necessities often given to students by 
local businesses. To help foster global caring and responsibility, and 
to show appreciation for all that is done on behalf of the school, the 
Barbara Bush Middle School Broncos have enthusiastically contributed 
thousands of dollars and other items to numerous local, national and 
international charities such as: The Pulsera Project-Color the World, 
Limbs International, Operation Kindness, UNICEF, North Texas Food Bank, 
Metrocrest Services, American Heart Association, Children Cancer Fund, 
and victims of natural disasters such as Hurricanes Katrina and Harvey.

  The teachers, staff, and students of Barbara Bush Middle School 
constantly strive to honor the former First Lady's legacy, which is 
captured in their school's motto, ``It's a great day to be a Bronco at 
Barbara Bush Middle School where our number one goal is high 
achievement for each student!'' Mr. Speaker, I am honored to represent 
the fine members of Barbara Bush Middle School. I ask all my 
distinguished colleagues to join me in wishing the school continued 
success in all of its endeavors.
