                 HONORING HEBREW HOME 100TH ANNIVERSARY

                                 ______
                                 

                          HON. ELIOT L. ENGEL

                              of new york

                    in the house of representatives

                      Wednesday, November 15, 2017

  Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, it is a true privilege for me to honor one of 
the great institutions in my district, the Hebrew Home, which this year 
is celebrating its remarkable 100th Anniversary.
  Operated by RiverSpring Health, The Hebrew Home for the Aged's 
history dates back to 1917, when a group of civic minded individuals 
began providing shelter for poor, aging immigrants in a small synagogue 
in Harlem. As the needs of the community grew, so did the Hebrew Home. 
They expanded their reach by moving to a beautiful 32-acre campus in 
Riverdale, where they then became known as the Hebrew Home at 
Riverdale.
  From there, the Hebrew Home's services continued to expand. Today 
they offer many options to meet the evolving needs of older adults. In 
addition to their award winning nursing care, their care solutions 
include assisted living, independent living, rehabilitation services, 
care management, home care options, and specialized programs including 
elder abuse prevention. With a comprehensive and caring approach to 
healthy aging, the RiverSpring Health family of care solutions offers 
help and support to over 12,000 residents, patients, and members, 
empowering them to live the fullest lives they can each and every day.
  Of course, to meet its mission of helping older adults live full 
lives the Hebrew Home must maintain strong leadership. It starts at the 
top with Dan Reingold, the CEO and President of Hebrew Home, who has 
been instrumental in the Home's continued success and sterling 
reputation. Dan and his team have done tremendous work day after day 
and I am proud to call him a friend.
  As Congressman for the Northwest Bronx I am truly fortunate to have 
such a wonderful institution working with me as a partner in the 
community. With their countless years of expertise, a commitment to 
healthy aging, and compassion for our communities, the RiverSpring 
Health team has been dedicated to helping families live forward, every 
day. Congratulations to the entire Hebrew Home organization on 100 
years of exemplary service to the community.
