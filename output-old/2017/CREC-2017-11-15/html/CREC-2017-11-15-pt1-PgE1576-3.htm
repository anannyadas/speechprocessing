                    in the house of representatives

                      Wednesday, November 15, 2017

  Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, this year, the Hebrew Home at Riverdale is 
celebrating its incredible 100th anniversary, and on that special 
occasion they have chosen to honor two individuals who have given so 
much back to the community, Wendy and Jeff Maurer.
  For Wendy and Jeff, philanthropy comes from the heart and is an 
integral part of their lives. They have devoted their time and 
resources to a select group of meaningful not-for-profit organizations, 
focusing predominately on Jewish and health causes that truly make a 
difference in countless lives. Wendy and Jeff's ties to the Hebrew Home 
are strong and deep rooted. Jeff's great grandparents were among the 
initial families who founded the Hebrew Home in 1917; his grandparents 
and parents, and Wendy's parents were all residents at the Home. In 
1991 Jeff joined the Board of the Hebrew Home and became Chairman of 
the Board in 2004.
  Under Jeff's leadership, and in collaboration with the Home's 
executive management and Board, the Hebrew Home has expanded 
significantly, evolving into RiverSpring Health. The organization has 
grown from 1,000 older adults in its care, to 12,000 throughout New 
York City, continuing its great legacy.
  Wendy served as Sisterhood President and Board member of Temple 
Israel of Great Neck, and has held a number of roles with the Manhattan 
chapter of the UJA Federation, most recently as co-chair of 
Connections, an arm of women's philanthropy. She left teaching in 1975 
to raise their two children and to concentrate on the family's 
charitable interests, as well as to further her own education. She 
earned her Masters in Social Work in 1991.
  Wendy and Jeff have done so much for our community, and have helped 
countless individuals along the way. They are most deserving of this 
wonderful recognition from the Hebrew Home and I want to congratulate 
them both on this great honor.
