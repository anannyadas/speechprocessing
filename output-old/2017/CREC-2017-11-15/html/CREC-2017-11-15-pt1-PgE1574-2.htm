        HONORING THE 10TH ANNIVERSARY OF CAIR--MINNESOTA CHAPTER

                                 ______
                                 

                          HON. BETTY McCOLLUM

                              of minnesota

                    in the house of representatives

                      Wednesday, November 15, 2017

  Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to join Minnesota Muslims in 
recognizing the 10th anniversary on the founding of the Council on 
American-Islamic Relations--Minnesota Chapter (CAIR-MN). CAIR-MN is 
among the 35 Regional Offices and chapters across the United States 
that are working to enhance reinforce core American values by 
encouraging dialogue, promoting social justice, protecting civil 
liberties and fostering freedom of religion. CAIR-MN is to be commended 
for their advocacy work to advance civil rights and ensure that America 
remains a beacon of hope, freedom, opportunity and respect for people 
of all backgrounds.
  At a time when Muslim Americans and Muslim immigrants face 
unprecedented levels of intolerance and abject bigotry, the work of 
CAIR-MN is vital. Minnesotans treasure our diversity and the desire for 
open and meaningful dialogue as we work together to strengthen our 
communities. Our growing and vibrant Muslim community in Minnesota is 
an important part of the fabric of this country, and I am pleased that 
CAIR-MN is actively engaged with our local communities across our 
state.
  Mr. Speaker, it is an honor to represent Minnesota families of many 
cultures, ethnicities and faiths. CAIR-MN plays an important role in 
protecting our state's culture and tradition of respect for all. Please 
join me in recognizing CAIR-MN for 10 years of advocacy and dialogue on 
behalf of Minnesota Muslims.
