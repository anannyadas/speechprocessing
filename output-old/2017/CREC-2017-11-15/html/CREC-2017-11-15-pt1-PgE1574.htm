                      Wednesday, November 15, 2017

  Mr. PERRY. Mr. Speaker, today I extend my sincere congratulations to 
my constituent, Detective First Class Jeff Spence of the York City 
Police Department, upon his retirement after almost 30 years in law 
enforcement.
  I've long appreciated the commitment of people who devote themselves 
selflessly to serving our Nation and communities. After graduating from 
William Penn Senior High School in York, Pennsylvania, Mr. Spence 
served our Nation in the United States Air Force. He began his law 
enforcement career in the patrol division of the York City Police 
Department, where he was later promoted to Detective and later 
Detective First Class.
  Mr. Spence has earned countless awards and commendations for his 
service, including Police Officer of the Year by both the City of York 
and York County, as well as induction to the York City School District 
Hall of Fame. His peers describe a true professional whose tireless 
dedication, professionalism and sacrifice touched the lives of 
countless people and challenged all with whom he served to be the best. 
His legacy of service to our Nation and community sets the standard for 
all to follow.
  On behalf of Pennsylvania's. Fourth Congressional District, I thank 
and congratulate Jeff Spence on his service and wish him and his family 
great happiness and success in their future adventures.

                          ____________________
