                            FISCAL YEAR 2018

                                 ______
                                 

                               speech of

                        HON. JOHN H. RUTHERFORD

                               of florida

                    in the house of representatives

                       Tuesday, November 14, 2017

  Mr. RUTHERFORD. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the 
Conference Report to the FY18 National Defense Authorization Act. This 
legislation helps ensure that our men and women in uniform are equipped 
to carry out their national security mission.
  As the proud Representative of Naval Station Mayport--the East Coast 
homeport for Littoral Combat Ships--I commend the Committee for 
authorizing three more of these ships. The LCS platform currently 
provides a much-needed U.S. naval presence in global hotspots, 
especially in contested waters, and will do so for years to come. I 
would also like to commend them for allowing the Navy to make common-
sense changes to the routine and low skilled maintenance requirements 
and practices of our forward deployed Littoral Combat Ships.
  As the Navy and we in Congress work to be good stewards of taxpayer 
dollars while meeting the global threat, we must reevaluate our 
sustainment strategies so that LCS can be utilized to the fullest 
extent possible. However, I would like to express my strong belief that 
the more complex maintenance availabilities and modernizations still 
require the expertise, proficiency and experience of the U.S. ship 
repair industrial base. Without a strong industrial base, our assets 
and sailors would be unable to meet the requirements facing our Navy.
  I thank the Committee for including detailed reporting requirements 
and a two-year sunset so Congress can work closely with the Navy to 
balance the importance of the U.S. ship repair industrial base and the 
flexibility needed for the Littoral Combat Ships on extended 
deployments.
  This bill is a strong example of Congress's commitment to the LCS 
program and using taxpayer dollars wisely. I again thank the Chairman 
and the Committee for their hard work on this legislation
