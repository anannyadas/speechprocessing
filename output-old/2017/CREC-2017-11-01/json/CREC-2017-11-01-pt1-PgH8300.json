Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a leader in our \ncommunity who has received a great honor. Skip Dolan, the head boys \nbasketball coach for the Annandale Cardinals, was inducted into the \nMinnesota Basketball Coaches Hall of Fame in October. I am not going to \ngo through all of his statistics, although they are quite impressive.\n  I think it is important that we note that a good coach can have a \nmajor impact on a kid's life. Coaches don't just teach a game to our \nkids, they ingrain important life skills in their minds. They teach our \nkids how to work with others and how to act as a team. They teach our \nchildren the value of practice and perseverance, and they teach our \nkids how to compete with honor, dignity, and how to win with grace.\n  A good coach guides our kids along the road to success, which is why \nI am so happy that we have a coach like Skip Dolan in our community. We \ncan never thank him enough for working with and teaching our kids, and \nwe congratulate him on this incredible honor.\n\n\n                       A Retiring Public Servant\n", "turn": 1, "speaker": "Mr. EMMER", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "E000294", "text": "  Mr. EMMER.
