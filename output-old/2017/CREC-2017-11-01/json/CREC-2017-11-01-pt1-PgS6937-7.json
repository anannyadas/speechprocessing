Mr. President, yesterday, when the Senate confirmed \nthe nomination of Professor Amy Barrett to the Seventh Circuit Court of \nAppeals, we took another important step to ensure that the Federal \njudiciary fulfills its role in our constitutional system. Now we have \nan opportunity to confirm another well-qualified woman to the bench, \nMichigan Supreme Court Justice Joan Larsen. President Trump nominated \nher to serve on the Sixth Circuit, and she will be a strong addition to \nthat court and a benefit to our Nation.\n  After graduating first in her class from Northwestern's law school, \nJustice Larsen served as a law clerk for Judge David Sentelle of the DC \nCircuit Court and then for Justice Antonin Scalia. These clerkships \nhoned Justice Larsen's legal abilities and respect for\n\n\nthe rule of law, preparing her for a distinguished career.\n  Joan Larsen also served as the Deputy Assistant Attorney General in \nthe Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel. Former government \nofficials from both Republican and Democratic administrations wrote in \nstrong support of her nomination, each of them holding her in the \nhighest regard.\n  Joan Larsen later joined the law faculty at the University of \nMichigan, teaching there for many years. She excelled in academia, \nearning the praise of her students and the esteem of her colleagues. In \nfact, more than 30 of Michigan's deans and law professors wrote to \nsupport her nomination. They wrote that Justice Larsen's ``commitment \nto the rule of law and her capacity for top-flight legal analysis are \nboth of the first order, and her personal integrity and decency are \nexceptional.'' Even when they disagreed, her colleagues praised Justice \nLarsen's generous manner, her personal integrity, as well as her legal \nacumen.\n  In 2015, Larsen was appointed to the Michigan Supreme Court. The next \nyear, she won election to a full term, winning every single county in \nthe State. Her fellow justices--even those with different ideologies--\npraised her intellect and her commitment to apply the law as it is \nwritten to every case before them.\n  Joan Larsen's time on the Michigan high court has shown a record of \nindependence and of fairness. Here is how one practitioner put it in a \nletter to the Judiciary Committee: ``I am not a Republican,'' he wrote. \n``Justice Larsen approaches cases with an open mind and an independence \nfrom party affiliation. . . . I believe that . . . Justice Larsen has \nhad a very positive influence on the Michigan Supreme Court. In my \nview, she would be a deserving addition to the Sixth Circuit Court of \nAppeals.''\n  Another lawyer wrote the committee, advising that he ``has practiced \nlaw in Michigan for 39 years'' and is ``a past president of the \nMichigan Association for Justice (formerly the Michigan Trial Lawyers \nAssociation).'' He goes on to say that Justice Larsen ``has \ndemonstrated on the bench that she is precisely who she is in person, a \ngenuine, thoughtful individual who respects precedent, the common law \nand the role that lawyers and judges play in society. . . . I have no \nhesitation in telling you that Justice Larsen will make an excellent \njudge on the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals.''\n  In conclusion, President Trump continues to nominate smart, well-\nqualified, and impartial individuals to our Nation's Federal courts. \nJustice Larsen, like each of the other nominees before her, was \nnominated on the basis of her belief in the rule of law and her \ncommitment to apply the law fairly to everyone who enters her \ncourtroom.\n  Once again, I would also like to thank Chairman Chuck Grassley for \nhis leadership on the Judiciary Committee, tirelessly working to bring \nthe President's nominees to the floor.\n  I look forward to voting to confirm Joan Larsen today, and I urge all \nof my colleagues to join me.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. McCONNELL", "itemno": 0}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 1}], "header": {"chamber": "Senate", "num": "177", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "S6937-S6938", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "1", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "NOMINATION OF JOAN LARSEN", "id": "CREC-2017-11-01-pt1-PgS6937-7", "title": "NOMINATION OF JOAN LARSEN"}
