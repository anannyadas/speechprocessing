Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Mr. Albert O. \nOrta for his selfless service to our nation.\n   Albert Orta's extensive career began in 1947 after completion of his \nentry level training at Lackland Air Force Base as a member of the \nUnited States Air Force. There, he tracked and noted weather cycles. \nSoon thereafter, he was promoted to work on the base's radar and \ncommunication equipment as an electronics technician.\n   After his service with the United States Air Force, Mr. Orta \ncontinued to serve his country as an engineer with the United States \nDepartment of Defense at Lackland Air Force Base. His talents for \nengineering were well recognized and his responsibilities increased. \nEarly in his career, he found himself traveling to well over fifty \ncountries briefing Commanding Generals and U.S Embassy Ambassadors on \ncommunicative data and command post installation projects on behalf of \nthe United States Military. His missions took him to Europe, the \nPhilippines, Indo-China and to countries in Africa and South America, \njust to name a few.\n   Mr. Orta also worked on military aircraft as a radar engineer and \nfound himself assisting on the improvements and installation of radar \nsystems in the early B series military aircraft: B29, B36, B47 and B52. \nMr. Orta's work was so noted as a leader and accomplished engineer that \nhe was assigned to equipping and testing radar systems in the early F \nseries military aircraft: F84, F86A, F89, F102 and F106. His proud \naccomplishment was his role as the lead engineer in the development and \ninstallation of new radar technology for the United States Air Force's \nF102 Delta Dagger, a $6 million project at the time of his assignment.\n   Mr. Orta's outstanding accomplishments and his willingness to serve \nour nation faithfully and to the best of his abilities in all positions \nwas recognized by President Jimmy Carter and a host of Generals and \nAmbassadors acknowledging his incredible service to our nation through \nhis work with the U.S. Department of Defense.\n   Albert Orta and Mary Louise Guerrero married in June of 1949 and are \nblessed with 12 children, 31 grandchildren, and 29 great-grandchildren. \nThroughout his career and travels he recognized that sharing stories of \nhis travels were important life lessons. There is no greater devotion \nof a father who returned home from a mission to share the experiences \nhe encountered of a different life, different culture and hardships to \nemphasize the importance of hard work, the importance of quality \neducation, to learn to be resilient and to appreciate the freedoms we \nenjoy today. He stands proud that his children and grandchildren are \nsuccessful in their own professional careers; some educators, leaders \nin the private industries, medical field, financial advisors, some with \na heart for public service and some who proudly served our country in \nthe military.\n   Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues in the United States House of \nRepresentatives to join me in honoring Albert O. Orta for his \ndistinguished career and his proud service to our country; and to Mary \nLouise Orta for her service in standing alongside her husband, \nsupporting him and their family throughout his missions.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. GARAMENDI", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 3}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "177", "extension": true, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "E1478", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "1", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "A LIFE WELL-LOVED IS A LIFE WELL LIVED", "id": "CREC-2017-11-01-pt1-PgE1478-2", "title": "A LIFE WELL-LOVED IS A LIFE WELL LIVED"}
