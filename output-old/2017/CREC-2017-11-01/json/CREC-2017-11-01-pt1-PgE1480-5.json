CONNOLLY\n\n                              of virginia\n\n                    in the house of representatives\n\n                      Wednesday, November 1, 2017\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "C001078", "text": "  Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize someone who has had a \nprofound impact on the Northern Virginia community, Ms. Mary Beth Coya. \nI have been proud to partner with Mary Beth on many issues of \nimportance to the residents of Northern Virginia and the quality of \nlife we enjoy, and I consider her a good friend. This year marks 30 \nyears since Mary Beth Coya began her career with the Northern Virginia \nAssociation of Realtors (NVAR), beginning in 1987 as a Legislative \nAssistant. During her career, she has steadily advanced and currently \nserves as the Senior Vice President of Government and Public Affairs \nfor NVAR.\n   Prior to joining NVAR, Mary Beth began her career as a staff member \nwith the Virginia House of Delegates Appropriations Committee in \nRichmond. From there she took her passion for advocacy to the private \nsector, where she lobbied at both the state and federal levels for a \nvariety of associations and companies. Throughout her career, Mary Beth \nhas used her knowledge and experience to advocate for policies that \nwould improve the lives of the members of her community. This has \nperhaps most been felt in the area of transportation, where she serves \nas a member of the Board of Directors for the Northern Virginia \nTransportation Alliance (NVTA), a business-citizen coalition focused on \nadvancing highway and transit projects of major importance to the \nregion.\n\n\n   I have worked with Mary Beth and the NVTA on efforts to construct \nthe Silver Line Metrorail extension and the establishment of the \nVirginia Railway Express commuter rail system. In fact, NVTA was the \nfirst private sector organization to call for a dedicated funding \nsource for Metro, which is a goal that I share.\n   Mary Beth's career with NVAR and her role as a Board Member for the \nNorthern Virginia Transportation Alliance are inextricably intertwined. \nAt NVAR, she has been an experienced and expert advocate for the \nadvancement of major legislation in the Commonwealth of Virginia. She \nwas instrumental in obtaining dedicated regional and statewide \ntransportation funding and has a passion for protecting the real estate \nindustry. Due to her strong relationships with elected leaders at all \nlevels of government and her extensive historical knowledge of the \nregion, she has been an effective voice in ensuring that Northern \nVirginia remains one of the best places in the country in which to \nlive, work, play, and raise a family.\n   Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating Mary \nBeth Coya on the occasion of her 30th Anniversary with the Northern \nVirginia Association of Realtors and in commending her for her \ndedication to the betterment of our region. I am pleased to have had \nthe opportunity to partner with her and NVAR on numerous issues and I \nlook forward to continuing to work with her going forward.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. CONNOLLY", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 3}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "177", "extension": true, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "E1480-E1481", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "1", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "RECOGNIZING MARY BETH COYA", "id": "CREC-2017-11-01-pt1-PgE1480-5", "title": "RECOGNIZING MARY BETH COYA"}
