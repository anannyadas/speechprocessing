Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition \nof the American Museum of Tort Law, located in Winsted, CT, which \ncelebrated its second anniversary on September 25, 2017. In honor of \nits history and continued importance as a national educational \ninstitution, I would like to commemorate the museum and celebrate this \nmilestone.\n   Since its founding by Ralph Nader, the American Museum of Tort Law \nhas attracted national acclaim from media outlets including Politico, \nthe New Yorker, the Boston Globe and the Washington Post. Its vital \nimportance to our citizenry has been recognized by former Supreme Court \nJustice Sandra Day O'Connor. Thousands of people have attended the \nmuseum and have come away educated, entertained, and impressed by its \npresentation.\n   The mission of this unique institution is to educate, inform, and \ninspire Americans about their legal system, with a focus on the right \nof trial by jury and the benefits of tort law. Through school group \nvisits, self-guided tours, quality curated programing, and its website, \nthe museum has shown true dedication towards the fostering of greater \ncivic knowledge and awareness.\n   Moving forward, the museum has an ambitious plan to expand, \nincluding not just on-site operations, but broadening its reach by \ntraveling across the country and becoming a resource for practitioners, \njudges, and legal scholars.\n   I have thoroughly enjoyed the opportunity to personally visit the \nAmerican Museum of Tort Law. As a former history teacher, I can attest \nto the tremendous value this museum provides through the details and \nhistorical context that brings to life the law and justice. Tort law \nhas improved the lives of so many and this museum tells that story.\n   I am proud to have such an exciting and important institution \nlocated in my district. Congratulations to the American Museum of Tort \nLaw on celebrating its second anniversary. May it continue to educate \nand inspire for generations to come.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. LARSON of Connecticut", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 3}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "177", "extension": true, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "E1475", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "1", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "RECOGNIZING THE AMERICAN MUSEUM OF TORT LAW'S SECOND ANNIVERSARY", "id": "CREC-2017-11-01-pt1-PgE1475-2", "title": "RECOGNIZING THE AMERICAN MUSEUM OF TORT LAW'S SECOND ANNIVERSARY"}
