But \ntoday we are thinking of everyone affected by this tragedy. We are \npraying for the victims and their families. We are thinking of our \nfellow Americans in New York. We are expressing our gratitude for the \ncritical work of our first responders. To them we say: Thank you for \nyour courage. Thank you for all you do, especially in the face of such \na terrible tragedy like we witnessed yesterday.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. McCONNELL", "itemno": 0}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 1}], "header": {"chamber": "Senate", "num": "177", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "S6937", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "1", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "NEW YORK CITY TERROR ATTACK", "id": "CREC-2017-11-01-pt1-PgS6937-5", "title": "NEW YORK CITY TERROR ATTACK"}
