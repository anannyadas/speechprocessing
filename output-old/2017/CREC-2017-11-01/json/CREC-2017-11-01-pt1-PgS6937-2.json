Lord, on this All Saints' Day, we remember the \nunseen cloud of witnesses that surrounds us. We are grateful for all \nthe saints who from their labors rest but whose works follow them.\n  We thank You for the many lawmakers in our history whose integrity, \ncreativity, and diligence have helped to keep us free.\n  Lord, we praise You for all of Your gifts, the glimpses of beauty, \nthe echoes of truth, and the kindness of friends. Thank You for all \nthose who lived and died for freedom. Grant us in our day and \ngeneration to live to honor our noble heritage.\n  And Lord, please remember all of those affected by the violence in \nNew York. Bring a speedy recovery to the injured.\n  We pray in Your merciful Name. Amen.\n", "kind": "Unknown", "speaker": "Unknown", "itemno": 0, "turn": -1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 1}], "header": {"chamber": "Senate", "num": "177", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "S6937", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "1", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "PRAYER", "id": "CREC-2017-11-01-pt1-PgS6937-2", "title": "PRAYER"}
