Mr. Speaker, Sergio Jose Martinez was trolling a \nparking garage in sanctuary city Portland, Oregon, armed with a knife. \nHe set his sights on his prey, a defenseless 65-year-old woman, and he \nattacked her.\n  But the woman fought back and pressed the panic button in her car. \nMartinez, the coward, fled the scene, but he was caught. Get this, Mr. \nSpeaker: Martinez, after serving several stints in U.S. penitentiaries, \nhas been deported over 20 times. But the criminal does his time, gets \ndeported, and just comes back into the United States.\n  Our border protectors do the best they can, but they are outmanned, \noutgunned, and outfinanced by the drug cartels, criminal gangs, and \noutlaws trying to enter the United States.\n  The Border Security for America Act authorizes a border wall, both \nphysical and virtual, puts more boots on the ground, more boats in the \nwater, and gives more equipment to our law enforcement.\n  We must keep criminals like Martinez out of the United States.\n  And that is just the way it is.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. POE of Texas", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "177", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H8368-H8369", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "1", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "STOP HABITUAL ILLEGAL BORDER CROSSERS", "id": "CREC-2017-11-01-pt1-PgH8368-3", "title": "STOP HABITUAL ILLEGAL BORDER CROSSERS"}
