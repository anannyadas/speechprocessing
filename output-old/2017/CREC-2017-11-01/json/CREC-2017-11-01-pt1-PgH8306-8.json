Mr. Speaker, cruelty to animals is a scourge, and there \nis no worse example than animal fighting that is for so-called pleasure \nand definite profit.\n  I am pleased today to introduce the Parity in Animal Cruelty \nEnforcement Act, which is to close a loophole.\n  Animal fighting is prohibited in the United States, but it is allowed \nin some U.S. territories. This is important for us because what we have \nis a situation where animals are manipulated, drugged, and put into \nsituations where their aggression is heightened. It is disgusting.\n\n\n  I am pleased to join with friends on the other side of the aisle--\nMessrs. Blumenauer and Nolan--and Representatives on the Republican \nside--Messrs. Rodney Davis, Yoder, and Knight--to come together on a \nbipartisan basis to address this trouble. I ask for cosponsors.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. ROSKAM", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "177", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H8306-H8307", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "1", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "CRUELTY TO ANIMALS", "id": "CREC-2017-11-01-pt1-PgH8306-8", "title": "CRUELTY TO ANIMALS"}
