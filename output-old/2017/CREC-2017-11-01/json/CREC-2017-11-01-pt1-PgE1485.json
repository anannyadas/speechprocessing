Mr. Speaker, I rise today to ask the United States \nHouse of Representatives to join me in recognizing Meredith Corey-\nDisch, a leader and business owner in my district, who was a recipient \nof a spot at the James Beard Foundation's Inaugural Class of the \nWomen's Entrepreneurial Leadership Fellowship program. This program, \nhosted at the prestigious Babson College, aims to help female chefs and \nowners grow their businesses by cultivating women's leadership in the \nculinary industry.\n   Meredith Corey-Disch and her business partner, Sarah Bogdanovitch, \nare exceptional entrepreneurs. Their business was founded on the belief \nthat it should be local, community focused space that provides organic, \ntraditional foods with shared work and fair pay. ``Community Loaves'' \nbegan in 2011 in Jacksonville, as an organic bike-delivered \nsubscription bakery. The pair then opened a bread shop in 2014, where \nthey served all-organic bread and pastries for breakfast and lunch. \nThey kept the business community focused by holding special pizza \nnights and farm to table dinners in their garden and invited \nsurrounding neighbors to these events.\n   Meredith began her love of bread making through an apprenticeship in \na bakery, while brainstorming ways she could start a business people \nwould enjoy back in her hometown of Jacksonville. She can be described \nas thoughtful, kind, generous, and creative. With these skills, along \nwith her passion of bread making, Meredith will continue to spread her \npassion throughout Northeast Florida. We need more creative small \nbusiness owners like Meredith. She has been a true example of \nleadership for women in Northeast Florida and I look forward to seeing \nher future culinary successes.\n   Mr. Speaker, I applaud Meredith Corey-Disch for her leadership in \nnot only the culinary community, but in Northeast Florida as well.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. RUTHERFORD", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 3}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "177", "extension": true, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "E1485", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "1", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "HONORING THE ENTREPRENEURIAL SPIRIT OF MEREDITH COREY-DISCH, OWNER OF COMMUNITY LOAVES", "id": "CREC-2017-11-01-pt1-PgE1485", "title": "HONORING THE ENTREPRENEURIAL SPIRIT OF MEREDITH COREY-DISCH, OWNER OF  COMMUNITY LOAVES"}
