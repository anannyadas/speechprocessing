Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, small businesses, entrepreneurs, and emerging companies \nare what drive the American economy. We meet them in our districts and \nsee firsthand the benefits that their dreams, their innovations, and \ntheir hard work provide to our constituents and to our communities.\n  These innovators, entrepreneurs, and risk takers are critical to our \ncountry's economic growth and prosperity. In fact, small businesses are \nresponsible for more than 60 percent of the Nation's net new jobs over \nthe past two decades. Sixty percent of all of the new jobs over the \npast two decades come from these small emerging companies.\n  Their ability to raise capital in the private markets is critical to \nthe economic well-being of the United States.\n  So if our Nation is going to have an economy that provides \nopportunities for every American, then we must promote and encourage \nthe success and growth of our small businesses and our startups. It is \nthis notion that brings us to this legislation that we are discussing \ntoday.\n  Under current law, accredited investors are allowed to purchase \nsecurities that haven't been registered with the Securities and \nExchange Commission. These types of offerings carry more risks than \npublic offerings. The thought is that individuals with enough financial \nsophistication or net worth can bear the potential losses that may be \nassociated with these types of securities.\n  How the law works today is that this definition of an accredited \ninvestor is solely based on wealth.\n  The ability to participate in a private offering should not be \nlimited to individuals that pass some type of Federal Government assets \ntest. Instead, the ability to participate should be expanded to include \nall individuals who demonstrate that they have sufficient understanding \nof the offering. That may be a doctor who has gone through the training \nand has an idea that a new piece of equipment might work for them; or a \nscientist who has done research in the lab who says: You know what, \nthis makes sense to me, and they understand the risk that they are \nentering into.\n  Well, H.R. 1585, the Fair Investment Opportunities for Professional \nExperts Act, introduced by Representative Schweikert and Representative \nHill, will expand the definition of an accredited investor in a way \nthat will appropriately increase the pool of potential investors, \nthereby providing additional investment opportunities for more \nAmericans and enabling the businesses they invest in to create more \njobs.\n  The expansion of the accredited investor definition will enhance the \nability of many companies, particularly small and emerging companies \nand businesses, to raise capital and grow by increasing the pool of \npotential investors. These are investors, again, that are very \nknowledgeable about that particular area.\n  This will both provide greater investment opportunities for more \nAmericans and will enable these businesses to begin investing to create \nmore jobs.\n  H.R. 1585 is a bipartisan bill that will help create jobs and a \nhealthier economy. The bill provides Americans with more investment \nopportunities and enhances small companies' ability to raise capital.\n  This legislation overwhelmingly passed the Financial Services \nCommittee by a bipartisan vote of 58-2, and I urge all of my colleagues \nto vote ``yes'' on this particular bill today.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.", "turn": 4, "speaker": "Mr. HUIZENGA", "itemno": 10}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "F000454", "text": "  Mr. FOSTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1585. This bill will \nexpand the definition of accredited investor, a status reserved for \ninvestors who possess the sophistication and financial means necessary \nto invest in private securities offerings.\n  Currently, accredited investors are limited to persons who have an \nannual income more than $200,000, or $300,000 together with a spouse, \nor a net worth in excess of $1 million, excluding a primary residence.\n  Aside from the primary residence exclusion added by the Dodd-Frank \nAct, the accredited investor definition has not been updated since \n1982.\n  In light of the growth of private markets and increasing complexity, \nthe SEC's Investor Advisory Committee recommended that the SEC conduct \nadditional study of adjusting the current thresholds for inflation and \nestablishing alternatives based on existing credentials, investment \nexperience, and limits of investments.\n  An updated definition is long overdue. Current law speaks almost \nexclusively to the ability to bear a loss rather than the \nsophistication of the investor.\n  The bill we consider today is the product of bipartisan compromise. \nLast Congress, it was significantly narrowed to include only persons \nwho qualify based on current income and net worth tests: registered \nbrokers, and investment advisers, and those who have the appropriate \neducational background and job experience as determined by the SEC and \nverified by FINRA.\n  These categories are in line with the recommendations of the Investor \nAdvisory Committee and effective proxies for sophistication, access to \ninformation, and ability to withstand losses.\n  There is an inherent tension between democratizing markets and \nprotecting investors on the basis of their ability to bear financial \nlosses.\n\n  This bill includes Ranking Member Waters' bipartisan amendment to \nrequire the SEC to adjust net worth and income thresholds for inflation \nevery 5 years. This will establish the economic value of the thresholds \nin current law, as the dollar amounts are increased, with growth in the \noverall economy and changes in the value of the dollar.\n  Doing so will preserve access to private markets for those currently \ninvesting in them. Private offerings can offer some of the best returns \nin the market, but they obviously carry different risks, like \nilliquidity, than securities in the public markets.\n  While there can be investment opportunities that significantly \nincrease a person's net worth, they cannot be immediately sold if an \ninvestor's financial circumstances change.\n  So this bill strikes a good compromise between giving access to \ninvestments without exposing the retirement accounts of working \nfamilies to excessive risks.\n\n\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge broad support for the bill today, and I reserve \nthe balance of my time.", "turn": 5, "speaker": "Mr. FOSTER", "itemno": 11}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "H001058", "text": "  Mr. HUIZENGA.

Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Huizenga for yielding \nme time.\n  A little bit of history: this piece of legislation, the underlying \nidea, actually was fostered a few years ago. One of my closest friends \nin Arizona, Lakshmi, is freaky smart, electrical engineer, off the \ncharts IQ. He and I were having a conversation about a company that he \nwas really interested in that had been started by a handful of his old \nfriends.\n  Well, it turns out his old friends had gone through all this process, \nand he had just sort of been watching what they were doing.\n  Now, Lakshmi is an absolute expert on the technology that these \ngentlemen are putting together, but because of a series of timing and \nother things, he was walled off from investing in a company that was \nusing a technology he was an absolute expert in, because he didn't meet \nthe accredited investor standards. He didn't have the million dollars \nin the bank.\n  His argument to me was, should his knowledge on a company and its \nproduct, their risk profile, its opportunity to succeed and its \npotential failure in the marketplace be based on his bank account, or \nshould it be based on his knowledge?\n  Now, the legislation has gone through a couple generations of \ncompromise. I personally preferred the original bill, a bit more \nexpansive, but this is a good thing, because for our brothers and \nsisters on both sides of the aisle here, I think we are embracing this \nconcept that we all care about the curve where we are seeing the \nwealthy getting wealthier in the United States and much of our \nhardworking middle holding sort of flat.\n  This is one of the reasons: we have created these definitions where \naccredited investors, I think only, like, 600-some-thousand people, \nhave gone through the process to hold that designation in our society, \nmeaning it is a tiny sliver of our society that is allowed to invest in \nthese types of businesses.\n  We have a bureaucracy that for how many years now the regulator has \nsaid: Your ability to invest in these types of organizations is based \non your bank account.\n  Today, we take the sort of first step on a bipartisan basis to say: \nYes, bank account is one, but how about your risk tolerance, your \nknowledge, your expertise, and your understanding that many of these \nfail, and many of these businesses become amazing successes, but are \nyou able to process both the technology, the risk, and the information?\n  For many of us, we are hoping that the opportunity to be part of the \ninvestor class starts to become much more egalitarian across our \nsociety instead of just being the hallmark of the ultrawealthy in our \ncountry.\n  Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Huizenga for giving me a moment and for \nmoving this bill forward.", "turn": 7, "speaker": "Mr. SCHWEIKERT", "itemno": 13}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "F000454", "text": "  Mr. FOSTER.

That is going to help companies looking to grow, \ncompanies looking to add jobs.\n  At the same time, it provides an investment opportunity, one with \ngreater upside and more risk, to those previously locked out of the \nprivate placement market. This includes many educated young Americans \nwho have not yet had time to grow their pocketbooks but do have the \nexpertise in these areas.\n  Mr. Speaker, in closing, I have seen firsthand that the \nentrepreneurial spirit is certainly alive and well in California and \nall across this country, and this bill before us today ensures that \nmore Americans can participate in both the risk and reward of the \nstartup economy.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support passage of H.R. \n1585.", "turn": 10, "speaker": "Mr. ROYCE of California", "itemno": 16}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "H001058", "text": "  Mr. HUIZENGA.

Mr. Speaker, H.R. 1585 does one of the things that most \nof us came to Congress to do: solve problems and change laws.\n  The current law excludes most of America from participating in one of \nthe most dynamic parts of our economy, which is private placement \ninvestment into small startup companies or, sometimes, very big \ncompanies but they are not yet publicly traded. There are opportunities \nall over to do this, but there are only a small number of Americans who \ncan make the investment.\n  For many smaller companies, they are faced with a dilemma. One option \nis no option. They may not have the network of prospective high net \nworth, accredited investors who can take a look at the kind of capital \nthat would help that company become a thriving larger company, that \nwould help grow the companies that drive the growth in our economy.\n  As investors, there are people who work in the investment industry \nwho are doing the underwriting--charter financial analysts, for \nexample. Whether they are working for a private equity group, they are \ndoing the work but don't yet have the high net worth. They have true \ndomain expertise.\n  Imagine the skilled labor who is actually doing the technology \nimplementation, who knows exactly everything that it would take in a \nprogram to make a program be the winner in the marketplace but is also \nwell informed on the rest of the risks, has been well educated on the \nmarket, and he is prevented from participating.\n  This act is a step in the right direction. I hope we can accomplish \nmore together.
