Mr. Speaker, I wish to highlight the Step Forward \nto Cure TSC Miami Walk, which took place last weekend at my alma mater, \nFlorida International University. Tuberous sclerosis complex, or TSC, \nis a rare genetic disease that causes uncontrollable tumor growth \nacross the face, body, and organs of impacted individuals.\n  Unfortunately, there is no cure for TSC. South Florida's own hero, \nMax Lucca, pictured here, was diagnosed with TSC when he was only 2 \nweeks old. Now, he is 9 years old, and he has thrived because of the \nconstant love and care provided by his parents, Vanessa and Max. The \nTSC Miami Walk brings together patients like Max Lucca and their \nfamilies with supporters who are committed to improving their lives.\n  Every year, the walk plays an essential role in advancing lifesaving \nresearch and programs to increase awareness of TSC, and expanding the \nnetwork of resources that improve the lives of patients and their \nfamilies.\n  Mr. Speaker, I would like to recognize the work of Vanessa Vazquez; \nher husband, Max; and all of the other activists who are so needed from \nthe Tuberous Sclerosis Alliance who work so hard to make this walk a \nreality.\n  I want to thank everyone who came out to FIU last Saturday and made \nthis event a resounding success. Due to your efforts, due to your \ncommitment, I am confident that we will be able to increase the \nresearch and education needed to find a cure for this tragic disease.\n  Meanwhile, go Max Lucca.\n\n\n             Commit to Ending Pediatric HIV/AIDS Worldwide\n", "turn": 1, "speaker": "Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "R000435", "text": "  Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I would like to encourage my \ncolleagues to support H. Res. 593, a bipartisan resolution reaffirming \nour national commitment to ending pediatric HIV/AIDS worldwide.\n  It is a resolution that I introduced with my friend, Congresswoman \nBarbara Lee. The fight against pediatric AIDS is a great example of how \nour country is a positive and transformative force in the lives of many \nacross the world. Because of our leadership here in the United States \nover the past 12 years, there has been a 62 percent increase in the \nnumber of women receiving mother-to-child transmissions prevention \nservices. Wow.\n  Thanks to positive American involvement through programs like PEPFAR, \nmore than 11.5 million expectant mothers around the world have received \nHIV testing and counseling, and nearly 2 million babies have been born \nHIV-free.\n  However, even though we have made great strides in a fight against \npediatric AIDS over the last few years, we cannot rest, Mr. Speaker. We \ncannot rest while more than 400 children around the world are born with \nHIV every day; 400. We cannot rest when less than half of the children \nsuffering from HIV have access to the lifesaving treatments they so \ndesperately need; less than half. Indeed, we must redouble our efforts \nto reach every single mother and child impacted by this terrible \ndisease.\n  For this reason, my friend, Congresswoman Barbara Lee, and I just \nreintroduced H. Res. 593, a bipartisan resolution recommitting our \ncountry, the United States, to eradicating pediatric AIDS worldwide and \nsupporting those who have been impacted by this epidemic. Our \nresolution also supports our national efforts to provide women and \nchildren with HIV counseling, with HIV testing services, as well as \nexpanding their access to lifesaving treatments.\n  America's ongoing commitment has helped save the lives of many, but \nso much more remains to be done. We are one of the greatest hopes for a \nbetter future for countless others. Now, more than ever, it is \nessential to ensure that we remain committed as a nation to creating a \nfuture where no child suffers from HIV/AIDS.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this worthwhile cause and cosponsor \nour resolution, H. Res. 593.\n", "turn": 2, "speaker": "Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 3}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "177", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H8305", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "1", "month": "November"}, "related_bills": [{"type": "HRES", "context": "OTHER", "congress": "115", "number": "593"}], "doc_title": "HIGHLIGHTING THE STEP FORWARD TO CURE TSC MIAMI WALK", "id": "CREC-2017-11-01-pt1-PgH8305"}
