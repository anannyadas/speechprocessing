Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the memory \nof longtime New York City Firefighter Robert ``Skippy'' Tilearcio, who \npassed away last Wednesday from a malignant tumor resulting from his \nmonths of recovery efforts at Ground Zero.\n  Skip was a tireless advocate for the Zadroga 9/11 Healthcare Act. He \ncame to Washington about six times to fight for its extension in 2014 \nand 2015, even before he was diagnosed with a fatal tumor. I had the \nprivilege of meeting Skip Tilearcio when he would make these painful \ntrips to Congress. On his final visit Skip was confined to a wheelchair \nbut his spirit was as strong as ever. Skip truly personified the \ncourage of New York's Bravest.\n  Skip Tilearcio was the 15th firefighter to die this year alone from a \n9/11 related illness. Many more are sick and suffering from these \ndreaded 9/11 illnesses. But because of Skip Tilearcio's heroic and \nsuccessful effort to extend the Zadroga Act, these brave first \nresponders will receive the very best medical care and treatment. My \nsincerest condolences go out to his wife Tina and his two children \nTatiana and Robert. R.I.P. Firefighter Robert ``Skip'' Tilearcio.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. KING of New York", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 3}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "177", "extension": true, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "E1481", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "1", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "HONORING THE MEMORY OF FIREFIGHTER ROBERT ``SKIPPY'' TILEARCIO", "id": "CREC-2017-11-01-pt1-PgE1481-3", "title": "HONORING THE MEMORY OF FIREFIGHTER ROBERT ``SKIPPY'' TILEARCIO"}
