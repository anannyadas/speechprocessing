Mr. Speaker, there is a great town back home in Texas 22, \nwhich some people think has a strange name. It is called Needville, \nTexas.\n  The folks in Needville need nothing except open ground and clear \nskies with millions of bright stars visible at night. On the third \nweekend in October for the last 34 years, the whole town turns out for \nthe Needville Harvest Festival.\n  The Harvest Fest is all Texas. There is a talent show with twirlers \nand clog dancers; barbecue cook-offs; contests for the best fajitas, \nthe best pork loins, the best chicken, and the best pork ribs; and they \ngive away a 4-by-4 Gator. City slickers think that is some sort of \nlizard. It is a big farm tool, a farm tractor.\n  The best part is all the money they raise goes to their city to \nimprove their 60-acre Harvest Park and the Needville schools.\n  I will close with a message from Mayor Ernie Stuart, Harvest Festival \nPresident Chris Janicek, and my guest for President Trump's speech this \nupcoming February, Katie Vacek. They all say, ``Go Astros. Beat L.A.''\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. OLSON", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "177", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H8308", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "1", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "NEEDVILLE HARVEST FESTIVAL", "id": "CREC-2017-11-01-pt1-PgH8308-3", "title": "NEEDVILLE HARVEST FESTIVAL"}
