Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize the Annandale \nChristian Community for Action (ACCA) on the occasion of its 50th \nanniversary. In 1967, Fred and Emily Ruffing realized that there was a \ngreat need for childcare services for low-income and working poor \nfamilies who did not qualify for subsidized daycare. They decided that \nthey needed to take action to address this problem so they organized a \nmeeting with representatives from eight local churches to set up a day \ncare center and ACCA was born.\n   Since 1967, ACCA has continued to grow not only in size but in the \nnumber of services provided. What began as a group of eight churches 50 \nyears ago has grown to 26 member congregations. ACCA has also partnered \nwith the Fairfax County Department of Neighborhood and Community \nServices (NCS) and its services and programs as well as the model of \nfaith community and government partnership begun by ACCA has been \nreplicated all throughout Fairfax County.\n   ACCA gives back to the community in a variety of ways. The Child \nDevelopment Center (CDC) provides both developmental childcare and \nearly childhood education to over 200 toddlers, preschoolers and \ninfants. The ACCA Pantry collects from churches, schools, community \ngroups and local businesses and delivers food and other necessities on \nan emergency basis to area households. ACCA's Emergency Assistance \nprogram handles financial emergencies such as payment for rent, \nutilities, prescription drugs, and minor car repairs for low-income \nfamilies who have few resources to fall back on in a time of crisis.\n   The 26 partner ministries provide a safety net while the families \nrecover stability. Furniture ministry volunteers collect and distribute \ngently used furniture to needy recipients, while volunteers from the \nTransportation ministry provide rides to medical appointments. Meals on \nWheels volunteers deliver meals every weekday to elderly residents who \ncannot fend for themselves. ACCA volunteers also spend a Saturday in \nApril repairing houses--more than 110 homes have been repaired or \nrehabilitated since 1990. With the exception of the CDC, all of these \nservices are provided by volunteers.\n   Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in thanking the staff \nand volunteers of ACCA and in congratulating them on this incredible \nmilestone. Civic engagement is the foundation of a healthy community, \nand Fairfax County residents enjoy an exceptional quality of life due \nin part to the efforts of these individuals. Their contributions have \nbeen a great benefit to our community and truly merit our highest \npraise.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. CONNOLLY", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 3}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "177", "extension": true, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "E1480", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "1", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "RECOGNIZING THE 50TH ANNIVERSARY OF ANNANDALE CHRISTIAN COMMUNITY FOR ACTION", "id": "CREC-2017-11-01-pt1-PgE1480-3", "title": "RECOGNIZING THE 50TH ANNIVERSARY OF ANNANDALE CHRISTIAN COMMUNITY FOR  ACTION"}
