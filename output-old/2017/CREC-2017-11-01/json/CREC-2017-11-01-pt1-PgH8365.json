Res. 422\n\n       Whereas the People's Republic of China assumed the exercise \n     of sovereignty over the Hong Kong Special Administrative \n     Region 20 years ago, on July 1, 1997;\n       Whereas the Joint Declaration between the Government of the \n     United Kingdom of Great Britain and the Government of the \n     People's Republic of China on the Question of the Hong Kong \n     (in this resolution referred to as the ``Joint Declaration'') \n     required China's National People's Congress (NPC) to pass the \n     ``Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of \n     the People's Republic of China'' (in this resolution referred \n     to as the ``Basic Law'') consistent with the obligations \n     contained in the Joint Declaration, which was approved by the \n     NPC on April 4, 1990;\n       Whereas relations between the United States and Hong Kong \n     are fundamentally based upon the continued maintenance of the \n     ``one country, two systems'' policy stipulated in the United \n     States-Hong Kong Policy Act of 1992 (Public Law 102-383; 22 \n     U.S.C. 5701 et seq.) and established by the Joint \n     Declaration;\n       Whereas under the ``one country, two systems'' policy \n     established by the Joint Declaration, Hong Kong ``will enjoy \n     a high degree of autonomy except in foreign and defense \n     affairs'' and ``will be vested with executive, legislative \n     and independent judicial power including that of final \n     adjudication'';\n       Whereas Hong Kong's autonomy under the ``one country, two \n     systems'' policy, as demonstrated by its highly developed \n     rule of law, independent judiciary, and respect for the \n     rights of individuals, has continued to make Hong Kong the \n     preferred residence for over 85,000 United States citizens, \n     and at least 1,400 United States businesses operate in Hong \n     Kong;\n       Whereas the Joint Declaration and the Basic Law declare \n     that the lifestyle and social and economic systems in Hong \n     Kong will remain unchanged for 50 years after the 1997 \n     reversion;\n       Whereas the Basic Law guarantees Hong Kong residents the \n     freedoms of speech, press, publication, association, \n     assembly, demonstration, religious belief and activity, \n     academic research, and the rights to form unions and to \n     strike, among others;\n       Whereas the Basic Law also guarantees Hong Kong residents \n     the right to vote and to stand for election;\n       Whereas although the Basic Law states that ``the ultimate \n     aim is the selection of the Chief Executive by universal \n     suffrage upon nomination by a broadly representative \n     nominating committee in accordance with democratic \n     procedures'', the actual process\n\n\n     for nominating eligible Chief Executive candidates remains \n     heavily influenced by the Government of China;\n       Whereas widespread frustration with the lack of progress \n     toward a democratic selection of candidates for Chief \n     Executive provoked large-scale public demonstrations in late \n     2014, popularly known as the ``Umbrella Movement'', that \n     involved hundreds of thousands of demonstrators and the \n     occupation of certain public spaces for as long as 79 days;\n       Whereas, although Hong Kong continues to enjoy high levels \n     of economic freedom and judicial independence, certain recent \n     actions by the Government of China are inconsistent with its \n     stated commitments to Hong Kong's high degree of autonomy and \n     the preservation of the rule of law;\n       Whereas international press reported that from October \n     through December 2015, four employees of Mighty Current \n     publishing house and its affiliated bookstore, Causeway Bay \n     Books, a Hong Kong seller of publications critical of Chinese \n     leadership, disappeared under suspicious circumstances from \n     Hong Kong, Thailand, and mainland China, in potentially the \n     most serious breach of the ``one country, two systems'' \n     policy since 1997, which has had a chilling effect on the \n     freedoms of speech and publication in Hong Kong;\n       Whereas international press reported that--\n       (1) Gui Minhai, a Swedish citizen and the co-owner of \n     Mighty Current, was last seen in Thailand in October 2015;\n       (2) The general manager of Mighty Current, Lui Bo, and the \n     business manager, Cheung Jiping, disappeared while on a visit \n     to mainland China around October 2015;

\n     and\n       Whereas these developments have called into question Hong \n     Kong's highly developed rule of law, independent judiciary, \n     and respect for individual rights, which are fundamental to \n     its way of life and economic prosperity: Now, therefore, be \n     it\n       Resolved, That the House of Representatives--\n       (1) recognizes, consistent with the United States-Hong Kong \n     Policy Act of 1992, that--\n       (A) Hong Kong continues to play an important role in \n     today's regional and world economy, with strong economic, \n     cultural, and other ties to the United States;\n       (B) respect for civil liberties, open markets, rule of law, \n     and judicial independence are all integral aspects of Hong \n     Kong's lifestyle and social and economic systems;

and\n       (2) urges adherence to the ``one country, two systems'' \n     policy established by the Joint Declaration and the Basic Law \n     with respect to--\n       (A) Hong Kong's exercise of a high degree of autonomy;\n       (B) its enjoyment of executive, legislative, and \n     independent judicial power;

Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I want to recognize Ranking Member Engel for authorizing \nthis important measure on Hong Kong, the city once known as the Pearl \nof the Orient.\n  I commend the gentleman for strongly advocating for Hong Kong's \ncontinued adherence to the ``one country, two systems'' policy that has \nallowed for Hong Kong's autonomy and prosperity for so long. I was \nhappy to join him as an original cosponsor of this important measure.\n  During a recent trip that I led to Hong Kong, I heard firsthand how \nmeasures like this are helpful in keeping the pressure on Beijing to \nkeep its commitment to the Joint Declaration.\n  Twenty years have now passed since the handover of Hong Kong from the \nUnited Kingdom to the People's Republic of China. At the time, the U.S. \nCongress played a vital role in the continuity of the U.S. relationship \nwith Hong Kong by passing the Hong Kong Policy Act in 1992. This act \nestablished that the U.S. would treat Hong Kong as a nonsovereign \nentity distinct from China on commercial, cultural, and law enforcement \nmatters so long as it remained ``sufficiently autonomous.''\n  Since the handover, Hong Kong has continued to be a global economic \nforce and a financial hub. In recent years, however, it has also begun \nto face increased social, economic, and political challenges, including \nexternal pressures.\n  Mr. Speaker, we saw the Umbrella Movement protest in 2014, which was \nled by youth seeking to liberalize the electoral system and introduce \ntrue universal suffrage to Hong Kong in accordance with the Joint \nDeclaration between Great Britain and China. In the intervening years, \nwe have witnessed booksellers kidnapped from Hong Kong, Thailand, and \nMainland China; legislator oaths being invalidated; and the jailing of \nprotest leaders.\n  For many of us here in Congress, there is growing concern about the \napparent increased role of Beijing in the affairs of Hong Kong. \nTherefore, Mr. Speaker, it is important to reiterate here today that \nour special treatment of Hong Kong is dependent upon it remaining \nsufficiently autonomous. We want to see Hong Kong's highly developed \nrule of law, independent judiciary, and respect for individual freedoms \nremain as the lifeblood of Hong Kong and its economic prosperity as \nguaranteed, again, by China and Great Britain in the Joint Declaration.\n  Passage of this resolution demonstrates our support for the \ncontinuation of the ``one country, two systems'' policy in Hong Kong, \nso I urge my colleagues to join me in support of this measure.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.", "turn": 4, "speaker": "Mr. YOHO", "itemno": 10}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "E000179", "text": "  Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I rise in support of this measure.\n\n\n  Let me start by thanking our chairman on the Foreign Affairs \nCommittee, Ed Royce of California, for his leadership and for working \nwith me to bring this measure forward.\n  I introduced this resolution with Representatives Chabot, Yoho, \nSherman, and Smith, and I want to thank them all for their partnership.\n  I really listened intently to Mr. Yoho and also know that we make \nprogress on the Foreign Affairs Committee because, as Mr. Poe of Texas \nsaid, we work in bipartisan measure, and we try to agree on the \nlanguage and we try to make sure that the U.S. Congress speaks with one \nvoice so that both our friends and adversaries around the world will \nunderstand that we put partisanship aside. We leave it at the water's \nedge, and I think that is very important.\n  I think the kind of people the Foreign Affairs Committee attracts to \nserve on the committee, on both sides of the aisle, are the kind who \nkeep perpetuating this bipartisan spirit because we have differences in \npolicies, for sure, but we are all Americans. We all want to keep each \nother safe, and we all want to make sure that America does the right \nthing and that others do the right thing to America as well.\n  So when we have the incident like we had yesterday with the terrible \nterrorist attack in Manhattan, it makes us pause, as a Congress, and \nthink about what this all means.\n  People in Hong Kong were made promises as well. They were made \npromises years ago that China would be one country, including Hong \nKong, but two systems, that Hong Kong would be its independent system. \nAnd, of course, the Chinese officials and Beijing regime have tried \nevery which way to go after student protesting, curbing the rights and \nvalues of the people of Hong Kong, so this resolution is really very, \nvery important.\n  I thank, again, Representatives Smith, Sherman, Yoho, and Chabot. But \nI also want to recognize Doug Anderson and Sean O'Neill on the \nchairman's staff for their contributions to this resolution, and \nJennifer Hendrixson-White on my staff. It is a great example, again, of \nbipartisanship when it comes to foreign policy. We work together and we \nproduce what I regard as superior products.\n  For decades, Mr. Speaker, the United States has shared an important, \nunique relationship with Hong Kong. That relationship has been based on \nHong Kong's autonomy from Mainland China. This resolution underscores \nour national security interest in seeing Hong Kong remain autonomous at \na time when we have seen some troubling trends.\n  Twenty years ago, at the time of the handover, China made a \ncommitment that Hong Kong would continue to enjoy its special status. \nToday, China claims that the 1997 Joint Declaration is a so-called \n``historical document'' that has, again, ``no practical significance.'' \nBut the UK and the United States believe in international law, and we \nare committed to holding China to its word, again, a ``one country, two \nsystems'' form of government in Hong Kong.\n\n  This approach was experimental when the Chinese and British first \ndevised it. You may remember that Hong Kong was a British colony. The \nChinese Government essentially said that Hong Kong would continue to \nhave its own executive, legislative, and judicial rights, that the \npeople of Hong Kong would continue to enjoy fundamental rights \nguaranteed in Hong Kong's laws. But Beijing is now backing away from \nits commitments, even declaring the Joint Declaration a historical \ndocument with no relevance today.\n  Meddling in Hong Kong's elections by China's National People's \nCongress led to the Umbrella protests in 2014. Hong Kong residents \ncritical of the People's Republic of China have disappeared, while the \npresence of the People's Liberation Army has grown.\n  The credibility of Hong Kong's courts has suffered following \ndecisions to send Umbrella Movement student leaders to prison after \nthey had already served their previous sentences. Academic freedoms \nhave eroded. Self-censorship has grown, and journalists face regular \nharassment.\n  So we are worried, Mr. Speaker. We are worried about Chinese \nencroachment, about what is going to happen to the people of Hong Kong, \nand about the way China's newly aggressive posture is going to affect \nour relationship with Hong Kong in the future.\n  Twenty years after accepting the so-called ``one country, two \nsystems'' model, China's objective now seems to be making Hong Kong and \nthe mainland ``one country, one system.'' This is not what the \ngovernment in Beijing, the international community, the United States, \nGreat Britain, or the people of Hong Kong signed up for.\n  So this issue raises bigger questions, Mr. Speaker:\n  To what degree will the Chinese Government live up to its \ninternational commitments as China continues to expand economically and \ngrow in stature on the global stage?\n  This measure says, ``Enough.'' It sends a message to China that we in \nthe United States Congress expect Beijing to keep its word. That is not \nasking too much. It reiterates that our special bond with Hong Kong is \nbased on our shared values, the values of democracy, and that we want \nto see that relationship endure for years to come.\n  So I am grateful to my colleagues for working on this measure with \nme, especially Mr. Yoho. I ask support from all Members.\n\n\n  In closing, Mr. Speaker, let me again remind everyone that Hong Kong \nis special because of its judicial independence and strong rule of law \nthat is supposed to be protected under the ``one country, two systems'' \napproach. That is also the reason why the United States shares such a \nstrong strategic relationship with Hong Kong.\n  This resolution is a reminder of why our ties with Hong Kong are so \nimportant, and a call for all parties to respect the decades-old \ncommitments that have underpinned Hong Kong's autonomy. At a time when \nChina is growing more and more aggressive in its neighborhood, the \nUnited States cannot be seen as ceding ground. We need to stand up for \nour friends. We need to stand up for our values. We need to stand up \nfor our interests. We need to hold all countries to their commitments, \njust as the United States lives up to our own.\n  I ask for all Members to support this measure.

It has been a bipartisan committee, and to see \neverybody come together to work on these different situations, and \ndifferent bills and resolutions, it is so important that we project a \nunified body.\n  I would think China, as they move forward, would look hard to honor \ntheir commitment that they made because it is not just Hong Kong they \nare influencing.

Mr. Speaker, I commend Ranking Member, Mr. \nEngel, along with Chairman Yoho, Mr. Chabot, and Mr. Sherman, for \nintroducing H. Res. 422.\n  I am an original cosponsor of this legislation. As the Cochair of the \nbipartisan and bicameral Congressional-Executive Commission on China, I \nhave been gravely concerned by the Chinese government's efforts to \ncurtail Hong Kong's autonomy and crush pro-democracy voices in this \ncity.\n  Twenty years ago, China promised to guarantee Hong Kong's autonomy \nand freedoms for 50 years through the Sino-British Joint Declaration. \nThese promises have been needlessly strained in recent years, calling \ninto question the viability of a `One Country, Two Systems' model that \nhas provided great benefits to both China and the world.\n  The threats to Hong Kong's autonomy and its freedoms are progressing. \nAt the recent 19th Party Congress, Communist Party General Secretary \nand President Xi Jinping reiterated the fact that Hong Kong's autonomy \nis limited by Beijing's ``comprehensive jurisdiction''--meaning that \nBeijing has the final say on what freedoms are exercised in Hong Kong \nand who gets to lead the city's government.\n  On October 11, 2017, a British human rights activist, Benedict \nRogers, was denied access to Hong Kong by the Chinese government. Mr. \nRogers was also warned not to continue meeting with pro-democracy \nsupporters in Hong Kong by the Chinese Embassy in London.\n  Beijing is now telling foreigners with whom they can meet in Hong \nKong and barring entry to those who will not comply.\n  This is a chilling development that should be a concern from all \ncountries and corporations that have an interest in Hong Kong's \nfreedoms. Maintaining these freedoms and the rule of law are vital \neconomic interests of the United States.\n  The governments and legislatures of the UK and the United States \nshould work together to ensure that the Sino-Declaration Joint \nDeclaration remains in force to protect Hong Kong's unique way of life.\n  Xi Jinping also said recently about Hong Kong that he would ``never \nallow anyone, any organization, or any political party, to separate any \npart of Chinese territory from China . . . and that attempts to \nendanger China's sovereignty and security, to challenge the power of \nthe central government . . . [crosses] the red line.''\n  Given Beijing's expansive view of its own security to include anyone \npeacefully seeking political reforms or rights protections, these are \nominous words indeed.\n  Beijing has ramped up efforts to destroy the pro-democracy movement \nin Hong Kong. This past year, six elected legislators were disqualified \nafter the National People's Congress intervened in Hong Kong's \njudiciary. Then, in August, a Hong Kong court issued heavier sentences \nfor Joshua Wong, Nathan Law, and Alex Chow, leaders of the peaceful \nUmbrella Movement of 2014.\n  Mr. Wong, Mr. Law, and Mr. Chow should now be considered Hong Kong's \nfirst political prisoners. Though Joshua Wong and Nathan Law are out on \nbail at the moment pending an appeal, they face other charges and may \nbe put back in prison in the future. They likely will not be the last \npolitical prisoners in Hong Kong, as other Umbrella Movement leaders \nwere convicted recently, including Professor Benny Tai.\n  Senator Marco Rubio and I, with whom I cochair the CECC, have \nannounced our intention to nominate Hong Kong pro-democracy Umbrella \nMovement for the 2018 Nobel Peace Prize. I hope all Members will \nconsider signing on to that initiative.\n  I support this resolution, but it should not be our last word. In \n1992, the U.S. Congress passed the Hong Kong Policy Act, saying that \nU.S. policy toward Hong Kong was contingent on the preservation of Hong \nKong's autonomy and freedoms. With these fundamental elements being \ndiminished by the Chinese government, we should consider amending a \nbill passed 25 years ago to better protect U.S. interests.\n  That is why I introduced, along with Congressman Tim Walz (a fellow \nCECC Commissioner), the Hong Kong Human Rights & Democracy Act (H.R. \n3856)--a bill that I introduced in the last Congress and which has been \nintroduced by Senator Marco Rubio and Senator Ben Cardin in the Senate.\n  If Hong Kong is to be just another Chinese city, then we have the \nresponsibility to reassess whether Hong Kong warrants special status \nunder U.S. law.\n  We all have a stake in ensuring Hong Kong remains an open city, with \nthe rule of law and guaranteed rights currently unavailable in Mainland \nChina.\n  I support passage of this bill and thank the gentleman from New York \nfor his leadership on this issue.", "turn": 7, "speaker": "Mr. SMITH of New Jersey", "itemno": 13}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "  The SPEAKER pro tempore.
