Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time \nas I may consume.\n  Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of H.R. 2936, the Resilient \nFederal Forests Act of 2017.\n  As I stated last Congress, our national forests are facing an \nepidemic of declining health, which is a direct result of policies \nwhich have led to a dramatic decrease in managed acres creating \ncatastrophic wildfires that have increased in size and frequency.\n  The past two fire seasons have been some of the most expensive on \nrecord, and this year appears to be no exception. Secretary of \nAgriculture Sonny Perdue recently announced that wildland fire \nsuppression costs for this fiscal year have exceeded $2 billion, making \n2017 the most expensive year on record.\n  While the suppression costs are staggering, these fires come at a \ngreater cost to local communities, private property, and pristine \nlandscapes. Most importantly, they also result in the loss of life.\n  For too long, our good folks at the Forest Service have been unable \nto do the work needed to manage our forest fuel loads. Over the years, \nthe problem has compounded with more severe fires. Furthermore, these \nfires have consumed more and more of the Forest Service budget that was \nintended for management. This cycle has gone on for far too long.\n\n\n  In the 2014 farm bill, we took meaningful steps to empower the Forest \nService to carry out its mission. With passage of this bill, we will \nprovide the Forest Service another tool to carry out their duties.\n  This bill builds on the success of the farm bill to allow the Forest \nService and their partners to manage our forests using sound science \nand environmental protections without fear of frivolous litigation. \nFurther, it promotes good stewardship through restoration projects that \nprotect our watersheds after catastrophic fire.\n  As fuel loads increase in our national forests, the cost of inaction \nincreases every day. This legislation allows the Forest Service to \naccount for the environmental consequences of inaction, hopefully \nexpediting treatments where needed.\n  Finally, this issue extends beyond just fire. While they have not yet \ngone up in smoke, some of our national forests continue to deteriorate \nas a result of insect and disease infestations, leaving what was \npristine and productive habitat so many in this Congress seek to \nprotect.\n  Mr. Chairman, I ask my colleagues to support this commonsense \nlegislation, and I reserve the balance of my time.\n\n         Committee on Education and the Workforce, House of \n           Representatives,\n                                 Washington, DC, October 25, 2017.\n     Hon.

Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of H.R. 2936, the \nResilient Federal Forests Act. When we fail to actively manage our \nforests and Federal lands, we put ourselves and our neighbors at risk. \nIt is time to better manage our fire-prone forests and fix how we pay \nfor wildfire suppression.\n  California just experienced the deadliest wildfire in our history, \nand 2017 is on track to be the worst fire season on record. We can't \nwait until next season. We have got to put the right policies in place \nnow.\n  The Resilient Federal Forests Act gives us the tools to immediately \nreduce the threat of catastrophic wildfires. It allows us to expedite \nthe removal of dead trees and rapidly mitigate disease-infested areas. \nIt enables us to responsibly manage our forests and improve ecosystems, \nand it permanently solves the fire borrowing problem. No longer will we \ndeplete forest restoration and management accounts to pay for wildfire \nsuppression. This will give our firefighters the resources they need \nwithout hindering prevention efforts.\n  As California recovers from this year's fires, this bill will help us \nmitigate future wildfires. I urge my colleagues to pass this bill and \nhelp improve the health and resiliency of our Federal forests.\n\n\n  Mr. Chairman, I include in the Record a letter from the Association \nof California Water Agencies in support of H.R. 2936.\n\n                                                    Association of\n\n\n                                    California Water Agencies,\n\n                                                 October 31, 2017.\n\n   ACWA Support for H.R. 2936--Resilient Federal Forests Act of 2017\n\n       The Association of California Water Agencies (ACWA) \n     respectfully requests your support for H.R. 2936, The \n     Resilient Federal Forests Act of 2017. ACWA's 430 public \n     water agency members supply over 90 percent of the water \n     delivered in California for residential, agricultural, and \n     industrial uses.\n       Recent severe drought and one of the most destructive \n     wildfire seasons on record have focused renewed attention on \n     the health of California's headwaters. That attention is well \n     placed because the forests, meadows and source waters that \n     play a critical role in our water supply and water management \n     system are threatened by factors ranging from climate change \n     to incomplete management to a lack of planning and \n     coordination.\n       H.R. 2936 addresses many of these factors. It incentivizes \n     and rewards collaboration with local governments and \n     stakeholders by expediting environmental review for \n     collaborative projects up to 30,000 acres in size. It also \n     includes important provisions that will increase the yield \n     and protect the quality of our headwaters.\n       Additionally, H.R. 2936 solves the perennial ``fire \n     borrowing'' problem, in which federal land management \n     agencies must raid non-fire suppression accounts in order to \n     pay for suppression activities. H.R. 2936 ends this practice \n     by allowing FEMA to transfer funds to the Forest Service/BLM \n     when all fire suppression accounts have been exhausted.\n       As stated in ACWA's headwaters framework, ACWA believes \n     with more effective management ``healthy headwaters'' could \n     provide multiple benefits to California's water management \n     system and the environment. These benefits include: Increased \n     Water Supply Reliability; Improved Water Quality; Reduced \n     Impacts from Catastrophic Wildfires; Increased Renewable \n     Energy Supplies; Improved Response to Climate Change; and \n     Enhanced Habitat.\n       ACWA encourages you to vote for H.R. 2936.\n       If you have any questions please contact David Reynold.\n", "turn": 7, "speaker": "Mr. DENHAM", "itemno": 13}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "P000258", "text": "  Mr. PETERSON.

Deeming these actions to be \nnondiscretionary serves as a direct waiver of the Endangered Species \nAct regulations and protections and allows forest activities to violate \nthe ESA and jeopardize species.\n  Another provision exempts the Forest Service and BLM from \nimplementing regulations that require consultation on management plans \nwhen a new species is listed as threatened or endangered or there is a \nnew critical habitat designation.\n  This, in particular, will have profound implications for species that \nhave been proposed or are candidates for listing under the ESA that \nrely on these lands for habitat, such as the North American wolverine.\n  In short, this bill dismantles interagency consultation that is \nintegral to wildlife protection under the Endangered Species Act.\n  America's forests are home to over 400 threatened or endangered \nspecies, including the Florida panther, native wild trout, and the \nblack-footed ferret. We cannot allow this bill to strip protections for \nthese iconic species and eliminate environmental review processes for \nour Nation's forests.

But it is impossible \nto talk about the need for wildfire suppression without talking about \nproper forest management. These two go hand in hand--or at least they \nshould go hand in hand.\n\n\n  All too often, we hear rhetoric that managing our forests and \nremoving dead or dying trees is a bad thing. This can't be further from \nthe truth.\n  When we leave these dried, rotting trees laying on the forest floor, \nthey become an incendiary breeding ground for fires. Those fires cost \nthe Forest Service billions of dollars and countless hours of manpower \nto extinguish. Last year alone, we spent $2.9 billion on suppression \nefforts. This leaves barely any financial resources to allocate towards \nactually managing our forests.\n  H.R. 2936 seeks to end this cycle.

Such restoration \n     projects are sorely needed to improve forest health and \n     reduce threats to lands held in trust for Indians as well as \n     non-trust federal land upon which Indian tribes access for \n     traditional, subsistence and treaty-guaranteed purposes.\n       Section 701 would provide timelines for review, approval \n     and implementation of Tribal Forest Protection Act projects. \n     This new authority is needed because of the underperformance \n     of the TFPA authority. Thirteen years after Congress passed \n     the TFPA, only three projects have been fully implemented, \n     while others linger in years of procedural abyss. As a \n     result, tribal forest lands remain at high risk of wildfire \n     coming from adjacent federal lands.

Improvement of forest health and \n     ecological functions are vital to maintain watersheds and \n     fish and wildlife habitat on lands that may be subject to \n     federally-reserved tribal rights. Acting through the Bureau \n     of Indian Affairs, tribes would be able to restore lands \n     using the federal regulatory structure used on Indian trust \n     lands. As the Committee has noted on several occasions, \n     tribal forest management is able to achieve greater results \n     faster and at lower costs than on federal land. This \n     provision would help bring that successful management \n     approach to federal lands sorely in need of restoration.\n       Section 703 authorizes pilot authority for the Interior and \n     Agriculture Departments to grant ``638'' contracting \n     authority to tribes and tribal organizations for the \n     administrative and management functions of TFPA projects.\n       The ITC is a forty-one year old association of more than \n     fifty Indian tribes and Alaska Native organizations that \n     collectively manage more than 90% of the 18 million acres of \n     forest land held in trust by the Bureau of Indian Affairs. \n     The ITC is dedicated to pursuing the best management and \n     protection of tribal forests and other natural resources.

Rob Bishop,\n     Chairman, Natural Resources Committee,\n     House of Representatives, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Raul Grijalva,\n     Ranking Democrat, Natural Resources Committee, House of \n         Representatives, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Bishop and Representative Grijalva: On behalf \n     of the National Wild Turkey Federation (NWTF) and its 230,000 \n     members, we urge you to take swift Committee action on H.R. \n     2936 the Resilient Federal Forest Act of 2017. The NWTF is a \n     leader in wildlife habitat conservation in North America and \n     is dedicated to the conservation of the wild turkey and \n     preservation of our hunting heritage. We are currently \n     working towards our 10-year Save the Habitat. Save the Hunt \n     initiative in which we aim to conserve or enhance 4 million \n     acres of critical habitat, recruit 1.5 million hunters and \n     open 500,000 acres for outdoor enjoyment\n       Active forest management is crucial to establishing healthy \n     and sustainable forests and decisions for forest management \n     should be based on sound science. As such, the common sense \n     solutions offered in H.R. 2936 are imperative to the health \n     and future of our nation's forests and important to the NWTF \n     to help achieve our objectives. In total, H.R. 2936 has many \n     reasonable solutions to the challenges that the managing \n     agencies face to increase the pace and efficiency of active \n     forest management on our nation's federal lands. We take this \n     opportunity to highlight those solutions that we believe will \n     make the most immediate difference and offer recommendations \n     as to how we believe the bill can be further improved.\n       We support increased availability for Categorical \n     Exclusions (CE) in order to deal more effectively and \n     efficiently with threats like pests and disease and for \n     addressing urgent wildlife needs like critical habitat for \n     endangered species. We are especially supportive of the CE \n     that will allow for activities that enhance early \n     successional forests for wildlife habitat. Unlike some \n     critics of CEs who will suggest, they do not exempt the \n     action from the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), \n     rather they apply the NEPA review to like or similar actions \n     to expedite the process. These are administered under Council \n     on Environmental Quality regulations and other guidance. \n     Increased use of CEs is one of the best opportunities we have \n     in the short term to increase the pace of active forest \n     management.\n       Funding the cost of fighting catastrophic wildfires outside \n     of the agency budget is paramount to the agency's ability to \n     deliver on other aspects of their mission. We are supportive \n     of a fix that will allow catastrophic wildfires to be \n     considered a disaster. Until agencies are freed from the \n     burden of fighting catastrophic wildfires through their \n     annual budgets we will be unable to make meaningful progress \n     towards proactive forest management. We recommend capping the \n     firefighting budget at the current 10-year average to protect \n     further erosion of the U.S. Forest Service budget in other \n     important mission delivery areas.\n       We support the bill's provisions for large scale \n     reforestation on fire-impacted lands. While public input and \n     review is essential to public lands management, currently it \n     can result in delayed action and result in an inability to \n     accomplish the necessary objectives. We believe the deadlines \n     set for plan development and public input, as well as the \n     prohibition on restraining orders and preliminary injunctions \n     strike a reasonable balance. We recommend that this provision \n     of the bill clarify that proper ecological restoration is \n     allowed as a mechanism to salvage forests post catastrophic \n     events as reforestation may not always be the best action for \n     the ecological good.\n       The NWTF strongly supports arbitration as an alternative to \n     litigation. This will conserve valuable U.S. Forest Service \n     resources and expedite work getting done on the ground. \n     Additionally, we support the provision that does not allow \n     plaintiffs challenging a forest management activity to \n     receive any award or payment obligated from the Claims and \n     Judgment Fund.\n       We support the approach for allowing evaluation of only \n     action/no-action alternatives for collaborative Forest Plans, \n     Resource Advisory Committee and Community Wildfire Protection \n     Plan projects. Limiting the number of alternatives will \n     expedite the development of environmental assessments and \n     allow work to get done on the ground more quickly. We also \n     support the requirement to look at consequences of a no-\n     action alternative as a no-action decision would still have \n     an impact on the resource.\n       We understand budget concerns counties face and are \n     supportive of a portion of retained receipts from stewardship \n     contracts going to the counties. Stewardship Contracting is \n     an important tool for active forest management. Ultimately \n     this change will remove one impediment to utilizing \n     Stewardship Contracting and help garner support from the \n     counties. We recommend modifying this section to reflect that \n     payment should come only from retained receipts on completed \n     projects, versus strictly from timber value within ongoing \n     projects. This will maintain the ``exchange of goods for \n     services'' function of Stewardship Contracting while also \n     preserving the balance of timber dollars and the investment \n     of matching funds from organizations like the NWTF to expand \n     the scope and scale of projects, thus accomplishing more \n     active management and fire protection across the landscape \n     and within counties.\n       We appreciate the recognition of the importance of funding \n     planning activities for forest management. We are concerned \n     that the provision could potentially provide justification \n     for the U.S. Forest Service staff to refrain from fully \n     utilizing product value and\n\n\n     partner match dollars for on the ground work. While we feel \n     the 25% threshold is too high, the provision of allowing some \n     of the stewardship project revenues to cover the costs of \n     planning additional projects could be beneficial and \n     incentivize project planning.\n       We also appreciate the common-sense amendments to the \n     Endangered Species Act (ESA) that will improve the process of \n     protecting endangered and threatened species and their \n     habitat. The bill overturns the ``Cottonwood'' court \n     decision, which directs that if additional critical habitat \n     is designated under an approved Forest Plan or Resource \n     Management Plan, a section 7 programmatic re-consultation of \n     the entire Forest Plan needs to be done. The U.S. Fish and \n     Wildlife Service and the Obama Administration argued that the \n     section 7 consultation needs only to be done on the portion \n     of the project covering the additionally designated acreage \n     of critical habitat. The remedy in this bill will greatly \n     reduce the debilitating process that the federal court \n     decision directs. The bill also affirms current U.S. Fish and \n     Wildlife Service policy that no ESA section 7 consultation is \n     required if the U.S. Forest Service or Bureau of Land \n     Management determines through informal consultation that the \n     proposed action will not likely have an adverse affect on \n     species or critical habitat. We further support the 90 day \n     threshold on a CE established by this bill because it will \n     conserve agency resources and expedite management activities \n     on the ground.\n       We commend Congressman Westerman, the co-sponsors, and \n     Chairman Bishop for their dedication to restoring and \n     maintaining our federal forests under management informed by \n     science, and offering the appropriate reforms to management \n     practices. We respectfully urge that you expeditiously report \n     H.R. 2936 out of Committee and to the House floor.\n           Sincerely,\n                                             Rebecca A.

Bruce Westerman,\n     House of Representatives,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Congressman Westerman: On behalf of the National \n     Association of Counties (NACo) the only organization \n     representing the nation's 3,069 counties, parishes, and \n     boroughs, and the Western Interstate Region (WIR), we write \n     to express support for H.R. 2936, the Resilient Federal \n     Forests Act of 2017. Thank you for your leadership in \n     introducing legislation to promote the active management of \n     our nation's federal lands and forests, reduce the risk of \n     catastrophic wildfire and promote collaborative approaches to \n     address natural resource management challenges.\n       The legislation will improve the health and wellbeing of \n     forest lands and forest communities by: promoting \n     collaboration and streamlining regulations for forest health \n     projects, protecting communities through wildfire risk \n     reduction, improving flexibility and fairness in forest \n     revenue sharing, and delegating the authority for Resource \n     Advisory Committees (RAC) appointments.\n\n\nPromoting Collaboration and Streamlining Regulations for Forest Health \n                                Projects\n\n       Counties believe that active management of federal lands \n     and forests must be done in a sustainable manner that ensures \n     the health of our federal lands for generations to come. One \n     way to help ensure a balanced approach to address natural \n     resource management challenges is by promoting locally driven \n     collaborative processes that promote consensus driven \n     decision making. Counties across the United States have \n     engaged in collaborative efforts to address their natural \n     resources challenges. By bringing a broad cross-section of \n     local stakeholders into collaborative processes, counties, \n     industry, outdoorsmen, conservationists and federal and state \n     land managers have built consensus on some of the most \n     complex natural resource management challenges.\n       By authorizing limited and reasonable categorical \n     exclusions for projects that improve forest health and have \n     been developed through consensus based collaborative \n     processes, H.R. 2936 builds upon these successes and provides \n     additional tools to help ensure that collaborative efforts \n     continue to work, accelerate and expand. Streamlining the \n     regulatory review of proposed forestry projects will increase \n     project implementation and the number of acres that are \n     treated.\n\n\n         Protecting Communities through Wildfire Risk Reduction\n\n       For the 26 percent of counties across the United States \n     that are home to federal forest lands, the health of our \n     national forests has a direct impact on the health and safety \n     of county residents. Healthy forests are less prone to \n     disease, insect infestation, and wildfire. While the causes \n     of catastrophic wildfire are complex, the status quo of \n     inaction has exacerbated present forest conditions, which now \n     present a great risk to both communities and the environment. \n     Your legislation would help to correct this by requiring the \n     costs and benefits of a proposed forest project be weighed \n     against the costs and benefits of doing nothing to address \n     wildfire threats, disease and insect infestation, and their \n     impacts on local water supply and wildlife habitat.\n       Provisions of the legislation expediting regulatory \n     analysis for timber salvage after major wildfires are also \n     crucial, and will provide the Forest Service with the revenue \n     it needs to execute critical and time-sensitive post-fire \n     reforestation work.\n\n\n     Providing Flexibility and Equitable Sharing of Forest Revenues\n\n       In addition to improving forest health and reducing \n     wildfire risk for forest communities, increased active \n     management will generate more revenue for the federal \n     treasury and critical services provided by counties, and \n     promote job creation and economic growth in counties across \n     the nation. According to the American Forest and Paper \n     Association, forest products industries account for 4% of \n     U.S. manufacturing GDP and over $50 billion annually in wages \n     for approximately 900,000 employees. These jobs provide a \n     direct economic impact to many rural and forest counties \n     across the country.\n       The growth in stewardship contracting in recent years has \n     shown that a market-driven approach to forest management \n     projects can work to achieve both forest management goals and \n     increased forest production. Counties support and are active \n     partners in stewardship contracting initiatives across the \n     United States. NACo and WIR support provisions of H.R. 2936 \n     that authorize the equitable sharing of stewardship \n     contracting revenues with counties consistent with historic \n     practices. Forest revenue sharing payments support critical \n     county services such as transportation infrastructure and \n     education. America's counties look forward to working with \n     Congress to further strengthen forest revenue sharing between \n     counties and the federal government.\n       Since 2000, due to sharp declines in forest revenues, the \n     federal government has provided payments to forest counties \n     through the Secure Rural Schools (SRS) program. The SRS \n     program provides a critical safety-net for forest counties \n     impacted by declines in forest production and the loss of \n     forest jobs and it will continue to be a critical program \n     until the declines in forest production can be fully \n     addressed. H.R. 2936 reforms Title III of SRS that provide \n     much needed flexibility for counties to use a portion of SRS \n     funding to support law enforcement patrols and ensure county \n     first-responders have the equipment and training they need to \n     provide high-quality emergency services on forest service \n     land to county residents and the millions of public lands \n     visitors each year.\n\n\n    Delegating the Authority for Resource Advisory Committee (RAC) \n                              Appointments\n\n       Finally, counties support legislation to ensure rural \n     counties can actively coordinate with federal agencies \n     through flexibility in RAC membership and appointments. NACo \n     and WIR support allowing the U.S. Secretary of Agriculture \n     and U.S. Secretary of the Interior to delegate the authority \n     for appointing RAC members to agency leaders, such as \n     Regional Foresters or Bureau of Land Management State \n     Directors. Counties should be included in the development and \n     implementation of public lands management plans, and RACs \n     allow county leaders to actively participate in this process. \n     Your legislation would allow the Secretary to delegate RAC \n     appointment authority, and ensure locally-driven efforts to \n     better manage federal lands can begin in a timely manner.\n       NACo and WIR stand ready to work with you to promote \n     locally supported, consensus-driven solutions to address \n     management challenges, reduce the risk of catastrophic \n     wildfire, and increase economic activity on our federal \n     lands. NACo and WIR encourage swift passage of the Resilient \n     Federal Forests Act of 2017.\n           Sincerely,\n     Matthew D.

Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  As we make this transition, let me try and sum up where we are at \nthis particular time.\n  This particular bill was done in coordination with the U.S. Forest \nService under both the Obama administration and the Trump \nadministration. This has the approval of local governments, Tribes, \nsportsmen's groups, and labor unions. The last time we had this bill, \nit had a good bipartisan vote on it, but these are issues that the \nForest Service needs and they can use on day one of their issue.\n  What the Forest Service needs are resources, obviously. We know that. \nBut they also need the tools that they need to actually do their work.\n  Now, there are some on the fringe who are going to say that \neverything is wrong here, but I would encourage them to get rid of the \nusual rhetoric and to pocket the dogma for a minute and realize that \nwhat we need to do is come up with a system that affects the planning \nprocess.\n  The Forest Service admits they have 50 to 60 million acres of \nforestland today that is ready to be a catastrophic catastrophe. They \nwant to treat 25 percent of what they own a year. They are only \ntreating 2 to 3 percent. That means, of the 50 to 60 million acres they \nhave that are in dire situations right now, they can only treat 3 a \nyear. That would take them 20 years to try and get through what needs \nto be treated unless we give them new tools to reform the system to \nmake that process going in, and that is exactly what this bill does: it \nrewards collaboration; it tries to stop unnecessary litigation; it \ncomes up with arbitration concepts that are in there; it expands the \nability of streamlining the process so they can get to work.\n  Our people need the resources to do their job. They need the tools. \nWe should make it very clear that money alone is not going to solve the \nproblem of wildfire catastrophe. What we have to do is solve the \nconditions that create the catastrophic wildfires in the first place, \nand that means that we need to make sure that we are doing things so we \ncan prohibit what has happened, which has been devastating to people \nand their property; which has destroyed habitat for species, endangered \nand unendangered; and which has created conditions of pollution in our \natmosphere.\n  All that has to take place. Everything in this bill is what the \nexperts in the Forest Service said they can do on day one after it is \npassed. It needs to take place. It needs to be in addition to the \nfinancial solving of the wildfire situation. You need to have these \nreforms, and that is what we are pushing in this bill. It is why it is \nso desperately needed and why it was worked out with the experts in the \nfield.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.", "turn": 42, "speaker": "Mr. BISHOP of Utah", "itemno": 52}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "G000551", "text": "  Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  I rise in opposition to H.R. 2936, the so-called Resilient Federal \nForests Act of 2017. Perhaps a better name would be the ``Log America's \nForest Act of 2017.''\n  But before I address the many concerns with the underlying bill, I \nmust commend my colleagues across the aisle for attempting to deal with \nthe biggest barrier to improved management of our national forests: the \nenormous cost and impact of wildfire suppression on the Forest Service \nbudget.\n  Over 50 percent of the Forest Service budget is eaten up by wildfire, \nand if things don't change, the agency predicts that it will increase \nto two-thirds in just 5 years. Unfortunately, the budget fix in this \nbill falls short.\n  First, it requires Congress to appropriate an amount equal to the 10-\nyear average before emergency funding is available. We know that \nclimate change results in longer and more intense wildfire seasons, \nmaking the 10-year average irrelevant to the ever-increasing need for \nfunding. Because the average is too low, the real number will keep \ngrowing, meaning the amount of funding that must be taken from the \nForest Service accounts will continue to grow. Fighting fires will \ncontinue squeezing out money for the active management my Republican \ncolleagues are so eager to prioritize.\n  Second, requiring the President to declare each fire a national \nemergency before releasing funds is unnecessarily bureaucratic and \ncould delay emergency operations.\n  We need a holistic fix for the wildfire budget that makes money \navailable in advance of a critical emergency, but Republicans would \nrather play politics with fire to undermine environmental safeguards.\n  This is not the first time we have seen the bill, this piece of \nlegislation. House Republicans sent a version to the Senate in the \n113th and the 114th Congresses, where it languished on the shelf \nbecause our colleagues on the other side of the Capitol found it too \nextreme.\n  Rather than view that experience as an opportunity to seek compromise \nthis time around, today we are considering a bill that is even more \nextreme and polarizing. They doubled the environmental review waivers, \nadded language to undermine the Endangered Species Act, and scaled back \nprotections for national monuments and roadless areas.\n  We are told that this is all in the name of decreasing wildfire risk \nand protecting communities. The truth is that it is just more of the \nsame from House Republicans who will look for any excuse to advance \ntheir extraction-above-all agenda.\n  Wildfires are a huge problem in this country due, in large part, to \nclimate change, something this bill ignores. By the way, they are \nbecoming more frequent and more intense, and they pose a growing threat \nto public safety and local communities.\n  This bill is not about forest health or wildfire mitigation. It is \nabout increasing the number of trees removed from our forests. \nRepublicans would rather scare us into weakening environmental \nsafeguards than work on a possible bipartisan solution to wildfire \nmanagement.\n\n\n  A serious proposal would recognize the Forest Service and the \nDepartment of the Interior have ample authority within current law to \nconduct fire treatment on our public lands. In fact, the 2009 \nCollaborative Forest Landscape Restoration Program, established the \nlast time Democrats controlled the House, has resulted in the treatment \nof over 1.45 million acres of national forests to reduce the risk of \ncatastrophic fire and the improvement of over 1.33 million acres of \nwildlife habitat.\n  In just 5 years, the program generated more than $661 million in \nlocal labor income and an average of 4,300 jobs per year. The projects \nhave attracted new partners and strengthened community relationships, \nleveraging over $76.1 million in partner matching funds. Collaborative \nprograms like this bring people to the table and result in more acres \ntreated, more local jobs, and more successful projects. Again, all of \nthis has taken place within the framework of the current law.\n  Increased funding for programs like Collaborative Forest Landscape \nRestoration should be a priority for Republicans, but this program was \nzeroed out by the Trump administration budget, and extreme proposals \nlike this bill chip away at the principal pillars of law that make \ncollaboration possible.

Raul Grijalva,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on Natural Resources, House of \n         Representatives, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Bishop & Ranking Member Grijalva: We write to \n     you today in strong support of HR 2936, the bipartisan \n     Resilient Federal Forests Act of 2017.\n       Our federal forests are facing serious threats from fires, \n     insects, and diseases due to lack of active forest \n     management. The poor health of our federal forests also \n     threatens wildlife habitat, watersheds, and neighboring non-\n     Federal lands, as well as the vitality of rural, forested \n     communities across the country. HR 2936 contains provisions \n     intended to both address the disruption caused by fire \n     borrowing and to expedite needed forest management to improve \n     the health and vitality of our federal forests.\n       The Resilient Federal Forests Act provides Categorical \n     Exclusions (CE's) under the National Environmental Policy Act \n     will allow needed forest management projects to be more \n     quickly prepared, analyzed, and implemented. It will also \n     allow forest recovery projects to proceed more quickly, \n     addressing a dire need created by recent wildfire seasons. \n     The Forest Service has long experience with management \n     techniques to reduce forest pests, thin hazardous fuels, \n     create and maintain habitat for species, recover damaged \n     timber and protect water quality. These projects mitigate \n     risk and help create early successional forest habitat which \n     is good for wildlife.\n       The Forest Service does more complex NEPA documentation \n     than most other Federal agencies, and even after years of \n     collaboration, frequently finds itself in court where judges \n     scrutinize procedural issues, delaying needed management, \n     sometimes for years. The Resilient Federal Forests Act \n     addresses the complex, court-imposed NEPA burden that has \n     been forced on the Forest Service, while preserving \n     collaborative efforts and avoiding sensitive forest lands.\n       HR 2936 addresses both the excessive analysis requirements \n     imposed on even modest forest management projects, as well as \n     the dysfunctional system of funding suppression costs out of \n     forest management program accounts. Provisions in the bill \n     limit the acreage of Categorical Exclusions, and prohibits \n     their use in sensitive areas. The legislation provides access \n     to the disaster relief fund for wildfire suppression expenses \n     in excess of the 10-year average.\n       The House acted on a similar, bipartisan bill in 2015. The \n     need for action to address forest health conditions on our \n     national forest system is even higher today. Wildfire \n     suppression funding mechanisms developed in the past are no \n     longer adequate to address the conditions we are \n     experiencing. We urge to take up and pass HR 2936 as quickly \n     as possible.\n       We stand ready to work with both of you advance responsible \n     solutions to these serious national problems.\n         Alabama Loggers Council; Allegheny Hardwood Utilization \n           Group, Inc.; American Farm Bureau Federation; American \n           Forest & Paper Association; American Forest Resource \n           Council; American Loggers Council; Arkansas Forestry \n           Association; Arkansas Timber Producers Association; \n           Associated California Loggers; Associated Logging \n           Contractors of Idaho; Associated Oregon Loggers; \n           Association of Consulting Foresters; Black Hills Forest \n           Resource Association; California Forestry Association; \n           Carolina Loggers Association; Colorado Timber Industry \n           Association; Coos County (Oregon) Board of \n           Commissioners; Deere & Co; Great Lakes Timber \n           Professionals; Hardwood Federations.\n         Intermountain Forest Association; Louisiana Forestry \n           Association; Michigan Association of Timbermen; \n           Michigan Forest Products Council; Minnesota Forest \n           Industries; Minnesota Timber Producers Association; \n           Mississippi Loggers Association; Missouri Forest \n           Products Association; Montana Logging Association; \n           Montana Wood Products Association; National Wildfire \n           Institute; New Hampshire Timberland Owners Association; \n           New Mexico Coalition of Conservation Districts; New \n           Mexico Forest Industry Association; Northeastern \n           Loggers Association; Professional Logging Contractors \n           of Maine; South Carolina Timber Producers Association; \n           Southeastern Lumber Manufacturers Association; \n           Sustainable Forest Action Coalition; Treated Wood \n           Council.\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 56}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "B001250", "text": "  Mr. BISHOP of Utah.

Mr. Chairman, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 2936, \nthe Resilient Federal Forests Act of 2017, introduced by my friend and \ncolleague Bruce Westerman.\n  Our forests and the communities that live, work, and rely on them \ndesperately need improved management practice to reduce these forest \nfire disasters and to increase resiliency.\n  I was very pleased with the quick work by my friend and former \ncolleague OMB Director Mick Mulvaney for addressing the wildfire \nfunding crisis at the United States Forest Service, requesting $576.5 \nmillion for wildfire suppression and recommending active management \nreforms.\n  Now, while the Trump administration came through in a big way for \nWestern communities that have been ravaged by catastrophic wildfires, \nCongress must pass H.R. 2936 and get serious about combating \ncatastrophic wildfires before they get started.\n  The Resilient Federal Forests Act is a bipartisan, comprehensive \npiece of legislation that simplifies the cumbersome planning process \nand reduces the cost of implementing proactive forest management \nstrategies.\n  H.R. 2936 empowers local communities by getting them involved in the \ndecisionmaking process. It empowers Tribal communities to be part of \nthe solution and help reduce the risk of wildfire.\n  The bill removes incentives for extreme special interest groups to \nfile frivolous lawsuits. In fact, it requires litigants opposing active \nmanagement projects to propose an alternative plan as opposed to just \nsaying ``no.'' Imagine that, solutions over lawsuits.\n\n\n  Mismanagement has left our forests vulnerable to insects and disease \nand ripe for catastrophic wildfires. It is clear the system is broken. \nWestern communities are tired of being victims, and this bill allows us \nto be proactive and to prevent disasters before they become a risk.\n  Mr. Chairman, I include in the Record two letters, one from the \nAssociation of Fish and Wildlife Agencies and the second from the \nNational Association of Home Builders, in support of H.R. 2936.\n         Association of Fish & Wildlife Agencies,\n                                    Washington, DC, June 26, 2017.\n     Hon. Rob Bishop,\n     Chairman, House Natural Resources Committee, House of \n         Representatives, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Raul Grijalva,\n     Ranking Democrat, House Natural Resources Committee, House of \n         Representatives, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Bishop and Ranking Democrat Grijalva: The \n     Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies (Association) is \n     pleased to support H.R. 2936, the ``Resilient Federal Forest \n     Act of 2017'' (RFFA). All 50 state agencies are members of \n     the Association. Founded in 1902, the Association's mission \n     is to protect the interests and authorities of the states to \n     manage fish and wildlife within their borders, including on \n     federal land. The Association works closely with the federal \n     land management agencies to deliver on the ground \n     conservation of fish, wildlife and their habitats for our \n     citizens.\n       The Association is particularly appreciative of changes \n     made by the Committee staff at the request of the \n     Association. These changes make more prominent in federal \n     statute the states' authority to manage fish and wildlife on \n     U.S. Forest Service (USFS) and Bureau of Land Management \n     (BLM) lands. Nothing in the amended language is intended to \n     change any existing federal, state or tribal authority. It \n     simply makes more evident the state-federal jurisdictional \n     relationship which Congress has affirmed. Federal-state \n     cooperation in this arena is compelled because the USFS and \n     BLM own the land and thus the habitat, and the state fish and \n     wildlife agencies manage the fish and wildlife. Robust \n     cooperation will provide that both land/habitat objectives \n     and fish and wildlife population objectives are met.\n       The RFFA is vitally needed to restore the health of our \n     Nation's federal forests on USFS and BLM lands. \n     Unfortunately, the USFS and BLM have fallen significantly \n     behind in meeting objectives for early successional stage \n     forest habitat, for a number of reasons. Significantly, \n     federal court decisions and increasing uninformed litigation \n     has created ``paralysis by analysis'' to quote a former USFS \n     Chief. Congress mandated that the federal forests were to be \n     managed for water quality, wildlife habitat, recreation, and \n     timber harvest. Active forest management by the federal \n     professional managers in cooperation with the state fish and \n     wildlife agency professional managers has been replaced by \n     natural resource management decisions being made by the \n     federal courts. A return to active forest management will \n     facilitate realization of all of the public values of federal \n     forests.\n       The Association much appreciates that the fire-borrowing \n     problem is addressed in HR 2936. While most catastrophic \n     fires occur in the western United States, this is a national \n     problem because the funds for every national forest and \n     public land unit are affected. This remedy will prevent the \n     USFS and BLM from having to borrow from other appropriated \n     line-items (for example, wildfire prevention, wildlife, \n     recreation and water quality) to pay for the cost of \n     catastrophic fire suppression, which cost consumes over 50% \n     of the USFS budget. We respectfully urge the Committee to \n     further protect the USFS budget by capping the 10-year \n     average cost of catastrophic fire costs at its current level. \n     The 10-year average is used by the USFS in building their \n     budget request. The 10-year average continues to rise and \n     unless it is capped it will continue to erode other important \n     budget line items such as wildlife, water quality, fire \n     prevention and recreation in the President's budget.\n       The Association further appreciates the process relief \n     provided to National Forest Plans (NFP) and (potentially) \n     Resource Management Plans (RMP) developed by collaborative \n     deliberation. It is appropriate that a collaborative-\n     developed plan, which often takes years to deliberate and \n     conclude, be subject to only two options under NEPA, proceed \n     or not proceed. It is very reasonable to assume that the \n     collaboratively deliberated process has examined and rejected \n     the other options, and only the action or no action need be \n     analyzed.\n       The bill's establishment of a pilot binding arbitration \n     process as an alternative to litigation in each FS Region is \n     certainly welcomed by the Association. Not only is the cost \n     of defending the land management plan a burden on the \n     agencies, but the planned for management work on the ground \n     is lost, perhaps never to be resurrected on that site. We \n     commend Congressman Westerman and the Committee for settling \n     on this significant improvement to litigation reform that was \n     in HR 2647 from the last Congress.\n       We also appreciate the increase in acreage ceilings for the \n     statutorily endorsed Categorical Exclusions (CEs) under NEPA. \n     CEs must avoid sensitive areas and must be consistent with \n     standards and guidelines in Forest Plans. Early forest \n     successional stage habitat, for instance, cannot be just \n     incidental to be effective in providing habitat for deer, \n     elk, wild turkey, neo-tropical migratory songbirds and other \n     species which are dependent on this habitat type. While an \n     acreage ceiling is an easy metric to measure success, the \n     desired forest future condition should really determine the \n     size of the timber harvest.\n       Additionally, the Association supports the proposed common-\n     sense amendments to the Endangered Species Act. First, H.R. \n     2936 overturns the Cottonwood decision, which directs that if \n     additional critical habitat is designated under an approved \n     FP or RMP, a section 7 programmatic re-consultation of the \n     entire FP needs to be done. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife \n     Service (USFWS) and the Obama Administration argued that the \n     section 7 consultation needs only to be done on the project \n     covering the additionally designated acreage of critical \n     habitat. This remedy will greatly reduce the debilitating \n     process that the federal court decision directs. Second, the \n     bill affirms that no ESA section 7 consultation is required \n     if the USFS or BLM determine during informal consultation \n     that the proposed action is ``not likely to adversely affect \n     a species or designated critical habitat'', which is already \n     USFWS policy. And third, if any consultation on a categorical \n     exclusion established by the bill is not concluded after 90 \n     days, the action shall be considered to have not violated \n     section 7(a)(2) of the ESA.\n       The Association is committed to working with our partners \n     in the USFS and BLM to manage our federal forests to fulfill \n     their public values as Congress mandated. HR 2936 makes \n     significant improvements to and would expedite the process \n     that governs approval of the USFS and BLM management plans. \n     We urge that your Committee expeditiously report HR 2936 from \n     the Committee to the House floor.\n       We look forward to continuing to work with you to move this \n     bill quickly through the legislative process. If you have any \n     questions, please contact AFWA Government affairs Director \n     Jen Mock Schaeffer.\n           Sincerely,\n     Nick Wiley,\n       President, Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies;\n       Executive Director, Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation \n     Commission.", "turn": 46, "speaker": "Mr. GOSAR", "itemno": 58}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                                  ____\n\n                                           National Association of\n\n\n                                                Home Builders,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 21, 2017.\n     Hon.

Better forest management practices that are \n     also mindful of environmental considerations will help \n     strengthen the housing supply chain and promote affordable \n     housing opportunities for all Americans.\n       Significant concerns have been raised about the U.S. Forest \n     Service's current forest management efforts, both in terms of \n     administrative obstacles and legal obstacles in approving \n     timber harvesting projects. Consequently, less commercial \n     harvesting of timber has resulted in overgrown forests and an \n     increased risk of catastrophic wildfire across the country.\n       Additional commercial harvesting of timber will promote the \n     health of our nation's forest system, but also positively \n     impact housing affordability. NAHB research shows lumber and \n     wood products account for 15% of the cost of construction for \n     a single family house. Lumber prices are generally volatile, \n     and it is common for builders to encounter a large price \n     swing in a short period of time. As additional supply is \n     brought into the market, upward pressure on lumber prices \n     will soften.\n       NAHB urges the House Natural Resources Committee to support \n     The Resilient National Forests Act of 2017, which will \n     encourage multi-use forest management practices for national \n     forests and provide increases in the supply of federal timber \n     products.\n       Thank you for considering our views.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               James W.

Mr. Chairman, I remember, 13 years ago, after another \nspate of catastrophic fires in the Western United States, we came \ntogether in a truly bipartisan fashion and passed something called the \nHealthy Forests Restoration Act. It authorized up to 20 million acres \nto be treated to remove\n\n\nhazard fuels in what is called the WUI, the wildland-urban interface, \nand in threats to municipal water supplies. We also authorized $760 \nmillion a year.\n  Well, it has been 13 years. We authorized 20 million acres of work. \nWhat has been done? 2\\1/2\\ million.\n  Is it because of litigation, lawsuits, or, you know, obstruction? No. \nIt is because of this body, the United States Congress, which is \nrefusing to put up the money to do the work.\n  In my State alone, there are 1.8 million acres waiting for treatment. \nThey have gone through all environmental reviews. There is no potential \nfor litigation or any other blocking, but they don't have the money.\n  Does this bill fix that? No. We are addressing problems that don't \nexist in terms of addressing the wildfire problem.\n  This is really, you know, kind of a lost opportunity, a missed \nopportunity. Yes, it does a partial fix of the wildfire borrowing, \nwhich devastates the Forest Service every year. I appreciate that. But \nthe fact is, we have got 44 million homes that are now at risk in terms \nof wildland-urban interface, and we have only treated 2\\1/2\\ million \nacres because this Congress isn't putting up the money.\n\n\n  And this year, yet again, they are proposing like one-half of what we \nauthorized. What does one-half get you? It gets you half the acreage.\n  So if we had appropriated at the levels we authorized over the last \n13 years, they would have treated 5 or 6 million acres. Again, they \nweren't blocked by litigation. They weren't blocked by appeals. The \nHFRA Act became virtually noncontroversial because it didn't do away \nwith judicial review, which this bill will do on a certain number of \nprojects in each region every year.\n  I wish that this was a bipartisan approach, it isn't, and I cannot \nsupport the legislation.", "turn": 49, "speaker": "Mr. DeFAZIO", "itemno": 62}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "B001250", "text": "  Mr. BISHOP of Utah.

They imposed what have become endlessly \ntime-consuming and, ultimately, cost-prohibitive restrictions on our \nability to properly manage our national forests so that we can match \nthe tree density with the ability of the land to support it.\n  I think after 45 years of experience with these laws, we are entitled \nto ask: How are our forests doing? The answer is damning. Our forests \nare now catastrophically overgrown, often carrying four times the \nnumber of trees that the land can support. In this stressed and \nweakened condition, our forests are easy prey for drought, disease, \npestilence, and fire.\n  There is an old adage that excess timber comes out of the forest one \nway or the other--it is either carried out or it burns out. When we \ncarried it out, we had resilient, healthy forests and a thriving \neconomy, as excess timber was sold and harvested before it could choke \nour forests to death. In the years since then, we have seen an 80 \npercent decline in timber sales from our Federal lands and a \nconcomitant increase in acreage destroyed by forest fire. I would \nremind my friend from Oregon that timber sales used to generate us \nmoney, not cost us money.\n  The direct revenues and spin-off commerce generated by these sales \nprovided a stream of revenues that we could then use to improve our \nnational forests and share with the local communities affected.\n  The Resilient Federal Forests Act begins to move us back towards \nsound and scientific forest management practices. It requires forest \nmanagers to consider the cost of no action alternatives; it streamlines \nfire and disease prevention programs and ensures that fire-killed \ntimber can be quickly removed to create both revenues and room to \nrestore fire-damaged lands; it ends the practice of raiding prevention \nfunds to fight fires; it streamlines onerous environmental review \nprocesses without sacrificing environmental protection; and it provides \nour forest managers with alternatives to resolve frivolous lawsuits.\n  Provisions that streamline the environmental reviews were already \nsigned into law last year for the Tahoe Basin, and the Forest Service \nregional manager told me that is going to take their revenue processes \nfrom 800 pages down to 40 pages and allow them to get their forest \nthere back to a sustainable level.\n  We made some very big mistakes 45 years ago, and our forests have \npaid the price. This bill starts the long process of correcting those \nmistakes and recovering our national forests, and I urge its adoption.\n  Mr. Chairman, I include in the Record two letters, one from the South \nTahoe Public Utility District, and the second from the Public Lands \nCouncil and the National Cattlemen's Beef Association, in support of \nH.R. 2936.\n                                                    June 22, 2017.\n     Hon.

National Forest lands \n     are the largest single source of water in the U.S. and in \n     some regions of the west contribute nearly 50% of the overall \n     water supply that supports our farms and cities. The current, \n     unhealthy state of these forests, which contain some of the \n     nation's most valuable watersheds, increases the threat of \n     catastrophic wildfires. These high intensity wildfires \n     jeopardize the reliability, volume and quality of water for \n     tens of millions of\n\n\n     Americans, along with the wildlife, recreational, and multi-\n     purpose value of these lands.\n       The H.R. 2936 supports collaborative forest management, \n     streamlines the environmental review process, addresses the \n     unsustainable practice of fire borrowing, and includes an \n     innovative arbitration process. We believe it is critical \n     that both forest management reforms and resolution of the \n     ``fire borrowing'' issue are addressed in any legislation to \n     ensure on-the-ground forest restoration activities can \n     proceed at the pace and scale of the problem.\n       We appreciate your leadership on this important issue and \n     urge prompt passage of H.R. 2936, the Resilient Federal \n     Forests Act of 2017.\n           Sincerely,\n     National Water Resources Association.\n     Utah Water Users Association.\n     Association of California Water Agencies.\n     Placer County Water Agency.\n     South Tahoe Public Utility District.", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 68}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                                  ____\n\n                                                    June 27, 2017.\n     Hon. Rob Bishop,\n     Chairman, House Natural Resources Committee, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Raul Grijalva,\n     Ranking Member, House Natural Resources Committee, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Bishop and Ranking Member Grijalva: The \n     Public Lands Council (PLC) and the National Cattlemen's Beef \n     Association (NCBA) strongly support H.R. 2936, the Resilient \n     Federal Forests Act of 2017, introduced by Rep. Bruce \n     Westerman (R-Ark.). PLC is the only national organization \n     dedicated solely to representing the roughly 22,000 ranchers \n     who operate on federal lands. NCBA is the beef industry's \n     largest and oldest national marketing and trade association, \n     representing American cattlemen and women who provide much of \n     the nation's supply of food and own or manage a large portion \n     of America's private property.\n       The Resilient Federal Forests Act will expedite \n     environmental reviews and assessments for the removal of dead \n     trees and set deadlines for reforestation projects to occur. \n     Such changes ensure forests are no longer neglected and \n     establish a healthier management pattern. Further, this \n     legislation discourages frivolous litigation by requiring \n     litigants who oppose a management project to come to the \n     table with an alternative, rather than just tying up agency \n     time and resources in court. The bill provides an incentive \n     for collaborative efforts between local governments, local \n     stakeholders and federal land management agencies. Finally, \n     the legislation prevents ``fire borrowing'' and stops federal \n     agencies from raiding accounts necessary for proper forest \n     and range management.\n       The severe mismanagement of federally-owned forests and \n     rangelands, due to outdated environmental laws and \n     regulations along with the abuse of the legal system by \n     radical special interest groups, creates devastating economic \n     hardship and danger for our members and rural communities \n     across the west. The livestock industry and rural economies \n     will spend decades attempting to recover from millions of \n     dollars' worth of infrastructure damage and forage loss that \n     have been the result of catastrophic wildfires in recent \n     years, not to mention the loss of valuable wildlife habitats.\n       It is scientifically proven that proper timber management \n     and rangeland management through grazing is the key to \n     maintaining healthy forests and preventing catastrophic \n     wildfires. However, according to the BLM, livestock grazing \n     has been reduced on BLM lands by as much as 50 percent since \n     1971, while the timber industry has been all but destroyed \n     over the last 30 years, due almost entirely to federal laws \n     and regulations and predatory environmental groups. \n     Restrictions have allowed the accumulation of fuel, \n     increasing risk of wildfires and leading to harm of forest \n     ecosystems and western communities--the watershed, wildlife, \n     air quality, rural communities and the taxpayers are all \n     negatively impacted.\n       PLC and NCBA believe that H.R. 2936 is a positive step \n     forward to returning management flexibility and fiscal \n     responsibility to the federal land management agencies. PLC \n     and NCBA appreciate the opportunity to provide our input on \n     behalf of our members--the nation's food and fiber producers. \n     H.R. 2936 is proactive, common sense legislation, and we \n     would encourage the committee to pass the bill out of \n     committee without delay.\n           Sincerely,\n     Dave Eliason,\n       President, Public Lands Council.\n     Craig Uden,\n       President, National Cattlemen's Beef Association.\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 69}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "G000551", "text": "  Mr. GRIJALVA.

Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman from Arizona for \nyielding.\n  Mr. Chairman, this bill that we are debating today has been touted as \nCongress' solution to the longstanding issue of fire borrowing that has \nplagued the Forest Service.\n  I represent a district that has experienced a lot of wildfire. \nThankfully, the recent devastating fires in the North Bay were not \ncaused by this fire-borrowing issue. They did not involve Federal \npublic lands. However, I have had a lot of wildfire in my district over \nthe years, and fire borrowing is a top priority for me. Unfortunately, \nas it is currently written, this bill introduces more problems than \nsolutions on this issue. Let me explain.\n  The title in the bill pertaining to fire borrowing repurposes the \nStafford Act, which Congress enacted to provide assistance to State and \nlocal governments in case of emergencies. This requires Congress to \nappropriate the 10-year average for wildfire suppression before the \nForest Service can access emergency funds. That is not the way to solve \nthis problem. In fact, I saw that just yesterday the administration \nissued a SAP because of this problematic provision.\n  If Congress is serious about fixing the budget issue, we should be \nmaking funds available ahead of an emergency situation, and we should \nremove the cost of fighting catastrophic fires from the agency's base \nbudget. That will enable them to invest in proactive measures to make \nour forests more resilient and healthy.\n  Although the Rules Committee added title XI to this bill, which \nincreased the overall cap for disaster spending, the problems with \nusing the Stafford Act approach still remain.\n  The second point. This bill, essentially, is a gutting of \nenvironmental protections and an attack on sustainable forest \nmanagement that threatens equal access to justice. We should just call \nit what it is.\n  Title I of this bill allows intensive logging projects of 10,000 to \n30,000 acres each. That is as big as the entire city of San Francisco. \nProjects of that size can proceed on Federal public lands without any \nenvironmental review under NEPA, without any compliance with the \nEndangered Species Act.\n  Title II of the bill eliminates the requirement that the Forest \nService consult with the Fish and Wildlife Service and, essentially, \nlet's the Forest Service decide for itself if it wants to follow the \nEndangered Species Act consultation requirements regarding any of its \nprojects on public lands.\n  Title III further chokes judicial review by prohibiting the recovery \nof attorneys' fees for any challenges to forest management activity \nunder the Equal Access to Justice Act, including meritorious successful \nchallenges. This severely limits public review of logging projects on \nFederal public lands.\n  How would any of these measures promote forest health? It wouldn't. \nSo let's call this bill what it is. It is an environmental wrecking \nball that weakens standards and protections, limits public \nparticipation in the review of Federal agency actions, and won't make \nour forests any healthier or safer.", "turn": 56, "speaker": "Mr. HUFFMAN", "itemno": 71}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "B001250", "text": "  Mr. BISHOP of Utah.

We \nhave all seen the devastation across the State, ranging from the Sierra \nNevada to the Bay area, and even the wine country. Even today, CalFire \nand Forest Service personnel remain deployed on fires across the State.\n  Ensuring that the Forest Service returns to active management of our \nforests is critical to promoting forest health and helping reduce the \nrisks and likeliness of catastrophic wildfires that we have seen \nalready this year.\n  The Resilient Federal Forests Act includes what I believe to be \ncritically important reforms to forest management, such as expedited \nenvironmental reviews and availability of categorical exclusion for \nforest management activities, to help achieve these needed goals.\n  In California, there are six national monuments managed by the Forest \nService or jointly between the Forest Service and BLM. Oftentimes, \nmanagement activities in these areas are highly restricted, which only \nleads to hazardous fuels buildup and increased risk\n\n\nof catastrophic fires. We see the results every year in the West.\n  H.R. 2936 clearly identifies certain national forest lands that these \nprovisions do not apply to. This includes wilderness areas, national or \nState inventoried roadless areas, or areas where timber harvesting is \nprohibited by statute.\n  However, it is my belief that provisions of this bill, Mr. Chairman--\nbased on the definition of National Forest System lands in the bill--\napply to all other Forest Service lands not explicitly prohibited in \nthe bill.\n  Respectfully, I would like to clarify with the chairman that it is \nhis intent that provisions in title I and title II of H.R. 2936 apply \nto all other Federal lands managed by the United States Forest Service. \nThis includes national monuments managed by the Forest Service.\n  Mr. Chairman, I thank the chairman for his work on this critical \nbill.", "turn": 58, "speaker": "Mr. LaMALFA", "itemno": 73}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "B001250", "text": "  Mr. BISHOP of Utah.

Mr. Chair, I thank Chairman Bishop for his tireless \nefforts to see our government do better on our Federal lands.\n  Mr. Chairman, I recently made a trip out to Montana to visit some of \nour National Forests and the rural communities they border. These \nforests, much like many areas across our country, have been mismanaged \nfor decades, and the ones that have not already been destroyed are ripe \nto be devastated by insects, disease, or catastrophic wildfire, not \nbecause of some action taken by the Forest Service, but just the \nopposite. Because of no actions, our forests are overstocked, \nunderutilized, and unhealthy.\n  We have seen nearly 9 million acres of forest, an area larger than \nthe State of Maryland, go up in flames just this year, spewing tens of \nmillions of tons of carbon and thick smoke into the atmosphere.\n  Don't get me wrong. 32,000 full-time Forest Service personnel are \nbusy and working hard trying to manage the 193 million acres of \ntimberland across our great country, but they are spinning their wheels \nand making very little progress.\n  Mr. Chairman, that is a forest the size of Texas and South Carolina \ncombined. According to scientists at the Forest Service, 80 million \nacres of that, an area the size of the State of New Mexico, is in a \ncondition that is subject to catastrophic wildfire.\n  These fires are not only creating a forest health crisis, they are a \npublic health crisis. They kill trees, they kill wildlife and \nlivestock. These fires not only kill livelihoods, they create \nunbearable health concerns and living conditions with their thick smoke \nand ash. On top of all that, they are killing people.\n  It shouldn't be this way and it doesn't have to be this way.\n  This bill simply allows sound, scientifically-based forestry \npractices, like the ones I learned at Yale's Forestry School, to be \nimplemented on our Federal forests.

Our enemies are not \nenvironmental extremists that are impeding science and causing some \npeople to love our trees to death. Our enemy is not even the United \nStates Senate.\n\n  Mr. Chairman, our enemy is catastrophic wildfire that destroys our \nforests. Our enemies are insects and diseases that kill our trees, and \nwe are feathering their arrows with inaction. We are feathering their \narrows with bureaucratic red tape.

Rob Bishop,\n     Chairman, House Natural Resources Committee,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Raul Grijalva,\n     Ranking Democrat, House Natural Resources Committee, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Bishop and Cong. Grijalva: Our organizations \n     which represent millions of hunters, anglers, recreational \n     shooters and other conservationists express our strong \n     support for H.R. 2936, the Resilient Federal Forests Act of \n     2017. We respectfully urge you to take expeditious Committee \n     action on H.R. 2936, which if enacted, will improve the \n     health of our federal forests and reduce costly wildfires. \n     Our nation's federal lands play a vital role in maintaining \n     healthy forests that are resilient to threats at a landscape \n     level from fire, pests, disease and insects. Through \n     incentives and expedited process, consistent with informed \n     science, the bill will help ensure that timber harvest and \n     the creation of young forest habitat for wildlife remains \n     viable on US Forest Service (USFS) and Bureau of Land \n     Management (BLM) lands. Additionally, it remedies the budget \n     fire-funding problem (borrowing from other line items) that \n     our country faces when fighting catastrophic wildfires.\n       Our organizations much appreciate that the fire-funding \n     problem is addressed in HR 2936. While most catastrophic \n     fires occur in the western United States, this is a national \n     problem because the funds for every national forest and \n     public land unit are affected. This remedy will prevent the \n     USFS and BLM from having to borrow from other appropriated \n     budget line-items (for example, wildfire prevention, \n     wildlife, recreation and water quality) to pay for the cost \n     of catastrophic fire suppression, which cost now consumes \n     over 50% of the USFS budget. We respectfully urge the \n     Committee to further protect the USFS budget by capping the \n     10-year average of catastrophic fire costs at its current \n     level. The USFS uses this 10-year average to build their \n     budget request for the President. The 10-year average \n     continues to rise and unless it is capped it will continue to \n     erode other important budget line items such as wildlife, \n     water quality, fire prevention and recreation as the USFS \n     constructs its budget request.\n       All forest management plans are conducted with public \n     input, and all projects undergo National Environmental Policy \n     Act (NEPA) analysis. The bill's use of the Categorical \n     Exclusion (CE) under the NEPA rules from the Council on \n     Environmental Quality, will allow routine projects with known \n     effects to be implemented more efficiently and cost-\n     effectively to achieve the forest's desired future condition, \n     as outlined in the forest management plan. Certain forest \n     management treatments previously analyzed under NEPA in order \n     to deal with issues such as pests and disease, hazardous \n     fuels, critical habitats for threatened or endangered \n     species, salvage facilitation, and water quality, do not need \n     re-analysis on each similar project. These projects are \n     routine, reoccurring activities with known effects, already \n     fully analyzed and therefore qualify for CEs from repeated \n     analysis.\n       We also appreciate the increase in acreage ceilings for the \n     statutorily endorsed CEs. Early successional stage forest \n     habitat, for instance, cannot be just incidental to be \n     effective in providing habitat for deer, ruffed grouse, elk, \n     wild turkey, neo-tropical migratory songbirds and other \n     species which are dependent on this habitat type. While an \n     acreage ceiling is an easy metric to measure success, the \n     desired forest future condition should really determine the \n     size of the management activity. Additionally, as stated in \n     the bill, all CEs must avoid sensitive areas and must be \n     consistent with standards and guidelines in approved Forest \n     Plans.\n       Our organizations appreciate changes made to make more \n     prominent in federal statute the states' authority to manage \n     fish and wildlife on USFS and BLM lands. Nothing in the bill \n     language is intended to change any existing federal, state or \n     tribal authority. It simply makes more evident the state-\n     federal jurisdictional relationship which Congress has \n     affirmed. Federal-state cooperation in this arena is \n     compelled because the USFS and BLM own the land and thus the \n     habitat, and the state fish and wildlife agencies manage the \n     fish and wildlife. Robust cooperation will provide that both \n     land/habitat objectives and fish and wildlife population \n     objectives are met.\n       Additionally, our groups support the proposed common-sense \n     amendments to the Endangered Species Act (ESA). First, the \n     bill overturns the Cottonwood decision, which directs that if \n     additional critical habitat is designated under an approved \n     forest plan or resource management plan, a section 7 \n     programmatic re-consultation of the entire forest plan needs \n     to be done. The US Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) and the \n     Obama Administration argued that the section 7 consultation \n     needs only to be done on the portion of the project covering \n     the additionally designated acreage of critical habitat. This \n     remedy will greatly reduce the debilitating process that the \n     federal court decision directs. Second, the bill affirms that \n     no ESA section 7 consultation is required if the USFS or BLM \n     determine during informal consultation that the proposed \n     action is ``not likely to adversely affect a species or \n     designated critical habitat'', which is already USFWS policy. \n     And third, if any consultation on a categorical exclusion \n     established by the bill is not concluded after 90 days, the \n     action shall be considered to have not violated section \n     7(a)(2) of the ESA.\n       We also support the bill's provisions expediting large \n     scale restoration after catastrophic wildfires. We likewise \n     support the prohibition on restraining orders and preliminary \n     injunctions. It is imperative that we work to restore \n     wildfire-impacted lands for the ecological health of the \n     immediate area and surrounding landscape, protection of the \n     watershed, and economic vitality of the local communities.\n       Our organizations further appreciate the process relief \n     provided to National Forest Plans and potentially Resources \n     Management Plans developed by collaborative deliberation. It \n     is appropriate that a collaborative-developed plan, which \n     often takes years to deliberate and conclude, be subject to \n     only two options under NEPA, proceed or not proceed. It is \n     very reasonable to assume that the collaboratively \n     deliberated process has examined and rejected the other \n     options, and only the action or no action alternatives need \n     be analyzed.\n       The bill's establishment of a pilot binding arbitration \n     process as an alternative to litigation in each Forest \n     Service Region is certainly welcomed. Not only is the cost of \n     defending the land management plan a burden on the agencies, \n     but the planned for management work on the ground is lost, \n     perhaps never to be resurrected on that site. We find much \n     merit in this improved approach as an alternative to the \n     proposal in H.R. 2647 from the last Congress, and commend \n     Cong. Westerman and the Committee for settling on this. \n     Uninformed litigation has led to federal forest management by \n     the federal courts; we need to return forest management to \n     the federal and state professionals with public input as \n     provided for by the established processes.\n       H.R. 2936 makes significant improvements to and would \n     expedite the process that governs approval of the USFS and \n     BLM management plans. We urge that your Committee \n     expeditiously report this bill from the Committee to the \n     House floor. We look forward to continuing to work with you \n     to move this bill quickly through the legislative process.\n       Thank you for your consideration of our community's \n     perspectives.\n       Archery Trade Association, Association of Fish and Wildlife \n     Agencies, (Boone and Crockett Club, Catch-a-Dream Foundation, \n     Congressional Sportsmen's Foundation, Conservation Force, \n     Council to Advance Hunting and the Shooting Sports, Delta \n     Waterfowl, Houston Safari Club, Mule Deer Foundation, \n     National Association of Forest Service Retirees, National \n     Rifle Association.\n       National Shooting Sports Foundation, National Wild Turkey \n     Federation, Professional Outfitters and Guides Association, \n     Public\n\n\n     Lands Foundation, Quality Deer Management Association, Rocky \n     Mountain Elk Foundation, Ruffed Grouse Society, Safari Club \n     International, Whitetails Unlimited, Wild Sheep Foundation, \n     Wildlife Forever, Wildlife Management Institute, Wildlife \n     Mississippi.", "turn": 67, "speaker": "Mr. WESTERMAN", "itemno": 82}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                                  ____\n\n                                           National Association of\n\n\n                                              State Foresters,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 13, 2017.\n     Chairman Rob Bishop,\n     House Natural Resources Committee, House of Representatives, \n         Washington, DC.\n     Ranking Member Raul M. Grijalva,\n     House Natural Resources Committee, House of Representatives, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Bishop and Ranking Member Grijalva: The \n     National Association of State Foresters (NASF) is pleased to \n     provide comments on the Resilient Federal Forests Act of \n     2017. NASF represents the heads of state forestry agencies in \n     all fifty states, the District of Columbia and the US \n     Territories. Through the development of comprehensive State \n     Forest Action Plans our members maintain a broad view of the \n     full set of forestry ownerships within their authority, \n     including federally owned forest lands. For citizens of the \n     United States to realize a full set of forest related \n     benefits, federal lands need to provide a complete and \n     balanced set of environmental, economic and social values.\n       In February of 2016 our organization adopted a formal \n     position on desired reforms to federal land management \n     policy. Suggestions are organized around:\n       Reforms that would allow federal lands to develop a more \n     balanced set of social, environmental and economic benefits;\n       Reforms that would lower the costs of agency \n     administration, planning, regulatory compliance and \n     litigation, and\n       Reforms that would enable vegetation management to be \n     carried out at a scope, scale and pace sufficient to create \n     more sustainable and resilient landscape conditions.\n       We feel this bill would indeed create the end results our \n     members support as our members want to see more active \n     management of federal forest lands. Expedited planning and \n     analysis, prompt response to catastrophic events, alternative \n     dispute resolution, greater collaboration and less costly \n     litigation are all outcomes that for which we strongly \n     advocate. In addition, we're encouraged to see some desired \n     modification to Good Neighbor Authority allowing road repair \n     to be part of cooperative projects, as well as support for \n     giving the land management agencies the opportunity to make \n     their own determinations of endangered species jeopardy or \n     adverse effects. Finally, NASF appreciates that this \n     discussion draft recognizes the need to solve the wildfire \n     suppression funding issue. We look forward to working with \n     the House Natural Resources Subcommittee on Federal Lands and \n     Congressman Bruce Westerman to ensure that a solution \n     addresses both fire borrowing and the erosion of the Forest \n     Service's budget over-time due to increasing wildfire \n     suppression costs.\n       We recently provided comments on federal land management \n     reform to the House Natural Resources Committee's \n     Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations. One additional \n     suggestion we made there and would repeat here is to \n     ``Require that National Forest Management Plans specifically \n     address how they support State Forest Action Plans. In \n     addition, encourage regular consultation with State Foresters \n     by National Forest System leadership to ensure their annual \n     programs of work are dovetailed where appropriate.''\n       Thank you for this opportunity to comment. We would be \n     happy to answer any questions or provide any additional \n     information that might be of assistance.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                                 Bill Crapser,\n\n                                           Wyoming State Forester,\n         President of the National Association of State Foresters.\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 83}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "B001250", "text": "  Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. DeFazio. Mr. Chair, I voted for last Congress' version of this \nbill, one of 19 Democrats to do so. It wasn't perfect, but the bill was \nstep in the right direction. I hoped the Senate would improve it and we \nwould finally make needed changes forest management and fix ``fire \nborrowing.'' But the Senate never acted on it, or on any other forest \nmanagement bill.\n  In the 113th Congress, I worked with Reps. Schrader and Walden and \ncrafted a bipartisan bill to create a long-term solution to properly \nmanage statutorily unique forestlands in Western Oregon. It would have \ndevoted nearly 1.3 million acres for sustainable timber production for \nlocal mills, created thousands of private sector jobs, and provided \nmuch-needed revenue for our rural counties. The legislation was \nincluded in a larger bill which passed the House in September 2014. \nAgain, the Senate failed to act.\n  Like last Congress, there are provisions in this bill I support. \nHowever, there are provisions that I cannot support. For example, the \nbill doubles the amount of acres exempt from nearly all environmental \nanalysis for projects up to 10,000 acres, and in some cases 30,000 \nacres, nearly 47 square miles.\n  I agree there is a need to need to increase the pace and size of \nforest restoration projects. But the Forest Service and BLM already \nhave many tools to accomplish more management objectives. What they \nneed is funding to complete projects. In fact, Forest Service NEPA \nexperts have initiated a comprehensive review to determine \nopportunities, already allowed under law, to increase efficiencies and \nmanagement tools to expedite environmental review, including proposing \nnew categorical exclusions.\n  It's true that in some cases the Forest Service and BLM don't use \nauthority they have because of legitimate concerns about the threat of \nlitigation and the accompanying expenses it incurs. But it is \ndisingenuous for us to claim that this bill, or any forest management \nbill, is a miraculous fix to harvest more timber, improve forest \nrestoration, or reduce fuels to reduce the threat of catastrophic \nwildfires, without Congress providing funding to do so. In fact, \naccording to the Forest Service, in Oregon there are over 1.8 million \nacres of treatment projects that are ``shovel ready,'' meaning all \nenvironmental analysis has been completed. But they stay on the shelf, \nbecause the Forest Service doesn't have the funds to complete them.\n  We've all seen the destruction from this year's severe fire season. \nHomes and businesses were destroyed, and dozens of lives were lost in \nNorthern California. In my district, over 300,000 acres burned. The \nForest Service says that nationally there are now more than 44 million \nhomes are within the Wildland Urban Interface, at high risk of burning \nin a wildfire.\n  In 2004, Congress passed, on a bipartisan basis, the Healthy Forests \nRestoration Act, which if properly implemented would go a long way to \nreduce the threat of wildfires in our communities. It authorized up to \n20 million acres to be treated to remove hazard fuels in the Wildland \nand Urban Interface, as well as protect municipal water supplies from \ncatastrophic wildfires. We authorized $760 million annually to perform \nthe work. So far, thirteen years later, only 2.5 million acres have \nbeen treated.\n  Why is that? We have never come close to appropriating enough funding \nto get the job done. In Fiscal Year 2017, Congress appropriated $390 \nmillion for hazardous fuels reduction.\n  As always, I stand ready to work with my colleagues on both sides of \nthe aisle to improve forest management and help our rural communities \nget back on their feet.

That makes sense. All these \nactivities are very appropriate as designated activities for \ncategorical exclusions.\n  Listing timber production as a designated activity, I believe, does \nnot work in this context. Timber is a byproduct of all those \nactivities. Therefore, it is unnecessary to actually include it as a \nspecific designated activity.\n  Our amendment simply strikes timber production from the list of \ndesignated activities for categorical exclusion under section 111.

Mr. Chairman, my amendment strikes section 311 from the \nbill. This section would create a forced arbitration program for \nforestry management. This section of the bill, in my view, usurps \njudicial oversight. While many agencies conduct quasi-judicial \nproceedings, there are still agency actions that are appealable to the \ncourts.\n  Judicial oversight and separation of powers is a core principle of \nour democracy. The arbitration would be binding, effectively making the \nSecretary of Agriculture the final judge and depriving the courts of \ntheir oversight role.\n  While the bill terms this as discretionary arbitration, the \ndiscretion ultimately lies only with the Secretary of Agriculture. The \npublic has no discretion over whether to submit to binding arbitration \nor not.\n  The public's right to challenge an action or inaction in court is an \nimportant check on the executive branch. Shielding an agency from \nreview by independent Federal courts could harm access to justice.\n  The Secretary of Agriculture can designate any objection for binding \narbitration up to ten times per year in each of the nine Forest Service \nregions and each of the 14 State regions.\n\n\n  This allows the Secretary of Agriculture to effectively dismiss about \n230 cases every year. According to the Department of Justice, in 2016, \nthe total amount of civil matters and cases brought against the United \nStates with an environmental or land cause of action was only 350. This \noverly broad power would allow the agency to dismiss some of the most \nproblematic cases every year.\n  The process also likely violates the nondelegation doctrine. That \ndoctrine prohibits the exercise of constitutional authority given to \nany branch of government by another branch or nongovernmental private \nparty.\n  Under the arbitration program set up by this bill, a private party \nobjecting to a management proposal and forced into arbitration would be \nrequired to write their own proposal. The appointed arbitrator could \nthen select that private party proposal as the final plan to be carried \nout by the agency. The arbitrator is not permitted to modify the \nproposal, and the decision would be binding.\n  I understand the need to streamline the process, but I think the \nforced arbitration really deprives people of their access to the \ncourts, and that is why, Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support \nthe amendment.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.", "turn": 86, "speaker": "Mr. KHANNA", "itemno": 240}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "B001250", "text": "  Mr. BISHOP of Utah.

Half of the \nactive management lawsuits of the Federal Forest Service account are \nspent, and 40 percent of all Forest Service lawsuits are brought on \nthis specific point.\n  In addition to that, the Forest Service, in an effort to try and \nmitigate against that, simply tries to delay the processes, which \ncreates a culture of analysis paralysis going through there, and at the \nend they get sued anyway.\n  This provision is one of few creative efforts we have had that does \nnot impact people's access to justice, but having a binding arbitration \npilot program allows us to try and give you the merits of a lawsuit and \nmove forward quickly. This is creative. This is what they need.\n  If we need to end endless litigation, frivolous lawsuits that impede \nthe\n\n\nwork of our land managers and cost taxpayers millions of dollars, this \nis the kind of thing that we need to start doing.

Section 801 proposes that forest \nplans not be considered major Federal actions under the National \nEnvironmental Policy Act of 1969. If this were to become law, local \ninput would be reduced. We should be looking for ways to increase local \nbuy-in, not undermine it.\n  In addition, section 903 proposes to modify the determination of \nextraordinary circumstances so wilderness protections and the \nprotections of the Endangered Species Act do not have to be considered. \nThis is a dangerous provision and allows our bedrock environmental laws \nto be ignored.\n  My commonsense amendment would simply remove these concerning \nsections that allow bureaucrats to make major decisions without \nconsidering all the facts.

Mr. Chair, this year, wildfires have devastated the \nAmerican West. It has been particularly tragic in my home State of \nCalifornia. Entire neighborhoods are gone, and families have been left \nwith nothing.\n  While we know that proper forest management requires burning, we need \nto be able to contain wildfires that threaten communities.\n  This month, wildfires killed 42 people, burned over 245,000 acres, \nand destroyed an estimated 8,900 structures, most of them people's \nfamily homes, according to Cal Fire.\n  The fires aren't just dangerous themselves, they produce thick smoke, \ntoxic ash, and debris that pose long-lasting risks to our health and to \nthe environment.\n  These wildfires continue to grow in frequency and ferocity. We must \nensure that we are using all of the available tools to prevent and \ncontain these fires. That is why I ask that this amendment, which \npromotes innovation in wildfire management, be adopted.\n  The amendment would require the Secretary of Agriculture to conduct a \nstudy evaluating the feasibility, safety, and cost effectiveness of \nusing unmanned aerial vehicles, otherwise known as drones, for the \npurposes of fighting wildfires. It will also study the use of drones \nfor forest restoration and management, which could be effective for \nreplanting remote areas of forest.\n  The Secretary of Agriculture would have to work with several other \nagencies that also deal with wildfire suppression and aviation. This \namendment would require consultation with the Department of \nTransportation and the Federal Aviation Administration to ensure safety \nfor our aircraft and the pilots flying in the same airspace.\n  It would also assess the impact of using drones on employment in the \nU.S. Innovation will take us into the future.\n\n\n  But we need to know, eyes wide open, how this affects the employment \nlandscape of our communities. And that is why these studies are also \nimportant.\n  The Department is required to report to Congress within 2 years of \nenactment. If implemented, I look forward to seeing the results of this \nstudy.

Mr. Chairman, our national forests are overgrown, and the \nthinning projects which would restore them to health are delayed by \nlengthy and costly regulations and litigations. In New Mexico, it takes \na look like this: the top picture is a picture of one of our national \nforests, and the bottom picture is a picture from an area that has been \nthinned.\n  Now, take, for example, the Lincoln National Forest near Ruidoso, the \nMescalero Forest is butted right up against it, so we are able to get a \ngood comparison.\n  Now, typically, the forests in the West look like this: widely spaced \ntrees and mostly grass in between, so when the fires came, they were \ngrass fires. The tree rings show us that every 8 years a fire occurred, \nand it would keep the small underbrush and the small diameter trees, \nthe small, unhealthy ones, it would keep those burned out and our \nforests, again, looked like this.\n  But because all of the thinning projects and all of the timber \nprojects have been canceled for decades now, our forests, instead, look \nlike this. When wildfires happen, they burn catastrophically and burn \neverything in their sight.\n  So my amendment today simply allows the Forest Service to move \nforward on balanced thinning programs in large scale. Typically, they \ndo all of the paperwork, all of the studies for small acreage, maybe 30 \nacres or 50 acres. Since the forests are about a million acres, you \nwould never get through and never get the forest restored to its \nhealth, and that is the problem.\n  The Forest Service has been working with me on the language for this \namendment and submitted almost exact language that we have put here on \nthe floor today. They agree with us that they should restore the forest \nto its health, but the environmental groups and the outside litigation \nhave stopped the programs completely.\n  Now, in New Mexico, this means jobs, but it also means the health of \nour environment, and it means the destruction of endangered species, \nbecause when the fires burn through, we get the effect on the next \npage; again, this is that same Lincoln National Forest that we were \nlooking at just a second ago. This is after the Little Bear fire, which \nburned 255 homes and almost 40,000 acres.\n  We almost lost the entire town of Ruidoso. If the fire had just \ncapped over the mountain, it would have burned straight down the side. \nThe winds were exactly the direction which would have caused that.\n  So the Forest Service is agreeing with us that we need to do some \nthinning, and we are not going to be able to do it without legislative \nlanguage, so this amendment is being offered here today.\n\n\n  We used to have 123 mills working in New Mexico clearing timber, \nprocessing it. We have got vast national\n\n\nforests, and all of those have been shut down. The spotted owl came \nalong in 1993, and the findings from the Fish and Wildlife Service was \nthat logging was the reason that the spotted owl was going extinct.\n  Over 20 years later, Dan Ashe, the head of Fish and Wildlife Service, \nsaid: Oops, we made a mistake and we burned down the West, and we have \nruined our forests over a mistake. There was actually another predator \nout there. We still have the problem to go in and clean up these \nforests before they burn and before they look like this.\n  Another real problem that exists is when we burn our national \nforests, then the watersheds are going to be choked up with mud, with \nash, and with everything else.\n  This is Bonita Lake there in that same Lincoln National Forest near \nRuidoso. It provides the drinking water for several major communities \nin the southern part of the State. That lake was about 75 feet deep, \npristine water, had fish in there. It was a recreational area right in \nthe middle of the national forest.\n  The Forest Service was alarmed at how much damage was going to occur \nto this lake if they didn't log above it, so they put in a project. \nThey were sued and work grounded to a halt. They did not get to thin \nthat area above the lake. A fire occurred, this fire that you just saw \nin the previous slide. Now, that 75-feet-deep lake is filled with 50-\nfeet of mud and ash. It killed all of the fish. It is not suitable for \ndrinking. The community does not have the money in order to drain that \nlake and to refill it.\n  So that is what we find in the West because of these forest \nmanagement processes. My amendment would simply allow the Forest \nService to move forward on large-scale projects. They would still have \nto do all of the studies, everything. They would just be expedited.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.", "turn": 145, "speaker": "Mr. PEARCE", "itemno": 318}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "G000551", "text": "  Mr. GRIJALVA.

Mr. Chairman, this amendment doubles down on the bad \nideas that are in the underlying bill. The 150,000 acre categorical \nexclusion to remove timber from Gila, Lincoln, and Cibola National \nForests has the potential to do more harm than good, and cuts the \nAmerican public out of the decisionmaking process.\n  The Forest Service doesn't need this waiver to harvest trees in New \nMexico. Last year, the Cibola produced 12,000 metric board feet, and \nLincoln and Gila each between 5,000 and 6,000 metric board feet. These \nare average production numbers across the region.\n  So I am not sure what problem this amendment is trying to address or \nhow exempting 150,000-acre projects from the environmental review helps \nthe Forest Service meet their mandate of protecting habitat, \nwatersheds, and providing recreational opportunities.\n  This amendment also exempts the Forest Service from the consultation \nrequirements and the Endangered Species Act. Logging projects \nuntethered from the bedrock environmental protections could potentially \nimpact several species which depend on these forests for habitat, \nincluding the Mexican spotted owl and the Gila trout.\n  Active forest management is not a bad thing if it is done \nresponsibly.

Mr. Chair, this amendment would not resolve the issue \nthat my friend from New Mexico has just brought up. The Statement of \nAdministrative Policy from the executive branch raises the concerns of \nH.R. 2936 and of the land management reforms, which are in the \nlegislation.\n  It says: ``The administration, however, has concerns about the \nlegislation's revision to the Stafford Act, which would force \ncompetition for funding between wildfires on Federal land and other \ndisasters already covered by the Stafford Act, including hurricanes.''\n  It also says that the legislation doesn't really address the issue of \nfire borrowing, which is central to dealing effectively and proactively \nwith wildfires, both prevention, and suppression, as the resource is \nneeded.\n  Mr. Chairman, I include in the Record the Statement of Administrative \nPolicy by the Trump administration. I also include another Statement of \nAdministrative Policy dated July 8, 2015, which is on the same \nlegislation, but by then-President Obama, which mirrors and reflects \nthe same concerns brought up by the executive branch of President \nTrump.\n\n                   Statement of Administration Policy\n\n\nh.r. 293--resilient federal forests act of 2017--rep. westerman, r-ar, \n                           and 18 cosponsors\n\n       The Administration strongly believes that funding for \n     wildland fire management must be addressed in order to enable \n     the Forest Service and the Department of the Interior to \n     better manage the Nation's forests and other public lands. \n     The Administration's second disaster funding request, \n     submitted to Congress on October 4, 2017, underscored this \n     belief. The request also noted the Administration's belief \n     that land management reforms are critical to solving the \n     problem of ``fire borrowing''--taking funds from forest \n     management programs to cover fire costs that exceed \n     appropriations--in a comprehensive manner, rather than \n     through a funding-only approach.\n       The Administration appreciates the intent of H.R. 2936, the \n     Resilient Federal Forests Act of 2017, and is supportive of \n     land management reforms like those outlined in the \n     legislation. The Administration, however, has concerns about \n     the legislation's revisions to the Stafford Act, which would \n     force competition for funding between wildfires on Federal \n     land and other disasters already covered by the Stafford Act, \n     including hurricanes.\n     Wildland Fire Management Funding\n       Last year, Federal wildfire suppression spending reached \n     $2.9 billion, an amount that signals clearly the need for \n     Congress to address the rising cost of fire suppression \n     operations. The dependence on ``fire borrowing'' to cover \n     funding shortfalls in times of severe wildfire impedes the \n     missions of our land management agencies, including by taking \n     critical funding from programs that help reduce the risk of \n     catastrophic fire, restore and maintain healthy functioning \n     ecosystems, and yield timber production.\n       The Administration, however, has concerns with re-purposing \n     the Stafford Act to address wildfires. The purpose of the \n     Stafford Act is to assist State, local, tribal, and \n     territorial (SLTT) governments that become overwhelmed when \n     responding to and recovering from natural disasters affecting \n     their jurisdictions. H.R. 2936 would modify the Stafford Act \n     by creating a new type of disaster declaration to address the \n     cost of wildfire suppression on Federal land, thereby \n     changing long-standing principles governing Federal support \n     to SLTT governments. As we have seen in this year's historic \n     Atlantic hurricane season, the Federal Emergency Management \n     Agency (FEMA) must continue to be focused on its existing \n     mission, and the Stafford Act's Disaster Relief Fund must \n     remain dedicated solely to that mission.\n       Instead of the approach outlined in H.R. 2936, the \n     Administration supports a separate, annual cap adjustment for \n     wildfire suppression operations, which will resolve concerns \n     about the sufficiency of funds for wildfire suppression and \n     avoid unnecessary competition for Stafford Act funds.\n     Improving Forest Management\n       The Administration appreciates H.R. 2936's recognition that \n     fixing the funding component of fire borrowing will not, on \n     its own, stop the worsening trend of catastrophic wildfires. \n     Meaningful forest management reforms to strengthen our \n     ability to restore the Nation's forests and improve their \n     resilience to destructive wildfires must be a part\n\n\n     of any permanent solution. H.R. 2936's provisions that \n     expedite environmental approval for proactive forest \n     management, including hazardous fuel reduction and post-fire \n     timber salvage and reforestation actions, are important steps \n     forward. The Administration supports and will continue to \n     work with Congress on the details of the forest management \n     reform proposals.\n       Although the Administration has concerns with H.R. 2936's \n     modifications to the Stafford Act, the Administration will \n     continue working with Congress to enact a sustainable \n     solution to ``fire borrowing'' that does not adversely affect \n     FEMA's critical disaster relief funding and that recognizes \n     the need for a comprehensive solution to the problem of \n     wildfires.", "turn": 150, "speaker": "Mr. GRIJALVA", "itemno": 323}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                                  ____\n\n\n                   Statement of Administration Policy\n\n\nh.r. 2647--resilient federal forests act of 2015--rep. westerman, r-ar, \n                           and 13 cosponsors\n\n       The Administration strongly opposes H.R. 2647. The most \n     important step Congress can take to increase the pace and \n     scale of forest restoration and management of the national \n     forests and Department of the Interior (DOI) lands is to fix \n     fire suppression funding and provide additional capacity for \n     the Forest Service and DOI to manage the Nation's forests and \n     other public lands. H.R. 2647 falls short of fixing the fire \n     budget problem and contains other provisions that will \n     undermine collaborative forest restoration, environmental \n     safeguards, and public participation across the National \n     Forest System and public lands.\n     Wildland Fire Management Funding\n       The Administration appreciates that there is bipartisan \n     agreement that wildland fire management funding needs a \n     legislative fix. The reasons are clear: in fiscal year (FY) \n     1995, the Forest Service in the Department of Agriculture \n     (USDA) spent 16 percent of its budget on firefighting. Today \n     the agency spends more than half of its budget on fire \n     management activities. This fundamentally impedes its \n     missions, including taking critical funding from programs \n     that help reduce the risk of catastrophic fire, maintain \n     healthy functioning ecosystems, and yield timber production.\n       The wildland fire funding fix in the President's FY 2016 \n     Budget provides the necessary resources for the Forest \n     Service as well as DOI to address wildland fire suppression \n     and rehabilitation needs without resorting to detrimental \n     transfers from other critical forest landscape resilience \n     priorities. Under this fix, which includes a discretionary \n     budget cap adjustment, the Forest Service and DOI could tap \n     disaster funds once they spend 70 percent of their 10-year \n     average of suppression spending, which is the amount of \n     suppression funding requested within the discretionary budget \n     caps. Providing this certainty would preserve critical \n     resources for hazardous fuel reduction and other essential \n     landscape restoration projects, allowing for more acres to be \n     treated, and thereby reducing the risk of fire, and the \n     degree of fire destruction.\n       The Administration's proposal would immediately increase \n     the Forest Service's capacity to plan and execute restoration \n     projects--including the FY 2016 Budget projection for timber \n     volume sold from 2.9 billion board feet in FY 2014 to 3.2 \n     billion board feet.\n       In contrast, the requirement in H.R. 2647 to fully fund the \n     ten-year average for wildland fire suppression would mean \n     that less funding is available each year in the agencies' \n     budgets for restoration and risk reduction programs as it is \n     diverted to the ever-increasing ten-year average.\n       Additionally, the bill repurposes the Stafford Act. The \n     purpose of the Stafford Act is to provide Federal assistance \n     to State, local, and tribal governments to alleviate disaster \n     suffering and facilitate recovery. This bill would instead \n     establish a sub-account within the Department of Homeland \n     Security's Federal Emergency Management Agency's Disaster \n     Relief Fund (DRF) to provide funding for USDA and DOI to \n     perform wildland fire suppression operations on Federal land \n     when suppression funding is exhausted and the President has \n     issued a disaster declaration for such fires. A proposed sub-\n     account under the DRF should not be used to redirect DRF \n     resources in support of non-Stafford responsibilities or to \n     circumvent existing major disaster declarations processes.\n     Undermining Fundamental Environmental Safeguards\n       The Administration takes seriously the management of \n     Federal lands consistent with the principles of multiple-use \n     and sustained-yield that are fundamental to the National \n     Forest Management Act and the Federal Land Management and \n     Policy Act and in accordance with long-standing environmental \n     laws including the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), \n     the Clean Water Act, and the Endangered Species Act, among \n     others. Application of these environmental laws ensures that \n     management activities recognize the economic benefits of \n     Federal lands and the wide range of goods and services that \n     these lands produce.\n       At the President's direction, Federal agencies, like the \n     Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management, are working \n     diligently to promote efficiencies in the permitting and land \n     management process. For example, the Forest Service has \n     established additional categorical exclusions for restoration \n     work, has expanded the use of focused environmental \n     assessments, is using adaptive management to allow decisions \n     to last longer, and is better training employees to take \n     advantage of new efficiencies. The Forest Service is also \n     developing new approaches in the wake of catastrophic fires, \n     such as the response to the Rim Fire, which burned 257,000 \n     acres in the summer of 2013, in which the Stanislaus National \n     Forest finalized its NEPA work for restoration and salvage in \n     one year. The Forest Service is also developing projects \n     across larger areas, thereby utilizing efficiencies and \n     providing a longer term and more certain timber supply for \n     local mills. For example, the Black Hills National Forest is \n     implementing a landscape scale approach across 200,000 acres \n     for treating current and future pine beetle outbreaks.\n       H.R. 2647 includes several provisions that will undermine \n     collaborative, landscape-scale forest restoration by \n     undermining public trust in forest management projects and by \n     limiting public participation in decision-making. The \n     Administration has substantial concerns with the design and \n     scale of the categorical exclusions, provisions related to \n     post-fire salvage and restoration (including unrealistic \n     timelines for environmental assessments), and unrealistic \n     targets for reforestation given current budgetary resources.\n       The Administration has serious concerns with provisions in \n     the bill related to the Resources Advisory Committees (RACs). \n     The Administration opposes provisions that limit the \n     discretion of RACs by requiring 50 percent of Secure Rural \n     Schools Act Title II funding be spent on timber management \n     projects. H.R. 2647 also assumes RACs can fulfill the role of \n     local forest collaboratives in designing forest restoration \n     projects, though the RACs were not specially set up to do \n     this and in many cases may not have the breadth of \n     stakeholder interest and expertise to do so effectively. \n     Additionally, the Administration opposes restrictions in the \n     bill on the membership of RACs.\n       Furthermore, the Administration opposes provisions in the \n     bill that require litigants to post a bond when challenging \n     forest restoration projects. As the Forest Service has \n     demonstrated, the best way to address concerns about \n     litigation is to develop restoration projects in partnership \n     with broad stakeholder interests through a transparent \n     process informed by the best available science. Lastly, the \n     bill should include stronger protections for ecologically \n     sensitive areas, tribal sacred sites, and other important \n     lands.\n       For the reasons set forth above, the Administration \n     strongly opposes H.R. 2647. The Administration looks forward \n     to continued engagement with Congress to address forest \n     management issues, which must begin by providing the Forest \n     Service and DOI with a comprehensive fix to the fire budget \n     problem.\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 324}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "G000551", "text": "  Mr. GRIJALVA.
