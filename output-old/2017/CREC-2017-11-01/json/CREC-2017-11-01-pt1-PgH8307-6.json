Mr. Speaker, this week, we will see on the floor the \nChampioning Healthy Kids Act. It will include a number of different \nreforms, which will include the Children's Health Insurance Program, \nthe CHAMPION Act, and my bill, the CARE Act.\n  We must increase access throughout our communities across the \ncountry. By expanding our residency program, we will see new doctors, \nespecially in these underserved areas. Expanding our residency program \nwill allow our medical schools to have people in our communities \npracticing medicine, and, ultimately, filling this doctor shortage that \nwe have today.\n  I look forward to the passing of the Championing Healthy Kids Act, \nwhich will, again, help our children with their health insurance \ncoverage and expand our residency program at a much-needed time.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. DENHAM", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "177", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H8307", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "1", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "CHAMPIONING HEALTHY KIDS", "id": "CREC-2017-11-01-pt1-PgH8307-6", "title": "CHAMPIONING HEALTHY KIDS"}
