Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Speaker, the terrorist attack last night in New York City comes \nas a devastating reminder that the enemies of liberty will not cease.\n  Eight people were killed and 11 more were injured in what law \nenforcement officials are now calling New York's deadliest terror \nattack since 9/11.\n  The perpetrator of this attack was radicalized domestically by ISIS, \nhighlighting the grave threat posed by this terrorist propaganda.\n  Mr. Speaker, the terrorist last night was an immigrant from \nUzbekistan, but we know that even within our midst, there are Americans \nwho sympathize with those who seek to destroy our freedom.\n\n\n  As many as 250 American citizens have sought to travel to Syria, and \nmore than 100 have joined ISIS' ranks. Many of these individuals have \nreceived terrorist training while overseas. Some are under the command \nand control of terrorist leaders who have instructed them to attack the \nUnited States whenever. Others are inspired by the perverted ideology \nof hate that the terrorists post on social media sites. Many of these \nare American social media sites.\n  These American citizens are a direct threat to our homeland. \nUnfortunately, our current safeguards are insufficient to protect us \nagainst such vulnerability.\n  In 2014, a 22-year-old Florida native became the first American to \ncarry out a suicide bombing in Syria. He had battled hard and been \ntrained by al-Qaida's Syrian affiliate for some time. This same \nAmerican was waved through U.S. border inspections when he traveled \nhome to Florida a year earlier.\n  After spending some time in Florida, the man made his way back to \nSyria to kill in the name of al-Qaida. When he ultimately blew himself \nup in May of 2014, al-Qaida released a video of his last will and \ntestament. He said: ``You think you are safe where you are in America. \nYou are not safe.''\n  Mr. Speaker, today we are at a dangerous crossroad. As ISIS loses \nmore territory in its so-called caliphate and it collapses, the threat \nto our homeland will really grow. Americans who have been fighting with \nISIS will be looking for ways to come home to stage deadly attacks.\n  In recent weeks, a man from Alexandria, Virginia, was convicted on \nterrorism charges for joining ISIS. He was sentenced to 20 years in the \npenitentiary. This terrorist traitor to our Nation named four other \nWesterners who had joined ISIS and who left Syria with intentions to do \nharm in their home countries.\n  Law enforcement officials and terrorism experts have been warning of \nthis foreign fighter threat for years. This is a serious threat, and we \nmust address it before it becomes worse.\n  Having betrayed our Nation, we must revoke the privileges that come \nwith an American passport. That is why my colleague, the gentleman from \nMassachusetts (Mr. Keating), and I introduced H.R. 425, the Foreign \nTerrorist Organization Passport Revocation Act. It authorizes the \nSecretary of State to revoke passports of those who have joined foreign \nterrorist organizations.\n  I might add, Mr. Speaker, this is a legal term, what a foreign \nterrorist organization is. It is only those organizations.\n  These individuals are U.S. citizens, but they betray our country. \nThey should clearly not be allowed the privilege of international \ntravel with an American passport, and they should definitely not be \nable to come back into the United States when they travel overseas, \nsuch as in Syria. This bipartisan bill will also stop these Benedict \nArnolds from using their passports to travel to other war zones or \ncross borders to attack any of our allies.\n  Mr. Speaker, there is absolutely nothing in current regulations \nspecifically to support foreign terrorist organizations. The Secretary \nof State does not have the authority to revoke passports on a broad \nnational security basis.\n  It is time our laws change and catch up with the modern world and the \nnew and real threats to our Nation. Let me be clear, Mr. Speaker. This \nbill would not strip American of their citizenship. It would deny those \nAmericans who have sided with foreign terrorist organizations the \nprivilege of travel internationally.\n  The bill also would not impinge on any American's due process rights \nif they want to appeal the revocation of their passport. Anyone whose \npassport is revoked or denied is eligible for a due process hearing \nwithin 60 days. The bill would actually increase oversight on this \nprocess by requiring the State Department to report directly to \nCongress whenever the Secretary moves to revoke or deny an American's \npassport on these grounds.\n  Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my colleague from Massachusetts (Mr. \nKeating) for working with me on this bill. We both sit on the Committee \non Foreign Affairs' Subcommittee on Terrorism, Nonproliferation, and \nTrade as the chair and ranking member. We have both been working on \nthis issue of foreign fighter threats for some time, and we believe \nthis is a good first step to protect our homeland.\n  I also want to thank Chairman Royce for his help in getting this \nimportant bill passed in the committee, and also Ranking Member Engel \nfrom New York, where this unfortunate tragic event occurred last night.\n  Mr. Speaker, the point is this: the traitors among us who have chosen \nto\n\n\nmake their allegiance to a murderous ideology instead of the country \nthat gave them life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness must face \nthe consequences. If you take up arms with our enemies, you deserve to \nbe treated like one.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.", "turn": 4, "speaker": "Mr. POE of Texas", "itemno": 12}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "E000179", "text": "  Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume, \nand I rise in strong support of this measure.\n  Mr. Speaker, as a New Yorker, my heart aches today. The appalling \nloss of life on the streets of Manhattan yesterday is a reminder that \nterrorism remains a threat that demands our focus.\n  Confronting violent extremism requires sound, reasoned policies; \npolicies proportional to the threat, policies based on good \nintelligence, careful analysis, and a clear understanding of what we \nare up against, not policies based on hysterical reactions or biases \nagainst certain faiths or nationalities.\n  I support this bill because it will ensure that the State Department \nhas the tools to prevent American terrorists from traveling abroad or \nreturning to our country.\n  Under this legislation, the Secretary of State could refuse to issue \na passport or revoke a passport for any American who has provided \nassistance to foreign terrorist organizations. Importantly, it also \naffords anyone affected the right to an appeals process, helping to \nensure due process rights.\n  This bill is just common sense. It is also a vital aspect of the \nfight against terrorism. We don't want known threats crossing our \nborders or slipping from country to country anywhere in the world.\n  The bill we are considering today would not have, obviously, \nprevented yesterday's attack, but this is important. This is just a \npiece of a larger strategy.\n  The President yesterday called our judicial system, which would \nprosecute the perpetrator of yesterday's attack, a joke and a laughing \nstock. I beg to disagree. That is our judicial system, which \nsuccessfully prosecuted shoe bomber Richard Reid; Ramzi Yousef, the \n1993 World Trade Center bomber; Faisal Shahzad, the Times Square \nbomber; and Sulaiman Abu Ghaith, Osama Bin Laden's son-in-law, in March \nof 2014.\n  Mr. Speaker, the judicial branch has done quite a good job in \nprosecuting terrorists. Let's show them a little confidence and give \ncredit where credit is due.\n  This is deadly serious. The man suspected in yesterday's attack was \nreportedly radicalized after he arrived in the United States. We have \nseen this before in San Bernardino and Orlando. ISIS inspires its \nadherents from thousands of miles away. That is a problem. And just as \nthis bill gets at a narrow, specific potential vulnerability, policies \nto deal with homegrown extremists and terrorists should take a hard \nlook at causes and take appropriate action to prevent this sort of \nradicalization on American shores.\n  We won't solve this problem by slamming shut America's front door and \nclamping down on immigration. In fact, doing so just contributes to the \nterrorist's ideological ammunition and recruitment efforts. There are \nproven ways to combat terrorism, but demonizing a religion or chipping \naway at constitutional rights won't work. Those approaches play right \ninto the tactics terrorists use to radicalize vulnerable Americans, \nmaking us less safe and less free.\n  I want to thank Representatives Poe and Keating, who lead our \nCommittee on Foreign Affairs' Subcommittee on Terrorism, \nNonproliferation, and Trade. Mr. Speaker, this bipartisan bill gets to \nthe real concern in the fight against terrorism. I am pleased to \nsupport it.\n  With all due respect to Mr. Poe, that is just the way it is.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Massachusetts \n(Mr. Keating), the ranking member of the Terrorism, Nonproliferation, \nand Trade Subcommittee.", "turn": 5, "speaker": "Mr. ENGEL", "itemno": 13}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "K000375", "text": "  Mr. KEATING. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding time to \nme.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 425, the Foreign \nTerrorist Organization Passport Revocation Act.\n  Mr. Speaker, I can't speak to the subject of terrorism without \ncondemning the senseless and heinous attack that took place yesterday \nin New York City. My prayers are with all the individuals and families \nthat were affected. My utmost respect goes to the New York City \ncommunity that, once again, stands strong, stands together, \nunintimidated.\n  Mr. Speaker, I introduced this important piece of legislation, H.R. \n425, together with Chairman Poe of the Foreign Affairs' Subcommittee on \nTerrorism, Nonproliferation, and Trade.\n  As we have discussed, this legislation works to strengthen the tools \nwe have at our disposal for combating terrorism. Put simply, the \nSecretary of State can refuse to issue or revoke the passport to any \nindividual the Secretary determines is affiliated with or has aided, \nassisted, or abetted a designated foreign terrorist organization.\n  The terrorist treats that we face today are complex. Our Federal, \nState, and local agencies are fighting terrorism at a time when ISIS \nand other terrorist organizations are able to use new technologies and \nmeans of communication to connect with individuals around the globe to \nfund, to direct, and inspire acts of terror.\n  Modes of international travel are more accessible and affordable than \never, and cross-border flows of people and goods have increased as we \nhave become more connected in the global world. While these are very \npositive developments for exchange, competitiveness, and quality of \nlife, we also have to be sure we are managing the risks that go along \nwith this increased connectivity.\n  We have to make it harder for anyone supporting terrorism to benefit \nfrom the increased ease of global movement. That is why our legislation \nis important. We must ensure that the Secretary of State has the clear \nauthority to refuse a passport to anyone affiliated with or supporting \na designated foreign terrorist organization.\n  This legislation provides that specific statutory authority, as well \nas improved congressional oversight, are in place. It is also important \nthat there are safeguards in place in order for any law to be \nsuccessful. That is why I am pleased that H.R. 425 also includes a \nright of review for anyone whose passport has been refused or revoked.\n  It is absolutely possible to fight terrorism while still upholding \nprotections for individuals' rights and the rule of law, and it is \ncritical that we do both. In fighting to protect our communities and \nour democracy, we cannot compromise these very things we are fighting \nto protect.\n  Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank Chairman Poe for joining me in \nintroducing H.R. 425, the Foreign Terrorist Organization Passport \nRevocation Act. I would like to also thank Chairman Royce and Ranking \nMember Engel for their support with this bill as well within the \nForeign Affairs Committee.\n  Mr. Speaker, in closing, I urge that all of our colleagues join \ntogether in support of this important legislation.", "turn": 6, "speaker": "Mr. KEATING", "itemno": 14}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "E000179", "text": "  Mr. ENGEL.

Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  I want to emphasize again our prayers for the folks in New York City \nand for the appreciation of our first responders, who are always there, \nas you personally know, Mr. Speaker. And the New York tragedy is an \nexample of how they respond and chase and go after terrorists rather \nthan run from terror.\n  One other thing I want to mention is the Foreign Affairs Committee, \nwe work primarily bipartisan, Mr. Speaker. That shocks a lot of folks \nhere in Washington, D.C., and it sure shocks a lot of folks back home. \nBut most of the\n\n\nthings that come before the House floor have been bipartisan pieces of \nlegislation.\n  We spend a lot of time on legislation and almost always come to the \nHouse floor with unanimous votes, or mostly unanimous votes, on the \ncommittee level. We work very well on these issues because these are \nnot partisan issues; these are American issues that we are talking \nabout.\n  Mr. Speaker, there are about 61 designated foreign terrorist \norganizations that our State Department has said are foreign terrorist \norganizations and, to prevent individuals in America who side with \nthese organizations, who support these organizations, who are part of \nthese organizations from traveling around the world and coming back \nhome, based upon their activities, this legislation by Mr. Keating is \nintroduced. Keep them from traveling, because we know who those people \nare, and keep them, especially, from coming back to the United States.\n  So what would happen if a passport is revoked and some American is in \nSyria and is radicalized and he tries to get on a plane? Well, he is \nnot allowed to get on the plane. He is stopped, and then he is turned \nover, eventually, to Department of Homeland Security and our Justice \nDepartment and handled that way.\n  Now, there are only a few places under our law where a person's \npassport can be revoked. Not paying your child support, drug \ntrafficking, sex tourism--those are three of the examples. So we are \nnot talking about a lot of examples, but we are talking about this \nexample.\n  I am a former judge, and I know Mr. Keating is a former prosecutor. \nDue process for Americans is always important. The Supreme Court has \nalready ruled on whether or not passports can be revoked under certain \ncircumstances, and they have affirmed the authority of the State \nDepartment to revoke passports in specific cases based upon national \nsecurity reasons.\n  This bill allows for due process of those people who have their \npassports revoked. This is a good step in protecting the United States. \nThis is bipartisan legislation. I think it is very important that we \ntake this step.\n  Once again, my prayers, our prayers, are for those folks in New York. \nBut, Mr. Speaker, we are not going to allow terrorists to have their \nday. We are not going to allow them to have their way.\n  And that is just the way it is.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.", "turn": 8, "speaker": "Mr. POE of Texas", "itemno": 16}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "S000522", "text": "  Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 425--\nthe FTO Passport Revocation Act of 2017--by my friend and colleague \nChairman Ted Poe. I cannot help but see this measure as a common sense \ntactic to prevent terrorists from entering or re-entering our country. \nHowever, more needs to be done to build on this useful foundation for \nsecurity from terrorists originating in this country or foreign-based \nterrorists.\n  Just yesterday, the streets of New York were the scene of carnage \ncaused by a man from Uzbekistan who won a diversity visa lottery to \nenter this country in 2010. He has lived here for seven years before \ngoing on the murderous rampage that killed 8 people and injured 12 \nothers. Clearly, we need to look closer at the background of those \nadmitted through this lottery as they could eventually obtain a U.S. \npassport. That was the conclusion by the Government Accountability \nOffice ten years ago--three years before New York terror suspect \narrived in this country.\n  The GAO report in 2007 called the diversity visa program ``an open \ndoor'' for terrorists. According to the report 9,800 people from \ncountries designated by the State Department as State Sponsors of \nTerrorism had used the program to enter the country. These people could \neventually qualify for a U.S. passport.\n  We also must be more vigilant about people coming from countries not \ndesignated as State Sponsors of Terrorism. The 9/11 Commission reported \nback in 2004 that as many as six of the hijackers of the three planes--\nwho were from Saudi Arabia, Egypt, United Arab Emirates and Lebanon--\nhad used fraudulent or manipulated passports to enter the United \nStates. In 2013, a Saudi citizen entering the United States through the \nDetroit airport was detained because he couldn't satisfactorily explain \nwhy he was carrying a pressure cooker like the one used in the Boston \nmarathon bombing. However, upon inspection, his passport suspiciously \nhad a missing page. Would that have been caught without the presence of \nthe pressure cooker? We are told that even the slightest tweak to a \npassport will be caught, but one failure could result in a terrorist \nentering our country, and they could eventually become terrorist \nsleepers who acquire a U.S. passport.\n  Finally, in order for the FTO designation to be effectively used to \nstop terrorists from getting passports or having their passport \nrevoked, our government must make that designation in the first place. \nI tried for two years to get the previous administration to designate \nBoko Haram as a terrorist organization. They finally did so in 2013, \nbut how many potential terrorists may have gotten through before then \nand acquire sufficient status to receive a U.S. passport? We also need \nto use the FTO designation to identify those giving support to \nterrorist organizations, especially in cases of such support coming \nfrom those living in the United States who could be or potentially \ncould be U.S. passport holders.\n  As I said earlier, I consider H.R. 425 a common sense measure on \nwhich to build, but we must take steps to make this bill as meaningful \nas it must be for our security.
