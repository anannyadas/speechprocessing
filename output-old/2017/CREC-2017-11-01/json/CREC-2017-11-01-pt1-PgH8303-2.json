Mr. Speaker, I think it is appropriate this morning \nto rise to share my passion and my love for this country, but also my \nfrustration. I will use this graphic to set the tone for my remarks \nthis morning.\n  Although the Republican tax proposal will be introduced tomorrow, I \nbelieve, if you look at this graphic and the headlines, it says that 80 \npercent of the tax relief will not go to you and you and you and to the \nAmerican people, or maybe even staff and Members who are here who are \nAmericans, salaried individuals; it will go, 80 percent, to the 1 \npercent of Americans.\n  Now, I am not going to talk about the tax legislation this morning. I \nwant this to be a symbol of the wrongness of the direction of this \ncountry and the leader who leads this Nation. We are going down a wrong \npath.\n  Many of us thought we had come together in unity, we had overcome the \ndivisiveness because we were different,\n\n\nwe had recognized the beauty of all of us, rural citizens in West \nVirginia, Ohioans in the mountains of the Appalachian area, \nMidwesterners, Southerners, Northerners, Westerners, Far West, \nimmigrant and nonimmigrant. But, unfortunately, in 2016, although some \nlost and some won, as we moved toward a new administration with the \nhopes and dreams of those who had voted, we looked for the unifying of \nwhat I know that all Presidents have done.\n  It has been a privilege of mine to work with President William \nJefferson Clinton, who didn't have an easy time but sought to unify the \ncountry. I worked with President George W. Bush, who did not have an \neasy time or an unconflicted election but sought to unify the country, \nin fact, was an enthusiastic signer of the reauthorization of the \nVoting Rights Act; and President Barack Obama, who rode in on a sense \nof hope and unity. That is the task of a President.\n  In the midst of this, again, having been appointed to the Homeland \nSecurity Committee in the ashes of 9/11, having gone to Ground Zero \nwhile our brave first responders were recovering, were still looking \nfor remains--it will penetrate my soul forever--unity was what we \nsought in spite of our difference of opinions.\n  So I rise to thank the first responders and the quick response of the \nNYPD and Fire Department on yesterday's terrorist act. Yes, it was a \nterrorist act. We live in a different world. But rather than rise to \nthe occasion, this morning the words come from the White House:\n\n       The terrorist came into our country through what is called \n     the ``Diversity Visa Lottery Program,'' a Chuck Schumer \n     beauty. I want merit-based immigration.\n\n  You tell me how many immigrants, how many Italians, how many Irish, \nand how many of those who escaped the Holocaust, who came before that \nfrom the Jewish community, how many of them would have met any test of \nmerit. Did the slaves who were brought here as slaves meet a test of \nmerit? All of these individuals helped build this Nation.\n  And on the morning when people are mourning of their lost loved ones, \nrather than bringing the country together, there is a politicizing, \ncalling out names of Members. We are working on merit based.\n  Does he even understand what merit based is? Absolutely not.\n  Taking away from the conspiracy charge against Manafort, taking away \nfrom the conspicuous collusion with Russians that George Papadopoulos \nhas indicated, oh, he is worrying about him lying. But I am worrying \nabout him telling the truth, and he is. They wanted dirty stuff on the \nopponent; they wanted to work with Russia; they wanted to work with \nPutin; and they wanted to conspire against the United States of \nAmerica--as well as the misunderstanding or the devastating comments of \nhis chief of staff about the civil war and NFL players being called \ninmates in a prison.\n  Mr. Speaker, I am fed up with dividing this Nation. We are going in \nthe wrong direction, and I am not going to accept it. I am taking a \nknee with all of those who believe in justice and what is right. I did \nit before. I do it now. I take a knee.\n", "turn": 1, "speaker": "Ms. JACKSON LEE", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "177", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H8303-H8304", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "1", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "TAKING A KNEE FOR WHAT IS RIGHT", "id": "CREC-2017-11-01-pt1-PgH8303-2", "title": "TAKING A KNEE FOR WHAT IS RIGHT"}
