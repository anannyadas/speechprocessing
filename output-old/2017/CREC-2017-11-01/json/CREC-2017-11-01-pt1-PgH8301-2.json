The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from \nWashington (Ms. Jayapal) for 5 minutes.", "turn": 0, "speaker": "The SPEAKER pro tempore", "itemno": 0}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "J000298", "text": "  Ms. JAYAPAL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today because we do have a gun \nviolence epidemic in this country, and the time to act is now.\n  Exactly 1 month ago today, we witnessed one of the most horrific mass \nshootings in our country's history, and Congress has done nothing. One \nmonth later, legislation on bump stocks has stalled. There is a \ndeafening silence from the majority on any responsible actions on this \npublic health crisis, even though, Mr. Speaker, a majority of \nAmericans, including responsible gun owners, support responsible gun \nsafety legislation.\n  Today, Mr. Speaker, I rise to share a statement written by my \nconstituent Zach Elmore, who is here with us this morning. Zach's \nsister, Alicia Johnson, was shot in Las Vegas. Thankfully, she \nsurvived. This is what he wrote as he sat next to her hospital bed as \nshe recovered:\n  ``My sister was shot in Las Vegas. I have never been more afraid, \nmore angry in my entire life. The problem with shootings around the \ncountry is that, unless you know someone directly affected, it is easy \nto say `what a tragedy,' and move on with your daily life.\n  ``It is not so easy when you are getting ready for bed and one of \nyour sisters calls inconsolably crying to tell you that another one of \nyour sisters has been shot. It is not so easy when you call your mother \nand she is terrified and crying and all you can do is try to calm her \ndown while you figure out how to get to your sister as quickly as \npossible. It is not so easy to see your brother-in-law with blood still \non his hands from doing whatever he could to keep your sister alive. It \nis not so easy to see your sister in a hospital bed, unable to move due \nto a gunshot wound in her back and staples in her stomach from surgery \nto check for organ damage. We are among the luckiest ones.\n  ``I am sick and tired of thoughts and prayers. If thoughts and \nprayers had any affect whatsoever, there would be a lot of people still \nalive today. All these thoughts and prayers would have miraculously \npulled bullets out of victims and healed wounds, would have stopped \nthese massacres before they started.\n  ``You know what is better than thoughts and prayers and lines around \nthe block at blood banks and enormous relief funds for victims of \ntragedy? Creating a society where we don't have to do these things many \ntimes a year.\n  ``We waited so long to do anything after Columbine that Virginia Tech \nhappened. We still couldn't talk about it when the Aurora theater \nshooting happened. That didn't change anything, and then 20 children \nwere murdered at Sandy Hook. Even that wasn't enough to promote change. \nWhen Dylann Roof happened, still couldn't talk about it, and then San \nBernardino happened. We still couldn't bring ourselves to discuss gun \ncontrol, and then the Pulse nightclub shooting happened.\n  ``Lord knows we can't do anything about guns, and then Las Vegas \nhappened. And we are still being told that now is not the time, let \nhealing begin, don't politicize tragedy, but by all means send thoughts \nand prayers to all affected by `insert massacre here.'\n  ``There is no place in society for any weapon which has the singular \npurpose to kill people. The man who killed and injured more than any \nmassacre in America's history broke the mold for who commits mass \nshootings. He would have easily passed a background check and psych \nevaluation. He was affluent and had no known ties to terrorist \norganizations, but he is certainly a terrorist. The system we have in \nplace allowed him to accumulate dozens of assault weapons and thousands \nof rounds of ammunition because, for all intents and purposes, he was \nnot a risk to society.\n  ``Let's keep in mind, the Second Amendment of the Constitution was \nwritten over 200 years ago when a good gunman might get three shots off \na minute with a musket. It is hard for me to believe the Founding \nFathers envisioned a world where one man could or would fire 400 rounds \na minute into a crowd of people.\n  ``This should not be difficult. How many people have to die before \npeople will apply a little logic to gun laws? Do more children need to \ndie? Does a hospital need to be attacked? What is your limit? Does it \nhave to happen to you or a loved one before you start to think \ndifferently about gun laws?\n  ``The people of this country have so much power. We have protested, \npressured our Congressmen and -women, and we have seen that work. Why \ncan't we do the same to reduce and hopefully eliminate the insane \namount of gun violence in America?\n  ``Excuse me for not being willing to wait to let healing begin, for \nnot accepting that now is not the time to talk about a major problem in \nthis country. There is never a wrong time to stand up for what you \nthink is right.\n  ``My sister was shot in Las Vegas in the latest of a devastatingly \nlong line of mass shootings in this country. We are luckier than 58 \npeople and their families, and likely luckier than many of the over 500 \nother people who were injured. If I don't talk about it, if we don't \ntruly take steps to effect positive change, everyone reading this will \nforget it happened because they will be sending thoughts and prayers to \nthe victims of the next mass shooting in America.''\n  Mr. Speaker, that is the end of the excerpt of his letter. Zach's \nfamily's experience illustrates why it is crucial for us to take a hard \nlook at gun violence policies.\n  Mr. Speaker, I hope that we will, across the aisle, in a bipartisan \nfashion, do what is right for the American\n\n\npeople and protect families like Zach's across the country.\n", "turn": 1, "speaker": "Ms. JAYAPAL", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "177", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H8301-H8302", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "1", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "GUN VIOLENCE IN LAS VEGAS", "id": "CREC-2017-11-01-pt1-PgH8301-2", "title": "GUN VIOLENCE IN LAS VEGAS"}
