GERALD E. CONNOLLY\n\n                              of virginia\n\n                    in the house of representatives\n\n                      Wednesday, November 1, 2017\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "C001078", "text": "  Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize my good friend Daniel \n(Dan) Duncan as he steps down after serving for 10 years as President \nof the Northern Virginia Labor Federation, AFL-CIO (NoVA Labor.) As \nPresident of NoVA Labor, Dan led the largest labor council in the \nCommonwealth of Virginia and which represents nearly 70 unions and \nlocals. In this role, he has been responsible for consolidating the \nmissions and concerns of the various unions and their members into one \nunified voice while ensuring that all opinions are heard and respected.\n   Dan has dedicated his life to improving the lives of working \nfamilies. He is committed to the mission of NoVA Labor which is to \nbring economic justice to the workplace and social justice to our \ncommunities. He learned these values from an early age--his grandfather \nwas a shop steward at a shipyard in Cleveland, Ohio and his father was \na rank and file Machinist. Dan joined his first union, the Retail \nClerks Union, in 1973 at the age of 17 while working for a grocery \nstore in Tennessee.\n   After graduating from the University of Chattanooga in 1978, Dan \nworked as a newspaper reporter. He later became director of the Fort \nLauderdale senior employment program with the National Council of \nSenior Citizens (NCSC) which was formed in 1961 and evolved from the \nSenior Citizens for Kennedy organization. Working with the \nadministration\n\n\nof President John F. Kennedy, the NCSC was instrumental in rallying \nsupport for comprehensive health insurance for senior citizens. These \nefforts bore fruit when President Lyndon B. Johnson signed Medicare \ninto law in 1965. NCSC's efforts were instrumental in passing this \nlandmark legislation and the organization, now known as the Alliance \nfor Retired Americans continues its fight to protect and preserve \nMedicare and Social Security.\n   Dan then accepted a position with the Seafarers International Union \nwhere he has served for 30 years in various positions. For the last six \nyears, Dan has held the position of Executive Secretary-Treasurer of \nthe Maritime Trades Department.\n   In his roles with individual unions as well as with the Northeast \nFlorida Central Labor Council, the Northern Virginia Central Labor \nCouncil, and the NoVA Labor Federation, Dan has worked tirelessly to \nadvocate for working families and support state and federal legislation \nthat would even the playing field for the backbone of our society--the \nmiddle and lower class who deserve a fair wage for honest work and \nother employer related benefits.\n   I have personally known Dan Duncan and his wife Karen for many years \nand have thoroughly enjoyed our countless conversations and discussions \non issues of importance. While we have on occasion disagreed, mainly on \ntheir terrible taste in baseball teams, but also occasionally on the \nbest way to achieve a certain objective, we both know and understand \nthat we share the same goals. These exchanges of ideas and opinions \nhave been invaluable to both of us as we continue to represent and \nserve our constituencies.\n   Mr. Speaker, I ask that my colleagues join me in commending Dan \nDuncan for his efforts on behalf of the working men and women of our \ncountry and in thanking him for his service. Although he is stepping \ndown from his position of President of NoVA Labor, I am confident that \nhe will continue his efforts to strengthen and protect the rights and \nbenefits of all and I wish him success in all of his future endeavors.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. CONNOLLY", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 3}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "177", "extension": true, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "E1481-E1482", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "1", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "RECOGNIZING DANIEL DUNCAN", "id": "CREC-2017-11-01-pt1-PgE1481-4", "title": "RECOGNIZING DANIEL DUNCAN"}
