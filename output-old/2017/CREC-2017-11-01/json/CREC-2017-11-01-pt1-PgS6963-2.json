{"content": [{"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "G000386", "text": "  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, last month the Environmental Protection \nAgency--EPA--Administrator, Scott Pruitt, issued a directive to all \nAgency employees that prohibits the so-called sue-and-settle process. \nThis is good news for good government.\n  Most of us here are familiar with the term ``sue and settle.''\n  These are tactics whereby the EPA has, in the past, resolved certain \nlawsuits against it through agreements negotiated behind closed doors \nwith politically favored interest groups. As we saw under the Obama \nadministration, some of these agreements committed the EPA to take far-\nreaching regulatory action, all without an adequate opportunity for \nthose people most impacted to have a seat at the table, as would \nnormally be done through the regulatory process.\n  Today, I come to the floor to applaud Administrator Pruitt's \nleadership in working to end these tactics, which make a mockery of \nlaws that Congress has put in place to ensure a transparent and \naccountable regulatory process. The commonsense reforms outlined in \nAdministrator Pruitt's directive will, no doubt, help restore \ntransparency and accountability, and these reforms should stand as a \nprime example for all Federal agencies to follow.\n  Accordingly, I call upon President Trump to use his full authority \nthrough Executive order to ensure that similar reforms are adopted \nacross the entire bureaucracy. Regulatory decisions that affect key \nparts of our economy should be made in an open, transparent, and, \nconsequently, accountable manner. But as we have seen with sue and \nsettle, Washington bureaucrats and their interest group pals would \nprefer to do things their own way.\n  It works like this. First, an interest group sues a Federal agency, \nclaiming the agency has failed to take regulatory action required by \nlaw. Through the lawsuit, the interest group seeks to compel the agency \nto take action by a new, often rushed, deadline. These plaintiff \ninterest groups often share a common regulatory agenda with the agency \nthey sue, such as when an environmental group sues the EPA or the Fish \nand Wildlife Service.\n  Instead of challenging the lawsuit, the agency and the interest group \nenter into negotiations behind closed doors to produce either a \n``settlement agreement'' or a ``consent decree'' committing the agency \nto take regulatory action. There is no transparency, no accountability, \nwhich you would get through normal regulation writing.\n  Noticeably absent from these negotiations are the very parties who \nwill be most impacted, such as farmers, manufacturers, and even the 50 \nStates themselves, which will be charged with enforcing some of these \nregulations. In 2010, for example, an environmental interest group sued \nthe Obama administration EPA to force the agency to revise certain \nwastewater regulations.\n  Wouldn't it be nice to have the people who are affected by those \nregulations involved in the process in an open way--the way the \nAdministrative Procedure Act is designed?\n  Oddly enough, the same day the lawsuit was filed, the plaintiff \ninterest group submitted a consent decree already signed by the EPA, \nwhich committed the agency to take prompt regulatory action. Such a \nscenario should raise serious questions about how truly adversarial \nthese lawsuits and negotiations are.\n  To add insult to injury, regulations that have resulted from sue-and-\nsettle tactics impose tremendous costs on the American economy. \nAccording to the American Action Forum, from 2005 to 2016, 23 sue-and-\nsettle regulations resulted in a cost burden of $67.9 billion, with \n$26.5 billion in actual costs. Sixteen of the rules imposed paperwork \nburdens on American job creators of more than 8 million hours. Think \nabout that. Nearly $70 billion in regulatory costs were imposed on \nAmerican business owners, manufacturers, farmers, and probably \ntaxpayers, all without due regard for transparency and the normal \nrulemaking process required by the Administrative Procedure Act.\n  Decades ago, Congress enacted the Administrative Procedure Act for \nthe sole purpose of ensuring transparency, accountability, and, more \nimportantly, public participation in Federal rulemaking. The EPA has \nbeen described as the citizens' ``regulatory bill of rights.'' A pillar \nof the Administrative Procedure Act is the notice-and-comment process, \nwhich requires agencies to notify the public of proposed regulations \nand respond to comments submitted--in other words, transparency.\n  Rulemaking driven by sue-and-settle tactics frequently results in \nreprioritized agency agendas and rushed deadlines for regulatory \naction. This renders the EPA's notice-and-comment process a mere \nformality. It deprives regulated entities, it deprives the States, and \nmost importantly, it deprives the American public of sufficient time to \nhave any meaningful input on final rules. The resulting regulatory \naction is driven not by the public interest but by the special interest \npriorities.\n  Sue-and-settle tactics also help agencies avoid accountability for \ntheir actions. Instead of having to answer to the public for \ncontroversial regulatory decisions, agency officials will simply point \nto a court order and say that their hands are tied, when really they \nwelcomed that process.\n  The American people deserve better, but don't just take my word for \nit. The Environmental Council of the States, a national nonprofit, \nnonpartisan association of State and territorial environmental agency \nleaders, adopted a resolution in 2013 entitled ``The Need for Reform \nand State Participation in EPA's Consent Decrees which Settle Citizen \nSuits.'' The rationale behind it\n\n\nprovides that ``state environmental agencies are not always notified of \ncitizen suits that allege U.S. EPA's failure to perform its \nnondiscretionary duties, are often not parties to these citizen suits, \nand are usually not provided with an opportunity to participate in the \nnegotiation of agreements to settle citizen suits.''\n  The Environmental Council of the States further resolved that \n``greater transparency of citizen suit settlement agreements is needed \nfor the public to understand the impact of these agreements on the \nadministration of environmental programs.''\n  Obviously, I agree. We need more transparency, more accountability, \nand more voices at the table. In other words, the public's business \nought to be public, not some new regulation agreed to behind closed \ndoors. I am happy to say that this administration is working to \naccomplish that, thanks to Administrator Pruitt. In his own words: \n``The days of this regulation through litigation . . . are \nterminated.''\n  His directive puts a swift end to sue-and-settle tactics by this one \nagency, the EPA. It does so by adopting commonsense reforms to promote \ntransparency and public participation in the regulatory process. It \nrequires the publication online of notices of lawsuits filed against \nthe EPA. It requires the EPA to reach out and notify any States or \nregulated entities that will be affected by the lawsuit. It requires \nthe EPA to seek the agreement of any affected State or regulatory \nentities before the agency can enter into a consent decree or \nsettlement agreement. Further, it prohibits the EPA from entering into \nany consent decree or settlement that converts a discretionary duty of \nthe agency into a mandatory duty to issue, revise, or amend a \nregulation. Most importantly, it requires the EPA to post online for \npublic comment any proposed consent decrees or settlement agreements \nbefore they are entered into by the court.\n  These and other reforms in Administrator Pruitt's directive mark a \nvery strong step toward ensuring that States, American job creators, \nand the public at large have a seat at the table when regulatory \ndecisions are made, which is exactly why Congress passed the \nAdministrative Procedure Act.\n  Before I close, I will add one more thing. Earlier this year, I \nintroduced the Sunshine for Regulatory Decrees and Settlements Act. \nThis bill would make permanent the very types of reforms outlined in \nAdministrator Pruitt's directive. If it becomes law, it can't be \nchanged at some later date. In other words, it would ensure that future \nadministrations can't simply roll back the great work Administrator \nPruitt is doing through this directive.\n  I am pleased to hear that the House of Representatives just passed \nthe companion bill introduced by Congressman Doug Collins. We will \ncontinue our work to build bipartisan support here in the Senate for \nthis commonsense decree.\n  But, today, I urge President Trump to move forward with the example \nset by Administrator Pruitt because Administrator Pruitt is draining \nthe swamp through this process. The President loves to sign Executive \norders. He would probably do more good in draining the swamp by \nproducing an Executive order like this than almost any other Executive \norder he could do.\n  There is simply no reason these reforms should be limited to just the \nEPA. Transparency and public participation are core elements of a more \naccountable government. Simply stated, they are part of the process of \nrepresentative government, where people make the laws and where \nadministrators carry out the laws, not where something is done behind \nclosed doors because some special interest wants something or because \nthe agency is begging to do something--which maybe someone doesn't want \nthem to do--to get it done and to do it behind closed doors, just to \nwork it out the way they want it and not necessarily the way it would \nbe done if people were participating.\n  I applaud Administrator Pruitt's directive. I urge the President to \npromptly see to it that similar reforms are implemented across the \nadministration.\n  So for a third time today, President Trump, issue an Executive order \nto all departments to do what Administrator Pruitt has done at the EPA.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. GRASSLEY", "itemno": 0}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 1}], "header": {"chamber": "Senate", "num": "177", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "S6963-S6964", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "1", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "REGULATORY REFORM", "id": "CREC-2017-11-01-pt1-PgS6963-2", "title": "REGULATORY REFORM"}
