Mr. Speaker, it is with great sadness I rise tonight to \nhonor the passing of Stanley Coolidge and his fiancee, Roseann Hannah.\n  Their lives were tragically lost on October 9, 2017, while trapped in \ntheir northern California home as it was destroyed by wildfire. What \nbegan as the faint smell of a distant fire quickly turned to tragedy as \nthe area surrounding Stanley's longtime home was ignited rapidly by a \nfast-approaching fire. As Stan and Roseann attempted a hurried \nevacuation, the house was engulfed by flames before they could escape.\n  Stan was a retired attorney, born in San Francisco, but lived his \nlast 50 years in the mountains of Loma Rica, California. Roseann was a \nresident of Grass Valley, California. Both she and Stan were very \nvalued members of their communities.\n  Our thoughts and prayers are with the Coolidge and Hannah families as \nwe ask the Lord's blessings for comfort and healing at this very \ntragic, very sad time, as well as the families of all who we have lost \nas a result of the fires in the West.\n  Stan and Roseann, you will be missed.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. LaMALFA", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "177", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H8368", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "1", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "HONORING THE PASSING OF STANLEY COOLIDGE AND ROSEANN HANNAH", "id": "CREC-2017-11-01-pt1-PgH8368", "title": "HONORING THE PASSING OF STANLEY COOLIDGE AND ROSEANN HANNAH"}
