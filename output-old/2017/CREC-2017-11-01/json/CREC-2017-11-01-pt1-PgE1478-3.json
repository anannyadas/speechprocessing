Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and \ncongratulate John Anderson of Minburn, Iowa, who, along with his \ncousin, Andy Anderson of Cedar Falls, Iowa, became the first Iowans to \nclimb to the summit of Mount Everest on the North Face.\n  John and Andy have been climbing and hiking for over 10 years. When \nthey decided to tackle the largest mountain in the world over a year \nago, they began their training between heavy work schedules, preparing \ntheir bodies and minds for the physical and mental challenges such a \nclimb presents. On the afternoon of May 21, all of their preparation \npaid off when they announced on their Facebook page that they had \nreached an elevation of 29,052 feet, the summit of Mt. Everest. \nAlongside the goal of just conquering the tallest mountain in the \nworld, the cousins also used the opportunity to help raise awareness \nfor veterans with PTSD. They plan to use the network they built in \npromoting this climb to help veterans and their families learn to use \noutdoor activities to help manage stress.\n  Mr. Speaker, I am immensely proud of John and his cousin Andy for \nconquering the largest mountain in the world. I am honored to represent \nthem in the United States Congress and it is with great pride that I \nrecognize them today. I ask that my colleagues in the United States \nHouse of Representatives join me in congratulating John and Andy for \nthis outstanding accomplishment and in wishing them both nothing but \ncontinued success.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. YOUNG of Iowa", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 3}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "177", "extension": true, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "E1478", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "1", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "TRIBUTE TO JOHN ANDERSON", "id": "CREC-2017-11-01-pt1-PgE1478-3", "title": "TRIBUTE TO JOHN ANDERSON"}
