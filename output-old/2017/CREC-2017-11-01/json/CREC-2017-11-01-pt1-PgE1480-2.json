Mr. Speaker, I rise today to call attention to November \nas being National Hospice and Palliative Care Month and to recognize a \npassionate steward of a non-profit hospice--West Virginia Caring.\n  Under the leadership of Ms. Malene Davis, West Virginia Caring's \nhospice and palliative care has helped citizens in 12 counties receive \nattentive and respectful care. As we consider the importance of \ncompassionate and dignified care during one's end of life, we must \nprotect the fair and adequate compensation for non-profit hospice and \npalliative care provider organizations. I continue to be vigilant of \nthe Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services as well as the \nintermediary contractors who review and recommend reimbursement rates \non a case-by-case basis. For our families, friends and the American \npeople, this is an important aspect of our healthcare responsibility.\n  During this month, I call particular attention to the many \nphysicians, nurses, caregivers and volunteers who offer invaluable \npatient service under the Medicare Hospice Benefit. I thank them for \ntheir skills and for their compassionate care.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. McKINLEY", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "177", "extension": true, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "E1480", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "1", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "IN RECOGNITION OF NATIONAL HOSPICE AND PALLIATIVE CARE MONTH AND WEST VIRGINIA CARING", "id": "CREC-2017-11-01-pt1-PgE1480-2", "title": "IN RECOGNITION OF NATIONAL HOSPICE AND PALLIATIVE CARE MONTH AND WEST  VIRGINIA CARING"}
