Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the outstanding \nstudents, faculty, and staff at Red Creek High School. The mission \nstatement of the Red Creek Central School District is to educate \nstudents with equity, and help them master fundamental skills. I would \nlike to commend the hard work of the Red Creek Central School District \nfor making Red Creek High School a safe and welcoming place to learn.\n   The National Blue Ribbon Schools Program recognizes public and \nprivate schools based on overall academic excellence or ability in \nclosing achievement gaps among students. Every year the United States \nDepartment of Education seeks out, and honors, schools that tirelessly \nwork to help students grow academically. Red Creek High School is one \nof just 19 New York State schools to receive the prestigious \n``Exemplary High Performing Schools'' award from the United States \nDepartment of Education this year.\n   Since the Blue Ribbon Award was first created in 1982, only four \nother schools in Wayne-Finger Lakes region have garnered Blue Ribbon \nstatus. Red Creek High School was awarded its Blue Ribbon Award this \nyear for the strong academic performance of its student body. The \nteachers and administrators at Red Creek High School work hard each day \nto make learning exciting, and encourage their students that they can \nachieve their goals both inside and outside of the classroom. I'm proud \nto recognize this stellar high school in my district, and applaud the \nstudents, parents, administrators and teachers for their efforts.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. KATKO", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 3}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "177", "extension": true, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "E1485", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "1", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "RECOGNIZING RED CREEK HIGH SCHOOL'S BLUE RIBBON AWARD", "id": "CREC-2017-11-01-pt1-PgE1485-2", "title": "RECOGNIZING RED CREEK HIGH SCHOOL'S BLUE RIBBON AWARD"}
