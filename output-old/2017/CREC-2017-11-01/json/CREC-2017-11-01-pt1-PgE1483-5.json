DOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to \nrecognize a remarkable public servant from my district, Mayor Raymond \nG. Bodnar of Munhall, Pennsylvania, who is retiring after 53 years of \nservice to his community.\n  Mr. Bodnar has been the Mayor of Munhall Borough for the last 30 \nyears, but his service to his nation and community began long before \nthat. As a young man, he served in the Army during the Korean Conflict \nand was honorably discharged in 1955. In addition to working for 40 \nyears for the U.S. Steel Corporation, he served eight years as auditor \nof Munhall and another fifteen as a member and then President of the \nMunhall Borough Council. In 1987, he was elected mayor, a position \nwhich he has honorably filled for the last three decades, and in which \nhe has worked tirelessly to improve the Munhall community.\n  During his career, Mayor Bodnar has supported and secured funding for \nsuch important projects as developing the Munhall waterfront, \nrevitalizing the town's Main Street, modernizing the police department, \nand introducing public safety and crime prevention programs.\n\n\n  Beyond his duties as a civil servant, he has also given back to his \ncommunity in countless ways, including managing the youth Munhall \nBaseball League, organizing summer athletic programs, working with Boy \nScouts, Girl Scouts, and church groups, and teaching local government \nto youth groups and schools. He is also a member of a number of \ncommunity service organizations, including Knights of Columbus No. \n2201, the Catholic War Veterans Association, the Homestead Elks, and \nthe Steel Valley Salvation Army Board ofDirectors.\n  For more than 50 years, Raymond Bodnar has demonstrated wholehearted \ndedication to public service and community involvement, and I think \nthat we can all learn something from his example. I wish to \ncongratulate the mayor on his retirement and commend him for his \nlifetime of devotion to the Munhall community.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. MICHAEL F.
