Mr. Speaker, I rise today to ask the United States \nHouse of Representatives to join me in recognizing the Atlantic Coast \nYoung Marines and their hard work during Red Ribbon Week.\n  The Florida regiment of Young Marines has performed more than 50,000 \nservice hours since last October, with more than 35,000 hours of \ncommunity service dedicated to our veterans.\n  As you can see, the Atlantic Coast Young Marines and their fellow \nYoung Marines throughout Florida are very active in their local \ncommunities.\n  Reduction of drug demand is a major issue of the Young Marine \nprogram, and Red Ribbon Week is an excellent opportunity to recognize \nthe Atlantic Coast Young Marines' emphasis on this mission.\n  Red Ribbon Week is the oldest drug prevention program in the Nation, \nreaching millions of Americans during the last week of October each \nyear. By wearing red ribbons and participating in community antidrug \nevents, Young Marines pledge to live a drug-free life and pay tribute \nto DEA Special Agent Enrique ``Kiki'' Camarena.\n  Special Agent Camarena was a veteran of the DEA assigned to \nGuadalajara, Mexico, where he was on the trail of the country's biggest \ndrug traffickers. Because he was so close to unlocking a billion-dollar \ndrug pipeline, he was kidnapped and murdered by drug traffickers. His \ntragic death opened the eyes of many Americans to the dangerous illicit \ndrug trade.\n  Red Ribbon Week celebrates Agent Camarena's life and his vision for a \ndrug-free America.\n  Last week, the Atlantic Coast Young Marines honored his life through \nevents that helped reduce the demand for drugs throughout northeast \nFlorida.\n  These young men and women who participate in this education and \nservice program are known to be excellent leaders inside and outside of \nthe classroom. The Atlantic Coast Young Marines are a shining example \nof our First Coast youth.\n  They also serve our veterans in numerous ways, by cleaning yards, \nmaking hospital visits, and simply writing cards. Their dedication to \ncommunity service and our veterans is a shining example of noble \nselflessness.\n  Mr. Speaker, I applaud the Atlantic Coast Young Marines for their \nservice to Florida's First Coast community.\n", "turn": 1, "speaker": "Mr. RUTHERFORD", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "177", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H8301", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "1", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "ATLANTIC COAST YOUNG MARINES", "id": "CREC-2017-11-01-pt1-PgH8301", "title": "ATLANTIC COAST YOUNG MARINES"}
