Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, over the last two decades, our Nation has experienced a \n37 percent decline in the number of U.S. listed companies--public \ncompanies. Equally troubling, we have seen the number of publicly \ntraded companies fall to around 5,700. These statistics are concerning \nbecause they are similar to the data we saw in the 1980s when our \neconomy was less than half its current size.\n  Mr. Speaker, since 2000, the average number of initial public \nofferings, or IPOs, has fallen to approximately 135 per year, which \npales in comparison to the more than 450 IPOs filed per year in\n\n\nthe early 1990s. Notably, there has not been a corresponding downward \ntrend in the creation of new companies over that same period. This \ndemonstrates that the regulatory costs associated with going public is \ndeterring new and emerging companies from making the decision to go \npublic.\n  Now, you may ask: Why is this important?\n  Well, first of all, it is preventing our capital markets from \nreaching their full potential, which sounds very academic and pie in \nthe sky.\n  What does that mean, though?\n  What it really means is that it is not allowing Mr. and Mrs. 401(k) \nfrom participating in the economic successes that we have seen lately.\n  Federal securities regulations are typically written for large public \ncompanies, and this one-size-fits-all framework imposes a \ndisproportionate burden on small and emerging companies looking to go \npublic.\n  The 2012 Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act, or JOBS Act, which was \na bipartisan bill signed into law by President Obama, created a new \ntype of issue called an emerging growth company, which allowed these \nso-called EGCs with less than $1 billion in revenue to be allowed to \ncommunicate with potential investors before an initial public offering \nand file confidential draft registration statements with the Securities \nand Exchange Commission.\n  On June 29, 2017, the SEC extended to all companies the option of \nsubmitting in advance draft registration statements for IPOs and \nfollow-on offerings within 1 year of an IPO.\n  H.R. 3903, the Encouraging Public Offerings Act, would ensure that \nall issues making an IPO would be allowed to communicate with potential \ninvestors before an offering and file confidential draft registration \nstatements with the Securities and Exchange Commission. In other words, \nwe are going to codify what the Securities and Exchange Commission has \nsaid we should be doing.\n  H.R. 3903 simply codifies that practice into law and it will allow \nthese companies to finalize their registration documents without undue \nexpectations from outside influences, and it allows companies to time \ntheir offering with the market before making their Form S-1s public and \nbeginning an investor road show.\n  I commend the bipartisan work of Representatives Budd and Meeks on \nthis important bill to ensure that H.R. 3903 applies to all companies, \nwithout losing valuable investor protections--a key element in this.\n  This bill will also help encourage companies to go public, and I \nencourage all of my colleagues to vote in favor of H.R. 3903.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.", "turn": 4, "speaker": "Mr. HUIZENGA", "itemno": 11}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "F000454", "text": "  Mr. FOSTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 3903. This bill will \nexpand the ability of companies to test the waters prior to going \npublic and to submit confidential filings for feedback from the SEC \nstaff prior to filing of an IPO.\n  The JOBS Act of 2012 created these mechanisms for emerging growth \ncompanies. Emerging growth companies are those with less than $1 \nbillion in revenue, $700 million in public float, and $1 billion in \nnonconvertible debt. The JOBS Act enabled these companies to speak to \ninstitutional investors prior to an IPO without it being considered an \nunregistered offering for sale of securities.\n  The definition of a securities offering is appropriately broad to \nprotect investors and ensure transparency in our markets by requiring \nregistration and significant disclosures. However, companies \nconsidering a public offering should be able to talk to the most \nsophisticated investors in the markets, large institutional investors, \nto gauge the interest in the offering. Having that ability will help \nencourage public offerings because it enables companies to realize \nefficiencies in assessing demand.\n  Research-intensive firms are more likely to test the waters because \nit lowers the cost of proprietary disclosure. These are the firms that \ndrive economic growth by bringing new ideas to market.\n  Research is obviously a passion of mine, having founded a company \nthat was based on my intellectual property and subsequently designing \nparticle accelerators as a physicist at Fermi National Lab. It is the \nnew ideas that grow our GDP and improve the standard of living for all \nAmericans.\n  Moreover, new businesses with new ideas do more to grow the economy \nthan incumbents with new ideas or just acquisitions. The public market \npresents an opportunity for small businesses to become big businesses \nwithout being bought out.\n  Additionally, this bill would allow companies of all sizes to file \nconfidentially forms with the SEC. This allows the firm to receive \nfeedback without making inappropriate or unrequired information public. \nDisclosing the correct information helps the markets understand risks \nand price an offering appropriately.\n  The bill also includes a provision giving the SEC discretion to \nensure that these mechanisms are used in a way that benefits markets \nand investors. The U.S. capital markets are the deepest and most liquid \nin the world, and this bill will help more companies tap into that \ncapital and grow our economy.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge broad support for this bill today, and I reserve \nthe balance of my time.", "turn": 5, "speaker": "Mr. FOSTER", "itemno": 12}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "H001058", "text": "  Mr. HUIZENGA.

Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the Encouraging Public \nOfferings Act, a bill that the gentleman from New York (Mr. Meeks) and \nI have worked on together, and I thank him for that.\n  I also thank the Financial Services Committee, in particular, the \nstaff and the subcommittee chairman, Mr. Huizenga.\n  I also thank the chairman, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Hensarling). \nHis leadership of this committee and his devotion and fidelity to the \nconservative principles are legendary. His retirement will be a great \nloss to this institution. The Hensarling legacy of conservative \nleadership will not be forgotten, and I am certain that his next \nchapter will be as great as this one. He will be missed by all, \nespecially by those of us--myself among them--who share his vision and \nhis limited government principles.\n  Mr. Speaker, no other country has a better history of connecting \nmoney with vision than the United States of America. We rightfully \ncelebrate our legendary entrepreneurs: Steve Jobs, Bill Gates, Andrew \nCarnegie, Tom Davis, John Rockefeller, and a whole host of others who \nbuilt the companies that drive our economy. None of those men could \nhave done what they did without capital. None of them could have done \nwhat they did without intermediaries to connect that capital to their \nvision.\n  So, Mr. Speaker, the depressing truth is that our capital markets are \nthe biggest, strongest, and most transparent connectors between money \nand vision, and they are not where they once were. We have the same \nnumber of public offerings on our stock exchanges that we did in the \n1980s, when the economy was much smaller. We have lost 50 percent of \nour public companies since the 1990s, and more and more companies \nchoose to go private, or they never even sell their shares to the \npublic.\n  The hope is that, with this bill, we will increase the desire of \ncompanies to go public, getting our financial markets back to being the \nnumber one method for capital formation. To that end, our bill does \nthree things:\n  First, it allows the companies to file their paperwork for going \npublic with the SEC confidentially. That way, if there is an error or a \ndiscrepancy in the documents, the company can work it out with the \nagency without getting embarrassed in public or exposing information to \ncompetitors.\n  Second, it allows all companies to confidentially file their \npaperwork for a second stock sale after an initial public offering. \nAgain, the point being to allow for a dialogue between the company and \nthe regulator.\n  Third, it also allows all companies considering an IPO to talk to \nsophisticated investors and qualified institutions and see if these \ninvestors might want to buy their stock before offering it to the \npublic, which is called ``testing the waters.'' It is hard to know if\n\n\nyou should sell a product if you can't check and see if there is anyone \nout there who even wants to buy it.\n  Mr. Speaker, these changes to the securities laws have received broad \nsupport. I want to quote the SEC chairman on this when he spoke at a \nhearing in our committee. He said: ``The initial data is positive. Not \njust people using it, but people saying, Thank you, we intend to use \nit. Both from an IPO perspective, but also from the perspective on \nfollow-on offerings that occur in the first year . . . if there is any \nadverse views, I'd like to hear them. We haven't heard any.''\n  The Center for American Progress, which has not traditionally been \nfriendly to relaxing financial regulations, has said that these \nreforms, which were made available to smaller companies in the JOBS \nAct, were some of the most successful provisions in that law. This bill \napplies them to all companies, not just those with a certain amount of \nrevenue.\n  Finally, the Treasury Department gave favorable mention to these \nreforms in its report on the capital markets earlier this year. This \nbill passed out of the House Financial Services Committee with \nunanimous support.\n  Mr. Speaker, the numbers on public companies are clear. We have a \nproblem. The experts are clear that the changes in the Budd-Meeks bill \nwould be a positive step towards fixing the problem. Similar bipartisan \nreforms have seen great success in the past.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge support.", "turn": 7, "speaker": "Mr. BUDD", "itemno": 14}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "F000454", "text": "  Mr. FOSTER.

It is no secret that the competition to our \npublic markets are private equity and venture capital, and these are \ninvestment instruments largely, almost entirely, under the control of \nthe very wealthy.\n  We are, this week, going to begin debate on a tax bill that will \ndecide, to a large extent, whether we accelerate or decelerate the \nconcentration of wealth at the very top. I just want to emphasize that \nconnection to make everyone understand that the continued health of our \npublic markets, which historically have been such an important \ncontributor to middle class investment in growing businesses.

Mr. Speaker, access to capital is crucial to promoting \na thriving U.S. economy. It allows companies to invest in growth and to \ndevelop new and innovative products and services. Historically, \ncompanies seeking a considerable amount of capital have preferred to \nuse an initial public offering and have shares traded on a national \nsecurities exchange.\n  However, the United States has experienced a 37 percent decline in \nthe number of U.S. listed public companies, which is considerably lower \nthan in the 1980s and 1990s.\n  Public company compliance costs have grown sufficiently large that \nmany smaller firms stay private rather than spend their profit \novercoming these regulatory burdens. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Dodd-\nFrank Act, and other legislative and regulatory actions have \ncontributed to these costs.\n\n\n  Title I of the JOBS Act created a new category of issuers known as \nemerging growth companies, or EGCs. These issuers must have less than \n$1 billion in annual revenue or $700,000 million in public float when \nthey register with the SEC.\n  While the JOBS Act made it easier for companies to go public, it was \nnot enough to overcome capital formation obstacles entrepreneurs and \nsmall businesses are facing.\n  H.R. 3903, the Encouraging Public Offerings Act of 2017, would allow \nany company, regardless of size or EGC status, to take advantage of the \npopular provisions of title I of the 2012 JOBS Act.\n  Title I of the JOBS Act has proven to be a real policy success, and \nCongress and the SEC should continue to advance policy that will reduce \nor eliminate barriers to economic growth.\n  Mr. Speaker, I applaud Mr. Budd and Mr. Meeks for their work on this \nimportant piece of legislation.

However, these companies need to be publicly traded for Joe and \nJane IRA or Mr. and Mrs. 401(k) to even be able to have the opportunity \nto invest in them. That is what this bill is trying to do.\n  This bill is trying to make sure that those emerging companies, those \nsmall startup kind of companies, who may be very innovative or, \nfrankly, might be even more mundane, but they are small and they are \nlooking to grow, that they have an opportunity to do so.\n  Who benefits? Everyone.
