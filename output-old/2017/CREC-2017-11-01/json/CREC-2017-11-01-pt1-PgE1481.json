She led the United Way of \nCentral Iowa's Financial Capability project, where since 2012 over \n20,000 people have gained access to financial systems and improved \ntheir financial management skills. Deidre has created several programs \nto provide financial and business education in Central Iowa, among \nwhich three ``boot camps'' have seen 1,300 people come and learn about \nfinances, business and non-profits.\n  Mr. Speaker, strong communities are built upon people like Deidre, \nwho go above and beyond their own self-interests and devote their time \nand energy to helping others.
