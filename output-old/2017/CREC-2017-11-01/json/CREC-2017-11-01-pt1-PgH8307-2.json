Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong \nsupport of H.R. 2936, the Resilient Federal Forests Act of 2017, that \nwas introduced by Congressman Westerman.\n  The House will consider this bill today, which will improve forest \nmanagement and cut the bureaucratic red tape that has been preventing \nsound management practices for the Forest Service.\n  Mr. Speaker, devastating wildfires have resulted in the loss of \nproperty, loss of pristine landscapes, and, most importantly, the loss \nof life. 2017 has been the costliest wildfire season on record, with \nthe Forest Service spending over $2 billion. While not the only issue, \nthe greatest cause for this increase in wildfire is a severe lack of \nforest management.\n  This bill provides Federal land management agencies the immediate \ntools to expedite and increase the scale and efficiency of forest \nmanagement projects without sacrificing environmental protections.\n  Mr. Speaker, we must do everything in our power to stop these \ncatastrophic wildfires and encourage better land management of our \nforests.\n  Today's bill is one step in the right direction and I encourage my \ncolleagues to support this important legislation.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "177", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H8307", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "1", "month": "November"}, "related_bills": [{"type": "HR", "context": "FIRSTPARAGRAPH", "congress": "115", "number": "2936"}, {"type": "HR", "context": "OTHER", "congress": "115", "number": "2936"}], "doc_title": "IMPROVE FOREST MANAGEMENT", "id": "CREC-2017-11-01-pt1-PgH8307-2"}
