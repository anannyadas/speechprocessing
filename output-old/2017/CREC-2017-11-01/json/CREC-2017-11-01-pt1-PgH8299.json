Mr. Speaker, ever since she was a little girl, \nSilvana loved to play hockey. In her Massachusetts hometown, hockey was \nmore of a way of life than just a sport.\n  Her parents knew she was talented, and supported her dream to play \neven in college. When she was offered a scholarship in 2011, to be the \ngoalie for the University of Connecticut, Silvana felt like all of her \ndreams had come true, so she eagerly accepted.\n  She pulled out of her driveway with her packed clothes and hockey \ngear, but she could have never known that in a few days her life would \nchange forever. She could not have foreseen how a lifetime of hard work \nand ambition would suddenly disappear tragically.\n  Like all new students, she was eager to immerse herself in her new \ncollege life. On the third day at the university, Silvana went to a \nhouse party with some new friends she met. But, after two drinks, she \nbegan to feel dizzy, numb, and lethargic. She quickly lost the ability \nto walk, and she became very ill. As she drifted out of consciousness, \na male hockey player at the party instructed others to carry her to his \nbedroom. When she woke up, she found him on top of her, sexually \nassaulting her.\n  She immediately turned to the university for help and reported the \nassault at The Women's Center. But the counselor did not tell her to \ncall the police, advise her to press charges, or help her in any way.\n  Silvana then went to the on-campus doctor. But instead of treating \nher like a victim and offering her the care and support she needed, the \ndoctor told her that he didn't want to know who assaulted her. Get \nthis, Mr. Speaker: the doctor told her, the remedy was for her to \ntransfer to another university. This is awful.\n  One in five women on our university campuses are sexually assaulted. \nOf those, less than 25 percent even report the rape.\n  It took an extraordinary amount of courage for Silvana to report that \nsexual assault, especially to multiple people she didn't even know. She \nwas offered no help or no support by anyone. She was alone, and she \nfelt it.\n  The doctor wasn't trained to deal with rape victims and made it clear \nhe wanted nothing more to do with Silvana. The university clearly \nviewed Silvana as a burden, just another statistic they didn't want to \ndeal with.\n  Mr. Speaker, universities in the United States should be required to \nhave a victim advocate on staff, a sexual assault victim advocate. \nAlso, to ensure that this doesn't happen to more victims at hospitals, \nI have introduced legislation that would require a hospital to provide \naccess to a staffer--it is called a SAFE, sexual assault forensic \nexaminer--who is trained to provide care and be sensitive to trauma \nrape victims, or have a plan to get that victim to a nearby hospital \nthat does. Universities and nearby hospitals need to work together to \nmake sure that rape victims are treated appropriately when they are \nassaulted on campus.\n  The bill that I just mentioned is named the Megan Rondini Act. It is \nin honor of a college sexual assault victim on the University of \nAlabama campus, who was a Texas student, who was denied access to post-\nrape treatment at a hospital. The university didn't help her, and the \nlocal law enforcement didn't help her.\n\n\n  In Megan's case, because she was alone and abandoned by all three of \nthose entities, when she returned to Texas, she later committed \nsuicide.\n  Anyway, after the rape of Silvana, the university left Silvana to \npick up the pieces of her shattered life. She was traumatized and \ndepressed. Claiming that she wasn't stable enough, the hockey coach \nremoved her from the team. She never played a single game of hockey in \ncollege. She withdrew from the University of Connecticut shortly \nthereafter, but her rapist stayed on his hockey team and played for the \nuniversity. Silvana had to successfully sue the university to get \njustice. She had to take the matter to court, where society and our \njustice system should have helped her initially.\n  Mr. Speaker, rape is never the fault of the victim, yet Silvana felt \nthat she was the one being blamed for what happened to her.\n  We as a society must demand our universities and hospitals protect \nand care for sexual assault victims. No longer should they be allowed \nto suffer alone and be abandoned. No more excuses.\n  And that is just the way it is.\n", "turn": 1, "speaker": "Mr. POE of Texas", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "177", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H8299", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "1", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "CARE FOR UNIVERSITY RAPE VICTIMS", "id": "CREC-2017-11-01-pt1-PgH8299", "title": "CARE FOR UNIVERSITY RAPE VICTIMS"}
