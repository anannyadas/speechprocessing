Mr. Speaker, I rise to talk about a job-killer tax bill \nthat is coming to Congress this week, and if you don't watch out, it \ncould be coming to your hometown soon.\n  Up until yesterday, Mr. Speaker, I thought the new GOP tax plan was \njust run-of-the-mill, upside-down class warfare waged by the wealthiest \npeople in the country against everybody else. I knew 80 percent of the \nwindfall of the tax cut would go to people making $912,000 a year or \nmore--the richest 1 percent of the country. I knew it would repeal the \nalternative minimum tax, the only reason that Donald Trump paid any \ntaxes at all in the 1 year we know he paid taxes over the last few \ndecades in 2005. I knew it would repeal the State and local income tax \ndeduction, which would be terrible news for tens of millions of middle \nclass people in States across the country, including mine in Maryland.\n  I knew it would repeal the estate tax which only affects the \nwealthiest one-half of 1 percent of the country. All of these \nprovisions would help to create a\n\n\nhereditary oligarchical elite like the hereditary oligarchical elite in \nRussia today.\n\n  This huge penthouse suite party will be paid for by the rest of us \nand blow a record-smashing $2 trillion deficit hole into our economy \nand programs like Medicare and Medicaid. I knew all of this. It is \npredictable enough.\n  But then I noticed a provision yesterday that is absolutely \ngobstopping, shocking, startling, eye-popping, unbelievable in the GOP \ntax blueprint. It is called the territorial system, and what it means \nis simple. We will tax American businesses only when their operations \nare here in America. Here is what that means: if I am a businessman and \nI am going to set up a manufacturing plant on main street in my \nhometown, I have to pay the full freight of taxes. I pay everything.\n  If I set my business, my new manufacturing plant, up in Mexico, or \nBangladesh, or Ireland, I pay zero taxes. Let me repeat that: if I \ndecide to set up my business in America, I pay 100 percent of the taxes \nI am going to owe. If I decide to relocate my business and all of the \njobs abroad, I will pay zero taxes. That works even if I have already \ngot the business in place here and I decide to ship everything \noverseas. Suddenly, I get a 100 percent tax break for all the profits \nthat I earn overseas.\n  Mr. Speaker, perhaps I misunderstand it. I am not a professor of tax \nlaw. I am a professor of constitutional law. So maybe I am not \ninterpreting it right. I would love nothing more than for one of my \ncolleagues from the other side of the aisle to get up and tell me it is \nnot true, and correct me, and explain what I have got wrong.\n  But if I have got it right, this shocking provision tucked into the \nbill that we are about to see is a job killer, a national emergency, \nand a dagger pointed at the heart of the American economy and our jobs. \nIt is only a few, small, big businesses, a few big businesses that will \nbenefit.\n  Small businesses are not going to be benefited at all. The small \nbusinesses do not set up tax-dodging corporate subsidiaries in the \nCayman Islands, or the Bahamas, or in Ireland. They don't ship \noverseas. So this is for a tiny percentage of the largest corporations \nin America, leaving the small businesses behind and taking millions of \nAmerican jobs with them.\n  Why would the majority do this to us when Donald Trump campaigned on \na platform of putting America first and promising to bring American \njobs back home--not export millions more with a devastating tax plan?\n  Now I see why they are hurdling this through Congress. In 1986, with \nthe tax reform plan, there were 63 days of hearings, and more than 450 \nwitnesses in Ways and Means and the Senate Finance Committee. It took 2 \nyears and 10 months. This plan they want to slam through Congress in \nless than 2 weeks, with barely any witnesses, maybe no hearings, maybe \none or two hearings; and you know why? Because they are tucking the \nmost massive job-killing provision anyone has ever seen into this bill.\n  If anything, we should be imposing higher taxes on those businesses \nthat ship our jobs overseas--not lower taxes--or they should pay the \nsame. But this plan would wipe out any taxes at all, and it is \ndumbfounding that they would think this is something that Congress \nwould put up with--just like they tried to slam through Congress the \nACA repeal and we stopped it when people got the word.\n  We have got to make sure, Mr. Speaker, that every American \nunderstands what is really in this tax bill coming our way.\n", "turn": 1, "speaker": "Mr. RASKIN", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "177", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H8304-H8305", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "1", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "AMERICANS BEWARE OF TAX BILL", "id": "CREC-2017-11-01-pt1-PgH8304-2", "title": "AMERICANS BEWARE OF TAX BILL"}
