Mr. Speaker, let me begin by saying to my brother, Steve, \nback in Ohio: I am so very proud of you, your courage, your goodness, \nand your honor.\n  Mr. Speaker, meanwhile, President Trump and the Republicans are doing \neverything to railroad tax breaks through this Congress to the top 1 \npercent with no open hearings, with deals being cut in the Speaker's \noffice. So I say: Whoa.\n  It is worth taking a step back to talk about what a good tax plan \ncontains. A good tax plan puts money back in the pockets of middle \nclass working families and small business owners. A good tax plan spurs \njob creation right here in the U.S.A. Yet everything we have seen and \nheard from the Republicans does exactly the opposite.\n  The goal should be to create more stability in our economy, not raise \nthe deficit. We have got to stop businesses from shipping jobs overseas \nas companies hold their money offshore. They should bring it back home.\n  Tax reform shouldn't be negotiated in secret. Why should lobbyists \nknow more about the bill than Members of Congress? A tax bill shouldn't \nexplode our deficit or threaten your 401(k) plan or hurt Medicare and \nMedicaid.\n  It is time for Republicans to do their jobs, put forward a budget-\nbalancing tax plan that helps American families, not just billionaires \nand multimillionaires; and bring the plan forward in sunlight, not \nbackroom dealings.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Ms. KAPTUR", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "177", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H8368", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "1", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "TAX REFORM NEEDS TO BE NEGOTIATED OPENLY", "id": "CREC-2017-11-01-pt1-PgH8368-2", "title": "TAX REFORM NEEDS TO BE NEGOTIATED OPENLY"}
