Mr. Speaker, I have a map beside me. It is not a Verizon \nor an AT&T map showing its coverage. What this is is a snapshot, a \nmoment in time, of the number of airplanes in the United States' \nairspace at any moment, over 90,000 flights a day. Think about that. \nThat is over 200,000 takeoffs and landings.\n  We, in the United States, have the safest and the busiest airspace in \nthe world; yet there are some in Congress who want to privatize this to \na board made up of 13 members only. I personally think it is more of a \nmonopolization, not a privatization of our airspace.\n  This is the taxpayers' airspace. This is not the airspace that we \nshould be giving away to a 13-member board, or the control of.\n  Those who want to pass this AIRR Act, H.R. 2997, want us to compare \nit to Canada. Well, I have flown in Canada. Look at the map: below the \nline in the United States, above the line in Canada. It is not even \napples to apples. It is not apples to oranges. It is apples to \nelephants.\n  And you say, well, that makes no sense. No, it doesn't. It does not \nmake any sense to give control of this airspace, where our wonderful \nmen in uniform and women who fly the military aircraft, the pilots like \nmyself, but, more importantly, the carriers that carry all of us to \nhere and there, the ability to control this airspace.\n  I am a small-government guy, Mr. Speaker, but there are three \ninstances where government needs to be involved in the lives of our \ncitizens: national defense, national intelligence, and national \nairspace.\n  I would argue that I have probably been in more control towers than \nany Member of Congress, and when you walk in, there are wonderful \ncontrollers who are looking at modern equipment, computer screens, \ndisplay lights, who are moving aircraft here and there, very \nefficiently, very professionally.\n  There are those who have stood at this podium, Mr. Speaker, and held \nup pieces of paper like this and have scared our people into saying: \nOh, this is the way controllers transfer control of airplanes from \nairspace to airspace.\n  That is a gross mischaracterization of what is happening. They use \nthis as a backup if a grid goes down, but they don't use it to move \ntraffic. They use modern computers.\n\n  The NextGen, or what we call the next generation of modernization of \nFAA, is called ADS-B, Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast. It \nallows separation of aircraft to come down. It has saved billions--that \nis with a B--in fuel and other costs, and yet we want to give all this \nmodern equipment to the control of a 13-member board? I think not.\n  We have all had delays in airports. Most of them, I will tell you, \nare weather. But how many of us have pulled up in a plane and we are \nwaiting for another plane to back out of a gate? That is not an air \ntraffic control issue. That is an issue with controlling the gates at \nthe airport, and that goes back to the airlines.\n  How many of us have been delayed because they come on and when we are \njust fixing to board the plane, oh, you have a maintenance issue, or we \nare waiting for another pilot crew to get off one aircraft to pilot \nyour aircraft? Again, those who would want to pass this act would make \nyou believe that that is air traffic control's fault. No, it does not \nhave to do with air traffic control.\n  CBO has said that if we give this airspace control to a 13-member \nprivate board, it will cause a $100 billion deficit addition--$100 \nbillion. The Congressional Review Service has said that if we do that, \nthat automatically allows sequester to take place. We don't need that. \nWe are trying to get out of that now. Our wonderful men and women in \nuniform are having a hard enough time meeting quotas, meeting \nequipment, meeting training, everything, because of the sequester.\n  This would hurt military retirement funding. This would hurt our \nBorder Patrol, men and women there protecting us from terrorist \nactivity on a daily basis.\n  Mr. Speaker, we need modernization, but we don't need privatization. \nIt is a bad idea any way you look at it.\n  We do need to pass a long-term FAA reauthorization act. I am all for \nthat. Our FAA needs to have the stability of funding where they can \nlook down the road more than 6 months at a time and plan for what is \ncoming down and what they need to do to keep our airspace safe.\n  So, Mr. Speaker, we don't need this H.R. 2997 passed. We need just to \nfund FAA for a long time.\n", "turn": 1, "speaker": "Mr. ABRAHAM", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "177", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H8303", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "1", "month": "November"}, "related_bills": [{"type": "HR", "context": "FIRSTPARAGRAPH", "congress": "115", "number": "2997"}, {"type": "HR", "context": "OTHER", "congress": "115", "number": "2997"}], "doc_title": "SETTING THE RECORD STRAIGHT ON OUR AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL SYSTEM", "id": "CREC-2017-11-01-pt1-PgH8303"}
