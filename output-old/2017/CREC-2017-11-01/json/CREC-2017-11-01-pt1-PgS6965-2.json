Mr. President, today we honor an icon of the film \nindustry and a distinguished public servant, George Stevens, Jr. For \nfive decades, George Stevens, Jr., served as the founding director of \nthe American Film Institute, AFI, an organization that led the clarion \ncall to preserve and celebrate America's film heritage.\n  In honoring him, I would like to state the following in the Record:\n\n       Whereas, George Stevens, Jr., stood in the Rose Garden of \n     the White House in 1967 when President Lyndon Johnson \n     announced there would be an American Film Institute in order \n     to address the crisis of America's disappearing motion \n     picture heritage.\n       Whereas, through the extraordinary vision of the Library of \n     Congress and the American Film Institute, more than 37,000 \n     motion pictures are now safely preserved in the AFI \n     Collection at the Library of Congress.\n       Whereas, George Stevens, Jr., led the effort at the AFI to \n     create a rescue list of movies with the Museum of Modern Art, \n     Eastman House, and the Library of Congress and locate and \n     preserve missing films.\n       Whereas, the collection includes classic American films, \n     including ``It's A Wonderful Life,'' ``Mr. Smith Goes to \n     Washington,'' ``The Ten Commandment,'' ``Puss in Boots,'' and \n     George Stevens, Sr.'s ``Gunga Din.''\n       Whereas, George Stevens, Jr., expanded the horizons of the \n     next generation of filmmakers and visionaries with the \n     creation an AFI Center for Advanced Film Studies.\n       Whereas, George Stevens, Jr., unleashed the power of \n     filmmaking in service to the\n\n\n     American people, leading the United States Information Agency \n     Motion Picture Service and producing award-winning films \n     about the fabric of American life.\n       Therefore, today in the U.S. Senate, I honor the 50th \n     anniversary of the American Film Institute and the \n     extraordinary legacy of George Stevens, Jr., director, \n     producer, playwright, and public servant without equal. \n     Thomas Edison may be given credit for inventing the film \n     industry, but it is George Stevens, Jr., and the American \n     Film Institute who have preserved it for future generations \n     to come.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. MARKEY", "itemno": 0}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 1}], "header": {"chamber": "Senate", "num": "177", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "S6965-S6966", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "1", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "TRIBUTE TO GEORGE STEVENS, JR.", "id": "CREC-2017-11-01-pt1-PgS6965-2", "title": "TRIBUTE TO GEORGE STEVENS, JR."}
