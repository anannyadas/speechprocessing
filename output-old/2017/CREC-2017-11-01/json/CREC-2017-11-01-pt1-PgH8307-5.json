Mr. Speaker, no family or community should \nhave to relive the devastating loss we felt on February 12, 2009, the \nday Colgan Air Flight 3407 crashed in western New York, killing all \naboard and one on the ground.\n  Thanks to the tireless efforts of the Flight 3407 families and a \nbipartisan collection of Members of Congress, new flight safety \nstandards have saved other families from similar pain, achieving 7 \nyears of no commercial airline fatalities.\n  Yet some, including the new nominee to the National Transportation \nSafety Board, are questioning the need for these hard-fought, \ncommonsense flight safety and training standards.\n  You have a right to know which airline is flying your plane, you have \na right to know that your pilot is well rested, and you have a right to \nknow that the pilot is adequately trained to handle any challenges that \nmight occur in flight. For these rights and for enhanced safety, you \ncan thank the families of Flight 3407 for their work in reaching these \nstandards, and you can join me in fighting to make sure that we keep \nthem.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. HIGGINS of New York", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "177", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H8307", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "1", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "FLIGHT STANDARDS", "id": "CREC-2017-11-01-pt1-PgH8307-5", "title": "FLIGHT STANDARDS"}
