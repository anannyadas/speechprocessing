Mr. President, today I wish to recognize a member of my \nstaff who has been in public service on Capitol Hill for 30 years. \nSusan Olson is my deputy chief of staff and general counsel. She has \nserved Members of Congress, the Senate, and congressional committees \nfor decades and is a well-known, beloved public servant around the \nHill.\n  Susan joined my staff when I came to the Senate in 2011, but she \nalready had a long track record of distinguished service and respect \nfrom her peers. I got to know Susan when she served as secretary of the \nHouse NATO Parliamentary Assembly Delegation, of which I was a member \nduring my years in the House of Representatives. Susan's knowledge, \ndetermination, and warm personality helped her earn the respect and \nadmiration of Members and staff alike. She also served as a valued \nstaff member on the House Ethics Committee where she was a legal \ncounsel from 2004 to 2011.\n  Prior to working on the Ethics Committee, Susan served in the office \nof former Congressman Doug Bereuter of Nebraska for 17 years as \nlegislative assistant, legislative director, and chief of staff. During \nher tenure with Congressman Bereuter, she also served as the secretary \nof the House Delegation to the British American Parliamentary Group \nfrom 1998 to 2000.\n  Susan's time on my staff has been marked by her wealth of knowledge \nand expertise on so many things. She is a trusted adviser, but more \nimportantly, a dear friend to me and to everyone on my staff in \nWashington and Arkansas. We love Susan very much and appreciate all her \nhard work. She takes a personal interest in everyone she meets, from \nthe many interns who cycle in and out of my office, to those on my \nstaff and the countless men and women she has worked with over the \nyears during her time on the Hill.\n  We are so happy for and proud of Susan for reaching this milestone. I \ncongratulate her for the many years of service she has rendered to the \nU.S. Congress and to our country.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. BOOZMAN", "itemno": 0}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 1}], "header": {"chamber": "Senate", "num": "177", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "S6967", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "1", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "TRIBUTE TO SUSAN OLSON", "id": "CREC-2017-11-01-pt1-PgS6967", "title": "TRIBUTE TO SUSAN OLSON"}
