Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Lieutenant \nColonel Gery Brent Truitt, U.S. Army Retired, of Harker Heights, Texas, \nfor his dedication to our country while serving 25 years in the Army. \nLTC Truitt exemplifies what it means to commit his life to his country \nand has more than earned our admiration and respect. He is a deserving \nrecipient of a Congressional Veteran Commendation.\n  Upon his commissioning as a Second Lieutenant from Sam Houston State \nUniversity in 1979, LTC Truitt began his military career as an Infantry \nOfficer with the Texas National Guard and then entered the United \nStates Army. As Lieutenant, he conducted more combat patrols inside the \nKorean demilitarized zone than any other officer in the 2nd Infantry \nDivision, and as Major, he served in a variety of 5th Special Forces \nGroup assignments. Just prior to being promoted to Lieutenant Colonel, \nhe was diagnosed with terminal colon cancer, which he successfully \novercame in the next year. LTC Truitt used that time to revive the \nColumbus State University ROTC Program as a professor in Military \nScience.\n  This brave soldier is also a committed citizen. Following his \nmilitary career, he continued to support the military in the Central \nTexas Special Forces Association. As President, he is responsible for \nan annual raffle that raises thousands of dollars annually to support \nhomeless veterans' programs and local non-profit organizations to meet \nimmediate community needs. His work to make his community a great place \nto live and work have made lasting and positive impacts on the region.\n  I commend LTC Truitt's selfless service to his community and nation. \nHis dedication to our country and community reflects the best values of \ncentral Texas. I join his family and friends in saluting his great work \nand dedication to our country.\n\n\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. CARTER of Texas", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 3}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "177", "extension": true, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "E1482-E1483", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "1", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "HONORING LIEUTENANT COLONEL GERY BRENT TRUITT, U.S. ARMY (RETIRED)", "id": "CREC-2017-11-01-pt1-PgE1482-3", "title": "HONORING LIEUTENANT COLONEL GERY BRENT TRUITT, U.S. ARMY (RETIRED)"}
