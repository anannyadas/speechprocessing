Mr. President, I rise this morning with a heavy heart. \nMy city, my dear city of New York, no stranger to terrorism, was once \nagain its victim yesterday.\n  Yesterday afternoon, a man deliberately drove a rented truck into \ngroups of pedestrians and cyclists, killing eight and injuring about a \ndozen more. Some of the injured were schoolchildren. These people were \nbiking or walking home, enjoying a brisk and beautiful New York autumn \nday. It is tragic. It leaves a hole in your stomach.\n  Our hearts go out to the victims and their families, and we wish all \nof the injured a full and speedy recovery. We are also grateful--deeply \ngrateful--to the New York Police Department and the first responders, \nespecially Officer Ryan Nash, 28 years old, who was the first on the \nscene. He reacted quickly and decisively to bring down the attacker and \nbring him into custody. Who knows how much worse the tragedy would have \nbeen without his actions.\n  As one of thousands of New Yorkers who regularly ride on the path \nwhere this attack took place--in the last month, I have ridden on it \ntwice--it hits close to home. My daughter went to the school near the \nscene, Stuyvesant High School, and she used the bike path I don't know \nhow many times. This is our territory, our home.\n  The attacks are meant to confuse and terrorize, but, as the world \nlearned after 9/11 and will learn again, New York doesn't scare easily. \nNew Yorkers are resilient. We always bounce back. We won't let these \nterrorists get their way or affect our way of life. We will never let \nterror prevail.\n  True to form--something that made my heart swell with pride--the New \nYork City Halloween parade marched on last night. Thousands of school \nkids went right into Stuyvesant today. The terrorists cannot stop us. \nThey cannot change our way of life. We love New York. We love America. \nThat bond holds us together.\n\n\n                         Antiterrorism Funding\n\n  Now, I have seen the tweets from President Trump. After September 11, \nthe first thing President Bush did was to invite Senator Clinton and me \nto the White House, where he pledged to do whatever was in his power to \nhelp our city. President Bush, in a moment of national tragedy, \nunderstood the meaning of his high office and sought to bring our \ncountry together.\n  President Trump, where is your leadership?\n  The contrast between President Bush's actions after 9/11 and \nPresident Trump's actions this morning could not be starker.\n  Again, President Trump, where is your leadership?\n  I would say in closing that I have always believed that immigration \nis good for America. I believe it today.\n  President Trump, instead of politicizing and dividing America, which \nhe always seems to do at times of national tragedy, should be bringing \nus together and focusing on the real solution--antiterrorism funding, \nwhich he proposed to cut in his most recent budget. So I am calling on \nPresident Trump to rescind his proposed cuts to this vital \nantiterrorism funding immediately. Our city relies on this funding to \ntrack potential terrorists and to snuff out attacks. The NYPD, which \nbravely and quickly responded to the scene yesterday and brought the \nmayhem to an end, depends on this antiterrorism funding to keep our \ncity safe day in and day out. So, again, I am calling on the President \nto rescind his proposed cuts to this vital antiterrorism funding \nimmediately.\n  Instead of dividing, instead of politicizing, do something real, Mr. \nPresident. Restore these funds now.\n  I yield the floor.", "turn": 2, "speaker": "Mr. SCHUMER", "itemno": 4}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, this week the Senate is moving through a \nseries of votes to fill vacancies in the Federal appeals court. \nPresident Trump has nominated highly qualified, mainstream judges and \nlegal scholars to do these jobs. Now, Democrats have responded once \nagain with delay and with obstruction. It is clear to me that we need \nto change the rules in the Senate that govern how we debate nominations \nin this body. All year Democrats have been putting up roadblocks to \nnominations. They have forced the majority leader to file cloture so \nthat\n\n\nthen we can confirm nominees like these four judges.\n  As of last Friday, Democrats have forced the Senate to file cloture \n47 different times when we have had to have cloture votes on President \nTrump's nominees. There were only six cloture votes at this point for \nthe previous four Presidents--five for Obama, none for George W. Bush, \none for Bill Clinton, and none under the Presidency of George Herbert \nWalker Bush. These are the kind of hoops that the Democrats have been \nmaking the Senate jump through in an effort to confirm President \nTrump's nominees.\n  The procedure has been set in place to allow for debate. Well, debate \nis a good thing in the Senate, as long as debate is actually occurring. \nIt is a chance for Senators to stand up, to say what they like or what \nthey don't like about a nominee. Now, if no one wants to debate, we \nshould just move things along and have the vote. There is one Senate \nrule that allows for as much as 30 hours of debate time on Presidential \nnominations after we have actually had the cloture vote. Now, in \nreality, very little of that time that is spent on the Senate floor is \nactually being used for the debate. In the past, both sides would agree \nto waive the time requirements and to move on to other Senate business, \nwhich is what we need to do to get the country continuing to move \nforward. But what is happening now is that Democrats are insisting on \ncloture votes, and then they are insisting that we use hour after hour \nafter hour, even when there is no one here to debate what is the issue \nor the person in front of us.\n  It is time to end this pointless spectacle. The Senate used to be \ncalled the world's greatest deliberative body. Democrats have turned it \ninto the world's most paralyzed deliberative body.\n  We have more than 125 nominees for various jobs who have had hearings \nin committee, who have testified in committee, who have been voted on \nin committee, who have cleared through the entire committee-vetting \nprocess and are now waiting for a vote on the Senate floor--125 of \nthem. Most of these people have bipartisan support. They will be \nconfirmed easily and eventually. They should be confirmed immediately. \nThere should be no reason for Democrats' stalling tactics except, once \nagain, to slow down the pace of other progress in the Senate on \nlegislative issues.\n  Mr. President, look at what happened with one judge last week. It is \na case you are very familiar with. Scott Palk was nominated by \nPresident Trump to serve on the U.S. district court. He had bipartisan \nsupport in the Judiciary Committee. He went to the committee, had a \nhearing in the committee, and with bipartisan support was voted out of \nthe committee. That was in June--more than 4 months ago.\n  Now, apparently that is not good enough for the Democrats--not at \nall. They are only interested in slowing down the work of the Senate. \nSo we had a cloture vote on the nominee. It was 1 of the 47 cloture \nvotes that we talked about. We had to have a cloture vote. Every \nRepublican and 27 Democrats voted for him. So he had bipartisan \nsupport. We still had to allow all of this wasted time for the debate. \nWe couldn't conduct any of the other business of the Senate during the \ntime because the Democrats insisted that we use all of the debate time. \nNow, they could have very easily agreed to waive the rules, as we do, \nand go straight to a vote. We wanted to do that. The Democrats refused.\n  So how much of that time--those 30 hours--did the Democrats actually \nspend on the floor debating this person's qualifications to be a \nFederal judge? How many of those 30 hours did the Democrats use? None. \nHow many minutes did they use? None. Not one Democrat came to the floor \nof the Senate to talk about that judge. Not a single Democrat even \nbothered to say a word against his nomination. There were fewer than 20 \nminutes of total talk on the floor of the Senate. Through hour after \nhour after hour of ongoing time, there were fewer than 20 minutes spent \nactually talking about the judge, and it was all spent in praise by the \nRepublicans. We still had to run out the clock because that is the \ndelay game the Democrats are playing in the Senate. The Senate had to \nwaste hours and hours when we could have finished debating in less than \n20 minutes. The Democrats have done this same thing time after time \nafter time, day after day, wasting day after day.\n  Things take time in the Senate. We understand that. That is what the \nFounding Fathers had in mind when they formed the two bodies of \nCongress, the House and the Senate. There is no excuse, though, for \nDemocrats abusing the process to make things take even longer. \nDemocrats aren't using the rules for debate. They are not using the \nrules for deliberation. It is only for delay. It hasn't always been \nthis way, and there is no reason it should continue to be this way.\n  The Senate had a different standard for nominations a few years ago, \nand that was in the 113th Congress. In years 2013 and 2014, the Senate \nallowed just 2 hours of debate after cloture was invoked on nominations \nfor district court judges. That is 2 hours more than the Democrats \nactually spent debating this judge's nomination last week. The rules \nsaid that we would have up to 8 hours to debate executive branch \nnominations below the Cabinet level. Then, for Cabinet Secretaries, for \nJustices on the Supreme Court, and for circuit courts, it was the full \n30 hours of debate. Thirty hours now is what we allow every nomination \ntoday, and Democrats have shown that in most cases it is far too much \ntime because even though we have to spend all the time, they use very \nlittle of it talking about the nominees.\n  We need a fair debate on every nomination. The procedure from 2013 \nand 2014, with fair debate on nominations, is one that was fair. The \nway the Democrats are wasting time today to keep us from doing our work \nis not fair. I believe it is time to return to the rules for debating \nnominees that the Senate used 3 years ago. There will still be plenty \nof time for Senators to debate the nominees, to raise objections if \nthere are any. Every Senator could be on the record. There are just a \nlot of hours that we could avoid that are being wasted today that could \nbe used to do the people's business of this country. A President's \nnominations of qualified people to important jobs was never meant to be \na tool for delay in the Senate or to be an obstruction the way the \nDemocrats have been using it.\n  Now, these rules that we used in 2013 and 2014 were the result of a \ncompromise. Democrats controlled the Senate at the time. A Democrat, \nBarack Obama, was in the White House making the nominations, and \nRepublicans agreed to make these changes to the rules. It was part of a \nbipartisan group, and I was part of that group. There were eight \nSenators. They worked on this compromise--four Republicans and four \nDemocrats. Senator McCain and Senator Alexander were part of this \ngroup. Senator Schumer, who is now the Democrat leader, was part of \nthis group. There was overwhelming support for these changes on both \nsides of the aisle.\n  It is time to do it again. Let's change the Senate rules and go back \nto the process that Senator Schumer supported in 2013 and 2014. Today, \nthe schedule allows us to do one or two nominations in a typical week. \nIf we go back to the 2014 standard, we could clear multiple nominations \nin a day. The Republican Senate has been busy this year, and we have \nmade progress on behalf of the American people. We have passed 15 \nresolutions rolling back destructive, Obama-era regulations using the \nCongressional Review Act and signed into law by the President. We \npassed a budget that will help give Americans at home a raise by \ncutting their taxes and giving us an opportunity to do the kind of tax \nrelief, tax reform, tax reductions, tax cuts that the American people \nare looking for. We need to do more. It is time for Democrats to stop \nabusing the rules just to delay the process. It is time to go back to \nthe previous standard of debating nominations. It is time to pick up \nthe pace and do the job the American people expect us to do.\n\n  Now, if Democrats have a different approach and don't want to accept \nthe standard of debate that was set in the previous Congress, then I \nbelieve it is time for us to force that change. If Democrats maintain \ntheir lockstep opposition to real progress on judicial vacancies and \nother nominees, we should give them a chance to vote on their continued \nobstruction. We can vote on these nominees in a straightforward\n\n\nand efficient way or we can vote to return to the precedent of the \n113th Congress. That is the choice. Either way, it is time to vote.\n  Thank you.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.", "turn": 4, "speaker": "Mr. BARRASSO", "itemno": 6}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, the magnitude of this moment should be \napparent to all. A sitting U.S. President's campaign chief and his \nprotege have been indicted for conspiring against the United States. \nAnother campaign adviser has pleaded guilty for lying to the FBI about \nmeetings with Russians. At those meetings, he illegally discussed \nobtaining dirt on the President's political opponent and emails that \nhad been stolen.\n  Two points need to be underscored for the American people. First, \nthese indictments and conviction are a sober, shattering moment in \nAmerican history. Second, all of us on both sides of the aisle should \ncome together to support the work of the special counsel and assure \nthat he is able to follow the facts and the law and all of the \nevidence, wherever they may lead.\n  This moment will stand as a landmark in American history, just as \nmany of the moments in Watergate did. This investigation has proceeded \nmore quickly than Watergate did. John Mitchell was indicted in 1974 for \nconspiracy, perjury, and obstruction of justice. He was convicted a \nyear later. That indictment took a year and a half of investigation. \nThese indictments have occurred just 11 months after the election and \nbarely 6 months after the beginning of the investigation.\n  We know that the President's campaign hired two alleged criminals and \none admitted criminal. Two of them were foreign agents, and the \ncampaign was run by a Russian agent, unregistered, now charged with \nconspiring against the United States. He was supported by another \nRussian foreign agent who was also charged with the same 12 criminal \ncounts. These two individuals, Paul Manafort and Rick Gates, were \nsignificant people in the Trump campaign.\n  In the case of Gates, his influence continued through the early \nmonths of the new administration. Manafort ran Trump's campaign at its \nmost critical point, and he organized and directed the 2016 Republican \nNational Committee convention, including the critical delegate-\ncorralling effort against a potential ``Never Trump'' insurrection, \nsecuring the Republican nomination for Donald Trump.\n  Under Manafort's leadership of the Trump campaign, the Republican \nParty stripped language from their platform that would have called for \narming Ukraine against Russian aggression. Ahead of the convention, \nManafort also offered to brief a Russian billionaire on the state of \nthe 2016 race. The convention he helped organize became a venue for a \nmeeting between Attorney General Sessions and the Russian ambassador, \nafter which the Attorney General misled Congress, implying--indeed \nstating--that it never took place.\n  The Trump campaign also worked extensively with George Papadopoulos, \na foreign adviser whose actions constitute the most significant \nindication of possible collusion--so far the most significant--between \nthe Trump campaign and Russian officials.\n  Papadopoulos was named a foreign policy adviser in March 2016 and \nbegan communicating with Russian nationals the next month. He met with \na professor for breakfast in London. They discussed stolen emails from \nHillary Clinton and subsequently shuttled messages to the Kremlin and \nback for the Trump campaign.\n  He worked with officials at the highest level of the Trump campaign. \nHis direct boss, in fact, was Jeff Sessions, who was then the head of \nTrump's national security advisory committee, and he is now, of course, \nthe Attorney General. He communicated extensively with the campaign \nmanager and members of the national security team.\n  President Trump tweeted today that he was a ``young, low level \nvolunteer,'' but the President sang his praises at a meeting with the \nWashington Post editorial board in March 2016, calling him an ``energy \nand oil consultant, excellent guy.'' These revelations are stunning.\n  Now the President is at a critical juncture. He can choose the course \nof cooperation or confrontation. He is literally teetering on the brink \nof a decision that could prove disastrous for himself and for America \nif he chooses a constitutional confrontation.\n  We are at a moment very much like the one that occurred in Watergate. \nIt is still memorable to many of us in this Chamber, although we were \nnot here at the time. Our Nation could be careening toward a \nconstitutional crisis. Some of the actions the President has already \ntaken, such as firing Jim Comey as FBI Director, may be evidence of \nobstruction of justice in the investigation by the special counsel. As \npart of our oversight responsibility, the Judiciary Committee must \ncontinue its work in investigating that firing and other actions that \nmay constitute obstruction of justice.\n  Firing the special counsel himself is something only the President \ncould try to do. It would be the ultimate act of contempt for the rule \nof law that is rightly seen as the actions of someone who has something \nto hide.\n  At stake is more than just this President or this special counsel. It \nis literally the rule of law. To this President, the rule of law may be \nmeaningless, a facade or a fiction, but that is exactly why Congress \nmust give the judicial branch specific, enforceable power to stop the \nPresident from firing the special counsel.\n  That is the purpose of legislation I have introduced, along with \ncolleagues. I am here to call upon this body to support and pass the \nSpecial Counsel Independence Protection Act.\n  I called for the special counsel to be established in February of \nthis year and was joined by 10 of my colleagues in that call. It was \nbased on credible allegations that the Trump team had colluded with the \nRussian Government. The Special Counsel Independence Protection Act, \nwhich I have cosponsored along with colleagues, seeks to forestall the \nkind of potential constitutional crisis raised by the President's \nthreats not so long ago and his labeling the investigation a hoax and a \nwitch hunt.\n  The Washington Post reported today that advisers close to the \nPresident are urging that, in fact, he take more aggressive action \nagainst the special counsel. The specter of Presidential action against \nRobert Mueller, designed to stop or stymie a virtually unavoidable and \nnecessary criminal investigation of the President himself, makes \nsafeguarding the special counsel more urgent and necessary now than \never before.\n  Rather than encouraging Presidential abuse of power by inaction, the \nCongress must move forward right away to check potential malfeasance \nand abuse before it occurs. Even the threat of such political \ninterference constituting potential obstruction of justice undermines \nthe special counsel's investigation. It makes witnesses less likely to \ncooperate. It discourages the agents and investigators working for the \nspecial counsel. It creates unnecessary confusion in the American \npublic. Only judicial review can provide the check against such abuse \nand ensure confidence that the special counsel will proceed \nmethodically and systematically to uphold the rule of law and follow \nthe facts in evidence, wherever they may lead. That is what the \nAmerican people want him to do. That is what we should guarantee that \nhe will do. Make no mistake, this investigation will continue and \nconclude fairly and fully. The only question is how much turmoil and \nhow much damage is done in the course of that investigation.\n  Clearly, like any investigation and prosecution, this one is a \nmosaic, consisting of many different diverse pieces and already it is \ncoming together on the Trump campaign's contacts with Russian \nofficials. They include, for example, campaign adviser Papadopoulos's \ncontacts with a Russian agent who claimed he had ``dirt'' on Hillary \nClinton; Donald Trump, Jr., and the campaign aides' Trump Tower meeting \nwith Russian agents to obtain information on Clinton; Jared\n\n\nKushner's meetings with sanctioned VEB Russian bank CEO Sergey Gorkov; \nSessions' meetings with the Russian Ambassador; the Cambridge Analytica \nCEO's outreach to WikiLeaks to obtain Hillary Clinton's missing emails; \nand former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn's dining with \nPresident Putin in Moscow. Those pieces of the mosaic are only the \nbeginning. We are at a critical stage--the end of the beginning, not \nthe beginning of the end.\n  As a former prosecutor, I know investigations take time. The best \ninvestigations are done without deadlines. In an important case like \nthis one, and in a complex and challenging one, we must allow all the \ntime necessary to assemble that full mosaic and put together the pieces \nof this puzzle.\n  The Watergate scandal took 2 years to unravel, from Bob Woodward and \nCarl Bernstein's first piece in the Washington Post in June of 1972 to \nNixon's resignation in August of 1974. We are less than a year into the \nTrump Presidency and fewer than 10 months into this investigation.\n  The first individuals to be indicted in the Watergate scandal were \nconsidered to be generally outside the President's inner circle. They \nwere E. Howard Hunt, G. Gordon Liddy, and the Watergate burglars in \nSeptember of 1972. No one knew--and many denied--the conspiracy that \ninvolved the President and his top lieutenants at the time of those \nfirst indictments. In these cases, too--in these first indictments and \nconviction--a lot more is to come.\n  We cannot wait until the President potentially shuts down his special \ncounsel to come to his defense. Already, the rule of law is under \nthreat. On Sunday--the day before the indictments were handed down--the \nPresident tweeted: ``DO SOMETHING!'' with regard to the Russia \ninvestigation. Although his reference was unclear exactly what he meant \nand whom the message was targeting, it certainly was an indication that \nsome kind of action might be taken to thwart the investigation.\n  Any interference in this investigation will be a red line for me and \nfor others in this Chamber. Let the President hear that message loud \nand clear. There is a red line that cannot be crossed. It is political \ninterference or intrusion in the special counsel's investigation, and \nit will be met with a firestorm, I hope, on both sides of the aisle. My \nconversations with our colleagues on the other side of the aisle \nindicate they would share our outrage and outcry if there is an effort \nto stop and stymie this investigation or if there is any other kind of \npolitical interference in it.\n  Senators Graham, Booker, Whitehouse, Coons, and I have cosponsored \nmeasures that will help protect the special counsel. There are two \nmeasures now, but they are so closely similar that they should be \nbrought together, and conversations are underway to do so. I expect we \nwill have a single bill in the very near future.\n  We should stand with one voice against obstruction of this \ninvestigation. I ask that my colleagues go on the record now to state \nthat they will absolutely resist and oppose any interference by the \nexecutive branch into this investigation or investigations that are \nunderway by our congressional committees--on the House side, the \nIntelligence Committee and, in the Senate, the Judiciary Committee \nalong with our Intelligence Committee. The congressional committees \nhave separate purposes. In the Judiciary Committee, we have the unique \nresponsibility of oversight over the Department of Justice and the FBI. \nWe have the unique responsibility to prevent the obstruction of justice \nand to uncover it, as is indicated by the firing of Jim Comey. My hope \nis that investigation will proceed and that it will be bipartisan, so \nwe will have hearings and subpoena witnesses with public testimony \nunder oath and eventually some report to the American people. That is \nmy hope, and that will be our decision here.\n  The decision we cannot and should not make is what the outcome will \nbe of the special counsel investigation. We must guarantee--and we have \nthis responsibility in the Congress--that there is adequate funding and \nauthority for the special counsel, that there is no effort to either \ncut resources or limit the purview of the special counsel or place \nconstraints on the time it may take for this probe to conclude. There \nshould be no firing and no pardons, and we should speak out and stand \nup to assure that message reaches the White House loud and clear.\n  This moment is one of historic magnitude. I cannot emphasize how \nstrongly I feel but also how deeply my colleagues have expressed to me \ntheir own feelings about our responsibility in this moment.\n  The grand jury that is bringing these indictments is an arm of the \ncourts, which should be independent of both the executive and \nlegislative branches. That independence gives the special counsel some \nnew measure of permanence and protection, but the President can still \ntry to fire the special counsel. He cannot fire the grand jury or the \nU.S. District Court judge who impaneled the grand jury. Judicial review \nof any firing of the special counsel, which is the core principle of \nour measure--the Special Counsel Independence Protection Act--would add \na highly significant protection to not just deter misguided and deeply \nmistaken actions, throwing our Nation into turmoil, but also assuring \nthat confidence and trust remains with the special counsel, and he can \nfollow facts and the law with the full support of the American people. \nThe American people can put their trust and faith in him and in our \ncourts. We should assure that we uphold that faith and trust.\n  Thank you.\n  I yield the floor.", "turn": 8, "speaker": "Mr. BLUMENTHAL", "itemno": 10}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, since day one, the President of the \nUnited States has made it clear that his top priority, when it comes to \nhealthcare in our country, is to score political points by attacking \nObamaCare. He has even said repeatedly that healthcare in our country \nwill ``implode,'' but this was not just a prediction that President \nTrump made, it was his goal, and he has tried virtually everything he \ncan do to make that implosion a reality.\n  In January, he abruptly pulled funding for outreach days before the \nend of the 2017 open enrollment period without any analysis of how that \nmight affect patients and families, and he signed executive orders \nspecifically designed to inject uncertainty and increased costs into \nthe healthcare system.\n  President Trump then dedicated the spring and summer to attempting to \njam partisan, extraordinarily destructive legislation through the House \nand Senate to repeal the Affordable Care Act, despite one independent \nanalysis after another showing that each version of TrumpCare would \ncause premiums to spike, take coverage away from millions of people, \nrip protections away from patients with preexisting conditions, and gut \nMedicaid.\n  This fall--after TrumpCare failed another time in the Senate--he \nslashed by 90 percent the investments that help inform families about \ntheir coverage options and followed through on his year-long threat to \ndiscontinue payments designed to lower out-of-pocket costs for low-\nincome enrollees.\n  This is a scenario that healthcare experts said would cause mass \nconsumer confusion and anxiety, one that insurance companies planned \nfor by shifting that burden of uncertainty to patients and taxpayers in \nthe form of higher premiums and fewer options in State marketplaces.\n  Now, this is by no means the full list of ways President Trump has \nattempted his healthcare sabotage, but it does explain why we are here \nnow. Today is the first day of the open enrollment period for 2018, and \nas a direct result of this President's actions, families are going to \nsee higher premiums, more out-of-pocket costs, and fewer coverage \noptions. Many families will have to change their coverage if they want \nto avoid paying hundreds of dollars more in premiums.\n  At a time when we need to continue to do more to bend the healthcare \ncost curve in the right direction, taxpayers are being burdened with \nhigher\n\n\nhealthcare costs to the Federal Government--not because of any \nimprovement in quality or comprehensiveness, just because of the chaos \nthis administration has caused.\n  In fact, just last week, the Trump administration proposed a rule to \ndouble down on the sabotage in 2019 that would let insurers cover fewer \nservices in addition to raising costs. I have to say, I just truly \nnever imagined that a President of the United States would so openly \nand uncaringly root for the people of this country to be worse off. But \nthat is exactly what President Trump is doing. It needs to be said, and \nit needs to be stopped.\n\n  What makes this even more frustrating is that a lot of it could have \nbeen stopped months ago if Republican leaders hadn't insisted on trying \nto help this administration carry out its partisan, wrecking-ball \nhealthcare strategy.\n  Back in September, Chairman Alexander and I were very near agreement \non a bipartisan bill to stabilize healthcare markets and protect \nfamilies from higher premiums and out-of-pocket costs through regular \norder, through a process that actually engaged over half the Senate. We \nwere on the verge of reaching an agreement when Republican leaders \nfroze our negotiations. Why? In order to jam TrumpCare through the \nSenate one more time.\n  Let me repeat that. Republican leaders hit the pause button on a \nbipartisan process that could have lowered premiums and stabilized \nmarkets, exposing our patients and families to the full impact of \nPresident Trump's sabotage.\n  That is the bad news, but the good news is that the legislation \nChairman Alexander and I ultimately agreed on can and will still have \nan impact--not just a few years from now but in 2018--if Republican \nleaders don't stand in the way again. Our bill would, among other \npriorities, continue out-of-pocket cost reduction payments and make \nsure that patients and families, not insurance companies, see the \nbenefit of that certainty in the form of rebates next year. The \nlegislation Chairman Alexander and I have proposed, with 12 Democratic \nand 12 Republican cosponsors, would do a lot to help us get things back \non track. It would tie President Trump's hands on sabotage, and it \nwould send a very powerful message that elected officials in Congress \ncan work together to get things done when we focus on common ground \nrather than scoring political points.\n  I would once again urge the majority leader to allow our legislation \nto get a vote. It has the support of 60-plus Senators, and it is \ngrowing. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has said that it \nprovides billions in savings and would stabilize the markets this year \nand lower premiums in 2019. And the President told Chairman Alexander \nthat he supports this process moving forward.\n  There is no reason to wait. There is absolutely no excuse for \ninaction, and I am going to continue doing everything I can to make \nthat clear until Republican leaders finally listen to the patients and \nfamilies they serve.\n  Mr. President, while I am here today, I also want to take a few \nminutes to speak on another way that I believe President Trump and \nRepublicans are taking our country in a direction that is deeply \nharmful; that is, by stacking our courts with extreme conservative \njudges.\n  The Senate this week is going to vote on four judicial nominees who \neach have the far-rightwing seal of approval. Two are on President \nTrump's short list for Supreme Court Justices, meaning they would \nautomatically vote to overturn Roe v. Wade. Unfortunately, their views \non many things--LGBTQ rights, sexual assault, criminal justice, and \ncorporate interests--are just as deeply troubling. One of the nominees \nwe are considering this week advocated for using electric shocks for \ncriminal punishment, and two--Amy Barrett and Stephanos Bibas--were \nnominated only after Republicans blocked the nominations of Myra Selby \nand Rebecca Haywood--both who happen to be African-American women--to \nthe respective benches.\n  It is clear that as Republican leaders' list of legislative failures \ngrows longer, their effort to enact their agenda by administrative \naction and by stacking the courts is only going to accelerate. That \nmight appeal to extreme conservatives--in fact, I am pretty sure it \ndoes--but the truth is that whether it is healthcare or infrastructure \nor taxes, most people across the country really want to see Congress \nworking together.\n  I am going to continue doing everything I can to speak out and fight \nback against extreme, harmful steps that are being taken by this \nadministration and allowed by Republican leaders here in Congress and \nalso to show there is a better way to get things done--by working under \nregular order, across the aisle, and putting people, not politics, \nfirst. That is what families rightfully expect, and that is what we all \nshould be focused on.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.", "turn": 12, "speaker": "Mrs. MURRAY", "itemno": 14}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I would like to start my remarks this \nmorning by offering my thoughts to the victims of yesterday's \nhorrendous act of terror in New York City, my thanks to the first \nresponders, and I would note the resiliency of the people of New York. \nOnce again, they are going forward with their lives today, showing the \nworld and anyone who would do us harm that Americans stand together and \nthat we move forward regardless of what our foes may try to do.\n\n\n                               Healthcare\n\n  Mr. President, I also rise today to encourage Granite Staters--as my \ncolleague from Washington did--and people across the country to take \nadvantage of the health insurance open enrollment period, which begins \ntoday and runs through December 15.\n  Every citizen deserves quality, affordable health insurance coverage \nto help them live healthy and productive lives. Access to healthcare is \ncritical to the freedom, dignity, and well-being of our citizens, and \nit also contributes to a productive workforce and a thriving economy.\n  I still remember meeting with a constituent named Jo, about a year or \ntwo ago, who has a chronic health condition. When she lost her job in \n2009 and lost her health insurance with it, her condition deteriorated \nto the point where she couldn't work, and a downward spiral ensued. She \nlost her home. She couldn't get healthcare because she had no \nresources. Because of the Affordable Care Act's Medicaid expansion, she \nwas eventually able to get healthcare, to get the surgery and therapy \nshe needed, and now she is working again. So healthcare is not only for \nthe benefit of the individual who receives it; it helps that individual \nbecome a productive member of our workforce.\n  Affordable, quality care is also critically important to those who \nare working but may not otherwise be able to afford health insurance \neven if employed. It is something I have heard often this year from \ncitizens of my State, as my Republican colleagues attempted to pass \nTrumpCare legislation that would have led to higher healthcare costs \nfor less care.\n  At an emergency field hearing in June that I held with Senator \nShaheen, we heard from a woman named Enna from Exeter, NH. Enna, who is \nself-employed, said that prior to the Affordable Care Act, her family \nwas unable to maintain insurance consistently. Even when she did have \nit, her previous policy didn't cover critical preventive care that she \nneeded. As a result of the ACA, Enna has been able to purchase \naffordable health insurance through the marketplace in New Hampshire \nfor herself and her family of four, giving them the peace of mind that \ncomes with having health insurance, while continuing to grow her own \nbusiness.\n  Enna's story is the story of so many people in New Hampshire, and it \nrepresents why it is essential for people across the country to take \nadvantage of this open enrollment period.\n  From today through December 15, Granite Staters and all Americans \nhave an opportunity to sign up for a healthcare plan at \nwww.coveringnewhampshire.org or www.healthcare.gov. It is also \nimportant for people to take this opportunity to see what other plans \nare available, to shop around and see whether other plans offer more \nsavings than their current one does, and it is critical to educate our \nfriends and neighbors about these options, given the Trump \nadministration's attempts to sabotage our Nation's healthcare\n\n\nsystem. These sabotage attempts include the Department of Health and \nHuman Services slashing the Affordable Care Act's outreach and \nadvertising budgets ahead of open enrollment, which provide key \ninformation and resources for those who need to sign up for care. It is \nclear that the Trump administration doesn't want people to know they \ncan enroll, but that doesn't change the fact that the Affordable Care \nAct is the law of the land, people can still get covered, and financial \nassistance is available for many on the healthcare exchange.\n  We must end this sabotage and continue to work together on efforts to \nlower costs and build on and improve the Affordable Care Act, and that \nis exactly what I am focused on.\n  I was proud to join HELP Committee leaders, Senators Alexander and \nMurray, to cosponsor bipartisan legislation that would stabilize health \ninsurance markets and lower costs for hard-working Americans. This bill \nincludes a provision that the New Hampshire Insurance Department could \nuse to support its proposal to create a reinsurance pool to help reduce \npremiums in our State's individual health insurance market. This \nlegislation proves it is possible to work across party lines to make \nprogress in our healthcare system. It is clear that it has the votes to \npass. We need Republican leadership to bring it up for a vote.\n  It is up to all of us to come together and make sure that healthcare \nis truly available and affordable to all of our people and to encourage \nour fellow citizens to sign up for the care they need to help their \nfamilies thrive.\n  The enrollment period is a critical time for the health and well-\nbeing of our citizens and for our productivity, as well, as a country. \nI encourage Granite Staters to take advantage of this opportunity and \nreceive the benefits that come with affordable healthcare.\n  Mr. President, I also want to take a moment to address the continued \nefforts this week from President Trump and my Republican colleagues to \npush through nominees who will truly reshape our Federal judiciary.\n  An independent and impartial judiciary is critical to democracy and \nto our march toward progress. Our Founders established our court system \nto serve as an independent arbiter that would protect the rights of all \nAmericans and ensure equal justice under our laws. Unfortunately, the \nnominees who have been selected by the President and who have been \nvoted on throughout this year have been handpicked by far-right groups \nto serve a conservative agenda. We have seen judicial nominees who have \nnot committed to upholding the precedent of Roe v. Wade and protecting \na woman's right to make her own healthcare decisions and control her \nown destiny in doing so, nominees who have stood against basic rights \nand freedoms for LGBTQ Americans and who have opposed protections for \nworkers' rights. This is unacceptable.\n  We are voting on lifetime appointments that require a commitment to \nequal justice, objectivity, and sound judgment. I will continue to \noppose judicial nominees who do not live up to those standards, and I \nurge my colleagues to do the same.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.", "turn": 14, "speaker": "Ms. HASSAN", "itemno": 16}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I would like to address the issue we are \nvoting on in a few minutes. The Senate will vote on the nomination of \nMichigan Supreme Court Justice Joan Larsen to serve on the Sixth \nCircuit Court of Appeals.\n  Though she currently lives in Michigan, Justice Larsen was born in \nand hails from my State of Iowa. In fact, she and I share the same alma \nmater, the University of Northern Iowa, for our bachelor's degrees. I \nhave also learned, since meeting Justice Larsen, that her father was \nthe longtime CEO of the Lutheran Services in Iowa. He is now retired, \nbut during the time he was the CEO, he was the very same person with \nwhom I often met for breakfast when he would come to Washington to tell \nus about the concerns of the Lutheran Services in Iowa. At that time, I \nnever knew I might be speaking in favor of his daughter. I didn't even \nknow of his daughter at that time. So I am proud to see a fellow Iowan \nand such an eminently qualified nominee be nominated to the Sixth \nCircuit Court of Appeals.\n  For those who may not be familiar with her career and \naccomplishments, a few minutes will give me an opportunity to share \nthem with you. I think you will find, as I have, that Justice Larsen is \nparticularly well suited to serve as a Federal appellate judge.\n  Justice Larsen has an outstanding academic record, having received \nnumerous awards during her undergraduate and law school careers. \nJustice Larsen was a Presidential Scholar at the University of Northern \nIowa and graduated with the highest honors. She graduated first in her \nclass at the Northwestern University Pritzker School of Law, where she \nwon the Justice John Paul Stevens Award for Academic Excellence and \nserved as editor of the Northwestern University Law Review.\n  She began her legal career as a clerk for Judge Sentelle on the DC \nCircuit Court of Appeals and then clerked for Justice Scalia on the \nU.S. Supreme Court. Following her clerkships, Justice Larsen joined the \nDC firm of Sidley Austin, one of the largest law firms in the United \nStates. Justice Larsen spent 2 years as Deputy Assistant Attorney \nGeneral for the Office of Legal Counsel, where she provided legal \nadvice to the President and executive agencies on difficult issues of \nconstitutional and statutory interpretation.\n  Justice Larsen has taught constitutional law and criminal law at the \nUniversity of Michigan Law School since 1998, where she has earned the \nrespect of faculty members and students alike. She won the L. Hart \nWright Award for Excellence in Teaching early in her teaching career. \nIn addition to her teaching responsibilities, Justice Larsen ran \nMichigan's clerkship program, helping hundreds of students and alumni \npursue clerkships at the Federal and State levels. As an adjunct \nprofessor, she continues to run the law school's Moot Court Program.\n  Her colleagues at the University of Michigan praised Justice Larsen \nand wrote:\n\n       Even among the talented and ambitious lawyers at an elite \n     law school, Joan stands out for her ability to make the \n     penetrating insight that untangles some knotty problem of \n     statutory interpretation or judiciary doctrine. Especially \n     distinctive, moreover, is the rigor and even-handedness she \n     brings to her analysis.\n\n  I will share one more example from that letter because I think it \naddresses some of my colleagues' concerns, who are on the other side of \nthe aisle, as to her approach to the law.\n  Her colleagues wrote:\n\n       For those of us who have found ourselves on the opposite \n     side of a debate with Joan about a case, a statute, or some \n     broader issue of constitutional history, she has demonstrated \n     time and again that she is both a gracious and intellectually \n     honest partner in the collaborative project of figuring \n     things out. What matters for Joan is not winning but working \n     out the right answer.\n\n  Now I bring emphasis to this last sentence.\n\n       Even when you disagree with her, it is impossible not to \n     respect her and to take pleasure in the process of refining \n     the issues actually in dispute.\n\n  In other words, as I see it, Justice Larsen is and will be a jurist \nwho seeks to find the right answer, never simply one she prefers as a \nmatter of policy.\n  We can already see from her time on the Michigan Supreme Court that \nJustice Larsen is a principled jurist with an impressive legal acumen. \nShe has served with distinction on that court since she was appointed \nin 2015. It happens that she was elected to the position in 2016, in \nher own right, by a resounding majority, winning every county in \nMichigan. Colleagues on the court have praised her sharp legal \nanalysis, her clear and crisp writing, and, most importantly, her work \nethic.\n  Outside the courtroom, Justice Larsen is actively involved in \nvolunteer efforts to serve disadvantaged children, and she works with \nMichigan's veterans, drugs, sobriety, and mental health court programs.\n  Some of my colleagues have said they will not support the nomination\n\n\nbecause Justice Larsen was included on President Trump's short list for \nthe Supreme Court. Is there anything wrong with the President \nsuggesting whom he is going to put on the Supreme Court if he is \nelected President? If you look at her background, it should be no \nsurprise that she was included on that list. She is an accomplished \nlegal academic, a mainstream jurist, and is well respected on a \nbipartisan basis throughout the legal community.\n  Because my colleagues have been concerned about everyone on that \nlist, at her hearing, I asked Justice Larsen when she learned that her \nname was on that list. She replied: ``The date it was announced . . . \nit was a complete surprise to me.''\n  I also asked her about judicial independence and whether she could \nrule against the President who nominated her.\n  She replied:\n\n       I would have no trouble ruling against the President who \n     appointed me or any successor President as well. Judicial \n     independence means one thing, one very simple thing--\n\n  At this point I want to emphasize--\n\n     and that is putting the law above everything else, the \n     statutes passed by this body, and the Constitution of the \n     United States. So I would have absolutely no trouble, and, \n     indeed, that would be my duty.\n\n  Here is the most outrageous reason I have heard for voting against \nJustice Larsen. This should surprise a lot of people. Some in the \nminority have suggested that she is somehow responsible for outside \ngroups running ads that support her nomination in Michigan. The claim \nthat she is responsible for the action of an outside group is \nridiculous, and the allegation that these ads are in some way a \nguarantee of how she will rule in the future is the most absurd thing I \nhave heard based upon her answers to my questions.\n  I find it interesting that my colleagues who are complaining about \nconservative groups do not seem to have the same concern for groups on \nthe left that are spending money in opposition to these nominees. One \nsuch group, Alliance for Justice, routinely issues reports and press \nreleases on judicial nominees. Oftentimes, these so-called reports put \nforward incendiary and false criticisms of these nominees. My \ncolleagues even make the same incendiary attacks against the nominees \nas these outside groups do. In other words, they use the same talking \npoints. I do not hear that my colleagues on the other side are up in \narms about their spending millions of dollars to oppose nominees.\n  Of course, some may remember that last year groups on the left \ncoordinated attacks on this Senator. I was followed all over Iowa by \nthese groups and their members. They ran ads against me and put up \nbillboards that opposed my election, and that had something to do with \nthe Supreme Court, as one might recall. I don't remember hearing any of \nmy colleagues on the other side of the aisle complain about all of the \nmoney those groups were spending at that time.\n  As I have said before, I expect that outside groups on the left and \non the right want to have their voices heard in the nomination process. \nIsn't that something to do with what we call democracy, representative \ngovernment, freedom of speech, freedom of association? There is nothing \nwrong with that, whether it is done by the right or the left, but I \ntake issue with complaints from the other side that do not acknowledge \nthat all sides have interest groups that are spending and engaging in \nthe judicial nomination process. It was completely appropriate for \nJustice Larsen not to wade in on the political debate regarding those \npolitical ads. Her answers to those questions were exactly what I would \nexpect an independent nominee to say, particularly if she wants to be \nindependent of any President who appoints her when she is appointed to \nthe bench.\n  Justice Larsen's nomination is supported by a broad and diverse \ncoalition of lawyers, judges, and academic colleagues. It is easy to \nsee why, for she is an accomplished and well-respected academic. She is \na brilliant and independent jurist. Her careful and well-reasoned legal \nanalysis puts her squarely within the mainstream of legal thought.
