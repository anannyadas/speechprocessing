Jennie \njust completed her fifth season at the helm of the women's basketball \nteam for the Drake Bulldogs, where not only she, but a number of her \nplayers, has won numerous awards and recognitions. Off the court, she \nleads her team in giving back to the community, reaching their annual \n1,000 hour goal of community service for four straight years. \nOrganizations throughout the Des Moines area, and the people they \nserve, have benefited from the team's generous efforts.\n  Mr. Speaker, I am honored to represent community leaders like Jennie \nin the United States Congress and it is with great pride that I \nrecognize her today. I ask that my colleagues in the United States \nHouse of Representatives join me in congratulating Jennie for this \noutstanding recognition and in wishing her nothing but continued \nsuccess.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. YOUNG of Iowa", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 3}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "177", "extension": true, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "E1484", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "1", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "TRIBUTE TO JENNIE BARANCZYK", "id": "CREC-2017-11-01-pt1-PgE1484-3", "title": "TRIBUTE TO JENNIE BARANCZYK"}
