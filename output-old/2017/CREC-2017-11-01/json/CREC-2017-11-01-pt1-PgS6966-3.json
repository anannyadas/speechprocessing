Mr. President, today I wish to recognize White Lick \nElementary School of Brownsburg, IN, for being named a 2017 National \nBlue Ribbon School by the U.S. Department of Education.\n  Established in 1982, the National Blue Ribbon Schools Program \nrecognizes schools that have demonstrated a vision of educational \nexcellence for all students, regardless of their social or economic \nbackground. Since its inception, this program has allowed schools in \nevery State to gain recognition for educational accomplishments, \nparticularly in closing the achievement gaps among students.\n  White Lick Elementary School currently serves over 600 students and \noffers a variety of education and extracurricular opportunities for its \nstudents.\n  White Lick Elementary School has been effective in tailoring its \ncurriculum to the educational needs of each individual student. As part \nof its commitment to students, the school provides programs like \nLearning Lab, which offers students struggling academically extra \nsupport in reading and math in a small-group setting every day for 30 \nminutes.\n  The school also prides itself on the professional development of its \nstaff. Teachers are given the chance to learn and grow through weekly \nmeetings with their professional learning communities. In these \nmeetings, teachers come together to analyze test scores and other data \nas they discuss how to better meet the needs of their students.\n  The school's investment in students is reflected in the diverse \nopportunities it offers. Whether it is through the ``Step-a-thon,'' \nwhere students participate in a physical challenge to help raise funds \nfor various school programs or the numerous afterschool clubs, White \nLick has excelled in offering resources and programs beyond the \nclassroom.\n  I am proud to recognize White Lick Elementary School principal Susan \nWise, the entire staff, the student body, the parents, and the entire \nBrownsburg community. The effort, dedication, and value you put into \neducation has led not only to this prestigious recognition but will \nbenefit your students and Indiana well into the future.\n  On behalf of the citizens of Indiana, I congratulate White Lick \nElementary School, and I wish the students and staff continued success \nin the future.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. DONNELLY", "itemno": 0}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 1}], "header": {"chamber": "Senate", "num": "177", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "S6966", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "1", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "RECOGNIZING WHITE LICK ELEMENTARY SCHOOL", "id": "CREC-2017-11-01-pt1-PgS6966-3", "title": "RECOGNIZING WHITE LICK ELEMENTARY SCHOOL"}
