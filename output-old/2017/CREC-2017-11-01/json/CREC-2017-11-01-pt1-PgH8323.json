Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 3279, the Helium \nExtraction Act of 2017. This straightforward piece of legislation will \nincentivize helium production on Federal lands, help ensure the future \nof America's helium supply, and provide a fair return to the taxpayer.\n  Under existing law, the Mineral Leasing Act only permits helium \nextraction as a by-product of an existing oil or natural gas lease. As \na result, if oil and gas production on a Federal site is not \neconomically viable, the lease will expire, regardless of the revenue \nbrought in by helium sales. The Helium Extraction Act of 2017 would \ncorrect this error and authorize helium production activities where \neconomically viable.\n  Helium is used for much more than balloons. It is a rare and unique \nelement which has become an indispensable part of our medical, space, \nand defense industries, such as its use in MRI machines, \nsemiconductors, and air-to-air missile guidance systems.\n  Unfortunately, the future of our domestic helium supply is uncertain. \nThe Helium Stewardship Act of 2013, which details a commonsense \nprivatization process of the Federal helium reserve, also specifies \nthat all helium in the Federal reserve must be auctioned off by \nSeptember 30, 2021, and the facility closed.\n  This crucial source of helium has been relied upon for almost half a \ncentury, but in a few short years, it will no longer be available. Our \ncountry needs another way to access this critical natural resource; \notherwise, we will be relying on hostile interests such as Qatar, \nAlgeria, and Russia. Each of these countries presents security and \ngeopolitical challenges made even more apparent by recent unrest among \nQatar and its regional neighbors.\n  Unless something changes, foreign facilities are predicted to become \nour chief source of helium by the end of the decade. This is why H.R. \n3279 is such a necessary piece of legislation.\n  By authorizing the Bureau of Land Management to lease land for this \nvaluable nonrenewable resource, this legislation will raise $9 million \nfor the American taxpayer and help secure our supply of helium for \nyears to come.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of this measure, and I reserve the \nbalance of my time.", "turn": 4, "speaker": "Mr. COOK", "itemno": 11}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "T000474", "text": "  Mrs. TORRES. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  H.R. 3279 would correct a problem in our Federal oil and gas leasing \nlaws that makes it more difficult for companies to commercially produce \nhelium from Federal lands. Helium is a critical element for high-tech \nresearch and modern medicine, and because of its unique properties, \nthere are simply no substitutes.\n  On the Natural Resources Committee, we have spent many years \noverseeing the Federal Helium Program, culminating in the bipartisan \nHelium Stewardship Act signed into law 4 years ago.\n  While the Helium Stewardship Act improved the management and sale of \nFederal helium, it didn't do much to promote the development of new \nsources of helium, which are in high demand. By allowing companies to \nhold onto Federal oil and gas leases if they are producing commercial \nquantities of helium and only helium, then the problem that kept \npotentially valuable helium resources under lock and key is resolved. \nThis is only one small step, but it is a very useful one.\n  Mr. Speaker, I thank the sponsor of this legislation for introducing \nit.\n  I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 3279, and I yield back the \nbalance of my time.", "turn": 5, "speaker": "Mrs. TORRES", "itemno": 12}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "C001094", "text": "  Mr. COOK.
