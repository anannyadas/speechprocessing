Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Dr. Cherif \nSadki, principal of Gar-Field Senior High School, as the 2017 \nOutstanding High School Principal of Virginia.\n   Each year, the Virginia Association of Secondary School Principals, \nwhich is the seventh largest school administrators' organization in the \nNational Association of Secondary School Principals, selects a \nprincipal to represent the state as the nominee for the National \nPrincipal of the Year Program.\n   As the 2017 nominee, Dr. Sadki is commended for his ``creativity and \nimagination in bringing about positive change, improving the \neducational program and student achievement; ensuring a school climate \nthat reflects high staff and student morale; and for involving the \ncommunity in the life of the school.''\n   At the helm of Gar-Field Senior High School for the past five years, \nDr. Sadki has implemented countless policy changes and program \nadjustments to address the needs of the increasingly diverse student \npopulation. Of the roughly 2,500 students enrolled in Gar-Field Senior \nHigh School last year, approximately half spoke a language other than \nEnglish at home. One to never shy away from a challenge, Dr. Sadki \nrolled up his sleeves, transformed the teaching model, and embedded \nEnglish instruction into the core curriculum to meet the needs of the \ndiverse student body.\n   For his foresight, engagement of the community, and commitment to \nensuring that all students receive a world-class education, it is my \nhonor to include in the Record, Dr. Cherif Sadki.\n   Dr. Sadki is the standard-bearer at the regional and national level \nfor educating English learners. He attributes much of his success in\n\n\nreshaping the mission of Gar-Field Senior High School to the efforts of \na supportive community, a focused group of educators, and a dedicated \nadministrative staff. Instead of seeing students who embraced a failing \nattitude, he saw children who had not been given an opportunity to \nsucceed. Dr. Sadki saw teachers who needed encouragement, training and \nsupport and a community that could be convinced that success was \npossible.\n   I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing Dr. Cherif Sadki, \nprincipal of Gar-Field Senior High School on his selection as the 2017 \nOutstanding High School Principal for Virginia. His leadership and \ndedication to the students, teachers, and faculty as he works to ensure \na bright future for all who pass through the doors of Gar-Field Senior \nHigh School is truly commendable and worthy of our highest praise.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. CONNOLLY", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 3}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "177", "extension": true, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "E1484-E1485", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "1", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "RECOGNIZING DR.
