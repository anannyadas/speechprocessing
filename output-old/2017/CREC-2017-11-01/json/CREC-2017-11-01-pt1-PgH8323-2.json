Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  There are laws on the books that stand in the way of true tribal \nself-determination and self-governance. One of those laws is Public Law \n80-846, known commonly as the 1948 Act. The 1948 Act targeted only one \ntribe, the Sac and Fox Tribe of the Mississippi in Iowa, also known as \nthe Meskwaki Nation, and gave the State of Iowa criminal jurisdiction \nover their tribal lands.\n  In 1948, the Nation did not have a formal mechanism for law \nenforcement and was not in a financial position to create one. This was \nused as the rationale for the stripping of these jurisdictional rights. \nBut this has not been the case for many years. The Tribe has a full-\ntime police department as well as a fully functioning court system.\n  The continued existence of the 1948 Act has resulted in an unfair \nsystem of crimes committed on Meskwaki land, whereby a Native-American \ndefendant must face the possibility of two prosecutions, State and \nTribal, but a non-Native defendant faces only State prosecution.\n  That is why I join my colleagues in supporting H.R. 1074. By passing \nthis bill and repealing the 1948 Act, we will remove the inequity it \nhas created, and bring the Meskwaki Nation in line with how criminal \njurisdiction issues are addressed on other Native lands.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the adoption of H.R. \n1074, and I reserve the balance of my time.", "turn": 5, "speaker": "Mrs. TORRES", "itemno": 13}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "C001094", "text": "  Mr. COOK.

Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from California for \nyielding and for his time managing today's floor debate.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 1074, a bill I first \nintroduced in the 114th Congress, which would repeal a 1948 law that \ngranted the State of Iowa criminal jurisdiction over offenses committed \nby or against members of the Sac and Fox Tribe of the Mississippi in \nIowa.\n  Prior to this 1948 law, the Tribe had largely policed itself, and \nthere was little, if any, Federal law enforcement on the Tribe's land.\n  Historically, determining who may exercise jurisdiction over crime in \ntribal communities is complex. Generally, crimes committed by or \nagainst Indians in Indian Country are under the jurisdiction of the \nUnited States, pursuant to various Federal statutes. The 1948 Act was \npassed at a time when the Federal Government was attempting to shift \nits responsibility and obligations from tribes to the respective \nStates.\n  In 1953, Congress passed a law, commonly called Public Law 280, \ntransferring criminal jurisdiction over all crimes, regardless of the \nIndian status of the offender or victim, in Indian Country of six \nStates from the Federal Government to those States. Even though Iowa \nwas not one of those States, for years it has been treated as if it \nwere a Public Law 280 State.\n\n  With respect to the law enforcement on the settlement today, a lot \nhas changed since 1948. Today, the Tribe has a fully-functional \ncriminal justice system, which includes a full-time police department \nwhose officers are certified by the State of Iowa. The Tribe maintains \nand employs law-trained judges and a prosecutor who, together with a \nprobation department, handle all criminal cases which arise on tribal \nlands.\n  H.R. 1074, and its Senate companion bill, have bipartisan support \nfrom the entire Iowa delegation, as well as the support of the Iowa \nState Legislature, which passed legislation signed by then-Governor \nTerry Branstad in April 2016, that began this process of conferring \njurisdiction to the Tribe and the Department of Justice.\n  As my friend from California previously mentioned, the entirety of \nthe Meskwaki Settlement is located in Tama County, Iowa, in my \ndistrict. Since I have come to Washington, I have gotten to know the \nSac and Fox Tribal Council and their representatives, and I was happy \nto first introduce this bill in 2016 after its approval by then-\nGovernor Branstad.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge the adoption of this bill, and I hope it \ncontinues to move through the legislative process so that the Tribe may \nonce again have jurisdiction over many of the crimes committed against \ntheir members on their land, and restore another portion of the Tribe's \nsovereignty, which has been removed since 1948.", "turn": 7, "speaker": "Mr. BLUM", "itemno": 15}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "T000474", "text": "  Mrs. TORRES.
