Mr. Speaker, if the United States is going to maintain \nthe ability to feed and clothe our own people and fuel this American \neconomy, we need a strong and sustainable rural America like the \ndistrict I represent in west Texas.\n  What would this country be without the hardworking energy and \nagriculture producers in small towns across this great land? The heart \nof small-town sustainability is access to healthcare. There are over \n5,000 hospitals in the United States, and roughly half of them are in \nrural America, serving one out of every five Americans. Without access \nto basic medical services, communities in America's breadbasket and \nenergy basin would not survive.\n  Hospitals serving rural communities face unique challenges: an aging \npopulation, low patient volume, higher percentages of Medicare \nbeneficiaries, to name a few. Each translates into a higher per-patient \ncost which has left 41 percent of rural hospitals operating at a loss.\n  On top of this problematic patient volume and patient mix, ObamaCare \nhas heaped a backbreaking $54 billion in additional regulatory burden \nin unfunded mandates. Since 2010, the year ObamaCare was enacted, 80 \nrural hospitals have shut down, 11 of which were in my home State of \nTexas. If this rate continues, in less than 10 years, an unimaginable \n25 percent of our Nation's rural hospitals will close. That would \ncripple rural communities across this country and deliver a devastating \nblow to our agriculture and energy economy, affecting all Americans, \nincluding our neighbors in urban and suburban America.\n  For some Texans, the nearest hospital is already 100 miles away. In \nan emergency, this distance can mean the difference between life and \ndeath. Point of fact: 60 percent of all trauma deaths occur in rural \nAmerica, despite the fact that rural America only makes up 20 percent \nof the country's population.\n  Here is a startling fact and outright scary scenario: one-third of \nrural hospitals have been deemed vulnerable to closure. If all 673 of \nthose hospitals were to close down, it could result in over 130,000 \njobs lost and almost $300 billion in GDP lost. When unemployment goes \ndown and wages go down in those small towns, folks move away in search \nof better opportunities.\n  In order to sustain the critical lifeline hospitals provide for our \nrural communities, I have introduced H.R. 4178, the Healthcare \nEnhancement for America's Rural Towns Act, or the HEART Act. Why? \nBecause small towns are the heartbeat of America; the heart of our \nfood, fuel, and fiber production; the heart of traditional American \nvalues. This legislation extends two programs vital to the \nsustainability of rural hospitals and the community they deserve: the \nLow-Volume Adjustment program and the Medicare-Dependent Hospital \nprogram. These programs account for less than one-tenth of 1 percent of \nall Medicare expenditures, but they go a long way to ensuring that \nrural community hospitals with a higher percentage of Medicare patients \nhave adequate funding to serve the unique populations.\n  By extending the Medicare Low-Volume Adjustment program for 2 years, \nand for the first time permanently extending the Medicare-Dependent \nHospital program, we can provide the assurance and continuity that our \nrural hospitals desperately need in order to serve our communities in \nthe future. Just as importantly, we do this in a way that is budget \nneutral and without spending any additional taxpayer moneys.\n  Let's pass this legislation. Let's protect the heart of rural America \nand give our community hospitals the certainty that they need to keep \nour people and our communities healthy.\n", "turn": 1, "speaker": "Mr. ARRINGTON", "itemno": 3}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 4}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "177", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H8304", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "1", "month": "November"}, "related_bills": [{"type": "HR", "context": "FIRSTPARAGRAPH", "congress": "115", "number": "4178"}, {"type": "HR", "context": "OTHER", "congress": "115", "number": "4178"}], "doc_title": "PROTECT RURAL AMERICA HOSPITALS", "id": "CREC-2017-11-01-pt1-PgH8304"}
