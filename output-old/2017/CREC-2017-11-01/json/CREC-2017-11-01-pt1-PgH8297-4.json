Mr. Speaker, last week, I congratulated \nSt. Marys Area High School student Michelle Bauer on winning first \nplace in the 34th annual Pennsylvania Municipal League high school \nessay contest.\n  Participants were asked to reflect on the theme ``Civics and You'' by \nwriting about opportunities in their community that allow for civic \nengagement and encourage citizens to volunteer to help with local \nchallenges.\n  Today, I would like to share a portion of Michelle's essay:\n  ``When I hear the word `civic,' I think of governmental duties. I \nunderstand my duty as an American citizen to vote, obey laws, pay \ntaxes, and serve on juries. These activities all involve one person: \nyourself. In reality, our civic engagement as Americans expands beyond \na single individual and encompasses entire communities. The definition \nof a civic engagement is an activity that includes both paid and unpaid \nforms of political activism, environmentalism, and service. As I look \nat my community, it is apparent that we have a lot of civic \nengagements.\n  ``As with most towns, mine has a city council that holds meetings and \nelections for positions on the council. These elections are open to \nevery member of the city and are an excellent way for citizens to have \na say in the politics of the town. Just as the elections are open to \nall citizens so are the weekly meetings. A unique feature about my \ntown's council meetings is that they are televised on a local channel. \nFor individuals who are unable to physically be present at the meeting \nor have commitments that require attention, this televised version \nprovides a perfect solution to keep abreast of the issues affecting our \ncitizens.\n  ``Along with a local city council, it is also a civic duty of \nindividuals in my community to vote and participate in elections and \nmeetings at the school district level. Anyone is able to run for a \nposition on the school board as well as attend the meetings. For me, \nour school board is a great way of civic involvement because the board \nis interested in new opportunities that can be incorporated into the \neducation of our youth. Just recently, I attended a board meeting where \nthe topic of robots was discussed. As a member of a small competition \ngroup, we were able to present our success and the benefit of \ncurriculum that includes new technology. One month later, it was \nannounced that a robotics class will be offered in the upcoming school \nyear. This will allow even more students to enhance their education and \nperhaps encourage new career choices.\n  ``In my community, the civic engagements do not stop on the political \nlevel. One of the most prominent forms of civic engagement I see in my \ncommunity that is not related to politics is the placing of wreaths on \nthe gravestones of fallen soldiers for Memorial Day. Citizens from all \nover town come together the weekend before Memorial Day and walk \nthrough the entire cemetery adorning and honoring the heroes of our \ncountry. This event is not for publicity or money but instead is for \nrespecting our veterans. Additionally, it is for the betterment of our \ncommunity by presenting a beautiful scene to those passing by.''\n  Michelle goes on to write:\n  ``Onlookers can also be mesmerized by the beauty of the mountainous \nrural area. Unfortunately, garbage and litter on the side of roads and \nhighways is so commonplace that most individuals do not even do a \ndouble-take when they see it. The highway through my town is an area \nwhere individuals think it is acceptable to throw garbage out of their \nvehicles or litter the sides of the road with cigarette butts and \nwrappers. For the past 7 years, I have been a part of the National \nHonor Society highway cleanup. Every spring and fall, the society walks \nthe sides of the roads picking up trash and making our town look \nbeautiful.''\n  Mr. Speaker, this is just a portion of Michelle's essay, and I \ninclude in the Record the full essay.\n\n\n\n\n  34th Annual Pennsylvania Municipal League High School Essay Contest \n                                 Winner\n\n\n1st Place High School Essay Winner: Michelle Bauer--St. Marys Area High \n                                 School\n\n       When I hear the word civic, I think of governmental duties. \n     I understand my duty as an American citizen to vote, obey \n     laws, pay taxes, and serve on juries.

One of the most prominent forms of civic \n     engagement I see in my community that is not related to \n     politics is the placing of wreaths on the gravestones of \n     fallen soldiers for Memorial Day. Citizens from all over town \n     come together the weekend before Memorial Day and walk \n     through the entire cemetery adorning and honoring the heroes \n     of our country. This event is not for publicity or money but \n     instead is for respecting our veterans. Additionally, it is \n     for the betterment of our community by presenting a beautiful \n     scene to those passing by.\n       Onlookers can also be mesmerized by the beauty of the \n     mountainous rural area.

For the past seven years, I have been a part of the \n     National Honor Society highway cleanup. Every spring and \n     fall, the society walks the sides of the roads picking up \n     trash and making our town look beautiful.\n       Volunteering to pick up the litter is not the only way to \n     carry out civic responsibility. Everybody has either \n     witnessed or directly experienced an accident or fire that \n     required the assistance of a fire department. The fire \n     department is a critical part of a city keeping fires at bay \n     and lending a hand wherever needed. In my community, these \n     people work tirelessly day in and day out for the good of the \n     community. Much of their assistance is not what would be \n     depicted as heroic but rather, responding to flooding issues, \n     weather related emergencies, traffic control, helicopter \n     landing zones, and searching for missing hunters in addition \n     to the rescue and fire calls. They are all volunteers that \n     give up their precious time as a civic duty to their \n     community without expecting recognition. We, the rest of the \n     community, have a duty to help support these people. One of \n     the best ways to do this is to attend their pancake \n     breakfasts that are used as a fundraiser. I am not a huge fan \n     of pancakes and sausage so instead of helping the \n     firefighters out by purchasing a meal, I volunteer to serve \n     the meals to customers. It is the civic duty of individuals \n     in my city to attend this pancake breakfast and show support \n     to the members of this department who tirelessly serve and \n     assist us.\n       Reporting for standby at a yearly event in July is another \n     aspect of service that our firefighters join their community \n     for. There are loud BOOMS echoing across the city and \n     suddenly bright orbs of colorful lights bursting in the sky. \n     This grand spectacle entrances onlookers for half an hour \n     with its bright lights and fun designs. A Fourth of July \n     fireworks display like this costs money. Every year, our city \n     struggles to come up with the funds needed to purchase \n     fireworks. Businesses around the town make it their civic \n     duty to help by setting out donation cans in their \n     businesses. The local Dairy Queen even has a day where 30% of \n     the profits from every blizzard purchased go to the city \n     fireworks fund. As citizens in the community, it is our duty \n     to go to Dairy Queen on this day and purchase a blizzard as \n     well as make donations in the cans set up at local \n     businesses. Eating ice cream is certainly an enjoyable way to \n     carry out a civic duty. The July show has been an important \n     part of our community for many years thanks to the numerous \n     supporters.\n       We have many such events traced back in our records. Local \n     history is like the heart of the human body. It shapes us, \n     powers our being, and makes us unique. Without history, \n     individuals would not even be alive. A great example would be \n     the Forty-Second Pennsylvania Volunteer Regiment (Bucktails) \n     who were part of the Civil War. These rugged woodsmen were \n     skilled marksmen and ideally suited to the challenges of \n     battle. Stories say that this group was so influential in \n     fighting the war at Gettysburg that the entire outcome could \n     have been different without them. The grit and determination \n     of our local ancestors remains in current day lineage within \n     our community. By knowing local history, members of the \n     community have a sense of pride and can even feel at ease \n     understanding that future generations will uphold the same \n     virtues. My town has a Historical Society that is free to \n     enter and accepts donations of local artifacts and history. \n     As a member of the community, it is my civic engagement to \n     donate any pieces of history I have so that others may \n     benefit from it as well. It is also the duty of our community \n     to visit the Historical Society and learn about our heritage \n     and how we can use the skills of our people to better our \n     society just like the Bucktails did in the Civil War.\n       Civic engagements are abundant in our community. From the \n     local fireman's pancake breakfast to the city council \n     meetings, civic activities are occurring all around us. It is \n     the obligation of the citizens to engage in these activities \n     to assist with local challenges and create a better community \n     for all of its members.\n", "turn": 1, "speaker": "Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "T000467", "text": "  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania.
