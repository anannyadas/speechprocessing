CONNOLLY\n\n                              of virginia\n\n                    in the house of representatives\n\n                      Wednesday, November 1, 2017\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "C001078", "text": "  Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize Fairfax Water on the \noccasion of its 60th anniversary. There are few human needs more \nprecious and more critical than access to fresh and safe drinking \nwater. Indeed, we have seen what can happen when those needs are \nneglected, as the tragedy in Flint, Michigan reminds us. Prior to the \ncreation of the Fairfax County Water Authority (now known as Fairfax \nWater), water was supplied to Fairfax County through many small, mostly \nprivate water systems, and a limited number of public systems. There \nwas no standardization between systems and each system maintained its \nown rate schedule and level of service. In order to improve service \nreliability, establish equitable rates, and provide effective fire \nprotection throughout Fairfax County, the Board of Supervisors created \nFairfax Water in September 1957 for the purpose of ``acquiring, \nconstructing, operating and maintaining an integrated water system for \nsupplying and distributing water.''\n   The acquisition of water systems began in 1959 with the purchase of \nthe Annandale Water Company. Over the next eight years, Fairfax Water \nacquired an additional 17 systems and began to build a comprehensive \nwater-supply system. By the end of 1967, Fairfax Water had 832 miles of \nmains, 3,354 fire hydrants, and 54,000 metered accounts serving more \nthan 425,000 people. By 1982, that number had grown to more than 1,800 \nmiles of mains, more than 10,300 fire hydrants and nearly 126,000 \nmetered accounts serving more than 650,000 people. By 1994, it would \nreach more than 2,700 miles of water mains, more than 17,300 fire \nhydrants and more than 197,300 meters.\n   Those numbers show a county undergoing tremendous growth in both \npopulation and urbanization. The challenges associated with that are \nnumerous and the temptation of providing service while overlooking the \nquality of that service is real. However, Fairfax Water has never \nallowed itself to fall into that trap. Instead, it has approached every \nnew challenge with its mission in mind: providing safe, clean drinking \nwater to Fairfax County residents and ensuring that the County's water \nsupply is maintained. There have certainly been no shortage of \nchallenges--from supply issues stemming from the use of a single source \n(the Occoquan River) to natural disasters to the threat of terrorism, \nFairfax Water has risen to meet those challenges. Its work stands as \ntestament to the strength and character of the ethos of public service \nin our community.\n   Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating \nPhillip Allin, Charles Murray, the members of the Board of Directors \nand the entire staff of Fairfax Water. I thank them for their service \nto our community and for maintaining the proud legacy of this \norganization while adapting it to meet the challenges of the future.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. CONNOLLY", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 3}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "177", "extension": true, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "E1483", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "1", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "RECOGNIZING THE 60TH ANNIVERSARY OF FAIRFAX WATER", "id": "CREC-2017-11-01-pt1-PgE1483", "title": "RECOGNIZING THE 60TH ANNIVERSARY OF FAIRFAX WATER"}
