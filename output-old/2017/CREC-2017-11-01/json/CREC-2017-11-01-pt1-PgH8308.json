Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor \nHershel ``Woody'' Williams and commemorate a naval vessel, which was \nchristened in his honor on Saturday, October 21, in San Diego, \nCalifornia. The ship will provide for accommodations for up to 250 \npersonnel, will offer a 52,000-square-foot flight deck, and will \nsupport helicopters and tilt-rotor aircraft.\n  Woody Williams grew up on a dairy farm in Fairmont, West Virginia, \nand enlisted in the United States Marine Corps Reserve in Charleston, \nWest Virginia, on May 26, 1943.\n  Woody landed in Iwo Jima on February 21, 1945. Woody fought through \nthe remainder of the 5-week-long battle and was wounded on March 6, for \nwhich he was awarded the Purple Heart.\n  As a result of Woody Williams' courageous service in the 21st \nMarines, 3rd Marine Division in the Battle of Iwo Jima, he received the \nCongressional Medal of Honor from President Truman. Today, at 93 years \nold, he is the last living Medal of Honor recipient from that battle.\n  I join all West Virginians in congratulating Woody Williams for this \nincredible honor. He is an unparalleled advocate for veterans from all \neras and a fine example of what it means not only to be a West \nVirginian but an American.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. MOONEY of West Virginia", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "177", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H8308", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "1", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "HONORING HERSHEL ``WOODY'' WILLIAMS", "id": "CREC-2017-11-01-pt1-PgH8308", "title": "HONORING HERSHEL ``WOODY'' WILLIAMS"}
