{"content": [{"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "M000355", "text": "  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, today I wish to congratulate Brig. Gen. \nSteven P. Bullard of the Kentucky Air National Guard as he begins his \nretirement after more than three decades of achievement, service, and \nsacrifice. This Nation and the Commonwealth of Kentucky thank him for \nhis diligence in defending our safety and security.\n  Brigadier General Bullard has served as the chief of staff, \nHeadquarters, for the Kentucky Air National Guard and the deputy chief \nof the Joint Staff, Joint Force Headquarters-Kentucky National Guard \nsince 2012. In these roles, he has been responsible for the guidance \nand direction of more than 8,500 Army and Air Guardsman in my home \nState. Brigadier General Bullard has skillfully carried out his \nresponsibilities in these positions, as well as the duties of his \ncivilian role as director of the division of administrative services \nwithin the Kentucky Department of Military Affairs.\n  On numerous projects, he was the critical link between my office and \nthe Kentucky Guard. I know that many on my staff who have had the \nprivilege of interacting with him have appreciated Brigadier General \nBullard's dependability and talent, which I am told also extends to the \ngolf course.\n  Entering officer training school at Lackland Air Force Base in 1985, \nBrigadier General Bullard took the first steps of his decorated \nmilitary career. He later achieved the rating of master navigator, \nhaving completed more than 5,500 flight hours on various aircraft. Over \nthe years, Brigadier General Bullard flew missions in 75 countries, \nincluding a deployment to Afghanistan during Operation Enduring \nFreedom. One might think that, with such aviation skill, he would have \nmore luck traveling as a passenger on commercial air, but his \ncolleagues report that throughout his career, a number of commercial \nflights he has traveled on have experienced weather or maintenance \ndelays resulting in numerous nights in the airport for the trained \nairman.\n  Brigadier General Bullard has earned and been awarded numerous \nmilitary awards and decorations for his selfless service to the \nCommonwealth and his Nation. These honors include the Bronze Star \nMedal, the Meritorious Service Medal with two bronze oakleaf clusters, \nthe Air Medal with one bronze oakleaf cluster, and the Kentucky \nDistinguished Service Medal. These awards are recognition of Brigadier \nGeneral Bullard's distinguished actions on behalf of our Nation and \nKentucky.\n  The men and women of Kentucky's National Guard serve a unique mission \nin our Armed Forces. Their efforts to help fight our Nation's wars, \ndefend our homeland, provide relief from natural disasters, and \nmaintain critical State, Federal, and international partnerships in \nsupport of our Nation's safety and security have demonstrated the vital \nnature of the National Guard's service. I am proud to represent them in \nthe U.S. Senate, and I am grateful for their sacrifice on behalf of our \nCommonwealth and our Nation.\n  As we celebrate Brigadier General Bullard's retirement, we are also \nsaddened to lose such a capable and dedicated public servant. In \naddition to his responsibilities at headquarters, Brigadier General \nBullard has also worked as the chairman of the Louisville Armed Forces \nCommittee, two terms as the president of the National Guard Association \nof Kentucky, and as the volunteer executive director of the Kentucky \nCommittee for Employer Support of the Guard and Reserve. On behalf of \nthe people of Kentucky, I would like to thank him for his 32 years of \nachievement and service. He has earned a relaxing retirement, spending \ntime with his family and friends. Finally, I would ask my colleagues in \nthe Senate to join me in paying tribute to Brigadier General Bullard, a \nbrave American, a selfless public servant, and a proud Kentuckian.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. McCONNELL", "itemno": 0}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 1}], "header": {"chamber": "Senate", "num": "177", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "S6964", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "1", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "TRIBUTE TO BRIGADIER GENERAL STEVEN P.
