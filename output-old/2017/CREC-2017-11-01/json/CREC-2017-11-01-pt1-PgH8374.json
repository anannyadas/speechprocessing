Mr. Speaker, I rise today as a member of the Climate \nSolutions Caucus to speak on the issue of climate change. The caucus is \na bipartisan group of members committed to implementing economically \nviable options to reduce climate risk.\n  The caucus has a ``Noah's Ark'' membership rule. Members can only \njoin in pairs, one from each party. Under the leadership of co-chairs \nMr. Curbelo and Mr. Deutch, the caucus is helping to break the partisan \ngridlock on this issue and show that promoting climate solutions can be \ntruly bipartisan.\n  The formation and rapid growth of the Climate Solutions Caucus \nrepresents a recognition of both the challenges and opportunities and \nhas demonstrated that there is bipartisan will to take action.\n  In recognition of the fact that 60 Members of Congress have come \ntogether to fight climate change in a bipartisan fashion, I organized \nthis time for my colleagues to join me on the floor to let the American \npeople know what we, as their elected leaders, are doing to address \nclimate change.\n  We know, from scientific evidence, that our climate is changing. The \nglobal average temperature has increased by about 1.4 degrees \nFahrenheit over the last 100 years. Sea levels are rising, the ocean is \nbecoming more acidic, precipitation patterns are changing, and heat \nwaves are becoming more frequent and longer in duration.\n  Each of these changes produces a cascade of effects that impact our \nlives and livelihoods, including flooding, changes in crop yields, \npower shortages, declines in fisheries, and increases in cardiovascular \ndisease.\n  Recent events in our own country, such as devastating hurricanes in \nthe Southeast and wildfires in the West have brought this issue to the \nforefront of everyone's minds. Now climate\n\n\nchange can't be directly blamed for all these problems, but the \nevidence strongly suggests that it contributes to each of them, and \nthere are things that we can do to limit its effects.\n  Climate change also has a significant impact on public health. A \ngroundbreaking study published just this week in a medical journal, The \nLancet, unequivocally showed that climate change is a serious public \nhealth threat. The study involved 24 institutions from around the world \nand included staggering statistics, such as the fact that air pollution \ncaused 1.9 million premature deaths in Asia in 2015, and that the range \nof common disease-transmitting mosquitoes increased 9.5 percent since \n1950.\n  We know that high temperatures exasperate health problems and that \nburning fossil fuels creates pollution that causes cardiovascular \ndisease. The National Academies estimate that air pollution causes \naround $120 billion per year in health-related damages, including \nhealthcare costs, missed days of work and school, and premature death.\n  We also know that changing climate has altered the range, in some \ncases accelerated the spread of vector-borne diseases likes Zika and \nthe West Nile virus. Responsibly transitioning to a clean energy \neconomy will not only reduce the greenhouse gas emissions that \ncontribute to climate change, but it will also reduce air pollution and \nhelp all Americans breathe easier.\n  What I want to talk about for a few minutes, before I turn to some of \nmy colleagues, is a very common misperception about the relationship \nbetween implementing climate solutions and growing jobs.\n  Some people think that this is a zero-sum game. That is, they think \nif you have more of one, you get less of the other. But that is simply \nnot true.\n  Implementing climate solutions can grow jobs, especially new high-\npaying jobs. The U.S. needs to take advantage of these economic \nopportunities. Regardless of what we do here in the U.S., the rest of \nthe world has committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions and \nreaching the targets laid out in the Paris Agreement, as have many \ncities, States, and companies here at home.\n  To achieve that goal, significant technological development and \ninnovation will be needed, as well as infrastructure, markets, and \ndistribution channels to get that technology to the people and places \nthat need it.\n  The national economies that produce this clean energy technology will \nbenefit greatly. The U.S. still leads the world in technology and \ninnovation. Countries around the world try to recreate the innovation \nethos that exists in Silicon Valley and in other places across our \nNation.\n  The United States also has the workers who are needed to build these \ninnovations. So we have what it takes, and if we seize the opportunity \nto invest in clean and climate-resilient technologies, then our economy \nand the American people will benefit as the world adapts to climate \nchange and America grows good-paying jobs all across our Nation.\n  But if we let this opportunity pass us by, then profits and jobs will \ninstead flow to foreign countries that develop the technologies the \nworld needs, and American cities and States will be forced to buy \nforeign products as they upgrade to climate-resilient infrastructure.\n\n\n  That is why I will soon be introducing a bill called Challenges and \nPrizes for Climate Act. This bill will establish five or more prize \nchallenges overseen by the Department of Energy to harness the \ningenuity of the research community in the private sector to solve big, \ncomplex climate problems.\n  Challenges have been used in the past by a wide range of \norganizations, including the XPRIZE, who used the challenge to jump-\nstart the commercial space transportation industry. This industry is \nnow flourishing.\n  I was just recently at SpaceX in California and saw their impressive \nmanufacturing facility they have there. The U.S. is now relying on \nSpaceX in order to bring supplies up to the International Space Station \nand their plans to soon be flying astronauts. This commercial space \ntransportation industry began with those who reached to try to meet \nthis challenge and get the XPRIZE.\n  The Federal Trade Commission also used the prize challenge to help \nbring a robocall blocking service to the market, something that we can \nall very much appreciate. That is why I am going this direction.\n  My bill will create challenges that fall under five themes: carbon \ncapture and reuse, energy efficiency, energy storage, climate \nadaptation and resiliency, and data analytics for better climate \npredictions.\n  Using authority from the America COMPETES Act, the Department of \nEnergy will convene working groups from across agencies, universities, \nnonprofits and the private sector to help plan the challenges, and even \nto contribute to the prizes.\n  The goal of the challenge is not just to reward the winner of the \nbest solution, but also to bring visibility to the range of innovations \ncompeting for the prize and to help society envision the future. This \nbill will help us see what our clean energy future will look like, and \nI urge all of my colleagues to support it.\n  Mr. Speaker, I want to begin hearing from the bipartisan group of \nclimate leaders who have joined me here on the floor this evening.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. \nFitzpatrick), my Republican colleague.", "turn": 3, "speaker": "Mr. LIPINSKI", "itemno": 4}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "F000466", "text": "  Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague, Mr. Lipinski, for \nhis leadership on this issue.\n  Mr. Speaker, serving as good stewards of our environment is something \nthat each and every one of us are called to do no matter who we are or \nwhere we come from.\n  It is critical in order to preserve public health. The reality is \nclimate change is real and humans are a contributing factor. Congress \nmust take serious and reasonable steps to combat it.\n  As an Eagle Scout and a conservationist who grew up in Bucks County, \nPennsylvania, I have always been captivated by the natural beauty of \nour open spaces and wild places. We have it all in Bucks County: \npreserved farmland, amazing parks, expansive forests, and historic \nrivers. I believe that with these natural treasures comes a special \nresponsibility to care for and protect our natural resources at the \nlocal, State, and Federal level.\n  Climate change and the irresponsible management of our resources put \na strain on the health of our communities and our children. Clean air \nand clean water are essential to the health, safety, and well-being of \nthe next generation of Americans.\n  Mr. Speaker, protecting our Nation's open spaces unites us as \nAmericans. That is why I joined 16 other House Republicans on House \nResolution 195 to encourage American innovation to improve \nenvironmental policy and to protect, conserve, and be good stewards of \nour environment.\n  I introduced the Udall-Eisenhower Arctic Wilderness Act, H.R. 1889, \nwith Congressman Jared Huffman from California. This bill designates \nthe 1.5 million-acre land of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge as a \ncomponent of the National Wilderness Preservation System to protect it \nfrom damaging activities like oil and gas drilling.\n  I have voted to protect the methane rule for stream protections.\n  The Climate Solutions Caucus will continue to be the group that shows \nWashington how to forego the political gamesmanship and get to work on \nways we can improve our environment, address the realities of climate \nchange, and increase innovation with an eye towards sustainability.\n  Protecting our environment cannot be partisan, Mr. Speaker.

Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Lipinski for his leadership on \nthis.\n  Mr. Speaker, I want to talk a little bit about climate. We know that \nclimate is changing, and we have seen it.\n\n\nIn California, we had horrific wildfires that claimed 40 lives and \ndestroyed thousands of structures. We have seen hurricanes more \nfrequently, more devastating, and more powerful than ever before. So \nthe effects are there. We see it happening.\n  Now, the thing that we are faced with is that there is a significant \nsection of people that deny climate change. You can sort of see why \nthey are denying it. I mean, if something is in your interest, you are \ngoing to be able to talk yourself into just about anything.\n  The big benefit of denying climate change is that we can continue to \nuse fossil fuels. If you are a company that uses fossil fuels or \nproduces fossil fuels, yeah, this is what you want. But there are costs \nof denial, and the costs of denial are clear.\n  We are seeing weather. We just talked about that. We are seeing \nhealth effects. We have seen that both in terms of elevated \ntemperatures, causing people to have heat problems. We are seeing \ndisease vectors moving to the temperate zones from the Equator. We are \nalso going to see significant infrastructure costs, like we see in \nPuerto Rico now. These are real costs that we are going to pay for the \ndenial of climate change.\n\n  Now, what are the benefits of climate change?\n  Well, there are significant benefits, from my point of view.\n  First of all, we have been spending American taxpayer dollars to \ndevelop technology to fight climate change, or to reduce carbon \nemissions.\n  I will tell you a little story about my own career. I was working at \na company called U.S. Wind Power. With some amount of taxpayer dollars, \nwe developed the leading technology for wind energy. Of course, what \nhappened was that the funding stopped, tax credits ended, and that \ntechnology that we developed with taxpayer dollars went to Europe. They \nbuilt thousands of windmills in Germany, and they made a lot of money \nbased on that technology that we developed and paid for right in the \nUnited States of America.\n  We also know that renewable energy production creates more jobs than \nfossil fuel production for the same amount of energy. We are talking \nabout a potential to create millions of jobs in this country. Not only \nthat, but renewable energy has a stable price market feature. Unlike \nfossil fuels, which have highs and lows over a 10-year cycle, fossil \nfuels are going to be nice and stable, will be predictable. And \nbusinesses love predictability. So I think this is also another very \ngood argument.\n  Lastly, if we reduce fossil fuels and go to clean energy, we are \ngoing to have cleaner air and cleaner water, a healthier environment, \nand we can reach sustainability. I think the benefits are pretty clear.\n  So where are we now?\n  Well, there are still significant resources out there determined to \nmuddy the waters and confuse people about climate change. I have three \npublications here I want to illustrate. One is called ``Clexit for a \nBrighter Future.'' Now, the point of this is that we need to exit the \nParis and United States climate treaties because fossil fuels are what \nwe need to power the future.\n  Another one is called ``The Mad, Mad, Mad World of Climatism.'' This \none, if you look it up, is biased, and it seems to be paid for by oil \ninterests.\n  The last one I want to show is a respected magazine that is called \nNational Geographic. And the cover page shows ``The War on Science.''\n  So I think we have a pretty good case to make for moving forward with \naction on climate change.\n  There will be significant costs if we don't. Renewable energy is more \nthan cost competitive these days. As I mentioned, I worked in the wind \nenergy business. We see wind and solar being more cost competitive--\nmore than cost competitive, really--with coal and oil for energy \nproduction.\n  So we have the technology, we have the means, and we have the desire \nto do this, yet we are still hung up here in Washington in terms of \nfollowing through with government support that is needed with the right \nsort of policies that will encourage us to reduce fossil fuel \nreduction.\n  Now, one of the great bright spots we see--as Mr. Lipinski, my friend \nfrom Illinois, pointed out--is that there is a bipartisan Climate \nSolutions Caucus that has been formed over the last two terms. In order \nto join, you have to have a Member of the other party. If I am a \nDemocrat, I have a Member of the Republican Party join.\n  What we are doing in that caucus is creating legislation that will \nhelp reduce carbon emissions in an economic and prosperous way. I think \ngood things have a potential to happen. I encourage the caucus to \ncontinue, and I hope it continues to grow.", "turn": 6, "speaker": "Mr. McNERNEY", "itemno": 7}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "L000563", "text": "  Mr. LIPINSKI.

Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman Lipinski, my friend from \nIllinois, for holding this Special Order this evening, to highlight the \nimportant work being done by the Climate Solutions Caucus, to develop \neconomically viable solutions to address climate change.\n  Mr. Speaker, changing weather patterns and extreme weather events \nthreaten nearly every aspect of New York State's economy, including our \nagricultural and outdoor recreational sectors. The recreational economy \nalone generates $42 billion in consumer spending each year, while \nsupporting over 300,000 Empire State jobs. As we work to address \nclimate change in a bipartisan manner, we must employ a variety of \ntechniques that both mitigate impacts and support economic growth.\n  I am currently working with my Agriculture Committee colleagues on \nconservation legislation for the next farm bill that will provide \nimportant data points on conservation programs and outcomes, allowing \nlegislators and regulators to most efficiently use taxpayer dollars to \nachieve real conservation results for our farms. These incentive \nprograms support farming practices that, among other benefits, like \nincreasing yield, lowering the amount of fertilizers that are employed, \npull carbon from the air and sequester it in the soil.\n  In addition to sequestering carbon in the soil. We can also work to \nreduce emissions through greater efficiency in the transportation \nsector. Indeed, the transportation sector is one area where \nCO2 emissions have risen in the last 20 years, unlike, for \ninstance, the electric generation sector.\n  One easy fix would be to modernize the air traffic control system to \nfly planes on more direct satellite guided routes because direct routes \nsave fuel. When Canada switched to a modern air traffic control system, \nthe national fleet was able to reduce emissions in that nation by \nmillions of tons per year.\n  These commonsense changes are great steps forward in combating \nclimate change, but our work is far from over. We must address the real \nimpacts of man-made climate change and emphasize the need to develop \nand create jobs with a goal of protecting our environment. It is \ncritical that we work together to develop smart solutions that will \nconserve our natural resources and protect our communities and \ninfrastructure for future generations.\n\n  Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to be a member of the Climate \nSolutions Caucus, and I look forward to working with my colleagues. I, \nparticularly, want to applaud our distinguished friend from Illinois, \nMr. Lipinski, for organizing this Special Order tonight on a bipartisan \nbasis so that we can address this issue and allow the folks at home and \nall around the United States to better understand the work that is \nbeing done here in Congress on a bipartisan basis to address climate \nchange.", "turn": 8, "speaker": "Mr. FASO", "itemno": 9}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "L000563", "text": "  Mr. LIPINSKI.

Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Lipinski for yielding and also \nfor\n\n\norganizing this Special Order for the Climate Solutions Caucus. I also \nwant to thank the founders of the Climate Solutions Caucus, Congressman \nTed Deutch from Florida and Congressman Carlos Curbelo also from \nFlorida, where they can see at their doorstep what issues like sea \nlevel rise mean to their communities.\n  Mr. Speaker, I am really pleased to join with my colleagues from the \nbipartisan Climate Solutions Caucus this evening to highlight the \nimportance of taking action on climate change, something that matters \nso much to my constituents at home in Oregon, but also to the country \nand to the planet.\n  This is an important issue that really is a moral imperative. This is \nabout preserving our natural resources for our children, our \ngrandchildren, and for generations to come. Addressing climate change \nis also vital to our Nation's economy, as we have had some discussion \nabout that this evening, and also to national security, but, really, \nthe health of the planet.\n  Now, the district I am honored to represent out in Oregon is \nbreathtakingly beautiful, and it is really full of potential. The \nmajestic Columbia River is the northern boundary of the district, and \nthe rugged Pacific Ocean is on the western boundary. It has a thriving \noutdoor recreation economy. As my colleague from New York mentioned, \nthat is an important sector that cares a lot about the changing \nclimate.\n  I also have in my district the heart of Oregon wine country. People \nin my district fish. They fish in our rivers, our lakes, and our ocean. \nThey hike in our forests. They ski in our back country and on our \nmountains. We rely on those natural resources in our backyard to \nsupport a significant part of our economy, but we are very vulnerable \nto the effects of climate change.\n  My constituents are already experiencing challenges: Our wine and \nagricultural industries are concerned about drought as global \ntemperatures continue to rise. Coastal communities are worried about \nthe vitality of the commercial fishing and shellfish industries as high \nlevels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere change ocean chemistry.\n  I was really thrilled that we had an Oregonian from Oregon State \nUniversity come to the Climate Solutions Caucus and talk about adapting \nto ocean acidification.\n  Our region has faced higher spring and summer temperatures and \nearlier snowmelt, and, as a result, a snowboard shop in my district is \nnow selling more skateboards and fewer snowboards.\n  Climate change is not a partisan issue. Nationwide, fishers, farmers, \nsmall-business owners, and our servicemen and -women are changing the \nway they do their jobs because of climate change, regardless of \npolitical affiliation.\n  The economic, health, and environmental consequences of climate \nchange are well known, and our understanding about how to address \nclimate change continues to improve.\n  People in the United States and around the world are facing threats \nfrom rising sea levels, from ocean acidification, from more frequent \nand severe weather events from record droughts and flooding and rising \nglobal temperatures. We can no longer sit back and debate whether we \nshould take action. The time is now. It is critical that we support \nscientific research about the climate and that we build on, rather than \nbreak down, decades' worth of progress on this issue.\n  Now, one important area of research is the connection between extreme \nweather events and climate change. Although it is not possible to say \nthat climate change causes one particular extreme weather event, it is \ncritical that we know more about climate change and how it increases \nthe frequency and the severity of these events. Learning more about \nthis correlation can help families, communities, and businesses make \ninformed choices and adopt climate strategies.\n  Now, this year has seen poignant example after example with so many \ndevastating extreme weather events. We need to do everything we can to \nmake sure our communities are prepared to keep families safe.\n  We have had wildfires in the Western United States for a long time, \nbut since the mid-1980s, they have been increasing in frequency and in \nduration, threatening lives, threatening public health and property. It \nhas been unusually hot and very dry in the Northwest.\n  Fires and severe smoke create dangerous conditions for all \npopulations. In Portland, Oregon, on Labor Day, the sky was gray, full \nof smoke from wildfire. This is especially problematic for pregnant \nwomen, for seniors, for children, for anyone with chronic health \nconditions like asthma. Residents and communities miles away from the \nwildfires saw ash falling on their homes, their cars, and throughout \ntheir neighborhoods.\n  This year's hurricanes have devastated communities, of course, across \nTexas, across the Southeast, and in the U.S. islands. About 70 percent \nof our fellow citizens in Puerto Rico are still without power.\n  These storms are increasing in frequency and severity, and lives are \nbeing lost every year.\n  Mr. Speaker, it is so important that we take action, and that is why \nI am so pleased to be here today to help highlight the importance of \nthis issue.\n  As Representative Lipinski noted and others have, Mr. McNerney and \nothers, we can take action to address climate change and grow the \neconomy. It is not an excuse to say this will be bad for the economy, \nbecause we can grow those renewable energy industries. There is so much \npotential in wind power, wave energy, solar energy. Those are good, \nhigh-paying, family-wage jobs. We can grow those economies and address \nclimate change at the same time.\n  Mr. Speaker, addressing climate change is going to save lives; it is \ngoing to save property. I am so pleased to be part of this bipartisan \ngroup that is working together in equal number of Democrats and \nRepublicans to call attention to this important issue, and I will \ncontinue to work with the caucus to emphasize the importance of \ncongressional action.\n  Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues on the bipartisan Climate \nSolutions Caucus for their dedication to this effort. I know it is \nquite a relief to my constituents back home in Oregon to know that \nthere are bipartisan Members who are committed to addressing this \ncritical issue.\n\n  Again, Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues for their dedication to \nthis effort.

I started this caucus \nwith my fellow Floridian, Congressman Carlos Curbelo, to start a new \ndialogue around climate and Congress because we are already facing \ndifficult challenges. We can't ignore it. We can't bury it in political \nfights. We need to have an open discussion not only for our future, but \nfor the impact of climate change that we are facing today.\n  It is no coincidence that this project started with two Members from \nsouth Florida. A 2015 study projected that some south Florida cities \ncould be underwater within this century. The study's author said some \ncities appear already to be lost.\n  Climate change is already here for Floridians. The effects have hit \nFlorida first.\n  Scientists have warned of warming average global temperatures and the \nchanging climate for decades. Dr. Andrew Clarke of the British \nAntarctic Survey has spent 40 years at the bottom of the planet \nwatching it disappear. Dr. Clarke said: ``You can see the entire \nenvironment changing in front of your eyes.''\n  We now have climate change right before our eyes in south Florida. We \nsee the rate of sea level rise outpace the global rate tenfold. We see \nthe high-water mark jump 1 inch every\n\n\nyear. Just this week, we see the tides flooding our neighborhoods.\n  The limestone that serves as the foundation of our State is porous. \nSaltwater pushes up through the limestone from below the surface.\n  Lower bridge heights will block boats from reaching open waters. With \n165 miles of canals, Fort Lauderdale faces significant threats of \nrising seas. Who in south Florida hasn't driven around their \nneighborhood and noticed more puddles, more water accumulating on the \nsidewalks and streets?\n  While many Americans might be able to ignore climate change, ignore \nthe science, based on their own personal experience and your own \npersonal experience at home, we can't. Looking out our windows, we see \nwhat is already there.\n  By the year 2100, almost 300 U.S. cities would lose at least half of \ntheir homes, and 36 American cities could be completely destroyed. One \nin eight Florida homes could be underwater. Those Florida homes \nrepresent half of the total expected loss in housing value caused by \nclimate change over the next 84 years. These aren't risks of a distant \nfuture. These are the burdens we are placing on our children and on our \ngrandchildren.\n  In response, and through the work of the South Florida Climate \nCompact, Miami Beach has initiated a sea level rise plan to lift roads, \nbuild up seawalls, and install pumps to clear water in the streets. \nFort Lauderdale is fixing roads and drains and sending vacuum trucks \ninto the streets to prevent saltwater damage, upgrading building codes \nand flood elevation requirements, and requiring higher seawalls.\n  In Florida, you can't put climate change out of sight or out of mind, \nbut it is not just hitting Florida and it is not just the sea level \nrise or increasing temperatures.\n  The National Climate Assessment has documented regional climate \nimpacts hitting every area of the United States:\n  In the Northeast and Midwest, dramatic increases in heavy \nprecipitation events overwhelm drains and levies, causing flooding and \naccelerating erosion;\n  In the Great Plains and Southwest, drought and wildfires strain \ndemands for scarce water resources;\n  In Alaska, receding sea ice and melting glaciers are damaging \ninfrastructure;\n  On the coasts, increases in carbon dioxide and warming seas lead to \ncoral bleaching and ocean acidification that is taking its toll on \nfisheries and the ecosystems.\n  The diverse and interconnected impacts that we already see throughout \nour country explain why we already have 60 Members who belong to this \nnew dialogue, the Climate Solutions Caucus, 30 Democrats and 30 \nRepublicans committed to changing the conversation and pushing \nsolutions that will create more resilient communities.\n  We are committed to understanding the impacts of climate change, the \nimpact on our national security; to investing in clean, innovative \nenergy protection; to protecting our public health; and to overcoming \nthe political obstacles that hold up public policy solutions.\n  It is time for Congress to come together and admit the challenges \nthat our constituents are already facing at home. It is time to build \nconsensus.\n  Through the bipartisan Climate Solutions Caucus, we have brought \ntogether Members from regions in every part of the country who are \nexperiencing their own climate change challenges.

Mr. Speaker, I applaud my colleague, Mr. Lipinski, for \npulling this effort together this evening.\n  Mr. Speaker, climate change is real, and I applaud my colleagues on \nthe Climate Solutions Caucus for working together in a bipartisan \neffort to try and find common ground and to seek to work together to \npass legislation to address this very real threat.\n  I believe the greatest opportunity we have here is to include efforts \nto move our Nation toward a greener economy as part of a comprehensive \ninfrastructure bill.\n  We must address climate change for three reasons: first, the Earth is \npart of the divine creation, and we have an obligation to preserve and \nprotect our precious gift; second, moving toward a green economy that \nretrofits homes and buildings and installs solar and wind farms will \ncreate good jobs at good wages that simply cannot be exported; and, \nthird, the main topic I wish to address this evening, is moving toward \na green economy, reducing our dependency on foreign oil, and addressing \nclimate change is essential to our national security.\n\n\n  Americans rarely talk about it and sometimes forget, but we supported \nOsama bin Laden against the Russians in Afghanistan. We supported \nSaddam Hussein in Iraq after we lost the Shah after the Iranian \nRevolution. We supported the Assads in Syria. And we still maintain a \nclose relationship with the Saudis, despite their support for \nWahhabism. Why? Because our national economic strategy and security has \nrelied for decades on access to foreign oil.\n  Our meddling in local affairs to ensure the oil spigot flowed freely \nhas sowed distrust across generations throughout the Middle East.\n  By moving towards a green economy and eliminating our dependence on \nforeign oil, we can clearly say to the Middle East: We never wanted \nyour land, we never wanted your money, and now we don't need your oil. \nAll we want is for people of the region to stop trying to kill each \nother. It will take some time, but moving towards an economy \nindependent of foreign oil is the best way to get there.\n  In addition to eliminating our dependence on foreign oil, we must try \nto stall the rapid rise in extreme weather events, droughts, and \ndesertification that is destabilizing huge swaths of the Middle East \nand Africa. The number of refugees in the world has grown from 35 \nmillion only 10 years ago to 65 million today. War and violence are \nexacerbated by the instability caused by climate change.\n  One of the most violent regions in the world today is Syria. The \ninstability in Syria began with droughts that destroyed the livelihoods \nof the Syrian people that rely upon an economy which is 85 percent \nagrarian. When people lost their farms, they fled to the cities looking \nfor work, but, of course, they could not find it. Then they looked to \nthe Assad government, but, of course, were ignored. Fomented by the \nArab Spring, they began to revolt. The result? The Syrian Government \nhas killed almost a half million of its own people and millions more \nrefugees. This story is being repeated throughout the region.\n  Although the people suffering are thousands of miles away from the \nUnited States, our national security is threatened by these failing \nstates. The rise of ISIS in Syria and Iraq is a prime example of the \nimpact of failed states on Western security. Mass migrations by those \nseeking to alleviate suffering, millions seeking political and economic \nreforms place pressure on corrupt and incompetent governments that are \nunable to respond to the needs of a population seeking opportunity and \nhope.\n  Our enemies who wish to foment instability--Russia, Iran, North \nKorea, and violent terrorist factions--are aided by the effects of \nclimate change and the instability it causes. We must do everything we \ncan to stall the growth of this nefarious trend.\n\n\n  The good news is that there is a growing bipartisan consensus in the \nClimate Solutions Caucus and the armed services community that we must \nact. The Armed Services Committee in the 2008 National Defense \nAuthorization Act acknowledged that ``climate change is a direct threat \nto the national security of the United States,'' and that ``the \nDepartment of Defense must ensure that it is prepared to conduct \noperations both today and in the future, and that it is prepared to \naddress the effects of changing climate on threat assessments, \nresources, and readiness.''\n  Secretary of Defense Mattis has said, ``Climate change can be a \ndriver of instability, and the Department of Defense must pay attention \nto the potential adverse impacts generated by this phenomenon.''\n  Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Joseph Dunford has said \nthat climate change and rising sea levels pose serious long-term \nthreats to the country. The number of natural disasters will increase \nin the coming years, along with ``the requirement for humanitarian \nassistance'' and the response required for the military for civilian \ndisasters.\n  Mr. Speaker, I want to thank again my colleagues for the work that \nthey have done to try and bring the issue of climate change to the \nAmerican people, and to try and find solutions to this very real \nproblem that is not only affecting us here at home, but our national \nsecurity throughout the world.", "turn": 16, "speaker": "Mr. SUOZZI", "itemno": 17}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "L000563", "text": "  Mr. LIPINSKI.

This year alone, natural disasters will cost more than $22 \nbillion in recovery efforts. That is why I am proud to work with my \ncolleague and cofounder of the Climate Solutions Caucus, Mr. Curbelo, \nto introduce the bipartisan Coastal State Climate Preparedness Act, \nH.R. 3533, which will help coastal States better plan for extreme \nweather events and implement climate change adaptation strategies.\n  We can save lives, homes, and billions of tax dollars by encouraging \nthese vulnerable communities to prepare their infrastructure for the \nimpacts of climate change.\n  After severe weather events like Hurricanes Maria and Harvey, it is \nimperative that we invest in readying our infrastructure for the next \nextreme weather event.

Mr. Speaker, I am grateful to my colleague \nfrom Illinois for leading this special discussion tonight. I am \ngrateful to have the opportunity to come here for a few minutes. And \nmore than anything, I thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, \nRepublicans and Democrats, who have stepped up and said: Enough of the \ndemagoguery, enough of the fact-less conversation. Let's focus on what \nis happening in the world, on how human beings are contributing to it, \nand let's try to make the situation better.\n  I oftentimes say that, on this climate issue, neither the deniers nor \nthe alarmists have much to offer. It is the men and women who are \nwilling to sit at the table and have a sober conversation that can \nreally help solve this problem. There are a lot of people who are \ncounting on us to solve this problem.\n  Sea level rise is a reality. It is happening all over the world. Mr. \nSpeaker, you might understand why this might be important to me. I \nrepresent a community where most people live near sea level and near \nthe sea. This is a real concern, especially in the Florida Keys, one of \nthe most attractive and dynamic parts of the country, an area that is \nrecovering. We hope our fellow Americans will help us continue \nrecovering after Hurricane Irma.\n  The Florida Keys and most of south Florida are significantly exposed \nto this sea level rise challenge, and we know that human activity is at \nleast, in part, responsible for this dynamic. The Climate Solutions \nCaucus is not about blaming people. It is not about pointing the \nfinger. It is about coming up with solutions.\n  I think there are really three phases to our caucus and our work. The \nfirst phase was to bring Republicans and Democrats together, sit at the \ntable, have a discussion about our different perspectives on this \nissue, invite in some key witnesses to help inform us. We have done \nthat. We have done a good job. Caucus members have a very good \nrelationship, a good rapport.\n  The next phase has been to block anti-climate legislation. We have \ndone that successfully here with some appropriations amendment where \nthe caucus has come together and said: No. We are not going to prohibit \nthe Defense Department from assessing the risks associated with climate \nchange.\n  Again, this is critical in my district. I happen to represent Naval \nAir Station Key West, where the men and women of the Navy work hard to \ntrain and prepare to defend our country overseas. That is a facility \nthat is exposed to this threat.\n  We came together and we defeated an amendment that would have \nprohibited the Defense Department from assessing these risks.\n  I am really excited for the next phase of the caucus, which I hope we \ncan reach during this Congress, which is to find legislation that we \ncan all get behind and say that these are reasonable solutions that not \nonly help the environment and help guarantee that we are going to hand \noff to our children and grandchildren the same beautiful Earth that we \ninherited, but also that we are going to provide opportunities for \nAmerican innovation and growth, and new good jobs, high-paying jobs, \nfor young men and women from all over this country. That is going to be \nvery exciting, and we are all working together to get to that day where \nwe can promote an agenda in this Congress that will bring Republicans \nand Democrats together behind a pro-environment, pro-growth policy that \nwill save this planet and keep our country on the cutting edge of \ninnovation, leading the world.\n  This is a not an issue that we should shy away from. We should rise \nto this occasion. This is the country that has led the entire world \nthrough a host of different challenges over the last couple centuries. \nWe can also do it on this climate issue, but I think we can only do it \nif we do it together.\n  Mr. Speaker, I thank all of my colleagues, but especially my \nDemocratic colleagues tonight who have led this Special Order, \norganized this Special Order. I think we all would like to invite our \ncolleagues from both sides of the aisle to join the caucus, especially \non my side. We are up to 30 Republicans, 30 Democrats. That is very \nexciting. When I arrived here a couple years ago, I probably had only \ntwo or three Republican colleagues who were even willing to discuss \nthis issue, and now there are 30 on the record.

Mr. Speaker, I appreciate Mr. Lipinski's kind words, but \nI\n\n\nthink he and I know best that we had good teachers to help us \nunderstand what it takes to get things done here in the United States \nCongress, and, most importantly, that is the ability to work together.\n  Mr. Speaker, I am proud to stand here today with all of my \ncolleagues, Republicans and Democrats, who are on the Climate Solutions \nCaucus. As you have heard tonight, and as we know, the Climate \nSolutions Caucus is a bipartisan caucus that gives Democrats and \nRepublicans the opportunity to sit down and to discuss ways not only to \nprotect our environment, but to protect our homes, our Nation's \neconomy, and our Nation's security.\n  Yes, this caucus consists of people from separate political parties, \nbut all of us are united in our belief that we must have this dialogue \nto defend our future.\n  Being from the central coast of California, where we have over 120 \nmiles of stunning coastline in my district, we understand the \nvulnerability that comes with rising sea levels, something that can \nimpact our economy, our security, and, of course, our daily lives.\n  The co-chairs of the Climate Solutions Caucus, Florida \nRepresentatives Carlos Curbelo and Ted Deutch, they understand and they \nappreciate that threat, for earlier this year Florida was pummeled by \nHurricane Irma and the subsequent severe flooding, a storm that \naffected the lives of millions of Americans and cost billions in \nrecovery and cleanup efforts.\n  We have seen that at times of crisis like that, despite the damage \nand despite our differences, our government and even this Congress can \ncome together and put back together those communities. That is our \ngovernment during an emergency, and at times where there are storms, \nwhere there is damage, we are motivated to come together and govern.\n  This year, my district saw this type of governing due to damage it \nsuffered during the major winter storms earlier in 2017.\n\n\n  Every county in my district saw devastation. One county in \nparticular, Monterey County, suffered an extreme amount of damage--the \ntown of Big Sur, along the coast of California, in particular. The \nnorthern route of Highway 1, going into Big Sur, suffered a knockout of \na major bridge. The southern route had a major landslide, leaving that \ncommunity isolated.\n  But I can tell you, 2 weeks ago, I stood on the brand-new bridge that \nwas built. And as I was standing there, to me, it was a story of the \npeople of Big Sur, very resilient, always coming back from these types \nof situations. But it was also the story of government working, people \nand government coming together, getting things done to help people.\n  Now, just prior to that, I had read a New York Times editorial, where \nthe title of that editorial was, ``We Used to Build Things.'' And it \nwas by David Brooks, and he talked about this big fire called the Big \nBurn, back in the early 1900s, that started in Washington and Oregon \nand spread throughout the upper West, all the way into Montana. And \nfrom that devastating fire arose something, and that was the U.S. \nForest Service.\n  When I read that article, it reminded me that, throughout the history \nof this Nation, we have always built things to help people. We have \nengineered infrastructure to energize our economy, and we have expanded \nagencies to embolden and to empower our communities and the people who \nlive there.\n  So now, after the storms on the West Coast, after the flooding in the \nMidwest, and after the hurricanes on the East Coast, it is our turn. It \nis time for this generation, our generation, to build things in a smart \nand resilient fashion, so that future generations are secure and safe \nin their homes and in their communities. And we need to start by \nfocusing on and building infrastructure that is strong and stable to \nsustain the inevitable intense storms of the future.\n  Now, we know, and what has been confirmed by the nonpartisan Federal \nGovernment Accountability Office, that extreme weather events are \nalready costing U.S. taxpayers billions and billions of dollars each \nyear. According to that GAO report, the Federal Government spent more \nthan $350 billion over the last decade on losses to private property \nand disaster assistance programs from natural disasters.\n  Now, that amount doesn't even include the massive price tag on the \nrecovery effort from this year's hurricanes and fires that are expected \nto be amongst the costliest in our Nation's history. And we know that \nit is going to get worse as storms are more intense, and recovery \nefforts are going to cost more. So we need to recognize and we need to \nrealize the need for smart rebuilding.\n  Now, after the 2012 hurricane up in New York, Hurricane Sandy, there \nwas a Rebuilding Task Force that was put together, and it recommended \nthat Federal flood protection measures should entail that projects \nreceiving Federal dollars, they should comply with elevation and flood-\nproofing measures to avoid rebuilding them after future storms. The \nreport wanted to ensure that we do not need to pay multiple times to \nrepair for flooding damages in flood-impacted areas.\n  In 2015, the administration put forward the Federal Flood Risk \nManagement Standard. That was a standard that set out that federally \nfinanced infrastructure projects must be built to withstand future \nstorms and flooding. That standard was meant to ensure that taxpayer \ndollars are spent wisely and communities are protected.\n  However, in August, this administration decided to roll back the \nFederal Flood Risk Management Standard, a decision that was compounded \nby its poor timing, as it was announced 2 weeks before the hurricanes \nthat ripped apart Houston, Florida, and Puerto Rico.\n  So last month, Congressman Curbelo and I introduced the Federal \nInfrastructure Flood Resiliency Act, a bipartisan bill that ensures \nthat Federal agencies complete implementation of a Federal Flood Risk \nManagement Standard; such a standard that will not just benefit our \ncoastal communities, it will help our government, and it will help our \ncountry, because we know that every dollar that is invested in flood \nmitigation efforts results in $4 in saved flood recovery costs. This is \nsomething that Republicans and Democrats understand.\n  After Hurricane Harvey, the Governor of Texas, Mr. Abbott, stated: \n``As we go through the build-out phase, and rebuilding Texas, part of \nour focus must be on rebuilding in a way that will prevent a disaster \nlike this from happening again.''\n  Mr. Speaker, by investing in more resilient project designs, our \ncommunities will be able to recover quickly, and they will be protected \nagainst any future flooding. Taking these prudent steps will save \ntaxpayer dollars and prevent future loss of life and property. It is a \ncommonsense step that we can take toward responsible, bipartisanship \ngoverning; and it is this type of governing that needs to happen all \nthe time.\n  Now, when I stood on that bridge, and I was there celebrating the \nreopening of that bridge, the reopening to Big Sur, I also thought that \nthis was government at its best, where the government came together, it \nresponded, it reacted in record fashion, and it reconstructed a major \nbridge.\n  So yes, it made me proud, but it also made me realize that we need to \nstop just governing by crisis. We need to start governing with \nleadership. We need to come together to get things done, not just in \nemergency situations, not just for natural disasters of today, but we \nneed to start governing for tomorrow.\n  The Climate Solutions Caucus understands and believes that we, in \nCongress, need to lead. We need to do that by coming together. We do \nthat by talking about the effects of climate change. We do that with \nFlood Risk Management Standard legislation, and we don't necessarily do \nit for us. We do it for our children.\n  That is leadership, and that is why I am proud to be on the Climate \nSolutions Caucus.", "turn": 22, "speaker": "Mr. PANETTA", "itemno": 23}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "L000563", "text": "  Mr. LIPINSKI. Mr. Speaker, at this time, I just want to thank all my \ncolleagues for their leadership on this issue. The time to take action \non climate is now. We can't leave this problem to future generations to \nsolve for us. As we heard this evening, there is no shortage of good \nideas for how to do so.\n\n\n  I want to close by reading the mission statement of the Climate \nSolutions Caucus, which reminds us of the many reasons why our \nbipartisan group has come together to take action:\n  ``The members of the Climate Solutions Caucus acknowledge the fact \nthat, if left unaddressed, the consequences of a changing climate have \nthe potential to adversely affect the health of all Americans and the \nstrength of our economy, consequently imposing substantial costs on \nboth State and Federal budgets.\n  ``By seeking to reduce climate risk, we will, in turn, ensure the \nprotection of our economy, infrastructure, and public safety, all while \nattaining energy independence from the world's most volatile regions. \nTherefore, it is our goal to take a market-based approach to \nsubstantially reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the United States in \norder to leave a better planet and stronger economy for future \ngenerations.''\n  Mr. Speaker, this is something that all Americans can endorse and \nsupport.
