Mr. Speaker, I rise today to share the story of Juan \nNavarro in Monmouth, Oregon, and to continue to urge Speaker Ryan to \nput forth a clean Dream Act bill.\n  Juan was brought to the United States, when he was 3 years old, from \nGuadalajara, Mexico. Juan suffers from cerebral palsy and was unable to \nwalk. Juan was admitted as a research patient in Shriners Hospital, and \nafter multiple surgeries and 12 long years of physical therapy, Juan \nnow is able to walk without any support.\n  While Juan was receiving care, his parents had to work two jobs, \nsomething we all used to do. They did this to provide a better life for \nJuan.\n  Over time, Juan excelled in school, and Oregon became his home.\n  Juan is an active member in the Monmouth and Western Oregon \nUniversity communities. He serves as a diversity student mentor, works \nwith the faculty at Western Oregon to create a campus website that \nlists available resources for undocumented students, works for the city \nof Monmouth as a community liaison, and started a support group for \nDREAMers at Western Oregon University.\n  Juan is the first person in his family to graduate from college and \nis currently attending graduate school at Oregon State University's \nCollege Student Services Administration program. He currently works as \na graduate assistant and hopes to bring more institutional changes for \nstudents of color.\n  Without DACA, none of this would have been possible for Juan, and our \ncountry would have lost out on a motivated and talented person.\n  Young people across the country are relying on us. We need to pass a \nclean Dream Act that will recognize Juan and the over 800,000 DREAMers \nas equal members of our community.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. SCHRADER", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "177", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H8308", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "1", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "THE STORY OF JUAN NAVARRO", "id": "CREC-2017-11-01-pt1-PgH8308-4", "title": "THE STORY OF JUAN NAVARRO"}
