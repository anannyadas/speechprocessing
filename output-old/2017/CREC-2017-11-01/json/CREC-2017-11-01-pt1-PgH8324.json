Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I rise today in support of H.R. 2600, sponsored by my colleague, \nRepresentative David Young of Iowa.\n  H.R. 2600 directs the Department of the Interior to convey to the \nState of Iowa the reversionary interest held by the United States in \ncertain land in Pottawattamie County.\n  By the way, there is going to be a test afterwards on this \npronunciation.\n  In 1989, Congress authorized the Secretary of the Interior to provide \nfor the development of a trails interpretive center in Council Bluffs, \nIowa. Six years later, in 1995, the National Western Trails Center \ndonated property to the Federal Government, and the National Park \nService later constructed a trails center on the property to interpret \nthe history of the Lewis and Clark\n\n\nNational Historic Trail, the Mormon Pioneer National Historic Trail, \nand the Oregon National Historic Trail.\n  In 1998, the Federal Government donated the trails center and \nsurrounding property to the State Historical Society of Iowa. Federal \nownership was transferred to the State subject to a condition that if \nthe trails center is not being used for the purposes specified in the \n1989 Act, the land and the center would revert to the United States.\n  Since 1998, the State has owned and operated the trails center. \nPresently, visitation at the center is very low, the hours of operation \nare limited, and maintenance is falling behind. The State of Iowa would \nlike to remove the trails center from its responsibility and possibly \ntransfer the property to the city of Council Bluffs.\n  The National Park Service currently does not own or directly manage \nany of the land associated with the 1989 Act. Moreover, it is the \nCommittee's understanding that the National Park Service does not have \nany interest in taking over operation of the trails center or ownership \nof the property.\n  I commend Representative Young for his outstanding work on behalf of \nhis constituents. I would also like to thank the minority for their \nhelp and cooperation moving this legislation forward.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the measure, and I reserve the \nbalance of my time.", "turn": 4, "speaker": "Mr. COOK", "itemno": 9}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "T000474", "text": "  Mrs. TORRES. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  H.R. 2600 authorizes the conveyance to the State of Iowa the \nreversionary interest on the Western Historic Trails Center in Council \nBluffs, Iowa.\n  In 1989, Congress authorized the Department of the Interior to \npartner with the State of Iowa to create a trails interpretative center \nto support three National Historic Trails that cross through the \nregion.\n  In 1988, the Secretary of the Interior transferred approximately 400 \nacres to the State of Iowa for use as a visitor center. Ownership was \nthen transferred to the State with a reversionary clause that limits \nthe use of the property to a visitor center.\n  The National Park Service does not operate or maintain the current \nvisitor center. However, under current law, if the State stops using \nthe site for its intended purpose, ownership will revert back to the \nFederal Government.\n  Since its establishment, the trails interpretative center has not \nlived up to its expectations. Visitation is low and the facility is in \nneed of significant maintenance.\n  The National Park Service and the State of Iowa have determined that \ntermination of the reversionary interest makes both fiscal and \noperational sense. This will allow the State to sell the property to \nthe city of Council Bluffs, allowing the city to maintain the facility.\n  As long as the State continues to provide National Historic Trail \ninterpretive services following the terms of the original agreement, \nCongress should be allowed to release the reversionary interest to this \nparticular property.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n\n", "turn": 5, "speaker": "Mrs. TORRES", "itemno": 10}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "C001094", "text": "  Mr. COOK.
