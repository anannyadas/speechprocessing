Mr. Speaker, this year my colleagues on the other side of \nthe aisle have wasted months in often misguided debate over repealing \nthe Affordable Care Act. While this debate has raged within one \npolitical party, the Children's Health Insurance Program has expired.\n  I received a letter last night from Governor Tom Wolf of \nPennsylvania. He wants us to act to protect the hundreds of thousands \nof children in our Commonwealth who depend on CHIP funding to meet \ntheir basic healthcare needs.\n  The GOP has failed to reauthorize CHIP over arguments of how to pay \nfor it and the distractions of a failed effort to repeal the Affordable \nCare Act. That puts us in a tough spot in Philadelphia and the \nCommonwealth.\n  I am convinced that something must be done because, as Governor Wolf \npoints out, time is essential for our State and numerous others; yet \n300,000 kids are enrolled in CHIP, which will soon run out of money to \npay for their care.\n  The kids who rely on CHIP funding are some of the most vulnerable in \nour State, and, frankly, they need action now. The solution doesn't \nhave to be partisan. Providing low-income kids and the hospitals that \nserve them isn't a Democratic or Republican issue; it is a commonsense \nissue. The failure to act is unacceptable, so I say now we need to do \nsomething.\n  I urge my colleagues in the GOP to get to work on a bipartisan \nsolution.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. EVANS", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "177", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H8309", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "1", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "WE NEED A BIPARTISAN SOLUTION TO REAUTHORIZE CHILDREN'S HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM", "id": "CREC-2017-11-01-pt1-PgH8309-2", "title": "WE NEED A BIPARTISAN SOLUTION TO REAUTHORIZE CHILDREN'S HEALTH  INSURANCE PROGRAM"}
