Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the \nservice and achievements of an esteemed and valued citizen, Captain \nDennis DeWine, U.S. Army. He has dedicated himself to his community and \nnation and is an embodiment of the Army values of honor, loyalty, and \nselfless service. CPT DeWine is a fitting and worthy recipient of a \nCongressional Veteran Commendation.\n  CPT DeWine joined the Army in 1967, graduated Helicopter Flight \nSchool in 1968, and spent the next seven years as a helicopter pilot; \ntwenty months of which were two tours of duty in Vietnam. As a \ntestament to his valorous service in Vietnam, the President of the \nUnited States presented CPT DeWine with the Distinguished Flying Cross \naward for his actions above and beyond the call of duty. After being \nHonorably Discharged CPT DeWine was inducted into the Ohio Military \nHall of Fame for Valor.\n  CPT DeWine's leadership skills have been invaluable throughout his \npost-military career. After rejoining civilian life, he became the \nfounder, broker, and president of ERA Colonial Real Estate and Colonial \nResidential Properties, Inc. Despite his busy schedule, CPT DeWine \nremains dedicated to serving his community. He can often be found in \njeans and boots working alongside his friends and neighbors. CPT \nDeWine's passion to serve is evident through his participation and \nleadership in numerous organizations, such as Central Texas Voices for \nLife, where he serves as Chairman. CPT DeWine has also proven his \ncommitment to serving others through his company's efforts to \nsuccessfully raise $100,000 for Muscular Dystrophy.\n  Despite his business and charitable commitments, CPT DeWine has found \ntime to raise a closeknit family, volunteer in community organizations, \nand remain active in his church. With admiration and deep respect, I \npay tribute to Dennis DeWine for his sacrifices and the lasting impact \nhe has had on his community and country\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. CARTER of Texas", "itemno": 3}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 4}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "177", "extension": true, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "E1487", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "1", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "TRIBUTE TO CAPTAIN DENNIS DeWINE, U.S. ARMY", "id": "CREC-2017-11-01-pt1-PgE1487-3", "title": null}
