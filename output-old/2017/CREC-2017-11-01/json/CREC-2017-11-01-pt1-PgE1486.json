Mr. Speaker, I rise to congratulate the City of \nBell on its 90th anniversary. I am deeply honored to represent this \ncity as part of California's 40th Congressional District, and I ask my \ncolleagues to join me in paying tribute to Bell and its residents on \nthe city's anniversary.\n  The foundation of the City of Bell can be traced back to the arrival \nof the first group of settlers in the mid-1870s. Among the settlers \nwere the city founder James George Bell and his wife and children. They \nmoved to a property on Gage Avenue that is now known as the Bell House. \nThe house is now a historic landmark filled with antique furnishings, \nvintage clothing, and photographs, and is open for the public to visit.\n  In 1898, the town's name was officially changed from Rancho San \nAntonio to Bell, in honor of its pioneer founders. The City of Bell was \nincorporated in 1927 and is a small, vibrant community composed of \nyoung families, small businesses, and an industrial district.\n  Between 1920 and 1935, Bell experienced a growth spurt where schools, \nbusinesses, and community organizations were established, such as the \nBell Chamber of Commerce and Bell High School.\n  Since its incorporation, the city has expanded its facilities, \nobtained land for public parks and recreational areas, and acquired \nbasic amenities such as a city hall, parks, a fire department building, \nand a police department.\n  The city has recently enhanced transparency and accountability within \nthe city government. In 2013, the city's website earned an A- from a \nnon-profit organization that examines state and local government \ntransparency. Through the city website, the public can now watch live \nstreaming council meetings, look up city contracts, view warrant \npayments and public officials' salaries and compensations, and review \nbudget information.\n  Over the years, Bell has become a vibrant city with an innovative \napproach to enhancing its services and infrastructure in order to \nsupport its growing community. Bell encourages programs that provide \nrecreational activities and community services, preserve and improve \nthe environment, and protect the safety of Bell residents.\n  In 2016, the Bell City Council adopted a five-year strategic plan, \nwhich outlines the top five targets for the city: economic development, \ncommunity outreach, public image, developing and improving strong city \nmanagement, and fiscal sustainability.\n  Currently, the City of Bell is mostly composed of a large Latino \npopulation and a growing Lebanese American community. Bell's commitment \nto community engagement can be seen through the various programs it \noffers to youth, adults, and seniors.\n  Over 700 children are participating in the city's soccer program and \nparents turn out in large numbers to support their kids. Some parents \neven become team coaches. The city has also developed new adult sports \nprograms, and has been renovating parks by establishing maintenance \nprocedures for the synthetic fields.\n  Ernest Debs Park, which is home to the youth soccer program, includes \na synthetic soccer field with covered bleachers and a covered fitness \nzone that are available to residents every day of the week. The largest \npark in the city is Veterans Memorial Park, which commemorates the \ncontributions of war veterans to our country and our freedom. Veterans \nMemorial Park includes a veterans monument, a rose garden, a baseball \nfield with stadium seating, two large park pavilions, and batting \ncages.\n  Family events such as the city's annual street festival, the Summer \nConcert Series, and the Bell 5K Run/Walk have also been developed to \npromote community, health, and fitness in the city. The city's \nsmartphone application has made it possible for its residents to report \nstreet improvements, pickup of bulky items, and graffiti removals \nthrough the touch of a button.\n  The new City of Bell Technology Center has provided a safe learning \nenvironment where both adults and youth can access computers. This \nTechnology Center provides free afterschool computer skills training \nclasses, which include introductions to computer equipment and \noperation, word processing techniques, e-mail correspondence, and \nfundamental skills required for safe web access.\n  As the City of Bell celebrates its 90th anniversary this month, the \ncommunity will also be celebrating some of the following achievements: \na ``Certificate of Achievement for Excellence in Financial Reporting'' \nby the Government Finance Officers Association of the United States and \nCanada; the establishment of a Planning Commission; the initiation of a \n``Business of the Month'' effort to highlight local businesses; a \npartnership with the Bell Chamber of Commerce to establish the Bell \nFamily Food Truck Night; and adoption of the city's Strategic Plan and \nthe new city logo.\n  That new logo is shaped by a bell design, and includes the city's \nmotto: ``Home . . . in the center of it all'' to inspire civic pride \nand civic engagement in the community.\n  The City of Bell has made huge strides in the past couple of years \nand does not show any sign of slowing down. I ask my colleagues to join \nme in sending our best wishes and congratulations to Bell on its 90th \nanniversary. This small, diverse, vibrant community makes residents \nproud and visitors feel at home. I expect more great things to come in \nBell's future.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Ms. ROYBAL-ALLARD", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 3}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "177", "extension": true, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "E1486", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "1", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "CELEBRATING THE CITY OF BELL'S 90TH ANNIVERSARY", "id": "CREC-2017-11-01-pt1-PgE1486", "title": "CELEBRATING THE CITY OF BELL'S 90TH ANNIVERSARY"}
