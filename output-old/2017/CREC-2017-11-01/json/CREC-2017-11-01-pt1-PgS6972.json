Mr. President, I want to remind my colleagues that we \nannually commemorate is National Domestic Violence Awareness Month in \nOctober. This is a time when we're called to increase public awareness \nand understanding of domestic violence.\n  As noted by the National Network to End Domestic Violence, domestic \nviolence is a crime that thrives when we remain silent. That's why the \nSenate today passed the resolution that I recently introduced with \nSenator Feinstein to commemorate National Domestic Violence Awareness \nMonth.\n  As stated in our resolution, Congress should continue to raise \nawareness of domestic violence in the United States. We also should \npledge our continued support for programs designed to assist survivors, \nhold perpetrators accountable, and bring an end to domestic violence.\n  Congress has made support to survivors a national priority for over \nthree decades, through the enactment of the Violence Against Women Act, \nthe Victims of Crime Act, and other Federal laws. Through the enactment \nof laws criminalizing domestic violence at the State and local level, \nwe've also sent a strong signal to abusers that domestic violence is \nnot a ``private'' matter.\n  We've come a long way, but we still have much work to do on this \nfront. Even now, domestic violence affects millions in the United \nStates, including women, men, and children of every age and socio-\neconomic status. About one in five women will at some point in their \nlifetime become a victim of this crime, according to the Centers for \nDisease Control.\n  I applaud the many individuals and organizations in Iowa and \nelsewhere around the Nation that work around the clock to respond to \nvictims in crisis. They include the hotline personnel who provide \nsupport 365 days a year. They include the staff and volunteers at \nshelters, who provide safe havens for those escaping abuse. They \ninclude the advocates who champion survivors' interests at the State \nand Federal levels. Last, but certainly not least, they include the \nfirst responders who compassionately respond to victims in crisis.\n  We applaud their continued service and we continue to support the \ngoals and ideals of National Domestic Violence Awareness Month.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. GRASSLEY", "itemno": 6}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 7}], "header": {"chamber": "Senate", "num": "177", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "S6972", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "1", "month": "November"}, "related_bills": [{"type": "SRES", "context": "TITLE", "congress": "115", "number": "320"}, {"type": "SRES", "context": "HEADERLINE", "congress": "115", "number": "320"}, {"type": "SRES", "context": "OTHER", "congress": "115", "number": "320"}], "doc_title": "SENATE RESOLUTION 320--SUPPORTING THE GOALS AND IDEALS OF NATIONAL DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AWARENESS MONTH, COMMENDING DOMESTIC VIOLENCE VICTIM ADVOCATES, DOMESTIC VIOLENCE VICTIM SERVICE PROVIDERS...", "id": "CREC-2017-11-01-pt1-PgS6972"}
