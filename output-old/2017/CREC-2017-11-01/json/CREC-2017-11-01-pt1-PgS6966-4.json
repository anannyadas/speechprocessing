Mr. President, today I wish to honor the 40th anniversary \nof the Maine Coalition to End Domestic Violence, MCEDV, and its nine \nmember organizations and resource centers: Hope and Justice Project, \nPartners for Peace, Next Step, New Hope for Women, Family Violence \nProject, Safe Voices, Family Crisis Services, Caring Unlimited, and \nImmigrant Resource Center of Maine. I am humbled and thankful for their \ntireless service to end the cycle of abuse existing in too many homes \nacross Maine, our Nation, and the world.\n  Originally formed in 1977 as the Maine Coalition for Family Crisis \nServices, and renamed the Maine Coalition to End Domestic Violence in \n2001, the MCEDV has spent four decades being advocates for victims of \ndomestic violence and have never lost their focus. Their efforts have \nhelped countless people find their own voices and regain their strength \nto live a violence-free life. The MCEDV has helped ensure there are \ndirect service programs, shelters, transitional housing, and court \nadvocacy available to everyone throughout our State. Not only do they \npartner with the nine member-projects mentioned above, but they also \ncoordinate efforts and give voice to the education of the public, \nlawmakers, law enforcement, friends, and neighbors to make domestic \nviolence a community-State-national and global issue that each of us \nhas a responsibility to confront.\n  It is not possible to put words to the significant impact the MCEDV \nhas had, the lives that have been saved, and terrifying existences \nturned into futures of peace. However, it would not be fair to their \nwork to not acknowledge the lives that have been lost to domestic \nviolence. All genders, all ages, all\n\n\nraces, all socio-economics categories, domestic violence knows no \nboundaries, and fear continues to be a strong silencer. However, with \nthe support and services provided by the MCEDV and its membership, many \nvictims have found exceptional strength to tell their story, found \ntheir courage to name the abuse and the abuser and support others to \nshine a light on this pandemic of violence.\n  I cannot overstate how awe-inspiring the exceptional staying power \nand determination of this coalition of advocates is and how impactful \ntheir efforts are. They have not only mobilized a state-wide interest \nin the topic of domestic violence but have also inspired people to work \nwith them to even further strengthen the message that there is no \nexcuse for domestic abuse. It has been said that peace in the world \nstarts with peace in the home. Thank you to the MCEDV for living those \nwords and helping to change the world for the better.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. KING", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "Senate", "num": "177", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "S6966-S6967", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "1", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "40TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE MAINE COALITION TO END DOMESTIC VIOLENCE", "id": "CREC-2017-11-01-pt1-PgS6966-4", "title": null}
