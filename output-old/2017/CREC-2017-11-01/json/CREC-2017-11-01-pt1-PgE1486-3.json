Mr. Speaker, I rise to today in opposition to the so-\ncalled Stop Settlement Slush Funds Act of 2017 (H.R. 732).\n  The Department of Justice has long had the authority to enter into \nand enforce settlement agreements on behalf of the United States \ngovernment. This includes payments to third parties that help right the \nwrongs caused by an entity that has broken the law.\n  For instance, the government can negotiate a settlement that allows \npayments to groups like nonprofits that help aid in the recovery of the \nindividuals and communities hurt by unlawful conduct. These third-party \npayments are particularly important when it is impossible\n\n\nto quantify all of the harm done, as is often true of environmental \ncases.\n  When a corporation responsible for dumping waste into a waterway or \nemitting pollutants into the air agrees to this type of settlements, \nthe non-profits they pay restore coastlines, rebuild ecosystems, and \noften coordinate cleanup activities. This legislation threatens that \ncritical remediation and recovery work.\n  The Stop Settlement Slush Funds Act of 2017 ends this common-sense \npractice by prohibiting the U.S. government from entering into or \nenforcing settlement agreements that require payments to third parties. \nIt also makes it much more difficult to provide relief for damage that \nis more generalized and non-quantifiable. When a power plant dirties \nthe air of a community, the number of visits to the doctor or new cases \nof asthma cannot be precisely measured. That does not mean that they \nshould not be held responsible for the harm they caused.\n  House Republicans have used the first 10 months of this Congress to \ndo little more than push policies that reduce corporate accountability \nand line the pockets of corporate bad actors. I oppose the Stop \nSettlement Slush Funds Act of 2017.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Ms. McCOLLUM", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "177", "extension": true, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "E1486-E1487", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "1", "month": "November"}, "related_bills": [{"type": "HR", "context": "TITLE", "congress": "115", "number": "732"}, {"type": "HR", "context": "OTHER", "congress": "115", "number": "732"}], "doc_title": "H.R. 732, STOP SETTLEMENT SLUSH FUNDS ACT OF 2017", "id": "CREC-2017-11-01-pt1-PgE1486-3"}
