Mr. Speaker, beginning today, millions of \nAmericans have the opportunity to buy or change their healthcare plan \nthrough the Affordable Care Act exchange.\n  The open enrollment period ends December 15, so consumers need to act \nnow. We only have 45 days to shop around, receive assistance from local \norganizations, and make a final decision. But many people may not know \nthat because the Trump administration has taken several administrative \nactions to undermine the ACA.\n  Cutting the open enrollment period in half, to slashing advertising \nand outreach funding by 90 percent, to announcing a shutdown of \nhealthcare.gov on Sundays during open enrollment and other sabotage \nefforts, the Trump administration and the Republican majority have \ntried to restrict the access to healthcare for Americans.\n  I encourage every American who needs health insurance to visit \nhealthcare.gov and get covered. Financial assistance is available, and \nabout 80 percent of the enrollees who pick plans on healthcare.gov will \nbe able to get insurance for $75 a month or less.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "177", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H8307", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "1", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "OPEN ENROLLMENT", "id": "CREC-2017-11-01-pt1-PgH8307-3", "title": "OPEN ENROLLMENT"}
