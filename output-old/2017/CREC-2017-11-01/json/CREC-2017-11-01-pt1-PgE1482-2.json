Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Ellucian on the \noccasion of the grand opening of its new office space in Reston, \nVirginia. Based in Fairfax County since 1987, the opening of this new \nheadquarters location speaks to the growing presence of technology \ncompanies in not only Fairfax County, but the Dulles Corridor as a \nwhole. We are continually reminded of why this area is rapidly \ndeveloping a reputation as the Silicon Valley of the East.\n   Established in 2012 by the merger of Datatel and SunGard Higher \nEducation, Ellucian and its parent companies have been serving the \nhigher education community since 1968. What began as a single office \nhas expanded into 20 regional offices employing over 2,900 individuals \nall over the world.\n   As a former member and Chairman of the Fairfax County Board of \nSupervisors, I know firsthand that the quality of life we enjoy in \nFairfax County is directly tied to the strength of our education \nsystem. This is especially true when it comes to higher education. \nProviding the gateways for students to succeed is essential and I \ncommend the staff of Ellucian for working to create and maintain those \nopportunities.\n   Mr. Speaker, to prepare the leaders of tomorrow, institutions of \nhigher education must have the services, tools, and technologies to \nengage and foster student success. For nearly fifty years, Ellucian has \nprovided support to these institutions in order for them to achieve \ntheir goals. It is critical that our nation focus our sight on \nimproving student outcomes to better compete in the world economy and I \nthank Ellucian and its dedicated staff for their efforts in this area. \nI ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating Ellucian on the grand \nopening of its new headquarters and in wishing it great success in all \nfuture endeavors.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. CONNOLLY", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 3}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "177", "extension": true, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "E1482", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "1", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "RECOGNIZING ELLUCIAN OF RESTON, VIRGINIA ON ITS GRAND OPENING", "id": "CREC-2017-11-01-pt1-PgE1482-2", "title": "RECOGNIZING ELLUCIAN OF RESTON, VIRGINIA ON ITS GRAND OPENING"}
