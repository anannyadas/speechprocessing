Mr. Speaker, today marks the 1-month anniversary of the \nterrible shooting that happened in my hometown, Las Vegas, on October \n1.\n  I rise to remember the life of Heather Alvarado, a woman who was \nknown for her hugs, her love of hot pink, and her beautiful green eyes.\n  Heather lived for her kids, Syrus, Albie, and Charlie, and had \ntraveled to Las Vegas to attend the Route 91 concert with her daughter.\n  Heather loved going on vacation with her family and spending time \noutdoors. She loved planning parties for her children and friends, \nincluding hosting elaborate Halloween parties every year. She was known \nfor her caring nature and kindness. Heather's husband, Albert, said \nthat she saw the good in everyone and would do almost anything to help \nothers.\n  I would like to extend my deepest condolences to Heather's friends \nand family. Please know that the city of Las Vegas and the State of \nNevada and the whole country grieve with you.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. KIHUEN", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 3}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "177", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H8308", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "1", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "HONORING THE LIFE OF HEATHER ALVARADO", "id": "CREC-2017-11-01-pt1-PgH8308-2", "title": null}
