Mr. Speaker, this is the final amendment to the bill, \nwhich will not kill it or send it back to committee. If adopted, the \nbill will immediately proceed to final passage, as amended.\n  Mr. Speaker, schools and counties across rural America are facing a \nfunding and economic crisis. It has now been over 2 years since \nCongress has failed to reauthorize the Secure Rural Schools program. \nThis is beyond unacceptable.\n  Schools and counties across rural America are facing a funding and \neconomic crisis, and the reauthorization of the Secure Rural Schools \nand Community Self-Determination Act will go a long way to helping \nensure children get the education they need to achieve success in \ntoday's economy.\n  Across my district, I have heard families, teachers, and school \nadministrators in forest counties tell me about the dire straits \nschools will be in if SRS is not reauthorized.\n  In Greenlee County, in eastern Arizona, the school superintendent \nshared with me that if the county doesn't see SRS dollars, they will \nhave to close the school that provides special education services. This \nis after the school has already gone through major changes to save \nmoney.\n  Across rural Arizona, schools face issues with access to technology \nand the educational opportunities that came with them. Reauthorizing \nSecure Rural Schools will allow more schools to develop innovative \neducational opportunities.\n  In Yavapai County, where they are using distance learning, schools \ncan share teachers. Making sure that students don't miss opportunities \nbecause they live in rural America is the right thing to do, and \nreauthorizing SRS will better enable coordination and support for \nstudents.\n  Mr. Speaker, the people of rural Arizona and America are tough and \ninnovative, but the simple fact is that they need resources to keep \nschools open and educate children. It is past time that we reauthorize \nSRS, and I call on my colleagues to do so today.\n  Across rural America and rural Arizona, the need for infrastructure \nis only growing. In Gila County, a bridge is needed to make it safer \nfor residents to cross a creek. SRS funding would make it possible for \nthe county to make a greater contribution to get the project completed.\n  If we are serious about passing a bipartisan infrastructure plan, it \nis critical that we make sure that local communities can begin \nplanning. Reauthorizing SRS would allow that to happen.\n  Nationally, there are 720 counties and 4,400 school districts that \ndepend on Secure Rural Schools for education, as well as other critical \nservices and programs, like law enforcement and infrastructure.\n  Rural America is ready for a renaissance, but for it to happen, we \nneed to make sure that folks have equal access to opportunities in \nschool and in the workforce. That means that we need to guarantee that \nschools have the resources that they need to educate our children and \nachieve their potential. That means we need to make sure that \ncommunities have infrastructure that supports local economies and keeps \npeople safe. That means we need to make sure that rural Americans have \na fair shot.\n\n\n  Mr. Speaker, I call on my colleagues to support my commonsense \namendment on behalf of kids across rural America.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.", "turn": 24, "speaker": "Mr. O'HALLERAN", "itemno": 46}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "B001250", "text": "  Mr. BISHOP of Utah.

It simply is another \ndelay tactic.\n  And let's face it, we are dealing with more significant issues in \nthis Nation, like who is going to win game seven tonight. That is \nimportant stuff.
