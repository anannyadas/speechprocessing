Mr. Speaker, I rise to mourn those lost and injured in \nyesterday's terror attack in New York City. The New York City Police \nDepartment is truly the greatest police force in the world, and they \nshowed us why yesterday.\n  It is this body's obligation to pursue policies that help prevent and \nrecover from terrorist attacks. It is a responsibility I am privileged \nto share as chairman of the Homeland Security Committee's Subcommittee \non Emergency Preparedness, Response, and Communications.\n  The alleged perpetrator came to our country legally using the \nDiversity Immigrant Visa program. As a matter of security and \ncommonsense, an immigration system that selects winners like a game of \nbingo should end.\n  I also ask that Congress consider the bipartisan STOP Act, \nlegislation I proposed with Mr. Espaillat from New York to help local \njurisdictions install protective bollards in areas with high pedestrian \ntraffic. Vehicle attacks are tough to prevent, but the STOP Act will \nprotect Americans and make them safer.\n  Mr. Speaker, I send prayers for the injured and the families of the \nlost.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. DONOVAN", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "177", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H8369", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "1", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "DIVERSITY IMMIGRANT VISA PROGRAM NEEDS TO END", "id": "CREC-2017-11-01-pt1-PgH8369", "title": "DIVERSITY IMMIGRANT VISA PROGRAM NEEDS TO END"}
