Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the Ruthie and \nConnie LGBT Elder Americans Act, legislation I am introducing to \nsupport our country's LGBT seniors.\n  The LGBT senior population is growing and is estimated to include \nnearly 6 million Americans by 2030. Unfortunately, the same generation \nof LGBT people who fought for rights in the workplace, equal marriage, \nand societal recognition are once again marginalized as they age.\n  LGBT seniors have fewer support services, higher poverty rates, more \nsocial isolation, and inadequate access to healthcare services compared \nto the rest of older Americans. One of the primary barriers to \nproviding services to LGBT seniors is a basic lack of information.\n  The Older Americans Act, or OAA, already requires the Administration \non Aging to collect data on the individuals receiving OAA services and \nthe efficacy of OAA programs; but if we collected data on sexual \norientation and gender identity, we could better understand this \npopulation and provide services that best fit their needs.\n  Unfortunately, the data we do have shows that the poverty rate is \nhigher for LGBT seniors, which is likely because many have faced \ndiscrimination while working, they have historically been unable to \nlegally marry, and they have experienced gender and racial \ninequalities. We also know that LGBT elders are less likely than their \npeers to have community support and caretakers to help them.\n  I know from speaking with LGBT seniors that many fear discrimination \nwhen receiving home healthcare services. They are twice as likely to be \nsingle and four times more likely to not have children. These are \ncomplex and important issues that require a personalized solution.\n  The bill I am introducing today with Colorado Senator Michael Bennet \nand Florida Representatives Ted Deutch and Charlie Crist would help \nbridge the gap between LGBT seniors and the services they need.\n  The bill is named for Ruthie Berman and Connie Kurtz, who sued the \nNew York City Board of Education years ago for domestic partner \nbenefits, and won their landmark case in 1994. In the decades since, \nRuthie and Connie have continued their advocacy and fight as champions \nof LGBT rights.\n  Our bill would amend the Older Americans Act to improve services for \nLGBT seniors and require data collection on sexual orientation so \nbetter decisions can be made.\n  Additionally, the bill would permanently establish a National \nResource Center on LGBT Aging and provide grants for organizations \nworking to improve LGBT services, including access to healthcare and \nlong-term care. The resource centers and the grants will help States \nand localities reach out to LGBT older adults and provide culturally \ncompetent support.\n  By requiring specific consideration for LGBT seniors in the Older \nAmericans Act, we can provide needed support to a vulnerable yet \noverlooked population.\n\n\n  I thank my colleagues for their work on this important issue, and I \nhope many others will join us in supporting this bill to help our LGBT \nsenior communities.\n", "turn": 1, "speaker": "Ms. BONAMICI", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "177", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H8300-H8301", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "1", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "RUTHIE AND CONNIE LGBT ELDER AMERICANS", "id": "CREC-2017-11-01-pt1-PgH8300-2", "title": "RUTHIE AND CONNIE LGBT ELDER AMERICANS"}
