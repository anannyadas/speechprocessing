Mr. Speaker, I rise to congratulate Oakwood Elementary \nSchool in Wayzata for being recognized as a National Blue Ribbon School \nfor academic excellence.\n  This is a big honor. It is a big deal. I visited Oakwood myself, and \nonly eight schools in Minnesota have received this recognition this \nyear. That is because exemplary, high-performing schools like Oakwood \nrank among the highest performing schools with top scores in State \nassessments.\n  One important note worth mentioning is that Oakwood Elementary School \nhas done significant work addressing the achievement gap in their \ncommunity so that every one of their students has what they need to be \nsuccessful.\n  Mr. Speaker, every one of Oakwood's teachers, staff, students, and \nparents should be commended for this accomplishment. Congratulations, \nagain, to Oakwood Elementary School for being named a National Blue \nRibbon School.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. PAULSEN", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "177", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H8307", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "1", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "CONGRATULATING OAKWOOD ELEMENTARY SCHOOL", "id": "CREC-2017-11-01-pt1-PgH8307-4", "title": "CONGRATULATING OAKWOOD ELEMENTARY SCHOOL"}
