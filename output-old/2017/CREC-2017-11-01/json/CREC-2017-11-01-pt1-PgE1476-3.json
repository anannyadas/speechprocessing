Mr. Speaker, I, along with my colleague Representative \nRobert Wittman, rise today to recognize the twenty-five years that \nMaster Sergeant Paul Contreras has served in the United States Marine \nCorps. MSgt Contreras is a true patriot who has significantly \ncontributed to the defense of our Nation. He enlisted in the Marine \nCorps in April, 1992 and was assigned to Recruit Training Center, San \nDiego, CA. He subsequently attended Marine Combat Training before being \ntransferred to Marine Corps Logistics Base, Albany, GA where he trained \nas a Packaging Specialist. Lance Corporal Contreras' first assignment \nwas to Supply Company, 1st Supply Battalion, 1st Service Support Group, \nCamp Pendleton, CA. Within his first month of this assignment, LCpl \nContreras volunteered to deploy in support of OPERATION RESTORE HOPE in \nMogadishu, Somalia. Upon completion of this deployment, he was selected \nto attend Marine Security Guard training, transferring to Marine \nSecurity Guard Battalion, Quantico, VA. Upon graduation from this \nrigorous course, LCpl Contreras' first assignment was to U.S. Embassy \nAbidjan, Ivory Coast. In July 1995 Cpl Contreras was transferred to \nU.S. Embassy Santiago, Chile for his second post.\n  Upon departure from Chile, Sergeant Contreras served with 1st Supply \nBattalion until early 1998 when he began the process of applying for \nthe Marine Corps' Counterintelligence/Human Intelligence (CI/HUMINT) \noccupational specialty. Staff Sergeant Contreras was competitively \nselected to train as a CI/HUMINT Marine, attending school from January \nto June, 1999. SSgt Contreras' first assignment was with 1st CI/HUMINT \nCompany where he served until being selected to deploy with the 13th \nMarine Expeditionary Unit. During this deployment, SSgt Contreras \nparticipated in recovery efforts following the bombing of the USS Cole \nin Aden, Yemen. In 2000, SSgt Contreras returned to 1st CI/HUMINT \nCompany where he served until June, 2001 before being reassigned to 2nd \nCI/HUMINT Company, Camp Lejeune, NC. During this assignment, SSgt \nContreras supported various exercises including BATTLE GRIFFIN in 2002, \nand deployed in support of combat operations to Kabul, Afghanistan in \n2002 and Babil, Iraq in 2004.\n  In 2006, Gunnery Sergeant Contreras completed his active service to \npursue a civilian career but remained committed to the Marine Corps, \njoining the Select Marine Corps Reserve later that year. His first \nreserve assignment was with the Marine Forces Pacific G2X office. From \n2006 to 2008 Master Sergeant Contreras supported exercises and \noperational requirements for Marine Forces Pacific. During this same \ntime, MSgt Contreras was a part owner of a small defense contracting \ncompany dedicated to the further development and training of Department \nof Defense CI/HUMINT professionals prior to their deployments into Iraq \nand Afghanistan. In the fall of 2008, Master Sergeant Contreras \nreturned to the CI/HUMINT school to provide support to the training \nstaff. His next assignment in March 2009 was with Marine Forces Command \nG2X office. Due to his excellent reputation, MSgt Contreras was \nrequested by name to mobilize with Marine Forces Europe from November \n2011 until August 2013 where he served as Counterintelligence \nOperations Chief. He returned to the United States for assignment to \nIntelligence Support Battalion, Marine Forces Reserve in Quantico, VA. \nIn his civilian career, MSgt Contreras also joined the Defense \nIntelligence Agency's Counterespionage Division. He remained on Marine \nReserve duty with Bravo Company until November 2014, upon which time he \ntransferred to Individual Ready Reserve Status intending to retire. \nRecognizing the immeasurable contribution that MSgt Contreras had made \nto the CI/HUMINT profession, the senior leadership of Intelligence \nSupport Battalion compelled MSgt Contreras to consider withdrawing his \nretirement request in order to serve one final tour with the Battalion \nand in February 2016 MSgt Contreras returned to Bravo Company. He \nsubsequently participated in a US Army exercise at Guantanamo Bay, \nCuba, and served as both Company CI/HUMINT Chief and Senior Enlisted \nAdvisor until his retirement in November of 2017. During this same \ntime, MSgt Contreras was hired by the Marine Corps Intelligence \nActivity in the Office of the Counterintelligence Coordinating \nAuthority where he is able to continue to support his beloved Corps by \ninfluencing the development and direction of counterintelligence \nactivities for the Marine Corps into the future.\n  Mr. Speaker, few can match the dedication and Esprit de Corps that \nPaul Contreras has displayed over his twenty-five years of service to \nCorps and country. We wish Paul continued success in his future \nendeavors. Many thanks to Master Sergeant Contreras. Our Nation has \nbenefited from his outstanding leadership\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mrs. COMSTOCK", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 3}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "177", "extension": true, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "E1476", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "1", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "IN RECOGNITION OF MASTER SERGEANT PAUL CONTRERAS", "id": "CREC-2017-11-01-pt1-PgE1476-3", "title": "IN RECOGNITION OF MASTER SERGEANT PAUL CONTRERAS"}
