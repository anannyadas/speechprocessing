Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me as I rise to \npay tribute to the Heart Failure Treatment and Transplant program at \nNewark Beth Israel Medical Center for performing its 1,000th heart \ntransplant.\n   Founded in 1901, Newark Beth Israel Medical Center is a regional \ncare, teaching hospital that provides comprehensive health care \nservices to local communities. Beth Israel is an important referral and \ntreatment center for patients throughout northern New Jersey, and it is \none of only two hospitals certified to perform heart transplants in the \nstate. Staffed with more than 800 physicians, 3,200 employees, and 150 \nvolunteers, the hospital serves over 3 million patients each year.\n   Newark Beth Israel Medical Center has long been a leader in cardiac \ncare. It performed the first heart transplant in New Jersey in 1986. It \nwas the first New Jersey hospital to use extracorporeal membrane \noxygenation for babies awaiting transplants, and it pioneered the use \nof Left Ventricular Assist Devices for heart-transplant patients.\n   In August, Beth Israel's Heart Failure Treatment and Transplant \nProgram performed its 1,000th heart transplant. Only eleven other \ncenters in the United States have reached this milestone. Newark Beth \nIsrael Medical Center deserves to be recognized for its achievement. I \nam proud and honored to have this medical center investing in the \nhealth care of my constituents and the citizens of the State of New \nJersey.\n\n\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. PAYNE", "itemno": 4}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 5}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "177", "extension": true, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "E1479-E1480", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "1", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "TRIBUTE TO NEWARK BETH ISRAEL MEDICAL CENTER FOR PERFORMING ITS 1,000TH HEART TRANSPLANT", "id": "CREC-2017-11-01-pt1-PgE1479-4", "title": null}
