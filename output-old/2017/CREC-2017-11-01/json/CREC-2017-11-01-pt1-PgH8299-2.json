Mr. Speaker, I rise today under the ``E Pluribus Unum'' to \ngive voice to the elderly, the children, the disabled, the most \nvulnerable who are once again facing your proposal, Mr. Speaker, to rip \nhealthcare and the safety net from them.\n  Is this the best you can do, Mr. Speaker, to once again, over and \nover again, propose this legislation to cut trillions of dollars from \nMedicaid and Medicare to fund tax cuts for corporations and for \nbillionaires, and to do this, to slam this through the House without \ntransparency?\n  Mr. Speaker, Republicans like to call me a ``tax and spend liberal,'' \nbut today we see this GOP fiscal plan as another ``borrow and spend to \npay for billionaires tax cuts.''\n  Now, the Wharton School and the Goldman Sachs studies both show that, \nat best, this plan would produce a paltry one-tenth, maybe two-tenths \nof 1 percent growth, but we all know that it will increase the national \ndebt by trillions of dollars.\n  This is a horrible investment, a horrible return, a negative return \non investment. It is a terrible process. This is terrible legislation. \nIt will produce terrible results for the overwhelming majority of \nAmericans, especially the millions who rely on Medicaid and Medicare.\n  Now, here is the deal, Mr. Speaker, that you are trying to push: if \nAmericans are willing to give billionaires\n\n\nwindfall tax cuts today and also trade their health security and safety \nnet, then you, Mr. Speaker, will give average Americans the empty \npromise of wage growth tomorrow and you will be able to file your taxes \non a postcard.\n  I say ``empty promises'' because studies and our experience have \nshown that this unicorn of wage growth from tax cuts will never, in \nfact, happen. It is reminiscent, Mr. Speaker, of the gluttonous Wimpy \nin the ``Popeye'' cartoon: ``I will gladly pay you Tuesday for a \nhamburger today.''\n  Now, this is a great plan if you are rich. It is dollars for fool's \ngold, but the American people are not fools, Mr. Speaker, and that is \nwhy the Republicans want to rush this through with minimum \ntransparency.\n  This is madness. Trickle down has not worked, it does not work, and \nit will never work. We have got deficits under Reagan and under George \nW. Bush to prove it.\n  The tax cuts will not pay for themselves, Mr. Speaker. The tax cuts \nwon't magically produce increased salaries for workers. The tax plan \nwill not lead to these claims of economic growth.\n  Mr. Speaker, we have all lived long enough to know that these are all \nlies. It is not even wishful thinking anymore, because we know better.\n  Congress should not be considering tax cuts for the rich and opening \nup even more tax loopholes. Mr. Speaker, we cannot spin gold out of \nstraw, and that is what we have here.\n  This plan will make most Americans poorer and sicker, if not dead. I \nurge all my colleagues to reject this bill.\n  Instead, Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to fortify our election \nsystem from Russian further interference; build new infrastructure, \nthat is what creates jobs; fund the Child Health Insurance Program that \nRepublicans let expire; ensure that all 3\\1/2\\ million American \ncitizens in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands can have access to \nwater, power, and healthcare this holiday season. That is what we \nshould be doing.\n", "turn": 1, "speaker": "Ms. MOORE", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "177", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H8299-H8300", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "1", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "REPUBLICAN TAX PLAN", "id": "CREC-2017-11-01-pt1-PgH8299-2", "title": "REPUBLICAN TAX PLAN"}
