Mr. Speaker, it is with great respect that I take this \ntime to recognize the 2017 Distinguished Citizen Award recipients, \npresented annually by the Boy Scouts of America Calumet Council. To \ncommemorate this special occasion, the organization hosted a \ncelebratory event on Thursday, November 2, 2017, at Gamba Ristorante in \nMerrillville, Indiana.\n  Since 1992, the Boy Scouts of America Calumet Council has presented \nthe Distinguished Citizen Award to individuals whose efforts have had \nsignificant positive impacts on their communities in Northwest Indiana \nand across the state. This year, the Boy Scouts of America Calumet \nCouncil honored Tom Sourlis and Susan Eleuterio.\n  Tom Sourlis is the founder and chairman of Mortar Net Solutions, \nlocated in Burns Harbor. Mortar Net, a product invented by Tom, \nprevents mortar droppings from clogging weepholes designed to allow \nwater to exit a building wall. Mortar Net Solutions is a tremendously \nsuccessful company, and the product is currently used on cavity wall \nconstruction throughout North America. In addition to his remarkable \ncareer, Tom dedicates much of his time and support to charitable \nendeavors throughout Northwest Indiana including Tradewinds, the Crisis \nCenter, Parents as Teachers, and the Porter County Community \nFoundation. For his outstanding devotion to such causes, Tom is worthy \nof this great honor.\n  Susan Eleuterio is currently a faculty member of Goucher College's \nMaster's in Cultural Sustainability program in Baltimore, Maryland. She \nhas established an extensive and impressive background that consists of \nmany titles including independent folklorist, author, educator, \nactivist, and consultant to non-profit organizations. Sue's \nextraordinary contributions to her community, however, are not limited \nto academia. She is active in her support for causes that improve the \nquality of life for others and encourage the protection of human \nrights, lending her time and talents to the Crossroads Fund. This \norganization, which is focused on the ideal that fundamental change \noccurs from humble, grassroots beginnings and supports efforts \nthroughout Chicagoland and Northwest Indiana, benefits from the passion \nfor justice, equality, and the academic knowledge Sue offers as a \nmember of the Board of Directors, as the arts and the human condition \nare often intertwined. For these reasons, Sue is worthy of the \ncommendation bestowed upon her.\n  Mr. Speaker, I ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues \njoin me in honoring the Boy Scouts of America Calumet Council and its \n2017 Distinguished Citizen Award recipients, Tom Sourlis and Susan \nEleuterio. For their lifetime of leadership and tireless dedication to \ntheir communities, Tom and Susan are worthy of the highest praise.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. VISCLOSKY", "itemno": 3}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 4}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "177", "extension": true, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "E1482", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "1", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "2017 DISTINGUISHED CITIZEN AWARD RECIPIENTS", "id": "CREC-2017-11-01-pt1-PgE1482", "title": null}
