Mr. President, I rise today to add my voice and my \nstrong support for the confirmation of Colorado Supreme Court Justice \nAllison Eid as the next U.S. court of appeals judge for the Tenth \nCircuit Court, which, of course, is housed in Denver, CO.\n  There is no doubt that Justice Eid is superbly qualified for this \nposition. For the past decade, she has served Colorado as a justice on \nthe supreme court. In 2008, Justice Eid was overwhelmingly retained by \nthe people of Colorado. We have a system where every decade the voters \nof Colorado vote to retain or dismiss a judge, and every time that has \ncome before the people of Colorado, she has been overwhelmingly \nretained by the people of Colorado.\n  Prior to her appointment, Justice Eid represented the State of \nColorado before the State federal courts as our State solicitor \ngeneral. She served as a tenured member of the faculty at the \nUniversity of Colorado Law School, where she taught courses in \nconstitutional law, legislation, torts, and she has published scholarly \narticles on topics such as constitutional federalism and tort law, in \naddition to being a clerk on the Supreme Court. She also practiced \ncommercial and appellate litigation at the Denver office of the \nnational law firm Arnold and Porter.\n  She began her legal career as a clerk to Judge Jerry E. Smith on the \nU.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. Her law experience took \nher to the U.S. Supreme Court under Clarence Thomas. Prior to attending \nlaw school, Justice Eid was a special assistant and speechwriter for \nthe U.S. Secretary of Education, Bill Bennett. She received her law \ndegree from the University of Chicago Law School, where she was the \narticles editor of the Law Review. She graduated with high honors and \nas a member of the Order of the Coif. She received her degree in \nAmerican studies from Stanford University, graduating with distinction \nas a member of Phi Beta Kappa.\n  What her resume clearly shows is that whatever Justice Eid does, she \ndoes it at the highest level, with the best results. She has \nspecialized knowledge of federalism, water law, and Indian law, among \nother important areas of the law. Indeed, the National Native American \nBar Association has even noted that she has ``significantly more \nexperience with Indian law cases than any other recent Circuit Court \nnominee.''\n  We have had some pretty doggone good circuit court nominees in the \npast, including Justice Neil Gorsuch, whose seat she will be filling on \nthe Tenth Circuit Court. These are concepts that are critical to my \nhome State of Colorado, and her expertise will prove to be invaluable \nto the Tenth Circuit Court, as well as to the Nation and the people of \nthis country.\n  But as impressive as her credentials are, it is her demeanor and her \napproach to the law that make her ideally suited for the court. Justice \nEid has been called a ``mainstream, commonsense Westerner.'' She is \nalso, as her former law clerks have noted, ``fiercely independent,'' \nand she will decide cases ``as she believes the law requires.'' At the \nsame time, she seeks out different viewpoints and wants to understand \nall sides of the issue she addresses.\n  That is the law professor I know from my days at the University of \nColorado School of Law. I can say from that experience that while \nJustice Eid has her perspectives on the law, she cares very deeply \nabout robust debate and hearing the views of others. And I know from my \nclassmates who had Justice Eid as their professor--those classmates \ndidn't always agree with her perspectives, but Justice Eid was open to \ntheir debate and hearing their views. She engaged them, and she was \nnever biased against differing perspectives but always applying the law \nas the law required, not as opinions suited.\n  I also know that ``fiercely independent'' jurist whom her former \nclerks spoke so highly of. Justice Eid will follow the law regardless \nof the popular wind, regardless of personal opinion. Whether \nconsidering the plain meaning of a statute, discerning the proper role \nof the courts, the legislative branch, or the executive and its \nagencies, or evaluating the relationships between the Federal \nGovernment and the States, Justice Eid will side with what the law \nsays, and she will do it in that commonsense, western way that clearly \nand articulately tells the American people what the law is.\n  I am privileged to know Justice Eid. I have known her for a number of \nyears now from my days as a student at the University of Colorado \nSchool of Law and through her work in the State of Colorado at the time \nthat I served in the State legislature. She is an incredible human \nbeing with a delightful demeanor that will suit the court well.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nseveral letters in support of Justice Eid's nomination: a letter to \nChairman Grassley and Ranking Member Feinstein from former law clerks \nof Justice Eid's, as well as a letter from various supporters in \nColorado and one letter from the Southern Ute Indian Tribe.", "turn": 2, "speaker": "Mr. GARDNER", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "recorder", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in ", "turn": -1, "speaker": "The RECORDER", "itemno": 3}, {"kind": "recorder", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "the Record, as follows:\n\n                                                    July 13, 2017.\n       Dear Chairman Grassley and Ranking Member Feinstein: We are \n     all of Justice Eid's former law clerks (except those \n     currently clerking for a federal judge and not permitted to \n     sign) since she began her tenure on the Colorado Supreme \n     Court in 2006, and we write to give our fullest support to \n     her nomination to be a judge on the United States Court of \n     Appeals for the Tenth Circuit. We come from a diverse set of \n     geographic, economic, cultural, and political backgrounds, \n     yet we are united in our belief that Justice Eid is a jurist \n     and a person of the highest caliber and character. We have \n     each learned so much from her.\n       Justice Eid was raised by a single mother in Spokane, \n     Washington under challenging circumstances, after her father \n     abandoned her family. Justice Eid began college at the \n     University of Idaho, but with the support and encouragement \n     of her mother and a professor there, Justice Eid transferred \n     to Stanford University where she graduated with distinction \n     and was a member of the Phi Beta Kappa honor society. After \n     Stanford, she served as a speechwriter to President Ronald \n     Reagan's Secretary of Education, William Bennett, and then \n     went on to attend the University of Chicago Law School, where \n     she served as Articles Editor on the Law Review, graduated \n     with High Honors, and was elected Order of the Coif. Justice \n     Eid began her legal career as a law clerk for Judge Jerry \n     Smith on the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth \n     Circuit. She then served as a law clerk to Justice Clarence \n     Thomas on the United States Supreme Court.\n       In private practice at Arnold and Porter following her \n     clerkships, Justice Eid practiced both commercial and \n     appellate litigation for a variety of clients. She departed \n     private practice and joined academia where she became a \n     tenured professor at the University of Colorado Law School, \n     teaching Legislation, Constitutional Law, and Torts, and \n     serving as the faculty clerkship advisor. During her time at \n     the University of Colorado, Justice Eid continued her service \n     in\n\n\n     the Colorado legal community as President of the Colorado \n     Association of Corporate Counsel. In 2005 she was appointed \n     by Colorado Attorney General John Suthers to serve as the \n     Solicitor General of Colorado. One year later, Governor Bill \n     Owens appointed Justice Eid to the Colorado Supreme Court \n     where she has served for 11 years and was successfully \n     retained by the voters of Colorado on a statewide ballot.\n       As law clerks we had the distinct privilege and opportunity \n     to learn by observing Justice Eid throughout her decision \n     making process. We learned that she never fails to provide \n     her full attention and dedication to each individual case, \n     mastering the relevant facts and carefully analyzing the law, \n     whether the text of a statute or the words of a contract. As \n     Justice Eid is so fond of saying, she ``goes where the law \n     takes her.'' In other words, she treats each case \n     individually without any preconceived notion of desired \n     outcome.\n       As young lawyers, we took particular note of the respect \n     that Justice Eid shows the parties and their attorneys both \n     in her written work product and during oral argument. We also \n     observed her belief in the importance of respect and \n     collegiality with her colleagues, particularly during times \n     of disagreement. Her chambers are always open, and she wants \n     to hear different viewpoints (even ours), but she remains \n     fiercely independent, ultimately deciding cases as she \n     believes the law requires. And her opinions do just that--in \n     clean and succinct prose, time and again, Justice Eid \n     resolves the dispute between the parties and announces a \n     clear rule of law that can be readily discerned by future \n     litigants. Her majority opinions in particular are a \n     testament to the care, dedication, and consensus-building \n     attitude she brings to her role as a Judge.\n       While serving as a Justice on the Colorado Supreme Court, \n     Justice Eid has continued to teach at the University of \n     Colorado. She also serves as the Chair of the Supreme Court \n     Water Court Committee, which works to identify rule and \n     statutory changes to achieve efficiencies in water court \n     cases, while maintaining quality outcomes for all. Justice \n     Eid was appointed by Chief Justice John Roberts to serve on \n     the Federal Advisory Committee on Appellate Rules--a \n     prestigious appointment where she has served alongside \n     federal judges, law professors, and lawyers to craft \n     revisions to the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure--and by \n     President George W. Bush to the Permanent Committee for the \n     Oliver Wendell Holmes Devise (an organization that writes the \n     history of the United States Supreme Court and sponsors the \n     Oliver Wendell Holmes Lecture).\n       Justice Eid is active in her community and church, and as \n     the mother of two children, Justice Eid has also been \n     involved in her children's school over the years. In addition \n     to her service on the Colorado Supreme Court, these other \n     responsibilities connect her to the Colorado community, \n     specifically the challenges and issues facing citizens of \n     this State and will allow her to bring an important \n     perspective and diverse set of experiences to the United \n     States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit.\n       Her qualifications to serve are unparalleled and speak for \n     themselves. At each stage of her education and career Justice \n     Eid has excelled at the highest levels and has received \n     praise, awards, and the utmost respect of her colleagues and \n     those who have worked for her. This is in no small part due \n     to her incredible work ethic and her leadership by example. \n     And we as law clerks have carefully observed and learned from \n     her simultaneous and unfaltering commitment to both her \n     family and her position on the Colorado Supreme Court.\n       We close by reflecting on our fond memories of our \n     experiences as law clerks under Justice Eid, whether it was a \n     lunch to celebrate a birthday, officiating numerous of our \n     weddings, or the annual holiday and summer parties that she \n     hosts. We all remember the genuine interest and support \n     Justice Eid provided to us as people and new lawyers. We will \n     never forget her heartfelt appreciation for our hard work and \n     the care and time she has taken to guide us through our \n     clerkships and beyond. She has been an important and \n     steady mentor in each of our lives. We urge the Senate to \n     take swift action on her nomination and are available to \n     speak to any member or their staff about Justice Eid and \n     her qualifications to serve on the United States Court of \n     Appeals for the Tenth Circuit.\n       Sincerely,\n        Marie Williams, Clerk for Justice Eid, 2006-07; Holly E. \n     Sterrett, Clerk for Justice Eid, 2006-07; Jared Butcher, \n     Clerk for Justice Eid, 2007-08; Clark Smith, Clerk for \n     Justice Eid, 2008-09; Kate Field, Clerk for Justice Eid, \n     2009-10; Tim Zimmerman, Clerk for Justice Eid, 2010-11; Lee \n     Fanyo, Clerk for Justice Eid, 2011-12; Jon Gillam, Clerk for \n     Justice Eid, 2011-12; Jake Durling, Clerk for Justice Eid, \n     2012-13; Doug Marsh, Clerk for Justice Eid, 2013-14; Jamen \n     Tyler, Clerk for Justice Eid, 2014-15; Ben Fischer, Clerk for \n     Justice Eid, 2014-15; Chris Chrisman, Clerk for Justice Eid, \n     2006-07; Catherine Bazile, Clerk for Justice Eid, 2007-08.\n       Katie Yarger, Clerk for Justice Eid, 2008-09; Sara Rundell, \n     Clerk for Justice Eid, 2009-10; Maranda Compton, Clerk for \n     Justice Eid, 2010-11; Trina Ruhland, Clerk for Justice Eid, \n     2010-11; Victoria Cisneros, Clerk for Justice Eid, 2011-12/\n     2012-13; Kate Cahoy, Clerk for Justice Eid, 2012-13; Lidiana \n     Rios, Clerk for Justice Eid, 2013-14; Ayesha Lewis, Clerk for \n     Justice Eid, 2013-14; Matt Mellema, Clerk for Justice Eid, \n     2014-15; Emma Kaplan, Clerk for Justice Eid, 2015-16; Julie \n     Hamilton, Clerk for Justice Eid, 2016-17; Rob Rankin, Clerk \n     for Justice Eid, 2016-17; Mairead Dolan, Clerk for Justice \n     Eid, 2016-17.", "turn": -1, "speaker": "The RECORDER", "itemno": 4}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                                  ____\n\n                                                    July 27, 2017.\n     Re Support for the Confirmation of Justice Allison Eid to the \n         Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals.\n       Dear Senators Bennet and Gardner: As members of the \n     Colorado legal community, we are proud to support the \n     nomination of Justice Allison Eid to serve as a Judge on the \n     Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals.

This incredibly diverse group of attorneys \n     agrees on one thing: we all agree that Justice Eid is \n     exceptionally well qualified and should be confirmed.\n       We know Justice Eid to be a person of integrity, \n     professional competence, and judicial temperament. She has \n     received the highest possible `Well Qualified' rating from \n     the American Bar Association. Her private practice work, \n     scholarship, law teaching, and service as Colorado's \n     Solicitor General have all demonstrated her superb abilities \n     over many years. Her service on the Colorado Supreme Court \n     has earned her a reputation as an excellent jurist. Her \n     strong work ethic is renowned. She is a preeminent member of \n     the legal profession, not only in Colorado, but in the United \n     States more broadly, with outstanding legal ability and \n     exceptional breadth of experience. We also know her to be a \n     compassionate and caring person, deeply involved in the \n     broader community and called to service, not only in her day \n     job, but through her extensive volunteerism toward the \n     betterment of the profession. Throughout her tenure on the \n     bench, she has hired numerous diverse law clerks and \n     continuously sought to ensure that the diverse voices of \n     Coloradoans are heard, evincing a very strong commitment to \n     diversity and inclusion. We are excited to see her bring her \n     spirit and skill set to the Tenth Circuit.\n       We ask that Colorado's Senators join together and support \n     this very highly qualified nominee from Colorado.

As a Colorado \n     Supreme Court Justice, Justice Eid has demonstrated expertise \n     in a broad spectrum of legal matters including the field of \n     federal Indian law. Justice Eid's judicial record evidences \n     her understanding of tribal sovereignty and other matters \n     that are acutely important to the Tribe.

Mr. President, I wish to spend some time talking about a \nletter dated July 27, 2017. This letter was sent to me and my \ncolleague, Senator Bennet from Colorado. This letter was titled \n``Support for the Confirmation of Justice Allison Eid to the Tenth \nCircuit Court of Appeals,'' which I have\n\n\nsubmitted for the Record, but I want to highlight some of the people \nwho have signed this letter because when it comes to the courts and \nnominations, I think it is very important that we listen to the voices \nof those people who are closest to the court over which the nominee may \nbe presiding. It is also important that those who are closest to a \npracticing lawyer provide their opinions of a lawyer who has been \nnominated for the bench who is not already on the bench.\n  In the case of Justice Eid's supporters, there is an incredible list \nof people from across the political spectrum--both sides of the aisle--\nsupporting Justice Eid. Let me talk about a few of Justice Eid's \nsupporters, because we will hear a lot of debate about groups who \nsupport or oppose Justice Eid, but the people who know her the best, \nthe people who have practiced before her court, the people who have \nworked with her over the many years of public service that she has \nprovided don't just fall on the Republican side of the aisle or the \nDemocratic side of the aisle, the support she has gathered is from \nacross the political spectrum.\n  There is Michael Bender, former Colorado Supreme Court justice; \nJustice Rebecca Love Kourlis, one of the most respected jurists in \nColorado, who served on the State supreme court and is one of the most \nhighly regarded justices not only in Colorado but across the country, \nquite frankly; Justice Mary Mullarkey. Justice Mullarkey is no longer \non the Colorado Supreme Court, but she served as the chief justice of \nthe Colorado Supreme Court. She was appointed by a Democratic Governor. \nShe is someone who believes Justice Eid would be an incredible addition \nto the court.

Mr. President, I come to the floor today for the \n184th time to ask us to at least wake up to our duty as a Congress to \nenact prudent policies to address the effects of climate change. The \nPresiding Officer is well aware of what Alaska faces from ocean \nacidification and ocean melting and sea level rise and all of that.\n  For the generations who will look back at this, I have tried in these \nspeeches to chronicle the political tricks and bullying that have put \nCongress--the Congress of the United States--in tow to a massively \nconflicted special interest, such that we are incapacitated on this \nvital subject. The shamelessness of the fossil fuel industry and the \nspinelessness of Congress under its sway will provide a long lesson in \nmodern-day corruption and political failure.\n  The Trump administration has been particularly loathsome, threatening \nthe emissions standards for cars and trucks, pressing for the Keystone \nXL tar sands pipeline, disbanding science advisory committees, lifting \nthe moratorium on Federal coal leasing, trying to expand offshore \ndrilling, and open national marine monuments and sanctuaries to energy \ncompanies. The Environmental Protection Agency is working to eliminate \nrules on the leaking and flaring of methane and has rescinded \nrequirements for reporting methane emissions. The President has \nannounced his intention to withdraw the U.S. from the Paris climate \nagreement.\n  One particular target of this corrupted administration is the Clean \nPower Plan, the 2015 EPA rule to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from \nAmerican powerplants--a rule that many utilities and States supported. \nBut it is the industry's bottom-dwellers who have the President's ear, \nand they want to undo even this flexible framework for meeting \nemissions-reduction targets.\n  When EPA balanced the costs and benefits of the Clean Power Plan \noriginally, it offset things, like between $14 billion and $34 billion \nin health benefits in the form of preventive illnesses and deaths, \nagainst the costs of industry compliance.\n  The net benefits of the Clean Power Plan came out to between $26 \nbillion and $45 billion every year.\n  So with its official proposal to rescind the Clean Power Plan, EPA \nadministrator and fossil fuel operative Scott Pruitt had to cook the \nbooks to wipe out this public benefit. Here is how he did it. There \nwere two tricks. One derives from the fact that harms, injuries, and \nlosses caused by carbon pollution can take place many years after the \npollution is emitted. In financial matters, future costs and benefits \nare balanced against present costs and benefits, using what is called a \ndiscount rate. It is more valuable to receive $1 million now than $1 \nmillion 20 years from now. That is the theory.\n  But even the George W. Bush administration recognized for healthcare \nrulemaking that ``[s]pecial ethical considerations arise when comparing \nbenefits and costs across generations,'' and they urged care about \nusing a discount rate when a rule is expected to harm future \ngenerations.\n  In 2015, the United States settled on a 3-percent discount rate to \nestimate the out-year costs of carbon pollution to society. Scott \nPruitt jacked that up to a 7-percent discount rate so out-year harms, \ninjuries, and losses would count for less. Mind you, our children and \ngrandchildren will still suffer the exact same costs at 3 percent or at \n7 percent. It is just that present-day polluters--Scott Pruitt's \nmasters--get a way-big discount.\n  Pruitt's second trick is only to count the carbon pollution harm \nwithin our borders. You might say: That is OK; we are Americans, after \nall. But it is worth taking a look at what this rule does if all \ncountries were to use it because there is a trick hidden in the middle \nof it. The fact is that we are harmed by other countries' carbon \nemissions, and they in turn are harmed by our carbon emissions. On the \nflip side, we harm other countries with our emissions, and they harm us \nwith theirs.\n  There is a total amount of global emissions, and there is a total \namount of global harm. If you call the total global emissions X and the \ntotal global harm Y, what happens when every country follows the Pruitt \nmethod of only pricing local emissions and local harms?\n  For purposes of illustration, let's say there are three countries in \nthe world, and each emits one-third of the total carbon pollution and \nsuffers one-third of the global harm from the collective global \nemissions. If each country only counts its own emissions and the harms \nonly to its own country, guess what happens. All that cross-border harm \nnever gets counted. It never gets counted. It disappears off the \nbalance sheet. It vanishes into this trick of calculation. If you are \nthe tool of the fossil fuel industry, how rewarding it must be to \nimplement a trick that just vanishes so much of the fossil fuel \nindustry's harm to the world.\n  In this hypothetical, how much harm simply vanishes? Two-thirds of it \ndoes. Two thirds of the harm simply vanishes, never to be accounted \nfor--not in the real world. Nothing has changed in the real world. In \nthis three-country hypothetical, the total emissions is still X and the \ntotal harm is still Y. None of that has changed. This Pruitt trick of \naccounting just wiped two-thirds of the harm off the books. A happy day \nfor polluters, and a happy, happy day for the polluters' tool, for \nthere will no doubt be rewards for implementing this trick.\n  Those fossil fuel industry bottom-dwellers no doubt think that this \nis pretty cute and that this is pretty clever stuff, indeed. There are \nhigh-fives in the corporate boardrooms that they have a tool in office \nwho will pull such a trick of magical, vanishing carbon pollution \nharms. But the problem with these crooked little schemes is that the \nwhole world is actually watching. Anybody can do the analysis that I \njust did and show that this is nothing more\n\n\nthan a trick, and sooner or later, consequences do come home to roost.\n  Out in the real world, the Pacific Island nation of Kiribati is \nbuying up land in Fiji so it can evacuate its people there when rising \nseas engulf its islands and eliminate the nation. It is on its way to \nbecoming a modern-day Atlantis, lost forever to the waves. You can \nreplicate that risk along the shores of Bangladesh, Burma, Malaysia and \nthe Maldives.\n  You can add in the risk of lost fisheries that left a country's EEZ \nfor cooler waters. If you think that is just a hypothetical, ask \nConnecticut and Rhode Island lobstermen about their catch. Add in the \nexpansion of the world's desert areas in the Sahel and elsewhere that \nforces farmers' crops and shepherds' flocks away from their historic \nhomes.\n  Add unprecedented storms powered up over warming seas. As bad as \nthings have been in Houston, Florida, and Puerto Rico, we are rich \nenough to rebuild, to throw billions of dollars at the problem, and we \nare. Other places do not have those resources. Without the help, \nimagine that suffering.\n  To those who will suffer in the future, what do we say? On that day \nof reckoning, on that judgment day, what do we tell all those people \nwho suffered? Ha-ha-ha, do we say? We came up with this little trick \nthat wiped most of your suffering off our books. We used a discount \nrate that discounted your suffering to virtually zero. Is that the kind \nof America we want to be? Remember the saying: The power of America's \nexample is more important than any example of our power. Some example \nwe would be, some city on a hill, if that was the way we behaved.\n  The natural world does not care about self-serving or ideological \narguments. The natural world is governed by immutable laws of physics, \nchemistry, biology, and mathematics. Scott Pruitt's polluter-friendly \nmathematics just doesn't add up. As Michael Greenstone, an economist at \nthe University of Chicago who helped develop the social cost of carbon, \nput it, Pruitt's plan was not evidence-based policymaking. This was \npolicy-based evidence making.\n  There is enormous pressure in the Trump administration to get rid of \nthe social cost of carbon. What is bizarre about the Trump \nadministration is that they don't try to get rid of the social cost of \ncarbon by getting rid of its social costs, by lowering carbon \nemissions, by addressing the harms that it causes. They try to get rid \nof the social cost of carbon by getting rid of the scoring mechanism \nthat counts all of that. It is like saying: My team is winning because \nI tore down the scoreboard.\n  Well, no, the world is getting clobbered out there by carbon \npollution and the climate change that causes it, and tearing down the \nscoreboard doesn't help change the game on the field. You cannot just \ncook the books and reduce the social cost of carbon.\n  For one thing, the social cost of carbon analysis is too well \nestablished in the honest world. Courts have instructed Federal \nagencies to factor the social cost of carbon into their regulations. \nStates are using the social cost of carbon in their policymaking. Most \nmajor corporations, even ExxonMobil, factor a social cost of carbon \ninto their own planning and accounting.\n  The social cost of carbon pollution is at the heart of the \nInternational Monetary Fund calculation, for which the fossil fuel \nindustry gets an annual subsidy in the United States of $700 billion a \nyear. Even to protect a multihundred-billion-dollar annual subsidy, \nScott Pruitt can't just wish the social cost of carbon away and just \ncan't stop counting it. Courts will take notice.\n  They may take notice that these stunts are arbitrary and capricious \nunder the Administrative Procedure Act. They may take note that Pruitt \nhas massive conflicts of interest with his fossil fuel funders. They \nwill surely note that the Supreme Court has said greenhouse gases are \npollutants under the Clean Air Act, and that EPA is legally obligated \nto regulate them. They will surely note that the EPA itself has \ndetermined that greenhouse gas emissions endanger the public health and \nwelfare of current and future generations, a determination that the DC \nCircuit resoundingly upheld.\n  But we are not in an ordinary situation. Pruitt has a long history of \ndoing the bidding of the fossil fuel industry. In the recent Frontline \ndocumentary, ``War on the EPA,'' Bob Murray of Murray Energy, a strong \nPruitt supporter, bragged about giving this administration a three-page \naction plan on environmental regulations and bragged that the first \npage was already done. That is the world we live in now, where the \nregulated industry brags that it controls its regulator, gives it \ndirection, and that its work is already being done.\n  Courts that look at any rule proposed by Scott Pruitt must recognize \nthat there is a near zero chance that he is operating in good faith. \nOur Nation's environmental regulator went in captured and has stayed \ncaptured by our Nation's biggest polluters. Scott Pruitt is not their \nregulator; he is their instrument. That is a conflict of interest.\n  I recently hosted my eighth annual Rhode Island Energy Environment \nand Oceans Day, bringing together members of our business community \nfrom the public sector, from government, and academia, to hear directly \nfrom experts about the latest environmental news and initiatives. I was \nvery excited to be joined by excellent keynote speakers, including \nformer Secretary of State John Kerry, who has done such magnificent \nwork on oceans particularly but on climate change generally, leading us \ninto the Paris climate agreement. Also, there was former U.S. Special \nEnvoy for Climate Change Todd Stern, who has labored in these vineyards \nso many years, and ocean advocate and Oceana board member Sam \nWaterston. They were all great, but one phrase stood out.\n  Sam Waterston called on us to tackle today's ocean and environmental \nproblems with what he called a ``battle-ready kind of optimism''--a \n``battle-ready kind of optimism.''\n  So let us go forward with a ``battle-ready kind of optimism'' to \nclean the polluter swamp at EPA, to clean our Earth's atmosphere and \noceans of unbridled carbon emissions, and to clear the reputation of \nour beloved country of the obloquy it is rapidly earning at the hands \nof a corrupting industry.\n  I yield the floor.", "turn": 5, "speaker": "Mr. WHITEHOUSE", "itemno": 9}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burr).

Mr. President, I rise to talk about the Children's Health \nInsurance Program. We all know that healthcare is the most important \nthing in any person's life and in their family's life, and there is \nprobably no healthcare issue that is more intense than a parents' \nconcern about the health of their children. I think all of the offices \nin this building have heard from parents about the health of their kids \nover the course of the number of months we have been debating what to \ndo about the Affordable Care Act.\n  I rise today to talk about another critical program, which I hope we \nwill act in a bipartisan way to reauthorize: the Children's Health \nProgram, or CHIP. CHIP builds on Medicaid, and it gives families who \nearn too much to be eligible for Medicaid an insurance option for their \nkids. In talking to families who avail themselves of this option--in \nVirginia, years ago we didn't do a very good job of enrolling kids in \nCHIP, and we have become an awful lot better at it. It is interesting \nto hear the way parents talk about it. They will often talk about how \nimportant CHIP is to them when their child is sick or when their child \nis injured, but what is interesting to me is how important it is to \nthem when their child is perfectly fine--not sick, not injured. But if \nyou are a parent, you are going to have anxiety when you go to bed \nevery night if your child doesn't have insurance or coverage: What if \nsomething happens tomorrow? This is a program that provides not just \nhealthcare but peace of mind for parents and their kids.\n  Between Virginia's separate CHIP program and the Family Access to \nMedical Insurance Security and CHIP-funded Medicaid, the State provides \ncoverage to nearly 193,000 children. CHIP alone--the specific CHIP \nprogram--covers 66,000 kids in Virginia and also pregnant moms; 1,100 \npregnant moms are covered right now. The coverage is important. It \nincludes doctor visits, hospital care, prescription medicines, \neyeglasses--which are critical to being successful in school--\nimmunizations, and checkups for kids up to age\n\n\n19, with minimal cost sharing and without premiums.\n  In Virginia, since 2009, when I was Governor, we extended CHIP to \nalso allow dental coverage. That has been really important to children \nand their families. The program is one of the success stories in this \nbody because it has been strongly bipartisan in support since its \ncreation in 1997. But as the President knows, this program expired on \nSeptember 30. Despite bipartisan work on the Finance Committee, we \nstill have not seen a reauthorization bill come to the Senate floor.\n  The uncertainty surrounding CHIP has already started to have an \ninfluence on my constituents and the constituents of every Member of \nthis body. According to our Virginia Department of Medical Assistance \nServices, the State will be forced to send letters on December 1, 2017, \nnotifying families that there is an impending loss of coverage. If \nthere is not a reauthorization bill done by that time, imagine the \nanxiety of all these families in the weeks before Christmas getting a \nletter in the mailbox saying that this CHIP program, which covers \n66,000 kids and 1,100 pregnant women, is about to expire. This will, at \na minimum, cause a great deal of anxiety and confusion, even if we then \ncome back and fix it. But if we don't fix it, obviously, the anxiety \nand confusion becomes much more catastrophic for the families.\n  After we send out letters on December 1 telling families that they \nhave to prepare for the elimination of this program, enrollment will \nfreeze on January 1. No new children can come into the program. By the \nend of January--and this differs in different States--Virginia will \nhave insufficient funds to continue the program. There are some States \nthat are already experiencing running out of the funds they have for \nthe program. Virginia has a little cushion, but that will take us only \nthrough the end of January if we don't reauthorize.\n  Here is something that makes matters worse in Virginia, and I think \nit is the case in most States. Our legislature is a part-time \nlegislature. The legislature is not in session. The legislature does \nnot come back in until January, and that will make it really difficult. \nWe can't find time for solutions before then because the legislature is \nnot in session. When the legislature comes back, that would be a lot to \nface in 2 weeks, which is when this program is going to expire.\n  Needless to say, the kids who use CHIP in Virginia are in all parts \nof the State. Just to give you some examples, the Hampton Roads area, \nthe second largest metropolitan area in the State--Virginia Beach, \nNorfolk, and the Northern Neck--has over 5,000 kids who rely on CHIP. \nIn far southwest Virginia, where my wife's family is from--Appalachia--\nnearly 6,000 kids rely on CHIP. It is a high poverty area, and in those \nparts of the State where poverty is high, CHIP is used in a very \nimportant way by families. The Shenandoah Valley, an agricultural area \nin western Virginia, has about 6,400 kids who rely on CHIP. There is \nnot a county, there is not a city in Virginia where there isn't a child \nand a pregnant woman who rely on this program.\n  On September 18--now to the good part of my talk, the positive words \nfrom my colleagues--Senators Hatch and Wyden introduced the bipartisan \nKeeping Kids' Insurance Dependable and Secure Act, which is a \nbipartisan compromise in the best traditions of this body, to extend \nthe CHIP program for 5 years to give States sufficient time to plan \ntheir budgets and make sure that families don't face the uncertainty \nrelated to getting notice letters saying that the program may \nterminate.\n  I rise today to urge my colleagues to strongly support bringing this \nbill to the floor and providing certainty to the families and children \nwho rely on CHIP. The possibility of all these families getting letters \non December 1 saying that the program is possibly going to expire is \njust a needless uncertainty, and we should try to avoid that if we can, \nnot just in Virginia but in every State.\n  My senior Senator, Mr. Warner, is also a strong supporter of the \nprogram. I will give him some props. When he was Governor of Virginia--\nhe preceded me as Governor--he was the one who focused on doing a \nbetter job of enrolling kids in the program. I give him credit for \nthat, and I will take credit for my teamwork and for adding dental \ncoverage to CHIP. But he was a great leader. He and I have together \nsent a letter to the Senate leader, Mr. McConnell, asking if he would \nbring a bipartisan bill to the floor quickly on behalf of Virginia's \nchildren.\n  This bill was bipartisan in its introduction, and with the number of \ncosponsors and the historic, bipartisan nature of support for this \nprogram, if we can get a floor vote on this bill, I think we can pass \nit today and send it to the House and do so in a way that we would \navoid the need to start sending out termination letters to families, \nneedlessly increasing their anxiety.\n  I will conclude by saying that if we can bring this to the floor, I \nthink we can get it passed. It is an urgent issue for children across \nthe country--and even more than children in some ways. The children \naren't wandering around every day thinking about their healthcare, but \ntheir parents are wondering every day, worrying desperately about their \nhealthcare. This would be a bill that would help both children and \nparents.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.", "turn": 7, "speaker": "Mr. KAINE", "itemno": 11}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, this week we are moving to confirm four \nFederal circuit judges. Because of that, it is a good week to talk \nabout the critical role the judiciary plays and actually about the \nunique power our Constitution gave the courts to do the job they are \nsupposed to do.\n  They are to provide a check and balance on the other two coequal \nbranches of government--the executive branch and the legislative \nbranch. Most importantly, the Federal judiciary provides Americans with \nan avenue with which to seek the rule of law, an avenue to know that \none is going to be impacted by what the law says and what the \nConstitution says. It is a fundamental right of how we conduct \nourselves, how we seek justice, how people should be able to make \ndecisions about their families and about their businesses and about \ntheir financial futures as well as their personal futures.\n  That is why judges who believe in the rule of law and what the law \nsays and what the Constitution says are so important and why it is \nimportant to have qualified and well-grounded judges--not just people \nwho are really good lawyers but people who have an appreciation for how \nimportant it is that others can absolutely rely on the law and the \nConstitution. Those can be changed. There is a way to change them, but \nthe way to change them is seldom on the Federal bench.\n  According to the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts, as of this \nmorning, there are 148 vacancies on the Federal judiciary. That \nincludes two vacancies on the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals. It \nincludes the circuit judges of whose nominations we have not yet fully \ncomplied and approved this week, but there are 148 vacancies--jobs that \nare to be filled for as long as the people are able to serve. That is \nwhy healthy judges, younger judges, and judges who are well grounded \ncan have such an impact for so long. The first major judicial \naccomplishment this year, in terms of the nominating process, was Judge \nGorsuch, who 29 years from now will be younger than three of the judges \nwith whom he is currently serving. These are decisions that will last \nwell beyond a Presidency and well beyond the tenure of the Senators who \nwill vote to confirm, and we have a chance to do that.\n  Of these judicial circuits, the Eighth Circuit is one my State of \nMissouri is in. As a matter of fact, the most recent data shows that \nwhile there are a handful of States in that circuit, one-third of all \nthe cases that had been filed in the Eighth Circuit from September 2015 \nto September 2016 had come from our State, and I imagine that number \nwill be about the same again this year. Reshaping the judiciary, \ngenerally, as well as what happens in the Eighth Circuit are important.\n  At the start of President Trump's term, 12 percent of all of the \npositions\n\n\nin the Federal judiciary were vacant. The Congressional Research \nService found that not since President Clinton took office has a \nPresident had the constitutional obligation to fill more judicial \nvacancies at the start of his term than President Trump. I, certainly, \nbelieve he made the right choice when he selected Judge Gorsuch to \nserve on the Court, and I have been enthusiastic about the other judges \nwhom he has nominated, including the four we have had a chance to talk \nabout and will continue to have a chance to talk about this week.\n  I think President Trump will continue to nominate judges who will, \nfirst of all, pay attention to the Constitution and what it says, who \nwill apply the rule of law, and will not legislate from the bench. \nThose three hallmarks of how this Senate should define, and how this \nPresident has so far defined, what a judge is supposed to do not only \ncan happen but can happen at this moment for--or at least as of January \n20--12 percent of the judicial positions, and that number will continue \nto grow as judges, for whatever reason, leave the bench as judges \ndecide to take early retirement. If at the end of the 4 years of this \nadministration we have filled all of the vacancies that will have \noccurred, we will have filled more than 12 percent of those lifetime \nappointments. So it is really important that the Senate act to confirm \nthese nominees and fill as many vacancies as are there to be filled.\n  Last month, the Federalist reported: ``Democrats are forcing more \ncloture votes than any early Presidency and demanding the full 30 hours \nof floor time per nominee that the Senate rules allow.''\n  Yesterday, at the press stakeout that we had outside of this room, I \nsaid that the Senate was designed to protect the rights of the \nminority, and that is a good thing. Just the fact that it would take 6 \nyears to replace the entire Senate means that the country has to stay \nfocused on one set of ideas if all of the Senators are going to reflect \nthat one set of ideas much longer than the 2-year opportunity to change \neverybody in the House. Also, the understanding that the Senate \nprovides that protection for minorities to be heard in a big and \ndiverse democracy like we have is a good thing. In the points that we \nwere making yesterday, I also said that the protections for the \nminority are always held onto, appreciated, and protected until the \nminority decides to abuse those protections. When that happens, the \nminority always loses the protection.\n  What we have had over and over again--47 times this year as compared \nto 1 time with President Obama for nonjudicial appointments, 5 times in \nthe entire first Obama year up until this time in October, I believe, \nno times for either President Bush, and 1 time for President Clinton--\nis that the minority has taken a judicial nomination or another \nnomination and said we are going to insist on 30 hours of debate \nbecause the rules allow for 30 hours of debate. Well, the rules allow \nfor 30 hours of debate for contentious nominees. The rules allow for 30 \nhours of debate when there is really going to be a debate. Last week, \nwe had 30 hours of debate on a judge, but 20 minutes were spent talking \nin support of him while zero minutes were spent in opposing him. The 30 \nhours that could have been used for other purposes was gone.\n  Frankly, I think that was the reason the 30 hours was demanded--so \nthe other work of the Senate had to be set aside so we could do the \nequally important work of letting the President put people in vacant \npositions that needed to be filled. That 30 hours will be changed if \nthe minority continues to abuse it. It has happened in the entire \nhistory of the Senate, but that is what happens when you abuse these \nrules that protect you and give you rights. It will happen again here \nif this does not change.\n  We see the same thing happening this week. We have had lots of time \nthis week--30 hours of debate, a final vote, and Democrats and \nRepublicans vote. In fact, regarding the judge I mentioned a minute \nago, 28 Democrats voted for that judge. There were 30 hours of debate, \nand not a single critical word was spoken in debate about the judge. A \nmajority of the Democrats and virtually all of the Republicans voted \nfor that judge. That is not an acceptable way to stop the Senate from \ngetting to the other work the Senate needs to do. This is not \nbasketball without a clock, where they used to effectively play the \ndelay game. The delay game got abused, and the clock became part of the \nsystem. The clock will run faster here, too, if our colleagues do not \nbegin to see the importance of what we do here.\n\n\n                       Nomination of David Stras\n\n  Mr. President, while these nominees have had cloture votes--again, \nPresident Obama, I think, only had one on a judge in his first year--\nthere is one nominee, Minnesota Supreme Court Justice David Stras, in \nthe Eighth District, which is the district again that Missouri is in, \nwho has had his nomination held up. There is a rule sometimes that has \nbeen used in the Senate--almost always if a judge is being replaced \nthat only affects your State--whereby a Senator can say: I am really \nopposed to that. In most of the history of the Senate, that kind of \nhold has been honored. It has not been honored on judges who represent \nanother State, many States, or will be a judge in the circuit for many \nStates just because they happen to come from your State.\n  The American Bar Association has said that Justice Stras is ``well \nqualified.'' It is its very highest rating. He received his bachelor's \ndegree, with the highest distinction, from the University of Kansas, \nwhich is another State in this circuit. He received his MBA from the \nUniversity of Kansas and his law degree from the University of Kansas. \nHe clerked on the U.S. Supreme Court before practicing law and teaching \nat the University of Minnesota. Not only was he appointed to fill a \nvacancy on the Supreme Court in Minnesota, but he was elected. In fact, \nhe was elected and received more votes than the person who is holding \nhis nomination received when he was elected to that job.\n  I urge my colleagues to not only support his nomination but to do \nwhat we need to do to get these nominees to the floor and let everybody \nexpress their opinion and be given the time needed to do that, not to \ncontinue to abuse the rules, not to continue to hold these important \nvacancies hostage to getting anything else done because we have 30 \nhours of debate in which nobody decides to come and debate.\n  By the way, if we want to continue to allow Senators to hold \nnominations in circuits that their States happen to be a part of, in \nthe Eighth Circuit, most of the work before that court comes from \nMissouri more than any other State. We would be glad to have an \nadditional judge, and there is nothing that would prevent that.\n  The right thing to do here is to let the nomination of a well-\nqualified person come to the Senate floor and be debated, if there is \ndebate to be had, and be voted on and to take one of those significant \n140-plus vacancies on the Federal judiciary and fill it with a person \nwho is well qualified, just like this week. In four other circuits, we \nintend to put three women and one man on those courts who will \nhopefully be able to serve long and well and will take their important \nphilosophies to the courts with them when they go.\n  I yield the floor.", "turn": 11, "speaker": "Mr. BLUNT", "itemno": 16}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, thank you.\n  As we heard my colleague from Missouri saying, we have a great \nopportunity this week to confirm four outstanding individuals to the \nFederal circuit courts. These nominees are well-qualified individuals \nwho have demonstrated a strong understanding of the proper role that a \njudge plays in our constitutional system.\n\n  I am especially pleased that we are considering three exceptionally \ntalented women for the Federal bench. Federal circuit court nominations \nare extremely important. Circuit courts sit directly below the Supreme \nCourt in our judicial system. Because the Supreme Court reviews \nrelatively few or a smaller number of cases, many times the circuit \ncourts have the last word in the majority of those cases, so it is \nessential that we have judges on the circuit court who will treat all \nlitigants fairly.\n  When I think about what I want in a judge, I think fairness is the \nfirst thing that comes to mind. We want someone who treats litigants \nfairly, who shows respect for our Constitution, our statutes, and the \ncontrolling precedents.\n\n\nWe need somebody knowledgeable in the law. That sort of goes without \nsaying but certainly is a top attribute of a judge. Every party before \nour Federal courts has the right to expect evenhanded, fair judges and \nfair justice from those judges who are handling their case.\n  Each of the four nominees being confirmed this week have a strong \nrecord and impeccable qualifications. They respect the rule of law. All \nwere given a high rating by the nonpartisan American Bar Association.\n  Yesterday I was very pleased to support Amy Barrett's confirmation to \nthe Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit. Despite obstruction by my \ncolleagues on the other side, I am pleased that yesterday we confirmed \nMs. Barrett, but I still have deep concerns about some of the debate \nand some of the questions that were raised about her religious beliefs \nthroughout the confirmation process.\n  The Constitution clearly states that there can be no religious test \nfor any Federal office. The Senate has a responsibility to consider \nqualifications and fitness for office of individuals nominated by the \nPresident, but that does not include an evaluation of a nominee's \nreligious beliefs. Our Constitution fundamentally protects religious \nliberty for all Americans. That principle is deeply rooted in our \nNation's history and allows individuals of all faiths the freedom to \nexercise their religious beliefs.\n  Ms. Barrett's credentials clearly demonstrate her ability to serve on \nthe Federal bench, which she will be doing, and I hope future nominees \nare questioned by this body on their record, their qualifications, and \ntheir jurisprudence, not on their faith.\n  Today we confirmed the nomination of Michigan Supreme Court Justice \nJoan Larsen for the Sixth Circuit, a supremely qualified individual. A \nformer clerk for Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, she served as a \nDeputy Assistant Attorney General and as a law professor at the \nUniversity of Michigan before joining her State's highest court, the \nsupreme court.\n  We are now considering the nomination of Colorado Supreme Court \nJustice Allison Eid for the Tenth Circuit. Justice Eid served as \nColorado's solicitor general and is a law professor at the University \nof Colorado. She clerked for Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas and \nwas appointed by Chief Justice John Roberts to serve as a member of the \nadvisory committee on Federal appellate rules.\n  Finally, we will consider the nomination of Stephanos Bibas to the \nThird Circuit. Mr. Bibas is a law professor at the University of \nPennsylvania and clerked for Justice Anthony Kennedy after earning \ndegrees from Columbia, Oxford, and Yale.\n  This is a supremely qualified slate of nominees, as their impressive \ncredentials make clear. My colleagues who are familiar with these \nnominees have given praise to these nominees in earnest and honest \ndiscussion, which very much lends itself to my support. Without \nquestion, their fitness for the Federal bench is evident.\n  The fact that Democrats have been holding up these qualified \nindividuals is totally misguided. We heard from Senator Blunt in his \nremarks about the numbers. There are currently 21 circuit court \nvacancies and 120 district court vacancies in the Federal judiciary. \nWhile the Senate has an important role in examining nominees to fill \nthese vacancies, Democrats have required virtually every potential \njudge to go through a time-consuming floor process that is simply not \nsustainable, even when there are no objections raised against the \nindividuals. In fact, Democrats have used political tactics to delay \nvirtually every one of President Trump's judicial nominees, \ncontroversial or not.\n  Every Senator has the right to vote against a judicial nominee if \nthey believe that person to be unfit or unqualified--we all have that \nright--but engaging in a de facto filibuster against virtually every \njudicial nominee is an abuse of the rules, I believe, especially when \nthe nominee has overwhelming bipartisan support.\n  The American people expect the Senate to confirm well-qualified \nnominees. They also expect us to advance a legislative agenda that will \nimprove our economy and our security. By filibustering against \nqualified nominees, Democrats are keeping the Senate from tackling our \nimportant legislative work.\n  Starting with Justice Neil Gorsuch to the nominees being considered \nthis week, President Trump has nominated mainstream judges who will \nserve our country for years in the judiciary. I commend the President, \nthe chairman, Senator Grassley, and the members of the Judiciary \nCommittee for their work in advancing these talented individuals. We \nshould confirm these judges and act promptly to fill other judicial \nvacancies.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  I yield the floor.", "turn": 13, "speaker": "Mrs. CAPITO", "itemno": 18}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cotton).

She is \ngoing to be voted on to serve on the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals. \nShe is an eminently qualified and exceptional nominee who has received \nwidespread, bipartisan praise and support.\n  Justice Eid has spent over a decade on the Colorado Supreme Court. \nBefore her appointment, she served as the Colorado State solicitor \ngeneral. In that role, she represented the State before both Federal \nand State courts. She also served as a tenured faculty member at the \nUniversity of Colorado School of Law, where she taught courses in \nconstitutional law, legislation, and torts. Justice Eid practiced \ncommercial and appellate litigation at Arnold and Porter. At the \nbeginning of her legal career, Justice Eid served as a clerk for Judge \nJerry Smith on the Fifth Circuit and as a law clerk for Supreme Court \nJustice Clarence Thomas.\n  Justice Eid was raised by a single mother, whom Eid credits for her \nsignificant personal and professional achievements. She earned a \nscholarship to Stanford and graduated with distinction and is a member \nof Phi Beta Kappa. Justice Eid received her law degree from the \nUniversity of Chicago, where she graduated with high honors and Order \nof the Coif. She has had an impressive legal career, and she has an \nimpressive life story.\n  In her long and celebrated tenure on the Colorado Supreme Court, \nJustice Eid has heard roughly 900 cases and written approximately 100 \nopinions. In 2008, 75 percent of Colorado voters retained Justice Eid \nto the Colorado Supreme Court.\n  Her nomination has also received wide, bipartisan support. As an \nexample, Justice Eid's former clerks, who noted that they ``come from a \ndiverse set of geographic, economic, cultural and political \nbackgrounds,'' wrote a letter to the Judiciary Committee supporting her \nnomination. Judges work closely with their law clerks every day. Law \nclerks understand a judge's deliberative process and approach to the \nlaw better than anyone. How did these clerks describe Justice Eid? They \nsaid: ``She never fails to provide her full attention and dedication to \neach individual case, mastering the relevant facts and carefully \nanalyzing the law, whether the text of a statute or the word of a \ncontract.'' Her law clerks also wrote that she goes ``where the law \ntakes her'' and that in their decade of collective experience in over \n900 cases, Justice Eid ``treats each case individually without any \npreconceived notion of desired outcome.''\n  The National Native American Bar Association also endorsed Justice \nEid. In their letter to the committee, they noted that she ``has \ndemonstrated deep understanding of Federal Indian law and policy \nmatters, as well as significant respect for the tribes as governments. \nSuch qualities and experiences are rare among nominees to the federal \nbench.'' They went on to note that ``while we do not expect that \nJustice Eid will agree with tribal interests on every issue, we also \nbelieve that she is immensely well qualified and we are confident that \nJustice Eid is a mainstream, commonsense Westerner who will rule fairly \non Indian Country matters.'' That is from the National Native American \nBar Association. I think ``mainstream, commonsense Westerner'' is the \nperfect way to describe Justice Eid.\n  Despite this bipartisan support and her professional achievements, \nall the Democratic members of the Judiciary Committee voted against her \nnomination in committee, and I suspect most of the minority will vote \nagainst her\n\n\nconfirmation when it comes up. That surprised me. Justice Eid received \na majority ``well qualified'' rating from the American Bar Association, \nan outside group who evaluates judicial nominees. My colleagues on the \nother side claim that this group's ratings weigh very heavily in their \ndecision to support or oppose a judicial nominee. In fact, my \nDemocratic colleagues claim that these ratings should carry a great \ndeal of weight with Senators, and they argue that the Judiciary \nCommittee shouldn't hold hearings on nominees who have not yet received \nABA ratings.\n  This week, we are voting on four circuit court nominees--including \nthree women--who received ``well qualified'' ratings from the ABA. The \nAmerican Bar Association rated two of these individuals unanimously \n``well qualified.'' Yet the vast majority of my Democratic colleagues \nvoted against the two nominees on whom we have already voted, and I am \nwilling to bet that the other two nominees will see similar opposition \nfrom my Democratic colleagues.\n  Why do my Democratic friends profess such admiration for the American \nBar Association's evaluation process and then vote against nominees who \nreceived the American Bar Association's ``well qualified'' rating? I \nwould like to see them put their money where their mouth is or maybe, \nbetter yet, their vote where their mouth is. If my colleagues believe \nso strongly in the ABA evaluations, they should start voting for \nnominees who receive ``well qualified'' ratings, but I suspect they \nwill not.\n  When the Judiciary Committee voted on Justice Eid's nomination, my \nDemocratic colleagues really stretched to find reasons to oppose that \nnomination. One of the chief reasons given for opposition to her \nnomination centered on a quote in a Denver Post article that said \nJustice Eid has ``earned a reputation of one of [the Colorado Supreme \nCourt's] most conservative members.'' I find that statement to be \nmisleading. Of the seven justices on the Colorado Supreme Court, \nJustice Eid is one of only two justices appointed by a Republican \nGovernor. To argue that she is somehow extreme just because she was not \nappointed by a Democratic Governor is very unfair.\n  Furthermore, the Denver Post published a subsequent article that \ndisagreed with this characterization. By contrast, the more recent \narticle stated that ``appointment by a Republican or Democrat does not \nalways dictate the ideology of the justice. . . . Even categorizing \njustices as either conservative or liberal is generally an error.'' I \nwould agree with the Denver Post on this point.\n  Justice Eid should not be evaluated by her ideological reputation \nbut, rather, by how she approaches issues before her judiciary. That is \nhow I have evaluated Justice Eid and other judicial nominees, and that \nis why I strongly support her confirmation today.\n  I am very proud to support the nomination of Justice Allison Eid. She \nis the third in a series of distinguished female circuit court nominees \nwe have had the opportunity to vote on this week. Her impressive \nexperience and numerous accomplishments speak to her qualifications for \nthis role. I commend the President for nominating these outstanding and \naccomplished women to our circuit courts. Justice Eid is an exceptional \nnominee, and her record overwhelmingly supports her nomination. As a \nresult, I will support her confirmation tomorrow, and I urge all of my \ncolleagues to do the same.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.", "turn": 15, "speaker": "Mr. GRASSLEY", "itemno": 20}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, this week we have been talking about some \nsterling nominees for our Nation's circuit courts of appeals. These are \nour intermediate appellate courts in the country, one step above the \ntrial courts where cases are tried and one step below the Supreme Court \nof the United States.\n  What most people don't realize is that the Supreme Court only decides \nroughly 80 cases a year. In other words, there is no guarantee that if \nyour case is tried in the trial court, it will go beyond the circuit \ncourt of appeals. So in many instances, our circuit courts are the \n``supreme court,'' or the court of last resort. These sterling nominees \nthat the President has nominated include Professor Amy Barrett, who \nyesterday was confirmed to the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals by a \nbipartisan vote of 55 to 43. For some reason, our friends across the \naisle have decided it is to their advantage to inexplicably drag out \nthe clock against a really accomplished scholar--and to boot, a mother \nof seven--but, of course, to no avail.\n  What is worse is our colleagues across the aisle have seemed to have \nforgotten some of their own priorities when it comes to judges. For \nexample, the senior Senator from Minnesota has said in the past: ``It \nis time to get women on the bench.'' Well, we just did that yesterday, \nand we are going to do it again. ``They should get an up-or-down vote . \n. . that is what women deserve.'' I would say that is what the \nPresident's nominees--whether they be women or men--deserve, but, \nunfortunately, that hasn't always been the case.\n  There is still time, however, for our Democratic colleagues to honor \ntheir previous statements and to put more women on the circuit courts \nwithout needlessly stringing them along with unnecessary delays.\n  Joan Larsen was the first. She was confirmed earlier today. She \nfulfills the desire of the senior Senator from Vermont to ``confirm \nwomen practicing at the pinnacle of the legal profession.''\n  That is certainly where Joan Larsen works. She has been a justice on \nthe Michigan Supreme Court and was nominated to the Sixth Circuit, \nwhich handles Federal appeals from Michigan, Kentucky, Ohio, and \nTennessee. Justice Larsen graduated first in her class from \nNorthwestern University's law school. She then clerked for the \nprestigious DC Circuit Court of Appeals, right here in Washington, DC. \nShe then went on to serve as a law clerk to Justice Antonin Scalia of \nthe U.S. Supreme Court.\n  Since then, she has worked in public service at the Office of Legal \nCounsel at the Department of Justice during the George W. Bush \nadministration and has taught at the University of Michigan Law School.\n  Both of our Democratic colleagues from Michigan have returned their \nblue slips, which is the piece of paper which says they are OK with the \nnomination going forward, signaling their approval. Given her \ncredentials, my question would be, How could they not?\n  Ms. Larsen will make an excellent judge. She already has been, but \nshe will make an excellent addition to the circuit court of appeals, \nand I am glad we have now confirmed her.\n  Another nominee is on the way. Justice Allison Eid of the Colorado \nSupreme Court has been nominated to the Tenth Circuit post formerly \nheld by Justice Neil Gorsuch, who was recently confirmed to the U.S. \nSupreme Court. The Tenth Circuit sits in Denver and includes Colorado, \nNew Mexico, Kansas, Oklahoma, Utah, and Wyoming.\n  As in the case of Professor Barrett and Justice Larsen, Allison Eid \nis exceptional in every respect. She attended Stanford University and \nthe University of Chicago Law School, where she was elected to the \nOrder of the Coif and graduated with high honors. She clerked for the \nFifth Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans and then went on to clerk \nfor Justice Clarence Thomas on the U.S. Supreme Court.\n  As with Justice Larsen, Justice Eid has received the blue slips from \nboth of her home State Senators, which means they are willing to let \nthis confirmation go forward. So I look forward to her quick \nconfirmation.\n  Finally, the fourth judge who will be confirmed this week is \nprofessor Stephanos Bibas, who teaches at the University of \nPennsylvania Law School. He has been nominated for the Third Circuit \nCourt of Appeals, which covers Delaware, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania. \nStephanos Bibas was educated at Columbia, Oxford, and Yale Law School. \nHe, likewise, clerked for the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals and then \nwent on to clerk for Justice Anthony Kennedy on the U.S. Supreme Court. \nHe has worked both in private practice and as a prosecutor. Now he\n\n\nhas distinguished himself as an academic, teaching and publishing in \nthe realm of criminal law and procedure.\n  In their ringing endorsement of his nomination, a diverse group of \nmore than 100 law professors noted Professor Bibas's ``fair-mindedness, \nconscientiousness, and personal integrity.'' Those are the sort of \nqualities we should all want in a circuit court judge.\n  We are going to confirm Stephanos Bibas and the other nominees I \nmentioned, no matter how long it takes, this week. The majority leader \nhas put our friends across the aisle on notice, and there is nothing \nthey can do to stop those confirmation votes before we call it a week.\n  Once again, the administration has demonstrated its skill at picking \nbright nominees for the right reasons. This week's nominees will read \nthe law faithfully. They will honestly interpret its text, and they \nwill apply it to cases with a sense of humility no matter what their \npreferred outcome might be.\n  I appreciate President Trump, Leader McConnell, and the chairman of \nthe Senate Judiciary Committee, Senator Chuck Grassley, for the hard \nwork in bringing these nominees to the floor. Now let's get them on the \nFederal bench.\n\n\n                               Tax Reform\n\n  Mr. President, the other issue I wish to bring up in my remarks today \nis tax reform, because we all know that the House of Representatives \nwill release the Ways and Means Committee's beginning bill for tax \nreform--something we have promised for a long time and that the country \nis anxiously awaiting.\n  This will be the culmination of months--if not years--of hard work, \nof meetings, white papers, listening sessions, and the like so that we \ncan deliver on our shared goal of a simpler, fairer tax system that \nboosts jobs and puts more money in the pockets of every American. Those \nare our goals.\n  We know that many hard-working Americans have had a rough time in \nrecent years. Sending their kids to college and securing retirement \nseems to be harder and increasingly out of reach for some of my \nconstituents back in Texas and people around the country. I hear about \ntheir concerns and their anxieties--economic anxieties--every time I go \nhome. It is not acceptable that 50 percent of Americans are finding \nthemselves living from paycheck to paycheck and that a third of voters \nare one trip to the mechanic shop away from a household financial \ncrisis.\n  Last week, several of my colleagues and I sat down with the \nPresident--we were members of a bipartisan group of the Senate Finance \nCommittee--and discussed our objectives in achieving meaningful and \nlasting changes to our Tax Code. The President agreed that we should \ncut taxes for hard-working Americans and that we should nearly double \nthe standard deduction, which reduces the number of people who will \nhave to itemize deductions on their tax return, thus, making compliance \nwith the Tax Code much simpler and cheaper. We agreed that we would \nsignificantly increase the child tax credit and reduce taxes on \nbusinesses and job creators.\n  This last objective--reducing taxes on businesses and job creators--\ndeserves a little bit more discussion.\n  Ireland represents an interesting point of comparison for the United \nStates. We have the highest tax rate in the world--35 percent for \nbusinesses that do business all around the globe. Ireland has a \ncorporate rate of 12.5 percent. That is 35 percent to 12.5 percent. \nBecause of that, it has become a haven for large American companies, \nespecially in the high-tech sector.\n  Ireland has since ended its so-called ``double Irish'' tax scheme, \nwhich allowed it to benefit from taxes on income that should have been \ntaxed in the United States. In other words, there is some rivalry and \ncompetition when businesses do business worldwide as to where their \nprofits will be taxed. We want to make sure that those profits are \ntaxed in the United States and not in countries abroad, where we would \nenjoy no benefit from.\n  This example illustrates what happens when we keep our tax rate so \nhigh. Sadly, companies leave. They go elsewhere, because they know that \nthe difference between a 35-percent tax rate and a 12.5-percent tax \nrate in Ireland may be the difference between making a profit for your \nshareholders--whether it is the teachers retirement system or the \nfirefighters pension fund--or ending up in the red and not making a \nprofit at all. Savvy companies will leave, and they will go elsewhere. \nThey know to create new entities and search the globe for better rates. \nIt is really a matter of their competitiveness in a global economy.\n  Of course, when they do this, it is legal. It is rational because \nthey want the best deal they can get for their shareholders. They also \nwant to make sure they can achieve a profit for their shareholders and \nnot a loss, frankly, due to the differential in tax rates.\n  When companies dodge U.S. taxes, it means we here in the United \nStates miss out on revenue that we would otherwise reap. One thing is \nfor sure. With $20 trillion in debt, we want to make sure that our Tax \nCode is fair and simple and is competitive and will help us grow our \neconomy in a way that will help us pay down those deficits and that \ndebt.\n  Now, our Democratic friends have been known to demagogue this issue a \nlittle bit, saying: Who wants to cut these corporate tax rates \noverseas? Corporations shouldn't get a tax cut, even though they know \nwhat the facts are.\n  Well, they should simply listen to people like Barack Obama. In 2011 \nhe was speaking to a joint session of Congress and called on \nRepublicans and Democrats alike to lower the U.S. corporate tax rate \nbecause he knew--and he was right--that this was hurting our global \ncompetitiveness in a global economy and that companies, out of sheer \nself-interest, were keeping the profits they had earned overseas rather \nthan bringing them back and suffering from double taxation, meaning \nthat workers here in the United States didn't get the benefit of that \ninfusion of extra cash in their paycheck, and the investment that \nshould occur here in the United States was occurring overseas strictly \nbecause of our Tax Code.\n  My colleague, the senior Senator from Oregon, described corporate \ninversions. That is what happens when an American company shifts its \nlegal address to a foreign country, such as Ireland, for tax purposes. \nHe called it a ``contagion'' that has affected the Tax Code with ``the \nchronic diseases of loopholes and inefficiency.'' He went on to call \nthe Tax Code an ``anti-competitive mess.'' He is right.\n  The senior Senators from Maryland and Ohio have also made similar \nstatements in past years.\n  We all realize that simplifying our Tax Code will reduce tax \ncompliance costs, which currently run for small business owners at \naround $19 billion a year. Our Tax Code has simply gotten to be too \ncomplex and too convoluted for honest, law-abiding small business \nowners to do it on their own. So they have to hire somebody else to \nhelp them sort it out.\n  The less money that a small business pays in tax compliance is the \nmore they can spend on their employees or on expanding their business \nor on investing in new equipment or simply giving their workers a pay \nraise. Let's give them the relief that they need. Let's reduce the \ncorporate rate, as President Obama and our colleagues on the other side \nused to argue for. With our proposals, we can also get moving on fixing \nthe rest of the Tax Code to let the hard-working people of Texas and \nAmerican families keep more of what they earn, improve their standard \nof living in the process, and to make our Tax Code more competitive in \na global economy so that businesses that operate internationally will \nbe incentivized to bring that money back here to the United States to \nmake and manufacture products that are stamped ``Made in America'' and \nto improve the wages and quality of life and income of American \nworkers. It just strikes me as a no-brainer, and that is exactly what \nwe are going to set out to accomplish to.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.", "turn": 19, "speaker": "Mr. CORNYN", "itemno": 24}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, thank you.\n\n\n\n\n\n                          Freedom to Negotiate\n\n  Labor unions and strong labor laws have helped build the middle class \nin America and protect the rights of workers for generations.\n  In the 1970s, union participation was around 30 percent, and it was a \ngolden era for the American middle class. Wages went up. Families had \nbenefits and vacations. Parents could pay for college. They could put \nfood on the table and have money left over. The vast, thriving middle \nclass was built on the blood and sweat of labor unions and those who \norganized the labor unions, often at their physical peril, back in the \nthirties.\n  Unfortunately, over the last few decades, union membership has \ndeclined and, along with it, middle-class wages and opportunities. In \nthe seventies, union membership was near 30 percent, but it had fallen \nto just 11 percent of all workers by 2014. That decline is mostly \nbecause the union movement and, concurrently, the middle class, with \nwhich it is allied, have been under attack from big corporate special \ninterests and the conservative movement for the better part of the last \nthree decades. It is well funded by a small group of very rich and, I \nmight say, greedy people, and it is patient.\n  Their goal is to, by any means necessary--Congress, the courts, \nwhatever--break up existing unions and prevent new unions from forming. \nThey will pursue any avenue in order to disrupt the ability of workers \nto organize and collectively bargain for a fair share of the profits \nthey create so that they can make an extra buck.\n  These forces will do whatever it takes to keep rigging the system in \ntheir favor, like asking the Supreme Court to rule on Janus v. AFSCME, \na case backed by the Koch brothers--$40 billion each, maybe more; \nplenty of money--but they hate giving any money to workers. And there \nis no record evidence of a single lower court ruling in its favor.\n  If anyone doubts the politicization of the Supreme Court, just look \nat their being willing to hear this case twice, which comes with a \ncrazy legal theory that a First Amendment basis should be used to \ndestroy collective bargaining. It is merely designed to eliminate the \nfreedom of people to come together in unions. If the Supreme Court \nendorses the arguments of Janus, it will be a dark day for the American \nworker.\n  Chief Justice Roberts, who said he would be fair and call balls and \nstrikes, in my view, has lost all pretence of fairness. He wants to \nkeep the Court nonpolitical, but he keeps pushing cases like this. \nSince his confirmation, under Chief Justice Roberts, the Court has \nmethodically moved in a pro-corporate direction in its constantly and \nconsistently siding with the big corporate interests over the interests \nof workers. Already, it has been the most pro-corporate Court since \nWorld War II. A decision in favor of Janus will be a shameful capstone \non that already disgraceful record.\n  I would say to all of those wealthy people who have plenty of money \nand to all of those corporate executives who get paid in the tens of \nmillions, who are desperate to take money away from middle-class people \nwhose incomes are declining, that you are creating an anger and a \nsourness in America that is hurting our country in so many different \nways.\n  American workers deserve a better deal, and Democrats are going to \noffer it. We are calling it freedom to negotiate. We are offering the \nmiddle class, and those who are struggling to get there, a better deal \nby taking on companies that undermine unions and underpay their \nworkers, and beginning to unwind a rigged system that threatens every \nworker's freedom to negotiate with their employer.\n  Our plan would, among other things, strengthen penalties on predatory \ncorporations that violate workers' rights; ban State right-to-work laws \nthat undermine worker freedoms to join together and negotiate; \nstrengthen a worker's right to strike for essential workplace \nimprovements; and provide millions of public employees--State, local, \nand Federal--with the freedom to join a union and collectively bargain \nwith their employers.\n  Over the past century, labor unions have fought to stitch into the \nfabric of our economy a basic sense of fairness for workers. Each \nworker left on his or her own has no power against the big corporate \ninterests that employ them, but together unions and workers who unite \nin unions can have some say.\n  No one taught me better about the lack of fairness than a 32BJ worker \nI met several years ago at the JFK International Airport, who was named \nShareeka Elliot. When I first met Shareeka, she was a mother of two \nchildren who was struggling to make ends meet. She was working the \ngraveyard shift cleaning the terminals at JFK and serving hamburgers at \nMcDonald's during the day. She was forced to rely on public assistance \nsince she had gotten so little in wages from those jobs. She lived in a \nhouse with six other family members to be able to pay the rent. She was \nnot a freeloader. She was working two jobs, but she got minimum wage \nand could hardly support herself. She barely saw her children and spent \nmost of her free time in getting to this job--this poorly paid, minimum \nwage job. She had to take a bus for 2 hours from East New York to the \nJFK International Airport.\n  She was not angry, by the way, as she was a churchgoing lady. She had \nfaith in God to provide, but she suffered so.\n  By the way, 30 years ago, if you had cleaned bathrooms at an airport, \nyou would have been employed by the airlines or by the terminal. But \nbecause these companies have learned to farm out the labor to \nsubsidiaries, to franchises, and to other corporations that have no \naccountability, now cleaning those toilets is a minimum wage job.\n  Over the last 4 years, though, I have seen Shareeka and her coworkers \nstart to rebuild their dreams. She said to me: Senator, if I only could \nget minimum wage, I might be able to take my kids out to a restaurant--\nI never could--or buy them toys for Christmas. I never could do that.\n  Shareeka joined the union, and they fought for a $15 minimum wage. In \nsome parts of the country, that may seem like a lot of money. In New \nYork City, I can tell you that it does not go that far. Costs are \nhigher. Shareeka was able to quit her second job and spend time with \nher daughters, like all parents want to do. Shareeka and her coworkers \nwon a union contract, and now they are able to gain the tools they \nneeded to protect themselves and do their work in a safer environment.\n  Shareeka is a metaphor for ``American workers,'' so many of whom have \nlost good-paying jobs that have gone overseas or that have been closed \ndue to automation. When they organize in these new types of jobs, they \ncan get the kinds of wages people used to get in the jobs that have \ngone away.\n  It is pretty simple: When workers have the freedom to negotiate with \ntheir employers, they have safer working conditions, better wages, and \nfairer overtime and leave policies. Shareeka's story is a testament to \nthat fact.\n  Our better deal, the freedom to negotiate, will do for so many \nAmericans what Shareeka's union did for her in New York. It will turn \nthings around for our country. Maybe middle-class wages will start \ngoing up, and maybe people will start having faith in the future again. \nWe Democrats--hopefully, maybe, joined by a few courageous \nRepublicans--are going to fight to get it done.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.", "turn": 23, "speaker": "Mr. SCHUMER", "itemno": 28}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I want to thank my colleague Senator \nBrown for leading the effort on the floor to speak out against the \nlatest attacks on union rights that are in front of the Supreme Court \nright now. I am very proud to join him to highlight the contributions \nunions have made to our middle class, to the economy, and to our \ncountry. I want to express my commitment to stand up against any \nattempts to undermine workers' rights to join a union and bargain \ncollectively.\n\n\n  Since day one, President Trump has broken his campaign promise, which \nwas to put our workers first, by rolling back worker protections and \nputting corporations and billionaires ahead of our working families, \nand now we are seeing corporate special interests doubling down on \ntheir attempts to undermine the rights of workers to band together. So \nit is critical now more than ever that we are committed to protecting \nour workers and their ability to advocate for safe working conditions, \nbetter wages, and a secure retirement.\n  Unions helped create the middle class in this country and helped a \nlot of our families in the last century become financially secure. But \nover the last few decades, as workers' bargaining power and union \ndensity have declined, we as a country have seen a decline in the \nmiddle class and a rise in income inequality in this country. As we all \nknow, too many families today are struggling to make ends meet. \nMeanwhile, corporations' profits are at an alltime high.\n  I will continue to fight back against any attempts by this \nadministration and by special interests to rig the rules against the \npeople who go to work every day.

Mr. President, I am here to speak out in favor of \nworking families and how we can empower American workers to obtain good \njobs, to secure a safe retirement after a lifetime of hard work, and to \ngive them the freedom to join together to negotiate for better pay and \nsafer working conditions.\n  Unions in the United States are important for our families and for \nour Nation's economy. Organized labor is one of the greatest forces \ndriving the middle class, which is especially important for our \nveterans and members of the military. Union jobs help provide our \nservicemembers and veterans with the economic opportunities that they \nhave earned. Union jobs help working moms and dads put food on the \ntable, and union jobs help power the engine of our economy--our middle \nclass. That is why I am working every day to protect the rights of \nworking people and why I stand shoulder to shoulder with organized \nlabor.\n  We must work together to combat the assault on the protections that \nworkers have fought so hard to secure. It is more important than ever \nthat we here in Washington work to expand economic opportunity for \nhard-working Americans, many of whom come from a union home. That means \npassing labor law reform to make it easier, not harder to join a union. \nThat also means expanding the use of project labor agreements for major \nconstruction projects and opposing efforts to repeal prevailing wage \nlaws. It also means defending the Davis-Bacon Act. The Federal \nGovernment can and should be a model employer that encourages companies \nto pay fair wages.\n  It is important to note the great progress that collective bargaining \nis making for all people. More families today have two working parents \nthan ever before, and women's growing role in our unions have increased \nto nearly half of the labor workforce. In Illinois alone, 44 percent of \nunion workers are women. The labor movement, which had a pivotal role \nin creating national minimum wage, the 40-hour workweek, overtime pay, \nand standards for workplace health and safety, is now also impacting \nwomen workers and their families in a significant way.\n  The collective voice that working Americans have is responsible for \nimproving sick leave and paid family leave policies at the State and \nlocal levels. These efforts can also lead to reducing our Nation's \nlong-lasting wage gaps between gender and race. Labor unions tend to \nraise wages and improve benefits for all represented workers, \nespecially for women, and women of all major racial and ethnic groups \nexperience a wage advantage when they are in a union. There is still a \nlong way to go in the wage gap fight, but unions are leading the way to \nmake those gaps smaller.\n  Unfortunately, organized labor is under attack. In Illinois, the \nanti-union surge is on the rise. Nationwide, so-called right-to-work \nefforts are growing. We need to be clear on one thing: These laws do \nabsolutely nothing to strengthen workers' rights, despite their \nmisleading names and rhetoric.\n  Make no mistake, opponents of organized labor are well funded and \nrelentless in advancing union-busting campaigns. We must work together \nand challenge these growing dangers to America's middle class.\n  The U.S. Supreme Court will soon decide a case that could determine \nthe future of American unions. A slim majority of conservative Justices \nmay hand down an anti-worker decision that would dramatically undo \nexisting precedent and sabotage the ability of unions to effectively \nrepresent hard-working, everyday Americans. Workers should not be able \nto reap all the benefits of union negotiations while refusing to pay \ndues that made those efforts possible. Make no mistake, a decision \nsanctioning this practice would strip away freedom from millions of \nAmericans. It would steal their freedom to join together to bargain for \nbetter wages, it would steal their freedom to join together to insist \non worker protections, and, ultimately, it would betray middle-class \nAmerica, which relies on organizing to effectively negotiate with \npowerful corporations.\n  Another way we can support our union workers is by making a serious \ninvestment in our Nation's infrastructure, which leads to more good-\npaying jobs and greater economic opportunity for working families. \nImproving our Nation's infrastructure is really just common sense. That \nis why I introduced a bill, which was passed into law, to cut redtape \nand reduce delays on construction projects in Illinois and our \nsurrounding States. Upgrading our transportation systems will help \nIllinoisans and all Americans who depend on our roads and transit \nsystems to get to work every day, as well as businesses that need our \nairports, highways, and our freight network to ship their products.\n  I am working each day to support our hard-working, middle-class \nfamilies. Through organizing, unions have become champions for working \nfamilies both in and out of the Federal Government.\n  I thank our union representatives for all the work they do for our \nfamilies, our communities, and our Nation.\n  Thank you.", "turn": 33, "speaker": "Ms. DUCKWORTH", "itemno": 40}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, last year, powerful corporate interest \ngroups actually stole a Supreme Court seat and handed it over to their \nhandpicked choice, Neil Gorsuch. Now those powerful corporate groups \nare about to use that seat to deal a devastating blow to hard-working \nteachers, firefighters, nurses, and police all across this country.\n  On September 28, the Supreme Court announced that it would hear a \ncase called Janus v. AFSCME Council 31. AFSCME 31 is a union \nrepresenting public sector workers in Illinois. This case will \ndetermine whether the public sector unions that represent teachers, \nnurses, firefighters, and police officers in States and cities across \nthe country can collect fees from all the employees in the workplaces \nthey represent.\n  Many expect that Justice Gorsuch will deliver the deciding vote in \nthat case, that he will force unions to represent employees who do not \npay dues and, in doing so, cut off sustainable funding for public union \norganizing.\n  Judges are supposed to be impartial, but there is no reason to expect \nthat Justice Gorsuch will be impartial in this case. On the afternoon \nof September 28--the very same day that the Supreme Court announced \nthat it would hear the Janus case--Justice Gorsuch attended a luncheon \nat the\n\n\nTrump International Hotel. And he didn't just attend an event at a \nhotel that makes money for the President. Nope. He gave the keynote \nspeech for a rightwing group funded by one of the Koch brothers and by \nthe Bradley Foundation--billionaires and wealthy donors who are pumping \nmoney into the people behind the Janus case.\n  It is no surprise that these rich guys want to break the backs of \nunions. After all, unions speak up, unions fight back, and unions call \nout billionaires who rig the system to favor themselves and to leave \neveryone else in the dirt.\n  What is at stake in the Janus case is basic freedom--the freedom to \nbuild something strong and valuable, the freedom to have a real voice \nto speak out, the freedom to build a future that doesn't hang by a \nthread at the whim of a billionaire. And just as the Supreme Court \ndecides to take up a decision that puts the freedom of millions of \nworking people in jeopardy, Justice Gorsuch shows up as the star \nattraction for a billionaire-sponsored outing to celebrate an \norganization that is sponsoring an operation to put workers' freedom on \nthe chopping block.\n  With this kind of brazen disregard for fairness and impartiality, it \nis no wonder that Gallup Polls have found that fewer than half of all \nAmericans approve of the way the Supreme Court is now handling its job. \nIn a shameless decision to abandon even the appearance of neutrality, \nJustice Gorsuch makes it clear that he is on the attack against \nAmerican unions and American workers.\n  In the Trump administration, workers have been under repeated attack. \nSince taking office, President Trump has signed several laws sent to \nhim by the Republican Congress, laws that directly undermine the wages, \nbenefits, health and safety of American workers. In just 10 months, \nthey have rolled back rules designed to make sure that Federal \ncontractors don't cheat their workers out of hard-earned wages. They \nhave delayed safety standards that keep workers from being exposed to \nlethal, carcinogenic materials. They have given shady financial \nadvisers more time to cheat hard-working Americans out of billions of \ndollars in retirement savings, and the list goes on.\n  This is a democracy, and in a democracy, the government in Washington \nis supposed to work for the people who sent us here. So why is it that \nthe Federal Government seems to be working against the interests of 150 \nmillion Americans who work for a living? Well, there is one reason--\nmoney.\n  Money slithers through Washington like a snake. Its influence is \neverywhere. There are obvious ways that we know about--the campaign \ncontributions from giant corporations and their armies of lawyers and \nlobbyists--but it is also the think tanks and the bought-and-paid-for \nexperts who are funded by shadowy money, whose point of view seems \nalways to help the rich and powerful get richer and more powerful.\n  Powerful interests invested vast sums of money in electing President \nTrump, and with each of his anti-worker actions, their investments are \npaying off. Powerful interests also spent vast sums of money to push \nFederal judges who will tilt our courts even further in favor of \nbillionaires and big businesses.\n  They did it when they spent millions of dollars to hold open a \nSupreme Court seat for over a year. They did it when they spent \nmillions more to promote Neil Gorsuch to fill that seat. Now that the \nCourt is poised to deliver a massive blow to public sector unions and \nworkers, their investment is paying off big time.\n  The stakes here couldn't be higher. Millions of teachers, nurses, \nfirefighters, and police officers are looking to the Court for a fair \nhearing of the case. They are holding out hope that their freedom to \ncome together and to stand up for themselves in the workplace, their \nfreedom to fight for higher wages, their freedom to fight for more \ngenerous benefits, and their freedom to fight for a better future for \nthemselves and their children will be preserved.\n  Unless we make real change, working people are just going to get \nkicked again and again, and we can make change. We can make the change \nright here in Washington. We can stand up and fight for our democracy, \nand we can start by demanding that everyone in our government is \naccountable, including the President of the United States and the \nSupreme Court of the United States.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.", "turn": 35, "speaker": "Ms. WARREN", "itemno": 42}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, 40 years ago, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled \nthat nonunion public workers who benefit from the work conducted by a \nunion to negotiate contracts that they benefit from should have to pay \na fee to cover costs associated with this work. If all workers benefit, \nit is only right that everyone contributes a fair-share fee.\n  However, in recent years, there has been a well-funded effort by \nspecial interest groups backed by corporate billionaires to dismantle \nunions and silence the voice of workers. There have been a number of \nattempts to overturn the 1977 decision in Abood v. Detroit Board of \nEducation. Other efforts have targeted State legislatures where they \nhave had success in many States. In other States like Pennsylvania, \nthese efforts were blocked.\n  Workers already have the right to decide whether to join a union. \nThey have the right to decide. It is common sense that if these workers \nbenefit from the higher wages and better working conditions that result \nfrom contract negotiations undertaken by the union, that those workers \nshould have to chip in for the cost of these negotiations. That is just \nfair. These negotiations get results and they benefit workers. They \nbenefit workers who are in the union and benefit workers who are not in \nthe union.\n  The right to bargain collectively has been an integral part of \nraising income and growing the middle class over the course of the last \ncentury. Being able to organize and bargain collectively allows workers \nto demand higher wages and salaries and of course boost their incomes. \nThese workers have more money to provide for their families, to \nincrease consumption, which in turn increases both production and \nemployment. Putting more money in the hands of workers is good for \nworkers and for the country.\n  Over the last several decades, we have seen the balance of power \nacross our Nation tilt more and more in favor of the wealthy and the \nlargest corporate interests at the expense of working Americans.\n  The Supreme Court has not been immune from this trend. Under Chief \nJustice Roberts, the Court has become an ever more reliable ally for \nbig corporations. A major study published in the Minnesota Law Review \nin 2013 found that the four conservative Justices currently sitting on \nthe Court--Justices Alito, Roberts, Thomas, and Kennedy--are among the \nsix most business-friendly Supreme Court Justices since 1946. So four \nof the six most business-friendly are serving on the Court at the same \ntime.\n  A review by the Constitutional Accountability Center--which is an \nongoing review and is updated with every case the Supreme Court \ndecides--shows the consequences of the Court's corporate tilt, finding \nthat the chamber of commerce has had a success rate of 70 percent in \ncases before the Roberts' Court--a significant increase over previous \ncourts.\n  These are all critical cases. These are cases of critical importance \nto everyday Americans. These are cases involving, for example, rules \nfor consumer contracts, challenges to regulations ensuring fair pay and \nlabor standards, attempts by consumers to hold companies accountable \nfor product safety, and much more.\n  Well-funded corporate special interests do not have the best \ninterests of working families at heart. They are pushing these efforts \nto reduce their bottom line by reducing the incomes of working \nfamilies.\n  That is why we are standing today to make sure that the voice of \nworking Pennsylvanians and Americans are heard. To increase incomes and \nstrengthen the middle class, we need to\n\n\nstop the assault on workers and labor unions, whether it happens in \nCongress or in State legislatures or, indeed, in the U.S. Supreme \nCourt.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.", "turn": 41, "speaker": "Mr. CASEY", "itemno": 49}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to speak in proud support of \nAmerica's workers--the men and women who build our cars and our homes, \nwho move American-made products across oceans, lakes, and highways, who \nteach our children every school day, who take care of our families when \nthey get sick, and who keep us safe in our communities. I have seen \nfirsthand the importance of unions, both in my home State, where I grew \nup, and across the country.\n  This is deeply personal for me. My father Herb was a public school \nteacher and an active member of the Michigan Education Association. My \nfather-in-law Raul was a proud member--and continues to be a proud \nmember--of the United Auto Workers.\n  My mother Madeleine found economic opportunity as a nurse's aide. As \npart of providing the best care possible to patients, she fought for a \nbetter workplace for her colleagues, and then she went on to help \norganize her workplace. She later served as a union steward with the \nSEIU.\n  My parents raised me in a middle-class, union household. They \ninstilled in me the need, both, to stand up for rights and to never \ntake those rights for granted.\n  Standing together for fair wages, safer workplaces, and better hours, \nMichigan's strong labor movement built the American manufacturing \nsector and a middle class that made the United States a global economic \npowerhouse.\n  My parents and their fellow union members embraced the union values \nthat built Michigan: the ability to earn a good life where you grow up, \nhard work, fairness, and looking out for your neighbor--whether it is \nyour neighbor on the assembly line or in your neighborhood. These are \nnot just union values. These are American values, and I learned to \ncherish them at a very young age. Now, I am sorry to say, these values \nare under attack, and I can't help but to take it personally.\n  This year we have seen new and unprecedented attempts to undermine \nour Nation's workers and their ability to collectively bargain. Earlier \nthis year, my Republican colleagues passed legislation to repeal \nFederal rules that simply required businesses to disclose previous \nworkplace safety and fair pay violations before they could contract \nwith the Federal Government. The reason for this rule was fairly \nstraightforward: We should not be sending taxpayer dollars to employers \nthat can't keep their employees safe or that cheat them out of their \nhard-earned dollars. Yet Republicans repealed the rule.\n  Now, across the country, we are seeing a wave of so-called right-to-\nwork legislation, which in practice means you can work more hours for \nless pay. In Michigan we are seeing the impact of this misguided \nlegislation.\n  Supporters of these policies told us that wages and job growth would \nincrease if Michigan just passed laws to crack down on union \nmembership. Well, Michigan has the law, but workers and their families \naren't seeing any of the promised benefits.\n  In the years since passage of the law, the economic data clearly \nshows that, yes, corporate profits are up but not wages. In fact, when \ncomparing Michigan to States that haven't attacked union membership, \nstudies suggest that we have fallen behind pro-union States when it \ncomes to worker pay.\n  I am deeply concerned by the ongoing efforts to implement national \nanti-union laws, including the Janus v. AFSCME case that the U.S. \nSupreme Court will rule on in the very near future. A negative ruling \nin this case would be a huge loss for American workers and would \nundermine the right to collectively bargain.\n  We should be doing everything we can to support American workers and \ntheir right to fight for better working conditions, fair pay, and the \nability to care for their families. Instead of attacking our Nation's \nlabor unions, we should be celebrating them.\n  For generations, unions have helped America build the world's most \nrobust middle class and a powerful economy, second to no other nation. \nUnions have not only helped workers to take home more pay and have a \nsafe place to work, but they have also built communities. Unions teach \ntheir members valuable skills and help them earn a secure retirement \nand have quality healthcare.\n  Big corporations are not trying to undermine unions because they are \nlooking out for newly hired employees. They are fighting against unions \nbecause of what unions stand for--the right to collectively bargain for \nbetter pay, increased workplace safety, hard-earned retirement \nbenefits, and quality healthcare.\n  I ask my colleagues to take a moment to consider our history and the \nhard-working men and women who built this great Nation of ours. Union \nmembers are our neighbors, our firefighters, our police officers, our \nteachers, our nurses, our brothers and sisters, our moms, and our dads. \nThey build our cars, our homes, and our infrastructure.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to honor these men and women by opposing \nany and all efforts to expand harmful policies designed to undermine \nAmerican workers.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.", "turn": 45, "speaker": "Mr. PETERS", "itemno": 53}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I wish to thank my colleagues for joining \nme on the floor today to stand with American workers. We organized a \ngroup of close to a dozen Senators who have heartfelt and strong views \nabout the dignity of work, who understand so well that workers are \nworking harder and smarter but earn less and less money, in spite of \ntheir hard work, in spite of their commitment.\n  I have been joined on the floor already by Senator Schumer from New \nYork, Senator Murray from Washington State, Senator Duckworth from \nIllinois, Senator Warren of Massachusetts, Senator Casey from \nPennsylvania, and Senator Peters from Michigan, and speaking after I \nspeak will be Senator Whitehouse of Rhode Island and Senator Merkley of \nOregon and Senator Durbin of Illinois. I thank them for standing up for \nAmerican workers.\n  People in Ohio and around the country, as I said, work harder, and \nthey work longer than ever, but they have less and less to show for it. \nOver the last 40 years, GDP has gone up, corporate profits have gone \nup, executives' salaries have gone up all because of the productivity \nof American workers. Again, GDP goes up, corporate profits go up, \nexecutive salaries explode upward. Workers are more productive, but \nworkers have not shared in the economic growth they have created. Hard \nwork just doesn't pay off like it did a generation ago.\n  It is no coincidence that over that same timeframe, we have seen \nattack after attack after attack on the labor movement. Corporate \nspecial interests have spent decades stripping workers of their freedom \nto organize for fair wages and for benefits. The case the Supreme Court \njust agreed to take up, Janus v. AFSCME, is yet another attempt to chip \naway at workers' power in the workplace.\n  These are public service workers. These are public schoolteachers, \nlibrarians, police officers, school nurses, firefighters, and postal \nworkers. They are not looking to get rich in these jobs. They are just \nlooking to be paid what they earn, the same as any other worker in this \ncountry.\n  Make no mistake, an attack on public sector unions is an attack on \nall unions. An attack on unions is an attack on all workers, whether \nthey belong to a union or not, and I mean all workers, whether you \npunch a timeclock or whether you fill out a timesheet or swipe a badge, \nwhether you make a salary or earn tips, whether you are on payroll, a \ncontract worker,\n\n\na temp, working behind a desk, cutting hair, working on a factory \nfloor, or working behind a restaurant counter. I mean all workers.\n  The fact is, all workers across this country--as profits go up, as \nGDP goes up, as executive compensation goes up, as workers get more \nproductive, all workers across this country are feeling squeezed. Work \ndoesn't pay off the way it used to.\n  We have seen what happens when workers have no power in the \nworkplace. Increasingly, corporations view American workers as a cost \nto be minimized instead of a valuable asset in which to invest.\n  Look at the news we got last month. This piece of news, when I \nmention this to some of my colleagues, when I mention it around the \nState of Ohio, peoples' mouths drop. The Bank of America, Merrill Lynch \ndowngraded the fast food restaurant Chipotle because the company pays \nits workers too much.\n  Remember what happened with American Airlines a few months ago. \nAmerican Airlines announced it was doing a companywide pay increase, \nand the stock market punished them by knocking their stock down. \nImagine that. So when a company wants to do the right thing, Wall \nStreet says: No, you are not going to do the right thing. Wall Street \nis saying: We want all the money. Don't give any of this money to \nworkers--workers making $10 or $12 or $15 an hour. Think about that. \nWall Street and Merrill Lynch didn't say they paid their workers too \nlittle, they paid their workers too much. That is why the labor \nmovement matters.\n  Pope Francis spoke about how unions perform ``an essential role for \nthe common good.'' He said that the labor movement ``gives voice to \nthose who have none . . . unmasks the powerful who trample on the \nrights of the most vulnerable workers, defends the cause of the \nforeigner, the least, the discarded.''\n  I just had the pleasure, for the last few minutes in my office, to \nspeak with Bishop Murry of Youngstown, OH, and we were talking about \nthe Pope and about steelworkers in Youngstown and about the struggles \nof workers and wages and layoffs and all the things that have happened \nto--where the winds of globalization have buffeted the workers in that \ncommunity. Bishop Murry, as does Pope Francis, understands what too \nmany in this town don't; that workers feel invisible, entire \ncommunities feel invisible. They feel like they are getting used and \nabused and some other words I can't say on the Senate floor.\n  What, exactly, is the point of creating economic growth if workers \ndon't share in it, if ordinary families still can't get ahead?\n  Everybody here loves to talk about tax reform and bring the corporate \nrate down, but nobody is talking about paying workers more or giving \nworkers more job security or what we should be doing--in working with \ncompanies and creating good jobs.\n  My legislation, the Patriot Corporation Act, says if corporations do \nthe right thing--if they pay their workers well, if they pay benefits, \nif they do the kinds of things American corporations should do--then \nthey get a lower tax rate because they have earned it.\n  We seem to have forgotten that all work has dignity. We have \nforgotten, as the Pope said, that ``the person thrives in work. Labour \nis the most common form of cooperation that humanity has generated in \nits history.'' Think about that. ``Labour is the most common form of \ncooperation that humanity has generated in its history.''\n  What Washington and Wall Street don't seem to understand is that \nworkers drive our economy, not corporations. You focus on the middle \nclass, you grow the economy from the middle out, not cut taxes on the \nrichest people and expect the money to trickle down into more money in \nworkers' pockets and more people are hired. You grow the economy by \ntreating workers well, by investing in workers. That is why we need \nunions to ensure that we spread economic growth to the people creating \nit, to the people working too many hours for too little pay.\n  I think about workers like Stephanie in Columbus. She has worked for \n25 years as a childcare attendant for students with special needs. She \nwrote, saying: ``Every day I wake up before the sun rises to prepare \nfor three daily shifts aiding students with special needs on their way \nto and from school.''\n  That is the person whom--because she belongs to a union, that is the \nperson whom corporate America, that the rightwing of the Republican \nParty wants to attack? That is the kind of person--Stephanie in \nColumbus--they want to attack?\n  She worries that cases like this that undermine her union ``could \nseverely limit our voice on the job and hurt our ability to best serve \nthe children we care so much about.'' She said: ``Unions provide a \npathway to the middle class for all people.''\n  Think about a janitor I met in Cincinnati. I was speaking at a \ndinner. There was a table down front with seven middle-age women--a \npretty diverse group. There was one empty seat at the table. It was \ntold to me by some others that this group of women were janitors, \ncustodians in downtown Cincinnati, southwest Ohio, and these women had \nsigned their first union contract with downtown Cincinnati business \nowners. So there were 1,200 janitors working in these downtown \nbusinesses--in these big buildings downtown--and they had signed their \nfirst union contract.\n  I asked if I could sit at their table, and they said yes. I said to \nthe woman next to me: What is it like to have a union?\n  She said: I am 51 years old, and this is the first time I will have a \n1-week paid vacation in my life.\n  Think about that. We don't think--I am guessing that most of my \ncolleagues think: Well, you know, people have paid vacations and people \nhave paid sick leave. Well, much of the country doesn't, No. 1; and No. \n2, those who do often have that because they had a strong union--a \nunion that negotiated sick leave pay for them, a union that negotiated \nvacation days for them, a union that negotiated family leave for them, \nand then, when those workers at a company get it, the other \nnonunionized workers and companies get it, and then those companies \ncompete with other companies.\n  So the fact is--there is a bumper sticker that says: ``If you enjoy \nyour weekend, thank a labor union.''\n  Labor unions brought to this country things like weekends and more \nleisure time and decent pay and all that. That is why unions matter. \nThat is why this decision in the Supreme Court matters.\n  If the Supreme Court rules against AFSCME, it will starve the union \nfor resources they use to organize and grow and advocate for more \nworkers. At the risk of being disrespectful, it would be nice if those \nnine members of the Supreme Court would follow the admonishment of Pope \nFrancis, the words of Pope Francis, who admonished his parish priests \nto go out and smell like the flock. Find out where people live and \nwork. Find out what people do.\n  Find out the living conditions of people.\n  Abraham Lincoln in the White House one day was talking to his staff. \nHis staff said: You have to stay here in the White House. You have to \nwin the war. You have to free the slaves. You have to preserve the \nUnion.\n  Lincoln said: No, I have to go out and get my public opinion baths.\n  It could be important if the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court--who \nhas an Ivy league education, went to the best colleges and the best law \nschools, grew up in a wealthy family, has done very well as a \nprofessional, and is a very smart man--if he would go out and smell \nlike the flock, if he would go out and get his public opinion bath, \nmaybe he would hear some stories, as I have heard in my time in the \nSenate.\n  He would hear stories from people who talk about how important it is \nthat Stephanie has union protection. He probably has never really \nthought much about the fact that janitors, who have worked 30 years as \njanitors--35 years for some of those women--but never had a paid day \noff, never had a paid vacation. He might learn something from them and \nthink a little differently about this.\n  If the Supreme Court rules against AFSCME, it is the opposite of what \nwe need. We should be making it easier, not harder, for workers to come \ntogether and negotiate. That is why, this week, I am introducing \nlegislation to strengthen the National Labor Relations Act, to make it \nharder for employers to deny workers the freedom to collectively \nbargain by playing games with their job titles and classifications.\n\n\nInstead of stacking the deck even further in favor of corporate CEOs, \nwe need to make it easier for workers to organize. That is how we make \nhard work pay off.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.", "turn": 49, "speaker": "Mr. BROWN", "itemno": 57}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, the Janus decision coming up in the \nU.S. Supreme Court, which Senator Brown has just spoken about, is one \nthat merits the attention of people who are concerned about the country \nand the Court.\n  I wish to make two points in my remarks. The first has to do with the \nvery difficult to explain--or at least very difficult to comfortably \nexplain--pattern of 5-to-4 decisions of the U.S. Supreme Court, in \nwhich the five consist entirely of Republican appointees.\n  The Supreme Court makes a lot of decisions, of course. But there is \nsomething that is particularly interesting about the 5-to-4 decisions, \nwhere the five Republican appointees line up and roll the other \nappointees. When we start looking at those decisions, there are some \nreally significant patterns that emerge. The first pattern goes to \nissues in which the court is treading into the world of politics.\n  Bear in mind that when Sandra Day O'Connor left the Court, it lost \nits only member who had ever run for office. What Justice O'Connor left \nbehind was the first Court in the history of the United States that had \nexactly zero experience with elections and politics. There has never \nbeen as ignorant and green a Court in the history of the United States \nwhen it comes to politics; yet there has rarely been a Court so \nflagrantly eager to jump into politics and make very consequential \ndecisions.\n  When we look at the 5-to-4 decisions--which I think are probably the \nbulk of those--each one aligns with the political interests of the \nRepublican Party--each one. It is not one or two or even three. It goes \non and on and on.\n  The oldest one in the series is probably Vieth v. Jubelirer, which \nwas the decision in which the five Republicans said: This whole \ngerrymandering thing is just too difficult for us. We are going to \ndeclare open season. There is going to be no judicial remedy. We can't \nfigure out one, so we don't have one.\n  It is not just me who is saying that. The ABA section on election law \nsaid in its volume: Look, basically, it is game over for court review \nof gerrymandering. What immediately happened after that was the \nRepublican Party went to work with that green-light signal and did the \nREDMAP project, which created massive, bulk gerrymandering through the \nbattleground States. This was not an easy plan because, in some cases, \nthey had to spend millions of dollars to win one or two State \nlegislative seats, so they could then control the State legislature, so \nthey could then change the districts consistent with the bulk \ngerrymandering scheme.\n  The result is what happened in States like Senator Brown's, where, \nwhen he was reelected, he was on the ballot with President Obama, who \nwas also reelected, and the majority of the votes cast in his State for \nMembers of Congress were cast for Democrats, but against that \nbackground, many more Republicans than Democrats actually went to \nCongress in that election.\n  A similar thing happened in Pennsylvania. My recollection is that on \nthe same set of facts, Senator Casey, a Democrat, was reelected; \nPresident Obama, a Democrat, was reelected; a majority of Pennsylvania \nvotes were cast for Democratic Members of Congress; the delegation was \n13 Republicans and 5 Democrats. Somebody is messing around, and it was \na 5-to-4 Republican Supreme Court that opened that can of worms and \nunleashed REDMAP on the political landscape.\n  They have a chance to review that now. Senator McCain has written a \nbipartisan brief asking them to wake up and smell the coffee about what \nhas gone wrong here. We will see if they do or not, but, clearly, that \nwas a decision that benefited the Republican Party's polls, and, \nclearly, it was 5 to 4.\n  Then you go to the Voting Rights Act cases. There were two of them. \nIn the first one, Bartlett v. Strickland, the five Republican members \nteed up a new standard, which they mentioned, but they didn't really \nact on it. Then, when it came to the home run pitch, Shelby County v. \nHolder, they created this new theory about which very conservative \njudges, like Posner, said that, basically, it stands on thin air. It \nhas no basis whatsoever in any real legal theory. They knocked out the \npart of the Voting Rights Act that requires States with a wretched \nhistory of abuse of minorities and Democratic voters at the polls to \nget preclearance from the Department of Justice or from a court before \nthey can change their State laws to scare people or keep people away \nfrom the polls.\n  With that knocked out, guess what. All these legislatures across the \nSouth went straight to work. They passed law after law after law to \ndeny people access to the polls, and over and over again, the courts \nthat reviewed those and the appellate courts that reviewed the district \ncourt decisions found that the laws had been intentionally \ndiscriminatory, that the legislature had intended to keep people away \nfrom the polls, that they had intended to discriminate against Democrat \nand minority voters, and that they had chosen to do that deliberately.\n  Of course, you can go back after all that litigation and clean it up \nand try to get the laws stricken and all of that. But in the meantime, \nyou have had election after election in which the effect at the polls \nwas had.\n  They couldn't have been more wrong about the notion that if you \nlifted the preclearance requirement, everybody was going to be fine. \nThose were just the bad old days; it was a whole new America; racism \ndidn't exist; efforts by one party to keep the other parties away from \nthe polls weren't anything to worry about. Move along, move along; \nnothing to see here, folks. They were just plain dead wrong. They had \nabsolutely no clue, and they have been proven dead wrong since. But, \nagain, both of those cases were 5 to 4, all Republicans together.\n  Then, of course, the big whammy came when the big special interests \nthat so often are the core backers of the Republican Party decided that \nthey felt really constrained by having to live under campaign finance \nlimits. They wanted to be able to spend unlimited money in elections. \nWell, that is fine. It reminds me a little bit of the story of the \nFrench philosopher who touted the majesty and equality of the French \nlaw, which forbid both rich and poor alike from sleeping under bridges \nand begging for bread. Well, guess who actually sleeps under bridges \nand begs for bread. It is not rich and poor. And guess who can take \nadvantage of a rule that you can spend unlimited money in politics. \nOnly those who meet two conditions: One, they have unlimited money to \nspend, and, two, they have a good reason to spend it. In other words, \nreally big special interests.\n  The Court's decision, presuming that this spending was going to be \neither independent or transparent, has been turned into a mockery by \nevents since. They obviously did not know what they were talking about. \nFacts have borne out that they did not know what they were talking \nabout. They were completely dead wrong.\n  Interestingly, since then, despite the presumption of their decision \nhaving been cut completely out from underneath it, the Court has shown \nno interest in a correction. They have shown no interest in correcting \ntheir error. They seem completely happy, the 5 to 4--the five \nRepublican appointees--completely happy to have the landscape of \nAmerican politics polluted with this money.\n  There again, it wasn't just one decision. It was a bunch of them. \nCitizens United was the big one; Tradition Partnership, Inc. v. Bullock \nanother; McCutcheon v. FEC yet another; Davis v. FEC yet another; \nArizona Free Enterprise Club's FreedomClub PAC v. Bennett yet another--\nall 5 to 4, all the Republicans lining up, all throwing out precedent \nor laws that had stood for 100 years.\n  So Janus fits right into this pattern of 5-to-4 decisions. Indeed, it \nis actually a little bit worse because something weird happened early \non when one of those 5 to 4--the Republican five Justices on the \nSupreme Court--signaled to the corporate supporters of\n\n\nthis ideology that he was interested in taking a whack at unions in a \nparticular way.\n  There is a pet peeve of the union-busting rightwing and the corporate \nsector, which was a decision from 1977 called Abood v. Detroit Board of \nEducation. That decision allows unions to collect some dues from \nnonmembers on the grounds that their work for their members has benefit \nto other members. So you break out their wages work, which helps \neverybody, from their political work, which you can disaggregate from, \nand it allows you to collect certain dues--not complete dues, but \ncertain dues--from nonunion members. What Abood did was to help unions \nkeep revenues from the service that they give to nonmembers who benefit \nfrom their work. Without that rule, employees would be encouraged to be \nfree riders and just get the benefit of what the union is doing without \nmaking any contribution to support it whatsoever. Of course, if that \nwere to happen, the balance of power between corporations and unions \nwould shift further toward corporations.\n\n  The story is told quite well in the New York Times by a reporter \nnamed Adam Liptak, who is a Supreme Court reporter. I will read his \nstory.\n\n       In making a minor adjustment to how public unions must \n     issue notifications about their political spending, Justice \n     Alito digressed to raise questions about the \n     constitutionality of requiring workers who are not members of \n     public unions to pay fees for the unions' work on their \n     behalf. . . . Justice Sonia Sotomayor saw what was going on. \n     ``To cast serious doubt on longstanding precedence,'' she \n     wrote in a concurrence, ``is a step we historically take only \n     with the greatest caution and reticence. To do so, as the \n     majority does, on our own invitation and without adversarial \n     presentation is both unfair and unwise.''\n       Michael A. Carvin, a leading conservative lawyer, also saw \n     what was going on. He and the Center for Individual Rights, a \n     libertarian group, promptly filed the challenge Justice Alito \n     had sketched out.\n\n  I would say that he had invited.\n\n       Indeed, Mr. Carvin asked the lower courts to rule against \n     his clients, a Christian education group and 10 California \n     teachers, so they could high-tail it to the Supreme Court.\n\n  Let me interrupt my reading of the story for a second and make the \npoint that this lawyer wanted to lose his case in the lower courts. It \nis rare for lawyers to go into a court wanting to lose. You have to \nhave kind of a weird motive to take a case into court that you want to \nlose. The obvious motive here is that Mr. Carvin had heard the signal \nfrom Justice Alito that he was willing to rule his way if he would just \nbring the right case. So it didn't matter whether he won or lost. \nLosing is actually quicker. It gets you right up to the Supreme Court. \nHe is not interested in litigating the matter truly on the merits; he \nis only interested in getting as quickly as possible to the Supreme \nCourt. Why? Because he knew that 5 to 4, he would get the right \ndecision.\n  When you are a lawyer, the most sickening feeling you can have is to \ngo into court with the belief that the judges you are going to argue \nbefore are prejudged against you. The confidence that Carvin must have \nhad to want to lose a case deliberately below so that he could hightail \nit at high speed up to a court that he knew was going to rule his way \nbecause they told him they would--that is not American justice in the \nway it should be delivered.\n  As it turned out, they took up the case. It was called Friedrichs. It \nwas going to be 5 to 4, just as expected, and then Justice Scalia \nunexpectedly passed away. If you read about how the press took that, it \nwas very clear that the fix had been in on this case.\n\n       ``Corporate America had high hopes,'' the Journal said, \n     because ``the Supreme Court appeared poised to deliver long-\n     sought conservative victories.''\n\n  Since when should a court be poised to deliver long-sought \nconservative victories, not fair, dispassionate adjudication? But that \nis the reporting of the friendly Wall Street Journal. And those long-\nsought conservative victories were going to take the form of `` `body \nblow[s] that business had sought against consumer and worker \nplaintiffs.' The cases `had been carefully developed by activists to \ncapitalize on the court's rightward tilt.' ''\n  Come on. This is not adjudication any longer; it is just the exercise \nof political power. And these 5-to-4 partisan decisions by the Supreme \nCourt are degrading the reputation of the Supreme Court, they are \ndegrading the integrity of the Supreme Court, and they are degrading \nthe role of the judiciary in our vaunted scheme of constitutional \ngovernment in the United States of America.\n  With that, I yield to my distinguished colleague from Oregon.", "turn": 53, "speaker": "Mr. WHITEHOUSE", "itemno": 61}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, our Nation was founded on a powerful \nprinciple encapsulated by the first three words of our Constitution: \n``We the People.'' We are meant to be a nation, in the words of Abraham \nLincoln, ``of the people, by the people, and for the people,'' not a \nnation by and for the most powerful, not a nation by and for the most \nprivileged. Yet time and time again, we are seeing a complete and total \ncorruption of the vision of our Constitution.\n  We saw this earlier this year with one TrumpCare bill after another \ndesigned to rip healthcare away from 20 to 30 million Americans to \ndeliver tax giveaways to the richest in America. We have seen it just \nrecently in the consideration of a budget that reversed that and said \nthat in order to give $4.5 trillion of tax giveaways almost entirely to \nthe richest Americans, we will take $1 trillion out of Medicaid and \nhalf a trillion out of Medicare. We have seen this powerful conversion \nof standing our Constitution on its head, and now we have the Supreme \nCourt fully participating in this effort in a case called Janus v. \nAFSCME. It is the very epitome of the principle of a nation so \ncorrupted that it honors the opposite of what our Constitution stands \nfor.\n  The sole purpose of this case, Janus v. AFSCME, is to undercut the \nability of workers to organize. This is an assault on the freedom of \nworking Americans to associate with their coworkers. It is an assault \non the freedom of working Americans to negotiate a fair wage. It is an \nassault on the freedom of Americans to fight for fairer benefits and a \nsafe workplace. Bottom line: It is an assault on the freedom of workers \nto participate in the wealth they work so hard to create.\n  In short, this is the right to exploit that our Supreme Court--\nmajority of five--is so determined to elevate. I have read the \nConstitution, and I have never seen embedded in it a right to exploit, \na right to cheat, a right to take advantage of. Yet here is the \nmajority of the Court prepared to fight for exploitation on behalf of \nthe 1 percent of Americans at the very top.\n  The key strategy in this case is to attack the finances of workers \nwhen they organize. Former President Jimmy Carter once said: ``Every \nadvance in this half-century--Social Security, civil rights, Medicare, \naid to education, one after another--came with the support and \nleadership of American labor.'' It has been workers banding together to \nsay: We can create a better foundation for families to thrive. And that \nhasn't just created a better foundation for those who belong to unions; \nit has created a better foundation for all workers. We saw them \nsuccessfully band together and fight for a 40-hour workweek, fight for \nminimum wage, fight for sick leave, and fight for healthy and safe \nworking conditions--again, benefits that every worker enjoys because \nworkers were able to organize and fight to receive and win these \nprovisions.\n  What is really going in the Janus case? Any organization, in order to \nfunction, has rights and responsibilities. Rights are the rewards you \nget for participating, and responsibilities are the requirement that \nyou be part of the team and you contribute to the effort.\n  When I was small, probably just 2 or 3 years old, my mother had a \nbook she would read to me that involved the animals in the barnyard. \nAnimal after animal was asked to participate in making the bread, and \nanimal after animal turned it down, but when the bread was baked, they \nwanted a full share even though they had refused to participate in the \neffort to create it. This is what Janus is all about. It is about the \nright to the rewards, divided from any responsibility to get the work \ndone.\n  When workers organize, they say: We are going to have to be able to \nhave the finances to drive this organization, and to do that, we need \nto have every worker contribute a fair share. Those fair share fees \nmean that all the workers\n\n\nare in it together, they are all contributing, and they all benefit \nfrom the rewards.\n  Forever, the courts have said: Yes, with the reward goes the \nresponsibility. That is true of any organization. It is fundamental in \nhow organizations work. If you don't show up here on the floor, you \ndon't get to vote. Every organization has its responsibilities that go \nwith its rewards. But the 1 percent have chosen a strategy that says: \nWe will take one organization in America--and that is workers \norganizations--and we will drive an absolute wedge between the \nresponsibility and the reward.\n  These fees that we are talking about, these fair share fees, are not \nfees that go to political purposes. They don't go to donations to \ncandidates. They don't go to organizing campaigns walking door-to-door \nfor candidates. They don't go to advertising on the television or the \nweb. They are simply the cost of having a team that works to negotiate \nan agreement with a company.\n  I find it absolutely evil that a majority of the Supreme Court is \nexcited about embracing this right to exploit other workers by saying \nin this one case in America, you get the rewards without the \nresponsibilities. If the Court was applying that to a stockholder in a \ncompany, the equivalent would be to say that the stockholder doesn't \nhave to contribute to the costs of the management of the corporation, \nso they can demand back their share of what the management spends on \ntheir salaries, on their office spaces, on their private jets, and on \ntheir trips to do whatever they do, of the time they spend negotiating \nacquisitions to build the size of the company or striking deals to sell \ntheir products. That would be the equivalent, that a stockholder gets \nthe rewards of all of that negotiation without having to participate in \nthe cost. But this is not a situation in which five Justices want to \napply consistent principle because their goal isn't to honor the \nConstitution, and their goal is not fairness; their single goal is to \ndemolish the ability of workers to organize, to get a fair share of the \nwealth they work to create.\n  We can see that already our Nation is in trouble on this principle. \nFor the three decades after World War II, we had workers who had the \nstrong ability to organize and demand a fair share, and we saw a \nrevolution in the prosperity of workers in those three decades from \n1945 through 1975. Individuals who had lived in shacks, individuals who \nhad been wiped out by the Great Depression suddenly were able to buy, \non a single worker's income--it didn't even take two incomes--a three-\nbedroom ranch house with a basement and a single-car garage and were \nstill able to save money for an annual camping trip and perhaps to save \nsome to help their children launch themselves into life. That is what \nwe had when workers got a fair share.\n\n  Yet, in the midseventies, the multinational companies said: Do you \nknow what? Let's undercut the American worker by making our goods \noverseas in China and importing them. That way, we will demolish the \njobs here in America, and we, the company, will have made things at the \nlowest price in the world, have sold them at the world market price, \nand have made a lot more money. This strategy worked for the \nmultinational companies. They made vast sums of money for their \nstockholders and for their executives.\n  This application of different rules for foreign workers and domestic \nworkers really gave a huge advantage to our competitor overseas and to \na company that spanned both shores and could move its production \noverseas. So we saw the loss of 50,000 factories; we saw the loss of 5 \nmillion factory jobs; we saw the loss of an enormous number of supply \nchain jobs; and we saw, without those payrolls being spent in the \ncommunity, an enormous loss of retail jobs in the community, but it \nmade the wealthy wealthier, and that was the goal of the strategy.\n  So here we are, facing this case that will come before the Court \nlater this year, but the members of the Court have, essentially, \nalready declared their positions. Four members of the Court were on the \nprevious version of this when the Court tied 4 to 4, and Neil Gorsuch, \nwho was added to the Court, has been very clear on which side of this \nhe stands.\n  Should we put an asterisk by Neil Gorsuch's name? Should a 5-to-4 \ndecision, with Gorsuch being in the majority, even carry weight here in \nour society? This is the seat that for the first time in U.S. history \nwas stolen from one President and delivered to another. The majority of \nthis body right here stole the seat, undermining the integrity, \ndishonoring the oath, the responsibility for advice and consent, and \ndamaging the legitimacy of the Supreme Court. It was done because it \nwas a strategy to enable the 1 percent to rip off ordinary working \nAmericans. The prize for that was a position on Citizens United that \nnow allows the wealthiest Americans to continue to fund campaigns \nacross this country to drown out the voices of ordinary people and a \nposition on this case, the Janus case, that says that we will take one \norganization in America, that of the workers, and divide the rewards \nfrom the rights.\n  We know who is behind this strategy. It is the Koch brothers through \ntheir organizations, the National Right to Work Foundation and the \nLiberty Justice Center. They were behind the strategy for the theft of \nthe Supreme Court seat. They were behind the massive increase in third-\nparty spending that polluted the campaigns across this country. They \nare behind this strategy to destroy the vision that is embedded in our \nConstitution.\n  Eleanor Roosevelt once said: I am opposed to this legislation because \nit gives employers the right to exploit. Eleanor Roosevelt was a real \nchampion for workers, and she called a spade a spade. The right to \nexploit is not a right that any Member of this body should pursue, and \nit certainly should not be pursued by the Supreme Court.\n  We know that there is a chapter 2 to this strategy. The first is to \nget the Supreme Court so that you can divide the rights from the \nresponsibilities; therefore, you as a worker do not have to contribute \nto the cost, but you will benefit from the rewards. Pretty soon, very \nfew people will be contributing; therefore, it will undermine the \nfinancial ability of the union to negotiate.\n  Then they have a second strategy. This fundraising letter was sent \nout last year by the State Policy Network. By the way, the State Policy \nNetwork is an alliance of 66 State-based think tanks that are designed \nand funded by the Koch brothers and their friends to undercut the \nability of workers to get a fair share of the wealth that they create. \nThey said: Here is our plan to defund and defang our opponent, the \nunions--to deal a blow to the left's ability to control government.\n  Ah, they are fancy words, but what they really meant was our goal is \nto take and undo the ability of workers to organize so as to get a fair \nshare of the wealth they create. It is one evil act after another that \nis funded by the Koch cartel.\n  In our Nation, we have stood up to this type of abuse time and again. \nThe American historian who created the phrase the ``American dream'' \nsaid, in each generation, there is a group of Americans who rises up to \ntake on the forces that appear to be overwhelming us. We need to call \non the people of the United States who believe in the vision of our \nConstitution, to be that group to rise up and take on this effort to \nturn our Constitution on its head--to strip ``we the people'' out of \nour Constitution and replace it with ``we the powerful''--and to stand \nup against this type of right to exploit, whether it is a bill here on \nthe floor of the U.S. Senate or it is a begotten majority of the \nSupreme Court.", "turn": 55, "speaker": "Mr. MERKLEY", "itemno": 63}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I am not the first guy to stand up here \nand make this observation, but I have serious concerns with how the \nnominee confirmation process has been going in this Congress.\n  There is a blatant lack of respect for the Senate nomination process \nand an unprecedented level of obstructionism. I have been here for a \nnumber of years, so I know what to compare it with. I have never seen \nso many people being delayed in their confirmations, knowing that they \nare, ultimately, going to be confirmed and that they are well-qualified \ncivil servants.\n  The Democrats are forcing cloture votes on nominees who have well \nover 60 votes in support. Last week, we held a cloture vote on Scott \nPalk. Scott Palk is from Oklahoma. He is a guy who everybody likes. He \ndoesn't have\n\n\nany enemies out there. In fact, he was actually nominated by President \nObama. He was not even nominated by this President. He ended up getting \n79 votes. Still, the stall was there, and we had to wait and wait and \nwait. Meanwhile, things are not getting done that should be getting \ndone. Furthermore, the agency positions that we have hardly ever held \nrollcall votes on are being forced to occupy floor time. There is no \nreason for these votes except to delay the work of the courts and our \nagencies.\n  I am very supportive of the leader's commitment to our courts and how \nhe has prioritized judicial nominees.

If there has been one Agency over the \nlast 8 years that has run around and expanded its authority beyond \ncongressional intent, it is the EPA. Putting confirmed appointees in \nplace at the EPA will allow the President and Scott Pruitt to be \nsuccessful in their efforts to rightsize that Agency. He has talked \nabout that quite a bit. It is a bloated Agency that needs to be \nrightsized, and he needs help to do that.\n  Last week, I highlighted the great things that Scott Pruitt is doing \nas Administrator. I was able to visit with him yesterday at the EPA and \nwitness firsthand the implementation of new policies that will bring \nabout positive changes in an Agency that has run roughshod over the \nAmerican people. With the repeal of WOTUS and the Clean Power Plan, \nwith the implementation of TSCA, in reforming the Agency by ending sue-\nand-settle processes, and by creating greater transparency on the EPA's \nScience Advisory Committee, he is really doing a great job.\n  By the way, yesterday, we had this event over there which had to do \nwith the scientists. There are three Scientific Advisory Boards in the \nEPA. These are supposed to be made up of scientists who advise the \npolicymakers as to what they are supposed to be doing. During the last \nadministration, we discovered in just one of these that six out of \nseven of the appointees were actually recipients of grants from the \nEPA. In fact, I was over there, and I gave a little talk about those \nsix. They actually received $119 million, and they are supposed to be \nunbiased in making policy. Obviously, this is one of the many things \nthat he is going to make sure will no longer exist.\n  He is making it impossible for anyone who serves on a scientific \nadvisory board to receive any grants from the EPA. How reasonable is \nthat? Yet that is still a practice they use and one of the many things \nhe is cleaning up there.\n  There is a lot of work still to do. The Agency needs its Assistant \nAdministrators, who will work to implement many of the initiatives I \nhave worked toward for years. The Environment and Public Works \nCommittee has now voted out five Assistant Administrators and General \nCounsel nominees, and I hope we can move swiftly to get these well \nqualified nominees over to the EPA to bring their expertise to an \nAgency that desperately needs them. Unfortunately, Democrats have \ntargeted two of these nominees and have disparaged them, their work, \nand their backgrounds.\n\n\n                   Nomination of Dr. Michael Dourson\n\n  Dr. Michael Dourson will be an excellent Assistant Administrator for \nthe Office of Chemical Safety and Pollution Prevention and will bring \nmuch needed expertise and experience to the office in charge of the \nTSCA reauthorization law. The TSCA bill was a huge success last year. \nIt was done on a bipartisan basis. It is the first major reform bill in \n40 years, and we were able to get that through. Yet we need to have a \nperson as the Assistant Administrator to make sure it is done right.\n  Dr. Dourson has endured a coordinated campaign against him that \nmisrepresents who he is and his record. There are groups working to \npaint Dr. Dourson as an ``industry scientist.''\n  What you will not hear from these groups is that much of his career \nexperience comes from the EPA itself, where he worked for 15 years. \nDuring his years at the EPA, Dr. Dourson helped establish the \nIntegrated Risk Information System, which helps identify and document \nthe potential dangers of chemicals found in the environment. He also \nhas the honor of having received four bronze medals from the EPA for \nthis commendable work. Dr. Dourson also served on EPA's Scientific \nAdvisory Board for 6 years and has held leadership roles with a number \nof relevant toxicology organizations, receiving several awards from his \npeers.\n  Since his time at EPA, Dr. Dourson has devoted his career to \nprotecting public health by founding his own nonprofit that works to \ndevelop, review, and share risk assessments on various chemicals. His \nnonprofit work is mostly on behalf of government, with a minority of \nthe work done at the request of various industries--many of these \nindustries are very pro-environmental industries--as well as providing \npro bono assistance to those in need of help. In other words, he used \nhis expertise to help people who needed help and were not able to get \nit in any other way.\n  Naturally, the industry work is the part that environmental activists \nhave focused on to prove their claims that his research is a \nrubberstamp for dangerous chemicals. They hold the perspective--which \nis a myth--that working at the request of industry must mean that you \nare evil.\n  As always, the reality is much different. On many occasions the \nnonprofit has developed risk assessments that did not support the \nindustry sponsor and were the same or lower than the safe levels set by \ngovernment. Furthermore, he has provided expert testimony against \nindustry on several occasions. Unfortunately, the coordinated attack on \nDr. Dourson will persist and a good man's reputation will continue to \nbe put at risk.\n  I ask that the leader find floor time for Dr. Dourson as soon as \npossible so he can get back to work at an agency that he served \ncommendably for many years and ensure that those who seek to tear him \ndown do not win.\n\n\n                       Nomination of Bill Wehrum\n\n  I also ask that the leader prioritize another nominee that has also \nfaced unfair and false attacks. I have known Bill Wehrum for years, and \nI have no doubt that he is the best choice to head the Office of Air \nand Radiation. I regret that his first nomination to the EPA back \nduring the George W. Bush administration was blocked by Senate \nDemocrats. It is my hope that we can correct that wrong and confirm him \nas one of the Assistant Administrators. He has served the public and is \nwidely recognized for his knowledge of the Clean Air Act.\n  The Clean Air Act has been very successful. In fact, I was one of the \noriginal cosponsors of the Clean Air Act Amendments. It has performed \nvery well. He was very much involved in that also. So there is no one \nmore qualified to head that Office of Air and Radiation than Mr. \nWehrum, and I am sure of that. He has been consistently recognized as a \nleader and top lawyer in environmental law by such groups and \npublications as Chambers USA, the Legal 500 United States, and \nWashingtonian magazine.\n  He, too, has worked at the EPA in the past and will once again serve \nthe Agency and the American people with integrity. Mr. Wehrum is also \nunder attack for working on behalf of industry. The environmental \nindustry--and it is an industry, as they, too, are working to secure \nmoney for themselves by pursuing an agenda of their sponsors--is \nlobbying against Mr. Wehrum because he wants to make regulations \nworkable within the scope of the statute for the regulated community.\n  This is very curious to me because we want environmental regulations \nto improve our air quality without putting entire industries out of \nbusiness--a balance that is a part of the Clean Air Act. Those words \nare used in the Clean Air Act: The rules need to be workable and \nimplementable without undue harm to our economy.\n  It is time that we returned some common sense and rule of law to the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency. We have taken the first and only step \nwith the confirmation of Scott Pruitt, and Bill Wehrum is the next step \ntoward that goal. Right now there has only been one confirmation, and \nthat is for Scott Pruitt.\n  With the repeal of the Clean Power Plan sitting before the EPA, I ask \nthat\n\n\nthe leader prioritize Mr. Wehrum's confirmation vote so that we can \ngive the Office of Air and Radiation the leadership it needs to make \nthe important policy objectives of the President and a majority of our \ncolleagues and States a reality.\n  Again, we have five EPA nominees that have been voted out of \ncommittee, and we are now into November and only have one EPA appointee \nconfirmed. We need to do better than that, and I think this is going to \nhappen.\n  Let me just repeat some of the things that are going on in the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency. Scott Pruitt in his meeting yesterday \ncalled this to the attention of the American people. We knew it all the \ntime, but people on the outside didn't know it and they were shocked. \nThey found out that in the Scientific Advisory Board of the Obama \nadministration, six of the seven on the board were direct recipients of \ngrants from the EPA and they were making policy decisions for the EPA. \nNow, how bad is that? In fact, we added it up. I would state to the \nChair that it came to $119 million going to six people who are on the \nboard making decisions that affected the grants to go out. That is the \ntype of thing that he is cleaning up. He has the guts to do it, and he \nis doing it.\n  I am anxious to get these two confirmed, and I am hopeful that will \ntake place.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.", "turn": 57, "speaker": "Mr. INHOFE", "itemno": 65}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sullivan).
