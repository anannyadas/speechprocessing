Res. 319\n\n       Whereas, according to the World Health Organization, \n     complications of preterm birth is now the number one killer \n     of children under 5 years of age worldwide;\n       Whereas 1,100,000 children die every year due to \n     complications of preterm birth;\n       Whereas preterm birth is a global problem that exacts a \n     harsh toll on families from all parts of society in every \n     country;\n       Whereas there are stark inequalities in the survival rates \n     of preterm babies born around the world;\n       Whereas complications from preterm birth have lifelong \n     consequences for the health, growth, and development of \n     infants;\n       Whereas up to 75 percent of deaths resulting from preterm \n     birth worldwide can be prevented through proven low-cost \n     interventions;\n       Whereas countries can improve maternal health and the \n     survival rate of babies born prematurely by making strategic \n     investments in health care systems to ensure access to high-\n     quality adolescent and pre-pregnancy care, prenatal care, \n     childbirth services, emergency obstetric care, postnatal \n     care, and comprehensive care for affected newborns;\n       Whereas according to data collected by the Centers for \n     Disease Control and Prevention, preterm-related causes are \n     the leading contributors to infant death in the United \n     States, accounting for more than \\1/3\\ of infant deaths;\n       Whereas while the preterm birth rate in the United States \n     decreased from a peak of 12.8 percent in 2006, the preterm \n     birth rate of 9.8 percent in 2016 is still too high;\n       Whereas there are significant racial and ethnic disparities \n     in preterm birth rates among many communities in the United \n     States;\n\n\n       Whereas the Institute of Medicine of the National Academies \n     estimated in 2006 that the annual societal economic cost \n     associated with preterm birth in the United States was \n     $26,200,000,000;\n       Whereas many preterm births can be prevented through \n     evidence-based public health programs focused on reducing \n     risk factors such as tobacco use, inadequate birth spacing, \n     and early elective deliveries; and\n       Whereas, in the United States and around the world, \n     November is recognized as Prematurity Awareness Month: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) supports the recognition of Prematurity Awareness \n     Month;\n       (2) supports efforts at home and abroad--\n       (A) to reduce the impact of preterm births by improving \n     maternal health during and after pregnancy; and\n       (B) to advance the care and treatment of infants born \n     preterm;\n       (3) honors individuals working domestically and \n     internationally to reduce preterm births; and\n       (4) expresses the intent of the Senate to promote evidence-\n     based prevention interventions to prevent preterm birth and \n     improve outcomes for affected infants.\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "Senate", "num": "177", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "S6971-S6972", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "1", "month": "November"}, "related_bills": [{"type": "SRES", "context": "HEADERLINE", "congress": "115", "number": "319"}, {"type": "SRES", "context": "OTHER", "congress": "115", "number": "319"}], "doc_title": "SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS", "id": "CREC-2017-11-01-pt1-PgS6971"}
