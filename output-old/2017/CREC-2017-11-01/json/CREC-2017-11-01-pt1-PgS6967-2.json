She has made a positive \nand lasting impact in the lives of many Montanans.\n  Through her work with Lutheran Social Services of Montana, Diana has \ngently guided and counseled adoptees, birth parents, and adoptive \nfamilies. For a dozen years, she has been a recruiter with Wendy's \nWonderful Kids, leading a program dedicated to finding adoptive \nfamilies for the longest waiting children in foster care from eastern \nMontana.\n  Throughout the United States, there are over 100,000 children in \nfoster care who are waiting for adoption, each needing a loving home \nand stable environment to allow them to thrive and reach their \npotential. In the midst of this adoption challenge, folks like Diana \nare a guiding light to help others traverse adoption obstacles.
