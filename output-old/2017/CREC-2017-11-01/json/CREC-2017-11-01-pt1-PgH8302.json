Mr. Speaker, I rise today to call attention to the \nGovernment of Ethiopia's continued pattern of repression and violence \nagainst its own people, and I urge the House of Representatives to vote \non H. Res. 128, the Supporting Respect for Human Rights and Encouraging \nInclusive Governance in Ethiopia resolution.\n  This resolution calls on the Government of Ethiopia to take clear, \ndecisive steps towards becoming more inclusive, more democratic, and \nmore respectful of the basic human rights of its own people.\n  This resolution has overwhelming bipartisan support, with more than \n70 cosponsors, and it passed out of the House Foreign Affairs Committee \nunanimously on July 27.\n  The ongoing human rights crisis in Ethiopia is extremely troubling to \nme, to the resolution's other cosponsors, the many Americans of \nEthiopian heritage, and too numerous to list human rights groups. I \nfirmly believe that the passage of this resolution will encourage the \nEthiopian Government to end its practice of violence and repression and \nprovide a strong basis for an inclusive government.\n  Specifically, this resolution condemns the excessive use of force by \nEthiopian security forces and the killing of peaceful protestors; the \narrests and detention of journalists, students, activists, and \npolitical leaders; and the Ethiopian Government's abuse of the anti-\nterrorism proclamation to stifle political and civil dissent.\n  The resolution does not simply highlight the Ethiopian Government's \nincreasingly authoritarian acts, but it also encourages the United \nStates to support efforts to improve democracy and governance in \nEthiopia.\n  I believe that the United States can take actions that will \npositively influence the Ethiopian Government and use our existing \ninstitutions to further democracy and effective governance in Ethiopia.\n  Critically, the resolution calls on the Ethiopian Government to admit \nU.N. human rights observers so they can conduct an independent and \nthorough examination of the current state of human rights in Ethiopia.\n  On March 9 of this year, the House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on \nAfrica, Global Health, Global Human Rights, and International \nOrganizations held a hearing to discuss specific steps the United \nStates can take to bring about positive changes for the Ethiopian \nGovernment and their people.\n  Among those who testified was Deacon Yoseph Tafari of the St. Mary's \nEthiopian Orthodox Church located in Aurora, Colorado. Deacon Yoseph \nwas raised in Ethiopia and has experienced the daily struggles too many \nEthiopians have faced living in abject poverty under an oppressive \ngovernment.\n  Deacon Yoseph fled from Ethiopia in 1976 and came to the United \nStates as a refugee. He and many of the members of the Ethiopian \ncommunity in my congressional district of Colorado, including the Oromo \nand Amharas, have worked diligently to organize and assist those still \nsuffering from repression in their home country.\n  Oromo community president of Colorado, Jamal Said, has also shared \nhis concerns with me, and both of these gentlemen have no motives other \nthan a concern about the safety and state of democracy in Ethiopia. I \nappreciate their leadership in the community as they continue to fight \nfor democracy in their homeland.\n  Unfortunately, stories like this are not uncommon in my district, and \nI am disappointed that the House has not yet scheduled a floor vote on \nH. Res. 128. I note that on two prior occasions a vote was tentatively \nscheduled. In both of these instances, it is my understanding that the \nvote was postponed due to pressure from the Ethiopian Government, which \ncontinues to make promises to curb human rights abuses against their \nown people, but fail to deliver.\n  Additionally, it has been brought to my attention that the Ethiopian \nGovernment has threatened to cut off security cooperation with United \nStates should we proceed with H. Res. 128.\n  I am particularly dismayed that rather than solving their problems \nand moving towards becoming a more democratic country, the Ethiopian \nGovernment has chosen instead to hire a D.C. lobbying firm at a cost of \n$150,000 a month to ``work with the Ethiopian Government to develop and \nexecute a public affairs plan to enhance the dialogue and relationships \nwith policymakers, media, opinion leaders, and business leaders,'' in \naddition to ``meetings with Members of Congress, their staffs, and \nexecutive branch officials.''\n  The issue the Ethiopian Government needs to address is the repression \nof democracy and its citizens in Ethiopia. The solution to whatever \nnegative perception it has in the Halls of the U.S. Congress is not a \npublic affairs one, but, rather, what concrete steps are being taken \nagainst democracy in Ethiopia.\n  That is why I remain committed to working with House leadership to \nhave a vote scheduled on H. Res. 128.\n  Mr. Speaker, I encourage leadership to schedule a vote, and I call on \nmy colleagues to vote in favor of and pass H. Res. 128. I will continue \nworking with local Ethiopian community leaders in Colorado and across \nthe country to raise awareness of the human rights abuses occurring in \nEthiopia and to bring relief from oppression to the Ethiopian people.\n", "turn": 1, "speaker": "Mr. COFFMAN", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "177", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H8302", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "1", "month": "November"}, "related_bills": [{"type": "HRES", "context": "FIRSTPARAGRAPH", "congress": "115", "number": "128"}, {"type": "HRES", "context": "OTHER", "congress": "115", "number": "128"}], "doc_title": "THE GOVERNMENT OF ETHIOPIA HAS A HUMAN RIGHTS CRISIS", "id": "CREC-2017-11-01-pt1-PgH8302"}
