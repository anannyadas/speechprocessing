Mr. Speaker, it is a privilege and an honor to \nrepresent the community of the San Fernando Valley here in the United \nStates Congress. I think it is my duty and responsibility to make sure \nthat when something is going on in Washington, people should know what \nis going to happen to them and how it affects them.\n  I think it is really important for everybody to understand that right \nnow in the workings--and it is probably going to come to this floor in \njust a few days--is the Speaker Ryan-McConnell tax giveaways to big \ncorporations, which will actually increase taxes for working families, \nworking mothers and fathers.\n  I think it is important for people to understand that this is \nsomething that is being sold as a middle-income tax cut. Actually, what \nit is going to do is it is going to cut the take-home income to middle \nclass families.\n  What it is going to mean is if you are a police officer or a teacher \nor a waitress, you are going to see less money every week. It might be \n$5 less a week, it might be $50 less a week, it might be $100.\n  Let me tell you, the opposite of what is going to happen should this \nbecome law is that the biggest corporations in America are going to see \n$1 million less in taxes a week, maybe $50 million less in taxes paid a \nweek, maybe $100 million less per week paid in taxes.\n  Some people are thinking: Well, they earned it. They should keep it.\n  Well, okay. I understand what you are saying. But, see, this is the \nfundamental problem of this $1.5 trillion reduction in the ability for \nour Federal Government to fund things like Medicaid and Medicare. \nBecause when we see less money, you are going to see Members on this \nfloor and in committees throughout this House and in the United States \nSenate saying: Well, we don't have the money.\n  When they see a mother whose child has cerebral palsy and she is \nsaying, ``I go to work every single day, and thank you, government, for \nallowing my child to be in a program so that he or she can be safe \nwhile I go to work,'' they are going to say, ``You know what? I agree \nwith you, ma'am. We should fund that, but since we don't have the money \nanymore, we are going to stop funding that.''\n  This is a woman who just wants to work for a living. This is a person \nwho just wants to make sure that she can have the dignity of work and \nhave her child in a safe place, but we are going to cut those programs \nif we have this tax giveaway go through Congress and signed by this \nPresident.\n\n\n  You see, it is a multistep process. And what some of my colleagues--\nand\n\n\nso far, the only ones voting for this tax giveaway are my Republican \ncolleagues. I say that accurately, not to be partisan, but just to be \nhonest and accurate. They say we have to do this; it is going to \nstimulate the economy.\n  Well, also, in this package, this plan that they want to make into a \nlaw, basically what it will do, it will actually incentivize the \nbiggest corporations in America, American corporations. It is going to \nincentivize them to go ahead and close up shop in your neighborhood and \ngo set up shop somewhere else in the world.\n  And the only connection they are going to have with you, ladies and \ngentlemen, is they are going to want to sell those products to you, \nbuilt by other than American hands in other parts of the world. The \nonly other connection they are going to have is this: They are going to \nbe able to bring their money, their profits, back to the United States, \npretty much free and clear, and just count their money here, where they \ncall themselves an American corporation.\n  I think it is important, ladies and gentlemen, that we recognize that \nthis is something that is wrong. This is something that is going to \nhurt the middle class. This is something, again, if you are a teacher, \nif you are a police officer, if you are busdriver, this is going to \nhurt you.\n  If you are a single mother who is working every single day, proud to \ndo that, you are going to see that you are not going to have the \nsupport you need to make sure that that childcare continues for your \nchild.\n  If you are a family member that has a mother or father whose only \nincome is Social Security, they probably depend on Meals on Wheels. \nThey probably depend on programs like that. Some of that comes from \nyour Federal Government. But when these Republican colleagues cut $1.5 \ntrillion out of the United States budget, it is going to come out of \nyou, ladies and gentlemen. The people who have worked hard, seniors who \nare finally retired and should have the dignity of having a dignified \nlife and having at least one darned meal a day, that is where it is \ngoing to come out of.\n  Ladies and gentlemen, I am here to warn you, please call your Members \nof Congress. Please make sure that you let them know: I don't want that \nkind of giveaway.", "turn": 1, "speaker": "Mr. CARDENAS", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "  The SPEAKER pro tempore.
