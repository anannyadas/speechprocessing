Mr. Speaker, the Children's Health Insurance Program, \nwhich is also known as CHIP, provides low-cost health insurance to \nnearly 9 million children all across the country, including over 25,000 \nchildren in my home State of Hawaii. Together with Medicaid, these \nprograms have reduced the Nation's uninsured rate for children to a \nrecord low of 5 percent.\n  Republicans in Congress let CHIP expire back in September, \njeopardizing the healthcare of millions of children.\n  At the current pace, my home State of Hawaii will exhaust all current \nCHIP funding by the end of this year, leaving thousands of our keiki \nunable to visit a doctor for routine checkups and to receive \nimmunizations, prescriptions, or more.\n  We must act now to reauthorize this CHIP program to ensure that our \nchildren have access to the healthcare that they need. We cannot \nneglect those who need help the most by failing to act and reauthorize \nthis legislation. We must act now.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Ms. GABBARD", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "177", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H8309", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "1", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "CHILDREN'S HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM", "id": "CREC-2017-11-01-pt1-PgH8309", "title": "CHILDREN'S HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM"}
