Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, H.R. 1488 would redesignate Indiana Dunes National \nLakeshore as Indiana Dunes National Park.\n  Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore was established by Congress in 1966. \nThe designation of the national lakeshore as a unit of the National \nPark Service was the culmination of decades of work by \nconservationists, area residents, and elected officials.\n  The original law included 8,330 acres of land and water. The National \nPark Service conservation advocates continued to seek expansion of the \nboundaries, and five subsequent laws increased the size of the national \nlakeshore to more than 15,000 acres.\n  In October 1916, shortly after the National Park Service was \nestablished, NPS Director Stephen Mather held hearings in Chicago to \ngauge public sentiment on a Sand Dunes National Park. In a Department \nof the Interior report published after the hearings, Director Mather \nstated: ``No national park or other Federal reservation offers this \nphenomenon for the pleasure and edification of the people, and no \nnational park is as accessible. Furthermore, the dunes offer to the \nvisitor extraordinary scenery, a large variety of plant life, \nmagnificent bathing beaches, and splendid opportunities to camp and \nlive in the wild close to nature.''\n  Despite Director Mather's support, the national park proposal was \nabandoned at the onset of World War I, and\n\n\nseveral years later, in 1925, Indiana Dunes State Park was established. \nRedesignation of the national lakeside as a national park would make \nIndiana Dunes the 60th national park in the United States.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.", "turn": 4, "speaker": "Mr. COOK", "itemno": 12}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "T000474", "text": "  Mrs. TORRES. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak on H.R. 1488, the Indiana Dunes \nNational Park Act. This act seeks to rename the Indiana Dunes National \nLakeshore to the Indiana Dunes National Park, one of the over 400 units \nof the National Park System.\n  Upon successful redesignation, the Indiana Dunes National Park would \nbecome the 60th national park, areas which are known for their variety \nof resources, for encompassing large land and water areas, and for \nproviding protection of resources within their boundaries.\n  Designated in 1966, Indiana Dunes protects over 15,000 acres, 50 \nmiles of trails, and provides both summer and winter recreational \nactivities for over 2 million visitors who trek to the lakeshore each \nyear.\n  When the lakeshore was admitted into the National Park System in \n1966, it was through the hard work of President Kennedy in 1963-64 to \ncreate a compromise for the national lakeshore and a port to promote \nthe industrial needs of the area.\n  Sponsors of this bill, including our esteemed colleague \nRepresentative Visclosky, believe that renaming the lakeshore as the \nIndiana Dunes National Park will capture the spirit and intent of the \nfirst National Park Service Director Stephen Mather.\n  Director Mather visited the area in 1916 and recommended the area be \nincluded as a national park within the newly designated National Park \nSystem. Sadly, the United States' entry into World War I precluded that \naddition. Now, 101 years later, this bill seeks to redesignate 15,000 \nacres of the Indiana Dunes National Park.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.", "turn": 5, "speaker": "Mrs. TORRES", "itemno": 13}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "C001094", "text": "  Mr. COOK.

According to the National Park Service, Indiana Dunes National \nLakeshore is the seventh most biologically diverse National Park \nService unit.\n  I believe the chairman and Mrs. Torres ably described the history of \nthe dunes and its evolution. I thank them for that, and I would thank \nall of the citizens over that half century and more that petitioned for \nthe creation of this great park.\n  The lakeshore currently does encompass about 15,000 acres of wetlands \nand marshes, beaches, oak savannahs, and sand dunes. It is clear that \nthe title of the Indiana Dunes National Park is fitting for such a \nunique natural resource.\n  The American taxpayers, over a number of generations, have invested \nin the preservation of the park. It is incumbent that we do everything \npossible to encourage citizens and travelers from around the world to \nvisit it, to learn about it, to recreate, and to simply enjoy the \nenvironment of northwest Indiana's lakeshore. H.R. 1488 helps to \nachieve this goal.\n  Mr. Speaker, I am proud that the act is supported in a bipartisan \nfashion by the entire Indiana delegation. I would also like to thank \nSenators Donnelly and Young, who have introduced a companion measure in \nthe Senate.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support passage.", "turn": 8, "speaker": "Mr. VISCLOSKY", "itemno": 16}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "T000474", "text": "  Mrs. TORRES.
