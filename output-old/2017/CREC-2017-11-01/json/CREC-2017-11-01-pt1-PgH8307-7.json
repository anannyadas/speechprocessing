Mr. Speaker, right now, President Trump and the \nRepublicans are trying to pass a massive tax cut for billionaires, \nmillionaires, and wealthy corporations, and reward companies that ship \nAmerican jobs overseas. The only way they can pay for it is by raising \ntaxes on working people and cutting more than $1 trillion from Medicare \nand Medicaid.\n  This is not what Donald Trump, the candidate, promised the American \npeople when he ran for President. He promised he would protect Social \nSecurity, Medicare, and Medicaid, but it turns out that wasn't true.\n  Wealthy Americans are doing better than ever. The top 1 percent are \nearning three times as much as they did 30 years ago, but working \npeople haven't seen their pay go up at all.\n  Let's get serious. Let's get working people a better deal that cuts \ntheir taxes. Let's get them a better deal that protects Social Security \nand Medicare. Let's not give tax breaks to companies that ship American \njobs overseas.\n  The American people deserve a better deal, not this raw deal that \nhurts working families.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. CICILLINE", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "177", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H8307-H8308", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "1", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "TAX REFORM", "id": "CREC-2017-11-01-pt1-PgH8307-7", "title": "TAX REFORM"}
