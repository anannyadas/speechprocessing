Mr. Speaker, today is the early action deadline for \nmany colleges in the United States. Thousands of students who are \nsubmitting their applications are anxiously hoping for entry into a \ncollege, community college, or postsecondary school.\n  As students try to determine what schools are right for them, it is \nclear they are missing some key information--information we all wish we \nhad for our children: How likely are they to graduate? How long will it \ntake to earn a degree or their certificate? How likely are they to find \na job? How much money will they earn if they do find a job?\n\n  As a parent, I know this information will be helpful. That is why I \nintroduced the College Transparency Act. My legislation would utilize \nand make meaning out of the data we currently gather at the Federal \nlevel to enable students and parents to make informed decisions.\n  I have over 35 years in workforce development and postsecondary \neducation. I understand the difficulties that people have in making \ninformed decisions about what is best for their future career. I also \nunderstand the reporting expectations for career colleges and \nuniversities. I understand which institutions have the information \navailable and how they provide it. I also understand the burdens that \noccur in providing that information.\n  Despite the incredible investment involved and the risk in pursuing a \npostsecondary education, we and students are left with too little \ninformation to answer the most basic questions: What can students \nexpect to pay out of pocket? Can you imagine that really they cannot \ndetermine how much it will cost them to complete a postsecondary \nprogram? How do students fare in the labor market after leaving \ncollege? How likely are they to fare in order to enter into the labor \nmarket? How do students fare on other metrics of success we all \nconsider important, like earnings, and loan repayment?\n  A prospective student doesn't have the information about which \nprograms at which institutions provide an adequate return on their \ninvestment, and on their parents' investment.\n  As a consumer and a father, it is difficult for me to wrap my head \naround the idea that Americans have so little information about \npotentially what may be the largest investment they make in their \nlives, and certainly, the second largest. I am the father of six \nchildren. The reality is that we are investing and putting six children \nthrough a college or a postsecondary program. Think about how much \nmoney goes into that. Yet we operate in a vacuum on information.\n  When you shop online, you are able to compare products, you are able \nto compare costs, you are able to compare features, the value to the \nconsumer. At this point in time, try to do that about programs at a \ncollege, university, or career school. Try to compare one university's \nnursing program to another; or the architecture program, or history \nprogram, or the nursing program in a college. Try to find that \ninformation. You won't find it online. Try to call the university. Good \nluck on that.\n  It is not that they don't try to provide it. In fact, they provide \nreams of data. The reality is that the current system simply doesn't \ngather that data in a manner that is useful to consumers, the people \nthat ultimately pay the bill.\n  The College Transparency Act would enable students to answer crucial \nquestions, such as how likely they are to enter the workforce \nsuccessfully, or what their chances are of transferring from a \ncommunity college to a 4-year college and being able to graduate.\n  Students past and present are owners of the $1.4 trillion outstanding \nFederal debt, and the clock is ticking. It is time for students, \nfamilies, and guidance counselors involved in the college \ndecisionmaking process to be able to assist students and have access to \ninformation that will make this huge investment make sense. Otherwise, \nwe leave young people to make decisions based on: Well, those colors on \nthe band uniform are really cool; or they have a good football team; or \nit seems like they have a really nice social life.\n  But, ultimately, what we are making is an investment into the future \nof our children and the future of this country. They have massive money \ninvested, and let's be honest, we all do as taxpayers as well. We have \na huge investment in the preparation of young people for the workforce.\n  It is time to streamline and update our higher education information \nsystem so that families and students can make better decisions on their \npath to long-term success. It is time to utilize and make meaning out \nof the data we currently collect to assist them in making the choice.\n\n\n  The question I am asked is: Why did I submit the College Transparency \nAct? I spent 35 years operating a private career school group and \nworking in workforce development. I worked at Chrysler Corporation, \nmoved to another company, and also retired out of that field.\n  The point is, I have worked in the field for 35 years. I understand \nthe data that is reported. I understand the challenges that people have \nin trying to sort out what is the best career path for them, how likely \nare they to succeed in that career path, and what is it going to cost \nto go to school?\n\n\n  This information all exists--and we will talk about that tonight--but \nit isn't made available in some coherent manner to students, and we \nneed to fix that.\n  We also can't tell students how long, on average, it takes them to \ncomplete their program. It used to be the day where they used to call \nthem 4-year colleges. The reality, as you well know, Mr. Speaker, is 4-\nyear colleges are now a dream, 5 years is the norm, and 6 years is not \nuncommon, yet we don't talk about the cost it takes to do that. Again, \nwe don't talk about the likelihood of completing even if you attend 6 \nyears. The reality is we have to fix that.\n  In my 35 years of dealing with the system, what became clear to me is \nit is outdated, it is burdensome, it is unhelpful, and it conflicts. It \nled me to start working on the College Transparency Act as soon as I \ncame to Congress. It was the first bill that I dropped and submitted in \nCongress. It is the one I spent the most time on. Why? Because we have \na huge investment in postsecondary education, and, even more \nimportantly, we have a huge investment preparing a labor force.\n  I have not gone to an employer since I was sworn into office that has \nnot said to me: We can't find people with the skills to go to work.\n  Yet we have people who have graduated from college who can't find \njobs that relate to their degree. We have people who will go to college \nfor an extended period of time or to a postsecondary program who don't \ncomplete, but they meander their way through. They get lost. They don't \nhave the information to make an informed decision, and then somehow, \nsometimes, frankly, we blame the consumer.\n  It is our fault. It is our fault here. It is our fault at the Federal \nGovernment. We are making a huge investment, and we expect everybody \nelse to cure the problem. Better information on outcomes in student \nsuccess will certainly assist in closing the skills gap that we talk \nabout nearly every day here in Congress and certainly every day in the \nEducation and the Workforce Committee when we meet.\n  Senators Hatch, Warren, Cassidy, and Whitehouse share my concern. On \nthe Senate side, they have introduced a similar bill--almost \nidentical--to address this critical issue. I believe on this issue we \ncan get bipartisan support to move forward with an approach to inform \nthe public and the consumers about the decision they will make with \ntheir money and, to be honest with you, our investment in their future.\n  The current system is massively broken. This chart will show the \ncurrent reporting system for higher education in the United States \ntoday. If you can possibly read it from there--and we will get it \nsubmitted for the Record--these are all the groups that gather data, \nall the places it goes, and all the information that is exchanged about \nstudents going to postsecondary education in the United States.\n  I ask you, Mr. Speaker, can you make any sense of that? I have worked \n35 years in that field. I will tell you that a student enrollment for \none system doesn't match the definition of enrollment in another \nsystem, it doesn't match the definition in the State system, yet we all \nreport that information. Graduate information is all different \ndepending on the system. None of the definitions match.\n  Now, if we can't get definitions to match internally in a system \nbetween State accrediting agencies and the Federal Government, how is \nit we expect students and how are parents to understand whether they \nare likely to complete the program? And, by the way, none of this \ninformation adequately reports student outcomes in terms of employment \nand doesn't provide them any information on what they are likely to \nearn. And guess what? Earnings matter in terms of their ability to pay \ntheir student loans back. News flash to everybody: it helps if they \nknow what they are going to make.\n  A 2015 study completed by Boston Consulting Group indicated $11.1 \nbillion is spent by institutions to comply with regulations specific to \ncolleges and universities. We don't need more regulations. Good God, \nhelp us. We have plenty--we have plenty of reporting.\n  One of the most significant findings of the study was that small and \nmedium colleges are disproportionately impacted by those Federal \nregulations with compliance eating up a much larger share of \nexpenditures than the wealthier institutions.\n  While we say we need more options for continuing and postsecondary \neducation, for career and technical education at the postsecondary \nlevel, we are killing those institutions with rules and regulations of \nreporting that give us that, that isn't useful to the public that has \nto make a decision. Imagine that.\n  We have an opportunity to fix that with the Higher Education Act. We \nhave an opportunity to fix that with the College Transparency Act. We \nhave an opportunity now.\n  There are three main goals of the bill. This chart will show you what \nthe bill will collect. First and most importantly, the goal is to \nprovide accurate and complete information that is searchable for \nstudents and can be customized. Think about it. How many people have \nshopped for an automobile? They have on the website a comparison of \nwhatever vehicle to other similar vehicles sold by other manufacturers. \nYou can compare them dealer to dealer. You can get an idea what \nfeatures are there. Shop for whatever you want, and then tell me if you \ncan find that about any educational program offered by postsecondary \ninstitutions.\n  This addresses that issue while reducing reporting burdens on \ninstitutions. I believe, and I think most of our party believes, that \nmarket competition works best when consumers can actually find out \ninformation and make rational decisions. They can compare complete \ninformation. They can compare the offerings, the costs, and the \noutcomes.\n\n  With that competition, we can, in fact, address one of the other \nconcerns we have, which is: What is the cost of higher education? We \ncan compare it not just on what you pay for tuition, room and board, \nbut the return on investment. What do they get for their time and money \nin a postsecondary education program?\n  More importantly, choices will be made by consumers and not the \nFederal Government. We have seen how that works in so many ways, and \nthe Federal Government should not be making choices about the future of \nAmericans.\n  If we arm consumers with that information to make informed decisions, \nthen we can remove the Federal Government from the business of \ndetermining quality in education and let consumers and accrediting \nagencies address that.\n  The bill also replaces a number of reporting requirements that the \nFederal Government has, most notably what is called the IPED survey. I \ndid them for years. Routinely, we get questions that don't match their \ndefinitions because their definitions made no sense for many \ninstitutions.\n  Thirdly, the bill aims to provide transparency to its students by \nrequiring they be posted in a searchable database, and the costs would \nbe identified there.\n  Let me go through real quickly in that chart the information that \nwill be available that is not currently available on a searchable \nbasis. You can get enrollment patterns, you can get progress to \ncompletion, and you can get completion rates. Do you graduate from a \nprogram? Imagine that. You can find that out, and it is the same \ndefinition whether it is the University of Michigan or Michigan State \nwhere I attended. Wouldn't that be a great idea?\n  You can find out about their postcollege earnings. It is really \nhelpful. Most people go to college or a postsecondary school to find a \njob, earn some money, and support their family. Can they do that? What \nis likely to be the outcome?\n  The cost of the program? I mentioned that a couple of times. It is \nnot just tuition and room and board. The reality is that, depending on \nthe program, your costs are significantly different. My 18- almost 19-\nyear-old stepdaughter attends an art school. Well, beyond tuition and \nroom and board, there are huge costs for art supplies. Now, we knew \nthat. I have experience in education. There are a lot of people who \nstart these programs who don't understand there are other costs and \nwhat those may be. This process requires reporting of that from the \ncolleges.\n  Also, information about financial aid that is available for those \ninstitutions\n\n\nso they can compare program to program, institution to institution, and \nmake a decision that is best for them and their family. That is what we \nare trying to achieve here. It is achievable.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Garrett) who \nwill speak for a few moments on the bill and its advantages.", "turn": 3, "speaker": "Mr. MITCHELL", "itemno": 4}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "G000580", "text": "  Mr. GARRETT. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my colleague, Congressman \nMitchell, for his leadership in this amazingly important area, and also \nto point out the bipartisan nature of this bill not only, Mr. Speaker, \nto you, but to those people who might be watching at home at a time \nwhen it seems that we can't agree on anything, here we have an \nagreement in a College Transparency Act in how to ensure a better \ninvestment for the futures of our children.\n  Now, there are those who have opposed this bill, and I can't really \nwrap my brain around it, Mr. Speaker. Someone suggested that this might \ngrow government. But that is absolutely not true. As a matter of fact, \nthe data that would be made available in this act is already collected. \nBut the problem is that that data is collected, and then it is siloed \nand accessible only to institutions or government entities and not to \nthe end user. That strikes me as illogical, at best, and stupid, at \nworst.\n  Someone says it burdens colleges with data collection requirements, \nyet, again, the data is already being collected. What about personal \nprivacy? Does it disclose individuals' private information? Well, if it \ndid, I wouldn't be standing here today extolling the virtues of this \nbill which I cosponsored and Mr. Mitchell sponsors that support it \nagain across the aisle to include the likes of the distinguished \ngentleman, Mr. Polis, from Colorado.\n  Instead of disclosing personal data of individuals, it discloses \nmetadata of groups so what we would learn, for example, is that \nindividuals who majored in X at college Y had an employment rate of Z, \nand that their earning potential was A as opposed to another university \nwhere it might be B.\n  What more pertinent information, Mr. Speaker, could there be to young \npeople as they seek to choose an area of study and a place to engage in \nthat area of study than their likelihood of success based on those who \nhave done the same thing at the same college or university before them?\n  So we have addressed some of the things that this bill doesn't do, \nbut let's speak briefly about what it does do. Without any ability to \narticulately argue, this bill increases transparency. When you step \naside from the realm of national security, I can think of no reason \nthat the Federal or State or local government should be in the business \nof collecting data that they don't share with the citizens who put them \nin office or the people who fund their endeavors. Indeed, this isn't \nnational security, unless you contemplate the fact that right now our \nchildren attend universities deprived of information that might help \nthem make better choices.\n  So this increases transparency. It creates informed consumers. It \nallows individuals to decide for themselves which college or university \nmight offer a program that they are interested in, is the best \ninvestment of their time, and perhaps their or their parents' or the \ngovernment's money. It informs payers to that very end, whether that \npayer is the student, a family member, or the State of which they are a \nresident. It gives us a return on the investment.\n\n  The fact that this data has been collected low these many years, and \nit took the leadership of Mr. Mitchell and good folks like Jared Polis \nworking across the aisle to get us to this point, is lamentable, but we \nhave the opportunity in the College Transparency Act to correct these \nwrongs, not to reburden our universities with more data collection \nrequirements, but to take the data that is already being collected and \ngive it to the end users, the students.\n  So it is with that that I again offer a hearty congratulations to \nCongressman Mitchell, a begrudging ``I wish I had thought of that,'' \nand I implore my colleagues on both sides of the aisle that while we \nalready collect this data, we do not disseminate it where it would be \nmost useful, and that is to the end users. I hope that all can find a \nway to join us from both parties in supporting this commonsense \nmeasure, the College Transparency Act.\n  Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from the president of \nthe University of Virginia in my district.\n\n                                           University of Virginia,\n\n\n                                      Office of the President,\n\n                                Charlottesville, VA, June 1, 2017.\n     Hon. Tom Garrett,\n     House of Representatives,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Representative Garrett: On behalf of the University of \n     Virginia (UVA), I thank you for your co-sponsorship of the \n     College Transparency Act. I appreciate your support of \n     transparency, good data, and enhanced consumer information in \n     higher education, as well as the bipartisan efforts that led \n     to the creation of this bill.\n       The College Transparency Act is a step in the right \n     direction for improving federal data, which is currently \n     limited, and at times, inaccurate. Improving data helps \n     students and families with the important decisions associated \n     with choosing a college, and also helps institutions of \n     higher education improve student success. The Association of \n     Public and Land Grant Universities, for which I serve as the \n     Chair of the Council of Presidents, compiled case studies \n     showing the importance of this type of data for improving \n     student outcomes. I look forward to working with you, in your \n     influential position as a member of the House Committee on \n     Education and the Workforce, on this issue and many others as \n     Congress moves forward with reauthorizing the Higher \n     Education Act.\n       Once again, thank you for your dedicated support of UVA.\n           Very truly yours,\n                                                  Teresa Sullivan,\n                                                        President.\n", "turn": 4, "speaker": "Mr. GARRETT", "itemno": 5}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "G000580", "text": "  Mr. GARRETT.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak in support of H.R. \n2434, the College Transparency Act. I want to thank my good friend from \nMichigan, Congressman Mitchell, for his leadership and bipartisan work \non this very important bill.\n  This time of year, parents and students are beginning to make \nimportant decisions about higher education for the next school year.\n\n\n  Unfortunately, there is little information available about what can \nbe expected from the large investment in a college or a university. \nThis legislation will enable students and families to make informed \nchoices about their education after high school.\n  The College Transparency Act will provide actionable, customizable \ninformation for students and families as they consider college and \nuniversities by accurately reporting on student outcomes, such as \nenrollment, completion, and postcollege success across colleges and \nmajors.\n  Most importantly, this information will tell students how other \nprospective students have succeeded at an institution and help point \nthem toward schools best suited for their unique needs and desired \noutcomes.\n  The current college reporting system is overly burdensome on \ninstitutions, yet it provides little practical information for students \nand families due to significant gaps in college data reporting.\n  Additionally, the data collected only reports graduation rates for \nstudents who begin as full-time students and finish at the same \ninstitution, leaving out successes of part-time students and\n\n\nany student who transfers and completes a degree at an institution \nother than where they started. With more than half of bachelor's degree \nrecipients attending more than one school and nearly two-thirds of \ncommunity college students starting part-time, we have to ensure that \nthese students count.\n  One example of this impact from my alma mater, The Ohio State \nUniversity, is a veteran named Tami. Tami returned to school to \ncomplete her social work degree after her military service. She \ncompleted an associate of arts degree at Columbus State, a community \ncollege, and transferred and eventually graduated with a social work \ndegree from The Ohio State University. She had a 3.9 grade point \naverage in the classroom and excelled in her two-semester field \nplacement at the university's Office of Military and Veterans Services.\n  Under this system, Tami's success story would not count toward Ohio \nState success. Under the new system, it will. Today, the system would \nnot count Tami because she started at one school and transferred to \nanother school. Under the legislation that Mr. Mitchell is working on \nand that I am talking about today, Tami would count again.\n  We need to make people count again. Tami served our country. Tami got \nout of the military, came back, went to school part-time, then \ntransferred schools, went to school full-time, and completed her \npractical experience. Under the current reporting system, Tami doesn't \ncount.\n  Let's fix that. That is what this bill would do. Under the updated \nsystem, institutions would securely report privacy-protected student \nlevel data to the National Center for Education Statistics, or NCES. \nNCES would be responsible for presenting summary information on a user-\nfriendly website for students and families, while securely storing \nstudent information.\n  This legislation will help countless students and families make \nbetter decisions about where to go for higher education, where they \nshould attend.\n  I want to thank Congressman Mitchell and Congressman Polis for \nintroducing this important, bipartisan legislation that will help so \nmany students and families, students like Tami.\n  I hope we can roll up our sleeves, work together, and get this bill \npassed. I urge my colleagues to support this bill.", "turn": 7, "speaker": "Mr. STIVERS", "itemno": 8}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "M001201", "text": "  Mr. MITCHELL. I appreciate the gentleman's notation of the groups \nthat support this bill. I was surprised, frankly, with the number of \ngroups that stepped forward--as I said, over 90--to support the College \nTransparency Act. Some of the groups I would like to stress today \ninclude veterans groups.\n  The Student Veterans of America and Veterans Education Success, among \nothers, have endorsed the bill because it helps veterans determine \nwhich institutions and programs best serve their unique needs and \nimprove their ability to make progress in the workforce to be \nsuccessful, something that, frankly, we owe them as part of their \nservice to our country.\n  As Chris Cate, vice president of research at Student Veterans of \nAmerica, said: ``Based on recent research, the value of the Post-9/11 \nGI Bill is clear, as student veterans across the country succeed at \nrates higher than traditional students. Yet, determining these outcomes \nis currently a significant effort and not easily accomplished without \nabundant resources. Basing policy on research and data is imperative, \nand it shouldn't take as much effort as it does today, as we have the \nanswer to this challenge staring us in the face.'' It is the College \nTransparency Act.\n  We currently collect the data that people are begging to get to make \ninformed decisions for themselves and, frankly, in this case, to assist \nveterans in making wise decisions on their GI bill.\n  Let me talk a little more about some of the groups that support the \nbill, and then I will yield to another colleague of mine.\n  Colleges, universities, and postsecondary institutions support this \nbill, which sometimes surprises me, given what we are trying to do, \nwhich is remake a reporting system and make transparent their \nperformance. Think about it. They support the bill without exception. \nThese institutions want more comprehensive information on student \nprogress, completion, and outcomes so they can better understand and \nevaluate how well they are serving their students and identify areas \nfor improvement.\n  Institutions also know best student-level data collection will \ndecrease the reporting burden and the financial and human resources \nnecessary to report and complete the requirements of the Federal \nGovernment, State government, and accrediting agencies.\n  Associations representing institutions serving the majority of \ncollege students support lifting the ban on connecting student-level \ndata to help build evidence and improve the quality of the program.\n  As my colleague Mr. Stivers indicated, as well as others, this \ninformation is disseminated and developed only at the metadata level. \nIt is not like we are going to send your Social Security number out and \npost it on a Facebook page with your employment status; although, in \nyour case, Mr. Speaker, everyone knows well your employment status.\n\n  According to the Michigan Association of State Universities, which \nserves as the coordinating board for Michigan's 15 public universities \nin my home State: ``The College Transparency Act of 2017 represents a \nmuch-needed modernization of the Federal Government's college reporting \nsystem for postsecondary data. The current ban on student-level data in \nthe Higher Education Act represents a gross injustice to students and \nfamilies who require and deserve more accurate data on postsecondary \ninstitutional outcomes in order to be adequately equipped to make one \nof the most important decision in one's life--whether and where to \nattend college. By providing more accurate information about \ninstitutional graduation rates, salary levels, and other employment \noutcomes, and additional information on how students fare at individual \ninstitutions and in academic programs, the College Transparency Act \nwill enable the creation of an essential resource for student and \nconsumer information.''\n  Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from the Michigan \nAssociation of State Universities.\n\n                                           Michigan Association of\n\n\n                                           State Universities,\n\n                                       Lansing, MI, July 10, 2017.\n     Re Endorsement of College Transparency Act, H.R. 2434/S. \n         1121.\n\n     Hon.

The current ban on \n     student-level data in the Higher Education Act represents a \n     gross injustice to students and families who require and \n     deserve more accurate data on postsecondary institutional \n     outcomes in order to be adequately equipped to make one of \n     the most important decision in one's life--whether and where \n     to attend college. By providing more accurate information \n     about institutional graduation rates, salary levels and other \n     employment outcomes, and additional information on how \n     students fare at individual institutions and in academic \n     programs, the College Transparency Act will enable the \n     creation of an essential resource for student and consumer \n     information.\n       Introduced in both Congressional chambers, this bipartisan \n     legislation will also serve as an indispensable tool in \n     helping institutions assess and enhance their academic \n     programs. Michigan public universities rely heavily on data \n     to inform institutional policy and to better serve our \n     students.\n       We commend your leadership and those co-sponsoring the \n     College Transparency Act and offer our support in advocating \n     passage of the legislation. America's students, families, \n     taxpayers and postsecondary institutions will all benefit \n     greatly from its enactment.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Daniel J. Hurley,\n                                          Chief Executive Officer.\n", "turn": 8, "speaker": "Mr. MITCHELL", "itemno": 9}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "M001201", "text": "  Mr. MITCHELL. For similar reasons, the Association of Public and \nLand-grant Universities, the American Association of Community \nColleges, the Association of Community College Trustees, the Dallas \nCounty Community College District, State University of New York system, \nUniversity of Virginia, Virginia Community College System, Ohio State \nUniversity, Louisiana State\n\n\nUniversity, St. Clair County Community College, and many others support \nthe bill.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Smucker) \nto talk further about his views on the College Transparency Act.", "turn": 9, "speaker": "Mr. MITCHELL", "itemno": 10}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "S001199", "text": "  Mr. SMUCKER. I thank my friend from Michigan (Mr. Mitchell) for \nhosting this Special Order on the College Transparency Act.\n  Mr. Speaker, I have spoken on the floor a number of times about the \nHouse's work to improve education in the country. I have been proud to \nwork with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle in the Education and \nthe Workforce Committee to improve career and technical education, and \nI have also spoken about my own experience with higher education as a \nnontraditional student taking classes at night while I ran a \nconstruction company during the day.\n  Tonight, I am happy to be here to talk about ensuring that students, \nparents, guidance counselors, and legislators like us have access to \ninformation that can help students make informed decisions about what \ncollege to attend so that policymakers have access to research and data \nthat will better inform our work on higher education policy.\n  Today, colleges and universities report data to the U.S. Department \nof Education that has been collected by a voluntary survey available \nonly to a limited group of graduates. The survey is not offered to any \nstudent who is attending college part-time, who is not seeking a \ndegree, who has transferred from another college, or who doesn't have \nFederal loans.\n  In today's economy, we are trying to make higher education more \navailable and accessible to nontraditional students, yet we omit a \nlarge group of nontraditional students from this data. That is just one \nof the reasons why we need to pass the College Transparency Act.\n  This bipartisan legislation seeks to modernize higher education \nreporting so that students and families can make responsible choices \nabout what college or university to attend. It will help empower \nstudents and families to determine how much they need to take out in \nstudent loans and which programs at different schools provide the best \npaths toward their dream job or a career.\n  Too many students today are graduating with massive amounts of debt. \nToo many students graduate with majors offering too few opportunities. \nAt the very least, students need to have this data available to them to \nmake informed decisions.\n  This bill, as has been pointed out by Mr. Mitchell, is endorsed by \nmore than 80 education and business organizations, including Advance \nCTE and the Association for Career and Technical Education, \norganizations that represent great schools like Thaddeus Stevens \nCollege of Technology in my district.\n  This bill has bipartisan support in our committee, in the Senate, and \nthe House, and it is essential for transforming our higher education \nsystem to meet the needs of a 21st century economy. So, again, I am \nhappy to rise to speak in support of this act.\n  I would like to thank my friend from Michigan for hosting this \nSpecial Order this evening, and I urge my colleagues to consider \nsupporting this important piece of legislation.", "turn": 10, "speaker": "Mr. SMUCKER", "itemno": 11}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "M001201", "text": "  Mr. MITCHELL. I thank my colleague, Mr. Smucker, for taking time out \nof his busy schedule to come here tonight to talk about the act and its \nimportance nationally and in his district.\n  He made reference to something I wish to stress, Mr. Speaker, which \nis that, annually, at the Federal level, we spend $160 billion a year \non student aid. We currently spend it into a vacuum, into a giant black \nhole, in which we hope we get outcomes and which students hope they get \noutcomes. Certainly, parents hope they get outcomes so they don't \ncontinue to live at home. We all hope that we can get success for our \nyoung people, and we don't have the information to determine that.\n  Let me also stress that, beyond educational groups, veterans, the \nU.S. Chamber of Commerce and Business Roundtable have both endorsed \nthis bill as being critical to the success of our Nation going forward.\n  I want to stress for you and everyone in this Chamber, when you get \nthe level of support from such a broad range of people, we have to \nstart asking ourselves: Why have we not already moved on this? Why has \nit not already taken place? We need to move on this issue sooner rather \nthan later. We can't afford not to.\n  Let me talk about one other group that supports this bill \npassionately. Students want to know which schools are best fit for \ntheir needs. Deciding where to spend their time, their precious \ndollars, and incur debt is critically important to them.\n  Surprisingly enough, these folks want to do more than go to college, \nmeet new friends, and have a little party every now and then. The vast \nmajority--85 percent--of college freshmen rate getting a better job as \nvery important in their decision to go to college; yet the day-to-day \nneed, as we have talked about repeatedly tonight, to discern which \nprogram's institutions will best address that objective is lacking.\n  The ability to provide that information is at our hands. We have the \ntechnology. We have the data. We just don't provide it in a usable \nformat.\n  Groups that support this bill include the Big Ten Student \nAssociation, Campaign for College Opportunity, Young Invincibles, \nInstitute for College Access and Success, the United Negro College \nFund, Achieving the Dream, Student Affairs Administrators in Higher \nEducation, Institute for Higher Education Policy, and the National \nAssociation for College Admission Counseling. They support the College \nTransparency Act.\n  I would ask: How many more groups do we need to gather before we \ndecide to act here in Congress?\n\n\n  In the time I have left, I want to address some myths. And if my \ncolleague, Mr. Smucker, who is still here, wants to weigh in on this, I \ninvite him to join at any point in time he wants to weigh in, because \nwe heard a number of myths put forward about the terrible things that \nthe College Transparency Act may arise.\n  One that amazes me is that while the bill requires institutions \ncollect and report tons of new information on students--well, can we \nbring that chart back up of what we already collect? Let's look at that \ngem of what we collect currently. We are doing this now. Institutions \nare doing this now.\n  So tell me, how are we going to collect tons more? In fact, every \nstudent who attends a postsecondary education institution in the United \nStates has information reported on them now, whether they take student \nfinancial aid or not, because a 1098-T is filed by that institution \nwith the IRS so, in fact, if they claim credit for going to school, \ntuition tax credit, they can claim that.\n  There is no information that is not currently with one agency or \nanother. The astonishing thing is the discussion that somehow there is \nsome secret about whether someone is attending a postsecondary \ninstitution. It is astonishing.\n  College universities, also, because of this reporting, hold the \nstudent-level data. They report much of it to the Department of \nEducation, to NCES, and to the State Department of Education to \naccredit the agencies in a variety of formats. The number of formats, \nthe array of those, will totally amaze you. If you would like, I can \nget those reports for you. You can spend the afternoon looking through \nthe joys of reporting on educational activities in a postsecondary \ninstitution, and none of it makes any sense to anybody that isn't \nactually in the system, and I will admit, that data doesn't make any \nsense to me either.\n  Colleges and universities also don't know if their graduates actually \nget a job, unless half the students come back happily and say they went \nto work and how much they are making. They don't get that information. \nThey couldn't assist the student with that information if they tried in \nany accurate basis other than anecdotally. So they don't try. Why would \nyou? You wouldn't do that. You wouldn't make that mistake.\n  That information exists. Why? Because the IRS has a 1098-T on \neveryone who went to college or a postsecondary institution. That data \ncan be matched by the Treasury Department to whether that student is \nemployed, what they are making, and they can report that, as was noted \nearlier, through metadata to the Department of Education for \ndevelopment of reports without reporting one individual student's \ninformation.\n\n\n  So I am lost in understanding how it is we lose our minds around here \nabout student information being disseminated. It exists. It can be \nprotected.\n  Let me talk real briefly about another myth that exists, that somehow \ntracking the student data will lead to a Federal rating system, the \nFederal rating system of educational programs of institutions.\n  Well, first, the Department of Education has tried a number of rating \nsystems over there, all with mixed success, at best, and I am trying to \nbe polite. It is late in the evening. Let's not be too blunt. But they \nfailed miserably in doing so. They tried to rate institutions based on \ncohort default rates, and those are being repealed by many as being \ninaccurate.\n  They tried to rate institutions on something called gainful \nemployment, but they only do gainful employment for career schools, \nbecause, hey, you know, no one goes to a university for gainful \nemployment. I assure you, my guess is the Speaker did as well, you went \nto the university hoping for gainful employment. I doubt there is \nanyone in the room who didn't go to a college or university in hopes of \ngainful employment.\n  The reality is the Department of Education, as they have implemented \nthis, has tried to create these Federal rating systems and failed \nmiserably. So I tell you what, we did something unique. The College \nTransparency Act explicitly prohibits the creation of a single database \nby the Department of Education and expressly prohibits using that \ndatabase for a Federal rating system.\n  I give up. I don't want the Department of Education telling us what a \ngood education system is because look how well they have done so far. \nWe will let consumers decide. We will give them information so they can \ndecide. They can make a wise decision rather than thinking that Big \nBrother can make that decision for them.\n  If the government were doing so well with it, why is it that every \nMember in this room has heard from their employers the terrible \nshortage we have of people in current technical education, of workers? \nIf they were doing such a great job of ratings and informing people \nwhat their opportunities were, why are we currently struggling with the \nworkforce we have?\n  It is a disaster. Let's stop thinking we can fix it, and let's let \nconsumers have the information they need to fix it.\n  The bill enables the NCES to aggregate student information from \nrelevant agencies with the responsibility that they had to protect that \ndata, which they have done for years.\n  So now they are doing--not create some massive Federal database in \nwhich everybody's name, Social Security number, is accessible so we can \ndetermine whether or not you are a successful student. It doesn't do \nthat, not even close to that, never has. It provides information on an \naccurate basis by a program institution of what your likelihood of \nsuccess is.\n  Last but not least, I talked a little bit about it, is keeping \npersonal information private, the fears about privacy, and that somehow \nwe can't achieve that under the College Transparency Act.\n  The College Transparency Act requires that data collection should be \nled by the National Center for Education Statistics. I apologize. I \nhave been using the abbreviation NCES because it has been burned into \nmy memory over the years. It is a statistical agency with strong \nprotocols for securing data and protecting student privacy. It has an \nexcellent track record for doing so.\n\n  They have consulted with the private sector, pretty good folks, about \nhow to continue to work on student privacy in that data. NCES is \nalready required by law to develop and enforce standards to protect \nindividual level data. As added protection, the act requires, the \nCollege Transparency Act requires, an institute utilize the latest \nFederal data security standards developed by the National Institute of \nStandards and Technology. We require that they implement those on an \nongoing basis and they maintain those.\n  I have to tell you, Mr. Speaker, that is not commonplace in the \nFederal Government at this point. We are going a step beyond what \nhappens every day in many agencies.\n  Further, your personal information, Mr. Smucker's or anybody else's, \nwill never be available to the Department of Education or to the \npublic. Your employment status will never be available. What will be \navailable is whether all of us who took a program in Michigan State \nUniversity--come on up, you would love the school, some time--whether \nor not you graduated, you got a job, and whether you are gainfully \nemployed and making money. Now, wouldn't that be a great idea for the \nmoney you put into a college education? All the aggregate information \nis available on the programs and institutions we are talking about \nhere.\n  The data developed by the Treasury Department on income and \nemployment, once it is transmitted to NCES, is literally blown up. The \nfile no longer exists. You can't hack what isn't there.\n  So I would ask, at this point in time, rather than continue to extol \nthe virtues of the College Transparency Act, I would ask all the \nMembers to look at the act. We have a number of cosponsors at this \npoint in time that I am very proud of. It is a bipartisan bill. I would \nask them to look at the act, look at what it is achieving, and if they \nhave questions, let's hear those questions, and let's make an effort to \nmove this forward.\n  We are already well into the decisionmaking process for young people \nto go to a postsecondary education program next year. It is too late \nfor them to get this information, but, you know what, we can get it the \nfollowing year. And the question I would ask is: How long are we going \nto wait while we are spending $160 billion in direct student aid alone \nhoping to get an outcome when we can do better and the ability to do \nthat is at our fingertips?\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n", "turn": 11, "speaker": "Mr. MITCHELL", "itemno": 12}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 13}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "177", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H8369-H8374", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "1", "month": "November"}, "related_bills": [{"type": "S", "context": "OTHER", "congress": "115", "number": "1121"}, {"type": "HR", "context": "OTHER", "congress": "115", "number": "2434"}], "doc_title": "COLLEGES NEED TO BE MORE TRANSPARENT", "id": "CREC-2017-11-01-pt1-PgH8369-2"}
