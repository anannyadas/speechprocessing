Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor and recognize LTC \nJoseph McGrath for his induction into the Wisconsin Military Academy \nHall of Fame. LTC McGrath's long and distinguished career is \nhighlighted by the numerous accolades and successes he achieved during \nhis service in the United States Army and Wisconsin Army National \nGuard.\n   LTC McGrath has been an integral factor in protecting America's \nsecurity interests here at home, while also spreading peace around the \nworld. Following the tragic events of September 11, 2001, LTC McGrath \ndeployed to Nicaragua to help ensure the security of the Nicaraguan \nPresident and establish the future success of the joint Wisconsin-\nNicaragua partnership.\n   In 2004, LTC McGrath was deployed to Afghanistan to direct \noperations in support of the Kandak ETT comprised of American and \nCoalition partners. LTC McGrath was also instrumental in providing \ndirect liaison with the UN Ballot Counting teams, while also \ncoordinating physical security for the provincial ballot collection \ncompound during the Afghan Presidential election.\n   Upon his return to the United States, LTC McGrath's leadership led \nto the creation of the Warrant Officer Candidate School at the 426th \nRegiment, a fiscally responsible move that brought greater strength and \nsecurity to Wisconsin.\n   LTC McGrath received the Bronze Star, among many other awards, for \nhis honorable service and dedication to our country. LTC McGrath's \ncommitment and courage have left a profound impact on the men and women \nhe led and served with across the world, as well as continued security \nof our great nation.\n   Mr. Speaker, I urge all members of this body to join me in \ncommending LTC Joseph McGrath for his dedicated military service and \ncongratulate his induction into the Wisconsin Military Academy Hall of \nFame.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. GALLAGHER", "itemno": 4}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 5}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "177", "extension": true, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "E1475", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "1", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "IN RECOGNITION OF LTC JOSEPH McGRATH AND HIS INDUCTION INTO THE WISCONSIN MILITARY ACADEMY HALL OF FAME", "id": "CREC-2017-11-01-pt1-PgE1475-3", "title": null}
