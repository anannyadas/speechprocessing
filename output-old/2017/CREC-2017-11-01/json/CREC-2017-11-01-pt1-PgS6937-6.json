Mr. President, after 8 years of sluggish growth and \nmissed opportunities for the middle class under 8 years of the Obama \nadministration, the American people elected a new President and \nCongress dedicated to getting our country moving again after so many \nyears of failed leftwing policies. We are working hard on joint \nlegislative initiatives on tax reform.\n  We have also undertaken what has been described as ``the most \nambitious regulatory rollback since Reagan.'' The administration has \nthe ability to take serious action on its own, and it has. The Congress \nhas taken important action many times as well. We have used the tools \ncontained in the Congressional Review Act, which allows us to overturn \ncertain regulations with a majority vote in Congress and the \nPresident's signature. The President signed all of the many CRA \nresolutions we passed already, which overturned regulations that \nthreatened everything from job creation to economic growth.\n  The President will sign another CRA resolution today, one that will \noverturn a regulation that threatened to drive up costs for millions of \nAmericans who carry a credit card. It is a regulation dreamed up by a \ngovernment agency, the CFPB, that claims to protect consumers but seems \nto have found a way to actually harm them. The Treasury Department \nreleased a study showing how this regulation has little to do with \nconsumer protection and everything to do with lining the pockets of \ntrial lawyers. This unaccountable agency ignored that study and issued \nits regulation anyway.\n  We passed this Congressional Review Act resolution to protect \nconsumers from wrongdoing while avoiding frivolous lawsuits that will \nonly drive up costs for the millions of Americans who have a credit \ncard. The CFPB continues to be one of the most unaccountable \nbureaucracies in Washington, and this Congress will continue to stand \nup for consumers even when the CFPB will not.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. McCONNELL", "itemno": 0}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 1}], "header": {"chamber": "Senate", "num": "177", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "S6937", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "1", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "CONGRESSIONAL REVIEW ACT RESOLUTION", "id": "CREC-2017-11-01-pt1-PgS6937-6", "title": "CONGRESSIONAL REVIEW ACT RESOLUTION"}
