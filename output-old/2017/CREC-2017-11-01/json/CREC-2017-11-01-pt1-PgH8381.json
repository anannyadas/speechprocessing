Mr. Speaker, I am here this evening, along with my friend \nand colleague, Representative Brian Fitzpatrick, as we advocate for the \npassage of the Right to Try Act. This bill, which we introduced \ntogether, has dozens of bipartisan cosponsors, including Members here \ntonight.\n  We are both supportive of Senator Ron Johnson's efforts to champion \nRight to Try in the Senate. He has been a tireless advocate of Right to \nTry for years, and his bill has already passed the Senate with \nunanimous consent. If you are watching the Senate very closely, you \nwill know that nothing comes out of there, and certainly nothing with \nunanimous consent; so that tells how strong the sentiment is in favor \nof this bill.\n  Our legislation allows terminally ill patients who have no further \noptions left--I repeat that, no further options left--the opportunity \nto try experimental drugs that could save their own lives.\n  Yes, there are also provisions in our bill to protect both the \npatients, as well as the pharmaceutical companies who want to \nparticipate, but those provisions are secondary to the primary purpose \nof this legislation. The primary purpose of the Right to Try Act is to \ngive brave patients across this country some choice over their own \ndestinies, when all other avenues are gone.\n  We want to give hope to these Americans, and we should all share that \nsame goal of doing everything we can for patients fighting to save \ntheir lives. This policy has significant bipartisan support. The Trump \nadministration strongly supports Right to Try, and President Trump has \nindicated he would likely sign this bill into law.\n  Time is of the essence, for time is one thing a terminally ill \npatient does not have. And the status quo is not the answer. The FDA \nand other agency officials claim that their own expanded access program \nis working and continues to improve. There may be some truth to that, \nbut the program is simply not enough; and I know that because I have \ntalked to dozens and dozens of patients, family members, and advocates \nwho tell me it is not enough. They come to my office, they call me on \nthe phone, they write me impassioned letters.\n  These same advocates have ensured that Right to Try has become law in \n38 States. Think about that for a moment. With one more State, you \ncould actually ratify a Constitutional amendment. And in half of those \n38 States, Right to Try laws passed with unanimous support. In my home \nState of Arizona, voters approved that initiative by 80 percent of the \npopular vote.\n  At a time when pundits are claiming that our politics are broken, and \nRepublicans and Democrats can't come together on anything, here is a \ncause that Americans of all political stripes can unite in.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. \nFitzpatrick).", "turn": 3, "speaker": "Mr. BIGGS", "itemno": 4}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "F000466", "text": "  Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my friend and \ncolleague, Andy Biggs, for him joining all of us in this fight to stand \nup for terminally ill patients across this country.\n  Mr. Speaker, each year, more Americans receive the devastating news \nof a terminal diagnosis. Even with the amazing work done in American \nmedical research and development, for too many families, access to \nthese potentially lifesaving treatments will come too late or not at \nall.\n  Thousands of terminally ill patients, like my constituent, Matt \nBellina, suffer needlessly while awaiting final approval for drug \ntherapies and other medical technologies.\n  In April 2014, at age 30, Matt was diagnosed with ALS, otherwise \nknown as Lou Gehrig's disease. ALS attacks nerve cells in the brain and \nspinal cord, causing those with ALS to lose control of their muscles.\n  Although this disease stopped Matt's career as a U.S. Navy aviator in \nits tracks, he persisted and actively involved himself in the ALS \ncommunity as a strong advocate for Right to Try legislation.\n  While the Food and Drug Administration carries out its three-phase \napproval process, which can take years and cost billions of dollars, \nmany patients simply want the chance to try treatments that have \nalready been demonstrated to be safe.\n  A bill that was unanimously passed by the Senate will offer them a \nchance to extend their lives. The Right to Try Act, S. 204, would \nensure that terminally ill patients, together with their physicians and \npharmaceutical manufacturers, can administer investigational treatments \nwhere no alternative exists. In fact, this bipartisan idea is already \nthe law in 37 States.\n  A Federal Right to Try law would prevent the government from blocking \naccess to potentially lifesaving medications. It would require patients \nto first try all other available treatments and be unable to \nparticipate in clinical trials.\n  I want to note that these provisions only apply to terminally ill \npatients. It does not undo the FDA approval process but provides a \npotential lifeline for those who cannot wait. Moreover, it requires a \nphysician to certify that other options are either exhausted or \nunavailable.\n  This bill requires that a product meet a demonstrated level of safety \nby attaining FDA phase I approval. We have worked with the drug \ncompanies to ensure adverse outcomes are not used against the ongoing \napplication for approval. Additionally, patients, doctors, and \nmanufacturers do not assume any additional liability under this act.\n  For those patients caught in between the traditional drug approval \ndelays, a clinical trial process for which they do not qualify, and \nlimited time, the Right to Try simply establishes the freedom for \npatients and their doctors to try therapies where the benefits far \noutweigh the risks. It gives them the option of trying to save their \nlife.\n  Mr. Speaker, whether it is a father like Matt courageously battling \nALS, or a brave child living with Duchenne muscular dystrophy, they \ndeserve the right to try.\n\n", "turn": 4, "speaker": "Mr. FITZPATRICK", "itemno": 5}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "B001302", "text": "  Mr. BIGGS. Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Fitzpatrick; I appreciate all \nthat he has done and continues to do in this cause, this important \ncause. He is a great leader in this, and I am grateful for all of his \neffort here.\n  At this point, Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield to the gentleman \nfrom Florida (Mr. Gaetz).", "turn": 5, "speaker": "Mr. BIGGS", "itemno": 6}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "G000578", "text": "  Mr. GAETZ. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. I thank \nhim for\n\n\nhis leadership on this issue on behalf of the terminally ill. I would \nalso like to thank Senator Johnson for marshaling together the \nresources of the Senate to bring this legislation to a head.\n  I ran for public office because I was tired of the government playing \ntoo large a role in the decisions people make in their private lives, \nin their homes, and in their businesses. We live in a world today where \nthe government wants to tell you where you have got to send your kids \nto school, what kind of healthcare plan you have got to buy, what \nregulations you have to comply with, and how much money they are going \nto take out of your paycheck each and every month.\n  I certainly don't think the government ought to play a role in \ndeciding how someone deals with treatment at the end of life. That is \nwhy I am a proud cosponsor of the Right to Try Act with Representative \nBiggs, Representative Fitzpatrick, and so many others. My frustration \nlies with any regime, regulatory or otherwise, that would impair a \npatient's decision to use any medication to be able to alleviate their \nsymptoms or improve their quality of life in their final days.\n  It is absolutely ludicrous to me that, in today's world, we don't \nallow terminally ill people in every corner of this great country to be \nable to use medical cannabis to alleviate their pain and suffering, \nparticularly at the end of life.\n  It is so frustrating to me that the Federal Government has lied to \nthis country for a generation about medical cannabis, saying that it \nhas no medical value. Well, I can tell you, Mr. Speaker, that is \nabsolutely not true. I have met with patients in my district who have \nreceived terminal diagnoses, who have been told by their doctors not to \nbuy green bananas, and yet those folks courageously move forward trying \nto be a part of their own treatment and to be a part of their own \nclinical plan moving forward.\n  Too often, doctors, whether it is at the VA or in private practice, \naren't able to counsel their patients and give them advice and comfort \nthat there is a substance in medical cannabis which has proven in some \ncircumstances to have medical value.\n  Stage IV of terminal cancer includes symptoms like loss of appetite, \nwhich can be helped by cannabis, chronic pain, shortness of breath, \ndifficulty breathing, chemotherapy-induced nausea. All of these things \ncan be helped by medical cannabis.\n  Those who are in stage III of AIDS have sleeplessness and weight loss \nthat can be helped by medical cannabis.\n  Cannabis has shown great promise in the treatment of Alzheimer's, \nCrohn's Disease, multiple sclerosis, and epilepsy, where there are \nrefractory seizures, at times, 30 or 40 seizures a day.\n  Mr. Speaker, in this great country, we will have people who will \nreceive terminal diagnoses each and every day. I say let's get the \ngovernment out of their way. Let's let the decisions that impact the \nhealthcare of patients be made by those patients and their family \nmembers and their doctors, not a bunch of politicians and bureaucrats \nin Washington.\n  As people fall ill, it is my position that this Right to Try Act can \nhelp them, and certainly the inclusion of medical cannabis into this \nlegislation would make it a great deal more useful and a great deal \nbetter for those in pain.\n  I thank the gentleman from Arizona for yielding.", "turn": 6, "speaker": "Mr. GAETZ", "itemno": 7}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "B001302", "text": "  Mr. BIGGS.

Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank my colleague from \nArizona (Mr. Biggs) for hosting tonight's Special Order. I also thank \nMr. Fitzpatrick, as well, for his leadership in this bill. I am really \nglad to be part of this effort.\n  We could stand here tonight and talk about the FDA's process for \napproving drugs. We could talk about the countless patients across the \ncountry who struggle to get accepted into a clinical trial for a drug \nthat could save their life. We could even stand up here tonight and \nshare with you one of the uplifting stories of a patient who received a \nlifesaving drug because of a State's right-to-try law. But we have \nheard this, and we know all of this.\n  We know the FDA's approval process takes years. We know there are too \nfew spots in clinical trials for patients in dire need of help. We know \nthat right-to-try laws give families hope and can save lives. What I \nwould like to talk about tonight is the moral imperative we face on \nthis right-to-try legislation.\n  America is home to the world's greatest doctors and medical experts. \nIt is home to the world's greatest medical schools and hospitals. We \nhave cured diseases that were once a death sentence. We have directed \nour national resources to fight epidemics that have saved lives here at \nhome and overseas. We don't give up.\n  What we do here in this Chamber, Mr. Speaker, speaks volumes. What we \ndo here shows the Nation and the world where our priorities are.\n  Is our priority the bureaucracy of this city that too often misses \nopportunities simply because of its inability to act, or is our \npriority the patients and families whom we represent to consult with a \ndoctor and decide for themselves how they choose to fight against \nillnesses for which we continue to search for a cure?\n  For me, the choice is clear, Mr. Speaker. I choose my constituents. I \nchoose life, and I urge every single Member of this body to do the \nsame. We cannot afford the cost of inaction.\n", "turn": 8, "speaker": "Mr. SMUCKER", "itemno": 9}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "B001302", "text": "  Mr. BIGGS.

Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from Arizona for yielding.\n  What a great issue. As a conservative, I am an outspoken defender of \none's right to life. But being pro-life doesn't mean that I am just \nantiabortion. It also means that I support the right to try, because \nlife at all stages is worth fighting for.\n  Every year, over 1 million Americans die from terminal illnesses, \nmany of whom pass away while waiting for the FDA to approve a drug that \ncould dramatically change their prognosis, while others die in the \nhopeless cycle of trying and trying again to gain acceptance into a \nmedical trial.\n  Think about that: we are losing millions of Americans at the hands of \ngovernment red tape.\n  Now, as a healthcare provider for 25 years, I know firsthand how \nimportant innovation is to the medical community. The Right to Try Act, \nif made into law, will give hope to the child with leukemia whose \ndoctors have exhausted all other treatment options. It opens previously \nlocked doors by allowing healthcare providers to try experimental drugs \nas a last-ditch effort for survival.\n  The experiments that the Right to Try Act will allow for have the \npotential to lead to many more birthdays, more piano recitals, and more \ncamping trips, and offer hope for our future, hope for years to come.\n  But don't take my word for it. Emily Whitehead was merely 5 years old \nwhen she was diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and her \ndoctors quickly realized that she was among a small percentage of \npatients whose disease was seemingly untouchable by chemotherapy. The \nWhiteheads were at the end of their rope. The little girl's body was \nresisting chemotherapy, and the window for many more birthdays, more \npiano recitals, and more camping trips was wearing thin. Their only \noption was to join a clinical trial that experimented with T-cell \ntherapy, where Emily could be the first pediatric patient to undergo \nthis treatment.\n  And do you know what? It worked. Three years later, a groundbreaking \nstudy was conducted where 63 patients received T-cell therapy for 1 \nyear, and 52 of them became cancer free, an absolutely unheard-of \nstatistic with this deadly strain of leukemia.\n  Think about that: 52 lives were saved; 52 families were given another \nbirthday, another piano recital, and another camping trip.

Mr. Speaker, in closing, I want to mention how I came to \nreally be converted to the cause of right to try.\n  I served in the Arizona State Legislature with Laura Knaperek, who \nwas also serving in the legislature when I first met her. By 2014, she \nwas no longer serving in the State legislature. She was an advocate. \nThat year, Laura was in the fight of her life against ovarian cancer, \nand her mission was to see right-to-try legislation passed into law.\n  In the end, her efforts for this cause succeeded beyond everyone's \nwildest expectations when 80 percent of the electorate in Arizona voted \nto enact right to try. But, unfortunately, Laura is not with us because \nshe lost her brave battle with cancer last year. Her legacy as a \ntireless patient advocate lives on.\n  I will continue to carry on the fight not just for Laura Knaperek, \nbut for all those patients across this country who are battling against \nthe odds every day.\n  I am joined by those who are here tonight, those who have cosponsored \nthis bill, and many other advocacy groups, such as the Goldwater \nInstitute in Arizona that continues to fight for this.\n  I fight for Bertrand Might. Bertrand is a very special little boy. He \nwas the first person ever to be diagnosed with a rare, fatal genetic \ndisorder called NGLY1 that has left this 7-year-old paralyzed. Because \nthe disease was only identified by scientists in 2012 and only a few \npeople worldwide have been diagnosed with it, there is no cure and no \ntreatment available. Because the disorder is so rare, a drug may never \nbe developed to treat it.\n  But scientists have found that Bertrand responds to certain \ninvestigational therapies. So Bertrand's family will have to rely on \ntrying those new investigational medications as long as they have \naccess to them. That is why we need this right-to-try legislation.\n  I fight for Jordan McLinn. Seven-year-old Jordan says he wants to \ngrow up to be a firefighter so he can save lives. He has Duchenne \nmuscular dystrophy, which could leave him paralyzed within 5 years and \nshortens his life expectancy to only 20 years. There is a drug now \nbeing used in clinical trials that is helping young people like Jordan, \nbut it could take another 7 years for that drug to be available on the \nmarket. His parents cannot afford to wait for the FDA to give that drug \nits final approval. He could be in a wheelchair by then. This \ninvestigational drug could add years to Jordan's life, which would give \nhim the chance to save others.\n  We have already heard, when Representative Fitzpatrick discussed Matt \nBellina, his needs and his advocacy. We fight for him, and we fight for \nMikaela Knapp.\n  At 24, Mikaela was diagnosed with a deadly form of kidney cancer that \nhad already migrated into her bones before she even knew she was sick. \nShe went through every known treatment in a matter of months and \nnothing worked. Her high school sweetheart, Keith, heard about a drug \nunder development that was successfully treating people with this same \ncancer, but Mikaela was not allowed to enroll in the clinical trial. \nMikaela and Keith launched a social media campaign to try to get access \nto the drug, but it wasn't enough. The FDA didn't help.\n\n  Mikaela died on April 24, 2014. Five months later, on September 4, \nthe FDA gave final approval to the drug that might have saved her.\n  I fight for Diego Morris. When he was 10 years old, Diego woke up \nwith a sore leg that his mom thought was just another sports injury, \nbut the pain didn't go away. They knew something was wrong, but they \nnever expected osteosarcoma, a rare form of bone cancer.\n  After exhausting all treatments available, Diego's doctors \nrecommended he try mifamurtide, which wasn't available in the United \nStates but was being safely used and had been given the Prix Galien \nAward, the gold medal for pharmaceutical development in England. The \nMorris family wasted no time and made the move abroad to try to save \nDiego's life. The treatments worked. Now Diego is back home in Phoenix \nand back to playing his favorite sports.\n  We fight unitedly for the countless other patients who deserve a \nright to try. We must act without further delay. Again, I thank those \nwho have been here to testify tonight.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n", "turn": 13, "speaker": "Mr. BIGGS", "itemno": 14}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 15}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "177", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H8381-H8383", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "1", "month": "November"}, "related_bills": [{"type": "S", "context": "OTHER", "congress": "115", "number": "204"}], "doc_title": "ADVOCATING FOR PATIENTS' RIGHT TO TRY", "id": "CREC-2017-11-01-pt1-PgH8381"}
