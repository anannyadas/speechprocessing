Mr. Speaker, well, not surprisingly, Republicans have had \nto delay the release of their tax plan because it is so deeply \nunpopular. We haven't seen all of the details yet, but what we know \nabout it is that this is really bad for working families.\n  The nonpartisan Tax Policy Center says that the Republican plan \nraises taxes on many middle class families to pay for a massive tax cut \nfor the people at the very top, the wealthiest Americans.\n  The details matter. A family of four earning $50,000 could see their \ntaxes go up 380 percent. Meanwhile, 80 percent of the benefits of this \n``billionaires first'' tax plan go to the richest 1 percent--80 percent \nof the benefits to the richest 1 percent. That is not middle class tax \nrelief.\n  And how do we pay for these massive tax cuts to the wealthy? What are \nwe going to do?\n  We are going to see cuts in Medicare, Medicaid, and education.\n  If anybody thinks we can do this and go big on infrastructure and \nrebuild America's capacity to produce, they better think twice. Plus, \nsaddling our grandkids with a huge debt.\n  What happened to the deficit hawks in this place?\n  This is wrong, and we ought to reject it.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. KILDEE", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "177", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H8307", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "1", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "BIPARTISAN TAX REFORM", "id": "CREC-2017-11-01-pt1-PgH8307", "title": "BIPARTISAN TAX REFORM"}
