Since its inception, this program has allowed schools in \nevery State to gain recognition for educational accomplishments, \nparticularly in closing the achievement gaps among students.\n  College Wood's mission is to provide opportunities for all students \nto realize their potential. College Wood students have consistently \nranked among the top 10 percent in annual standardized testing. By \nencouraging every student to strive for excellence, explore \nopportunities, and realize their full potential, College Wood students \nare equipped to succeed and graduate.\n  College Wood strives to provide a quality, well-rounded education and \nteach students the traits of successful leaders and communicators.
