Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate the important \nmark that Ioannis Ioannopoulos had on American society, as the original \nfounder of one of the oldest known wooden school houses in the country. \nIn order to fully understand the cultural motivation to establish this \nhistoric treasure, one must examine Ioannopoulos's early life. A \ncarpenter by trade, Ioannis Ioannopoulos was the son of George and \nMaria-Canelas and hailed from the Petalidi area in Messinia that was \nthen known as ``Koroni'' (the village of Skoutari, Mani). He was known \nby the Spanish as Juan Genopoly. Ioannopoulos--at the age of 13--was \none of a group of indentured laborers brought to the New World by \nAndrew Turnbull to work an indigo plantation at New Smyrna. This group \nof 1,403 Minorcans, Greeks and Italians suffered mistreatment, \nstarvation and overextended servitudes at Turnbull's plantation. The \npeople were reduced to slavery, and treated with great cruelty by \nTrumbull, whose partner in the enterprise was the English Governor of \nthe territory, who kept the colonists in subjection with English \ntroops. This slavery lasted nine years, during which time nearly two-\nthirds of these colonists perished; but large crops of indigo were \nraised for the company--one year 30,000 lbs. it is stated.\n  In 1776, a new Governor having arrived, the petitions of these people \nfor relief were listened to, and they were released from the tyranny of \ntheir master. One year later six hundred refugees, led by Ioannis \nIoannopoulos, Francisco Pellicer and Antonio Llambias, walked to St \nAugustine and were granted asylum by Governor Tonyn. They became the \nlargest group of immigrants to settle in America in one group at one \ntime. Collectively called ``Minorcans'', they were an important part of \nthe fabric of St. Augustine history. It was on Saint George Street \nwhere the survivors of the New Smyrna Colony first settled after their \nescape. Since that time, this area of Old St. Augustine has been called \n``the Greek Quarter'' and alternately ``the Minorcan Quarter.''\n  Ioannis Giannopoulos built a little house out of red cedar and \ncypress and put it together with wooden pegs and handmade nails, \nsometime around 1800. This building was a home first but, as early as \n1811, members of the Genopoly family taught the children of other \nMinorcan families in the first floor ``schoolroom'' of this building. \nAs the story goes, Genopoly, in typical Greek fashion, was worried his \nchildren would grow up without an education. Genopoly and his daughter \nMaria Manuela Barbara ``Mary'' Genopoly Darling were the first \nteachers. Then Genopoly hired a school teacher, and generations of \nchildren from St. Augustine went to school in this building. Juan \nGenopoly died in 1820.\n  Today, this preserved building is recognized as one of the oldest \nschoolhouses in North America. It has become the symbol of their hard \nwork and perseverance. It's now the main attraction of the historical \nprecinct in St. George Street, Saint Augustine, Florida. John \nGiannopoulos left a deep imprint in the educational history of St. \nAugustine by establishing a school in his house. Now restored, it \nstands as one of the oldest school buildings in the United States.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. BILIRAKIS", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 3}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "177", "extension": true, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "E1479", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "1", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "HONORING IOANNIS IOANNOPOULOS", "id": "CREC-2017-11-01-pt1-PgE1479", "title": "HONORING IOANNIS IOANNOPOULOS"}
