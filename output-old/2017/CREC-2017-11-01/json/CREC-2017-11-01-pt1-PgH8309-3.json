Mr. Speaker, on Tuesday, just yesterday, the Rules \nCommittee met and reported a rule, House Resolution 595, providing for \nconsideration of an important piece of legislation, H.R. 2936, the \nResilient Federal Forests Act of 2017.\n  The rule provides for consideration of H.R. 2936 under a structured \nrule, with four Democratic amendments made in order and two bipartisan \namendments and one Republican-led amendment made in order.\n  Mr. Speaker, this rule provides for consideration of H.R. 2936, the \nResilient Federal Forests Act of 2017, a bill that is critically \nimportant to my district in central Washington State and to rural, \nforested districts like it across the United States who continue to \nface devastation from catastrophic wildfires as we have seen, just this \nlast year, a great example of.\n  This bipartisan, comprehensive legislation is aimed at addressing the \ndisastrous consequences of wildfires by utilizing the tools the Forest \nService and other agencies have to reduce the threats posed by these \nwildfires, by insects, by disease infestation, and by dangerous old \nforest overgrowth that serves as a literal tinderbox for wildfires. \nThis legislation will expedite and improve forest management activities \nin Federal forests to counteract these threats.\n  This legislation, spearheaded by my friend and colleague from \nArkansas, Representative Bruce Westerman, who is a trained forester \nhimself, is comprised of a truly comprehensive effort developed here in \nthe people's House. It is bipartisan. This bipartisan support \ndemonstrates that the threat of catastrophic wildfires does not just \nimpact a red or a blue district, but, rather, it poses a threat to \ncommunities across the United States.\n\n\n\n\n\n  H.R. 2936 would provide Federal land management agencies immediate \ntools to increase the pace and the scale of forest management projects \nto dramatically improve the health and resiliency of our national \nforests, ensuring robust protection of the environment. Active \nmanagement leads to healthier forests. It is that simple.\n  This legislation also allows expedited review for collaborative \nprojects in Federal forests and removes incentives for special interest \ngroups to file frivolous lawsuits. By requiring litigants opposing \nactive management projects to propose an alternative management option, \nwe can instill accountability into a system that is wrought with \nlitigation.\n  Additionally, the legislation bolsters locally led forest management \nand hazardous fuel reduction projects to improve forest health.\n  By engaging local stakeholders, we can lessen the severity and the \ncosts of wildfires, while protecting the communities and the \nenvironment.\n  Mr. Speaker, another major component of our Nation's wildfire crisis \nis the broken system with which we fund firefighting suppression. When \nthese firefighting costs exceed the existing budget, the U.S. Forest \nService transfers funds from other vital forest management program \naccounts in order to pay for wildfire suppression. I and a lot of other \npeople in this Chamber have been outspoken critics of this dangerous \nbroken cycle known as fire borrowing. That also is a very bipartisan \nposition that is taken. H.R. 2936 provides a major step forward in \nending this cycle. By raiding accounts that provide for forest \nmanagement programs which help prevent wildfires, we tie one hand \nbehind our back in an effort to both prevent and suppress these \ncatastrophic wildfires. This legislation will help to put an end to \nthis longstanding problem.\n  Mr. Speaker, my constituents know as well as anyone the immense \nthreat that wildfires pose to local communities. In just the past 4 \nyears, the fourth district of my State, my district, has seen the two \nlargest fires in Washington State's history. We have lost hundreds of \nhomes and businesses and structures. My constituents are still \nstruggling to recover from the Carlton Complex Fire of 2014 and the \nOkanogan Complex Fire of 2015. We lost three firefighters that year. \nThat truly is a high cost.\n  Active forest management is a matter of saving lives and livelihoods, \nof protecting our communities, and ensuring our constituents' health \nand safety, which is why I am proud to support this rule and the \nunderlying legislation that it represents today.\n  Mr. Speaker, as I have often said, we cannot continue to limp from \none devastating fire season to the next. We must take significant steps \ntoward reforestation, rehabilitation, and overall forest management. \nThis legislation will allow us to do just that. We must begin to \nprevent, to suppress, to mitigate the threat of catastrophic wildfires, \nand the Resilient Federal Forests Act of 2017 will be a momentous \nopportunity to turn around our diseased and overgrown Federal forests. \nThis legislation is essential and desperately needed to change the \ncurrent path of forest management on public lands. It is outdated, \nunsustainable, and dangerous.\n  Mr. Speaker, this is a straightforward rule allowing for \nconsideration of this critical piece of legislation that will help \nprotect our rural communities and ensure that we are prepared to \nrespond to devastating and catastrophic wildfires that have plagued \nmany areas of our country in the last few years.\n  Mr. Speaker, I support the rule's adoption, I urge my colleagues to \nsupport both the rule and the underlying bill.\n  Mr. Speaker, before I yield to my colleague from Florida, I would \nlike to share one last note. Just a few weeks ago, the new chief of the \nU.S. Forest Service, Tony Tooke, came to Capitol Hill and briefed some \nof my colleagues, including me, regarding this year's devastating \nwildfire season.\n  He reported to us that over 8 million acres, just this year, have \nburned. We have also lost dozens of lives, thousands of homes. Chief \nTooke left us with the stark fact that while more than 8 million acres \nburned this year, another 80 million acres across the United States are \nat high risk of catching fire--80 million acres. Mr. Speaker, if that \ndoes not show how dire this problem is, then I certainly can't tell you \nwhat does.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.", "turn": 5, "speaker": "Mr. NEWHOUSE", "itemno": 9}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "H000324", "text": "  Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, before beginning my remarks, I would offer condolences \nto the grieving families who lost loved ones in yesterday's terrorist \nattack in New York City, and to have the people of New York know--and I \nknow I speak for all of us, and there will be a more appropriate \nrecognition at a time in the future, I am sure, but to have them know \nthat all of us grieve with them and are concerned not only for those \nwho lost their lives, but to assist in preventing measures of this type \nin the future.\n  Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from Washington for yielding to me the \ncustomary 30 minutes for debate.\n  This bill is a sweeping attack on responsible forest management \npolicy that upends key environmental safeguards, limits public \nparticipation in land management decisions, and prioritizes commercial \ntimber harvest over transparent, science-based management. In other \nwords, this is business as usual for this Republican majority when it \ncomes to protecting our environment.\n  A footnote right there, my friend from the State of Washington does \nhighlight, rightly, concerns not only for his congressional district, \nbut areas throughout the country that have experienced wildfires.\n  Many of us have talked about this in conjunction with other disasters \nand a need for this Congress to be able to address the shortfall in \nfunding for such important measures.\n  During this Congress alone, my Republican friends have brought to the \nfloor bills that undermine the ability of the Environmental Protection \nAgency to issue independent and objective scientific conclusions, \nweaken regulations of pesticides, and repeal rulemakings aimed at \neffective, science-based management of public lands, just to name a few \nthings.\n\n  Repeatedly, my Republican friends ignore science and attack \nenvironmental protections all in an all-too-obvious attempt to help \ncommercial interests over sound conservation policy. This focus not \nonly undermines our public lands, but it also harms the health and \nsafety of the American people.\n  This bill continues the assault on our Nation's environmental \nprotections, and it may be one of the most irresponsible examples yet.\n  Under the guise of responding to the recent tragic wildfires in \nCalifornia and elsewhere in this Nation, this legislation attacks the \nNational Environmental Policy Act, known as NEPA, which requires \nFederal agencies to assess the environmental effects of their actions.\n  The bill also attacks the Endangered Species Act by requiring \nredundant and unnecessary reporting requirements. It blocks access to \nthe courts and limits recovery in environmental justice cases. Just for \ngood measure, this bill effectively overturns President Obama's \nadministration's monument expansion.\n  The bill does little to fix the true problem of wildfire management, \nnamely the chronic underfunding of wildfire management. Any serious \nproposal must address the constant funding shortages at the U.S. Forest \nService by increasing the amount of Federal funding available for \nwildfire suppression. A successful solution needs to provide advanced \naccess to emergency funding.\n  Unfortunately, today's legislation does no such thing. Yesterday, the \nadministration offered its statement of administration policy, and, at \nbest, it is tepid. It says, ``The administration appreciates the intent \nof H.R. 2936 . . . and is supportive of land management reforms like \nthose outlined in the legislation,'' and then comes the however. ``The \nadministration, however, has concerns about the legislation's revisions \nto the Stafford Act, which would force competition for funding between \nwildfires on Federal land and other disasters already covered by the \nStafford Act, including hurricanes.''\n  It goes on to say, `` . . . the administration supports a separate, \nannual cap\n\n\nadjustment for wildfire suppression operations, which will resolve \nconcerns about the sufficiency of funds for wildfire suppression and \navoid unnecessary competition for Stafford Act funds.''\n  Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record the Statement of Administration \nPolicy.\n\n                   Statement Of Administration Policy\n\n\nH.R. 2936--Resilient Federal Forests Act of 2017--Rep. Westerman R-AR, \n                             and cosponsors\n\n       The Administration strongly believes that funding for \n     wildland fire management must be addressed in order to enable \n     the Forest Service and the Department of the Interior to \n     better manage the Nation's forests and other public lands. \n     The Administration's second disaster funding request, \n     submitted to Congress on October 4, 2017, underscored this \n     belief. The request also noted the Administration's belief \n     that land management reforms are critical to solving the \n     problem of ``fire borrowing''--taking funds from forest \n     management programs to cover fire costs that exceed \n     appropriations--in a comprehensive manner, rather than \n     through a funding-only appropriations approach.\n       The Administration appreciates the intent of H.R. 2936, the \n     Resilient Federal Forests Act of 2017, and is supportive of \n     land management reforms like those outlined in the \n     legislation. The Administration, however, has concerns about \n     the legislation's revisions to the Stafford Act, which would \n     force competition for funding between wildfires on Federal \n     land and other disasters already covered by the Stafford Act, \n     including hurricanes.\n     Wildland Fire Management Funding\n       Last year, Federal wildfire suppression spending reached \n     $2.9 billion, an amount that signals clearly the need for \n     Congress to address the rising cost of fire suppression \n     operations. The dependence on ``fire borrowing'' to cover \n     funding shortfalls in times of severe wildfire impedes the \n     missions of our land management agencies, including by taking \n     critical funding from programs that help reduce the risk of \n     catastrophic fire, restore and maintain healthy functioning \n     ecosystems, and yield timber production.\n       The Administration, however, has concerns with re-purposing \n     the Stafford Act to address wildfires. The purpose of the \n     Stafford Act is to assist State, local, tribal, and \n     territorial (SLTT) governments that become overwhelmed when \n     responding to and recovering from natural disasters affecting \n     their jurisdictions. H.R. 2936 would modify the Stafford Act \n     by creating a new type of disaster declaration to address the \n     cost of wildfire suppression on Federal land, thereby \n     changing long-standing principles governing Federal support \n     to SLTT governments. As we have seen in this year's historic \n     Atlantic hurricane season, the Federal Emergency Management \n     Agency (FEMA) must continue to be focused on its existing \n     mission, and the Stafford Act's Disaster Relief Fund must \n     remain dedicated solely to that mission.\n       Instead of the approach outlined in H.R. 2936, the \n     Administration supports a separate, annual cap adjustment for \n     wildfire suppression operations, which will resolve concerns \n     about the sufficiency of funds for wildfire suppression and \n     avoid unnecessary competition for Stafford Act funds.\n     Improving Forest Management\n       The Administration appreciates H.R. 2936's recognition that \n     fixing the funding component of fire borrowing will not, on \n     its own, stop the worsening trend of catastrophic wildfires. \n     Meaningful forest management reforms to strengthen our \n     ability to restore the Nation's forests and improve their \n     resilience to destructive wildfires must be a part of any \n     permanent solution. H.R. 2936's provisions that expedite \n     environmental approval for proactive forest management, \n     including hazardous fuel reduction and post-fire timber \n     salvage and reforestation actions, are important steps \n     forward. The Administration supports and will continue to \n     work with Congress on the details of the forest management \n     reform proposals.\n       Although the Administration has concerns with H.R. 2936's \n     modifications to the Stafford Act, the Administration will \n     continue working with Congress to enact a sustainable \n     solution to ``fire borrowing'' that does not adversely affect \n     FEMA's critical disaster relief funding and that recognizes \n     the need for a comprehensive solution to the problem of \n     wildfires.\n", "turn": 6, "speaker": "Mr. HASTINGS", "itemno": 10}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "H000324", "text": "  Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, as I indicated, the bill does little to \nfix the true problem of wildfire management. Any serious proposal, as I \nhave said, must address the constant funding shortages, and that is \nwhat, among other things, the administration suggested.\n  Mr. Speaker, this year has been a wake-up call. We must do more to \nrespond to the natural disasters that face our Nation. After three \nmajor hurricanes and devastating wildfires in my friend from \nWashington's State, in California, in Montana, and even in the \nEverglades of Florida we have experienced some wildfires, albeit not at \nthe magnitude of loss of life or property as existed in some of the \nothers, our resources and agencies are stretched to the brink.\n  Weeks after the storms, millions of people across the Virgin Islands \nand Puerto Rico are without power and without reliable access to clean \ndrinking water. FEMA Administrator Brock Long testified just yesterday \nthat the response to these storms and wildfires and other disasters--we \nhave had tornadoes that have come along as well--is costing the Federal \nGovernment $200 million a day.\n  Mr. Speaker, I understand that the Office of Management and Budget is \ncurrently working to send a proposal to Congress for a third \nsupplemental spending package to address the recovery needs in the \naffected areas. I urge them and my colleagues here in Congress to act \nswiftly to provide the resources that so many people desperately need. \nIn the meantime, what have we gotten from Republicans? Bipartisanship? \nSound science-based proposals? No. Instead, the Republican majority has \nignored bipartisanship, and, yesterday, in the Rules Committee, a \nbipartisan measure was offered that was a thoughtful proposal on this \ntopic, and was rejected, and presented this bill that we have here now \nthat doesn't address the real issues facing public land and wildfire \nmanagement, but, rather, guts environmental protection and overturns \nPresident Obama's monument expansion.\n\n\n  Mr. Speaker, this is business as usual for House Republicans. But if \nwe are going to seriously address natural disasters and how we respond \nto them, I encourage my friends on the other side of the aisle to put \naside their partisanship, reconsider their denial of climate change and \nits effects on our environment, and join Democrats in working together \nto address this and other important issues faced by all Americans.\n  There were two amendments that were offered yesterday by my \ncolleagues from California. Both of those amendments were not made in \norder.

They at least should have had an opportunity to offer up their \namendment and have it voted against if people felt so here in this \nbody.\n  I would hope, in the future, we would make a correction of that kind \nof undertaking.

Brothers, sisters, sons, and daughters, are terrified \nthat they might lose their loved ones any minute. Parents are afraid to \ntake their children to the hospital or to school, and breadwinners \ndon't know whether they will be able to continue to earn a paycheck to \nsupport themselves and their families.\n  For 57 days, the Republican-controlled Congress has been silent, \ndoing nothing to provide certainty for 800,000 American DREAMers who \nare caught up in Congressional dysfunction. Without a permanent \nlegislative fix, these young Americans, like Maritza from Texas, will \nbe at risk of detention and deportation.\n  Maritza works part time to help her pay for college so she can pursue \nher dream career in journalism after graduation. Over months, she and \nher family saved up $1,000 to pay for an attorney and the DACA program \napplication fee. All she needed was her school to provide her records \nso she could finish her application.\n  But then Hurricane Harvey hit and flooded her family's home in east \nHouston and shut down school for 2 weeks. While Maritza and her mother \nwere recovering from Harvey's devastation, they were the victims \nof another disaster, but this one was created by their own government.\n\n  They watched Attorney General Jeff Sessions announce on live TV that \nthe Trump administration was ending DACA and cutting off new \napplications for young immigrants just like her. The devastating news \ncrushed Maritza and her family. Now they and countless others have \nwaited 57 days for us to fix it.\n  Today we have the opportunity to uphold our values and to pass the \nDream Act so that these young Americans aren't waiting in fear any \nlonger.\n  Mr. Speaker, there is a quote directly above your chair from Daniel \nWebster imploring us to do ``something worthy to be remembered.''\n  So how will we be remembered?

If there is an issue that I \nunderstand that comes before this Congress, it is our forests.\n  As I listen to accusations from across the aisle, I trust my \ncolleagues are not intentionally trying to mislead, but they seem to \nknow so much about just what isn't so. This is a bipartisan bill with \nDemocratic cosponsors and it is based on sound scientific management.\n  Mr. Speaker, we are on the floor today to debate a rule and, as you \nknow, this rule is part of the process of the House of Representatives \nthat will conclude later this afternoon with votes not only on this \nrule, but eventually on the underlying legislation.\n  The process of moving this bill through the House began earlier this \nyear, as I and a number of Members representing multiple committees \ntalked about and debated different ideas and what we hoped for in a \nfinal piece of legislation. After hundreds of meetings with \nstakeholders on all sides of this issue, on both sides of the aisle,\n\n\nand countless hours of work by Members and staff alike, I believe that \nthe House stands ready to vote to improve the condition of our national \nforest land.\n  However, the hard work of everyone involved will be for naught if the \nSenate fails to act. For that reason, I encourage our colleagues in the \nSenate to take up this legislation, debate it, offer solutions, and act \nto make a difference on our national forests and our rural communities.\n  Mr. Speaker, let's be clear. Our national forests are in the poorest \ncondition this Nation has ever seen, and will continue to degrade if we \nfail to act and complete the work that has started here. However, I \nbelieve that we have reason to be encouraged. The Senate Environment \nand Public Works Committee recently held a hearing on a discussion \ndraft that includes similar forest management provisions as H.R. 2936, \nand I know the other committees of jurisdiction are working on forest \nreform legislation as well.\n\n\n  This is not only a forest health issue; it is a public health issue \nthat demands action. Shame on us if we continue to stand idly by and \nwatch our treasured national forests go up in smoke while people suffer \nand die. I stand here today to encourage the House to adopt this rule \nand pass this bill, therefore allowing the United States Senate to take \nup the legislation, or, at the very least, something similar to it. \nPass it and allow us to meet at conference and work out the \ndifferences.

These fires are deadly, and, tragically, more than 40 people lost \ntheir lives when fast-moving wildfires swept through northern \nCalifornia just a few weeks ago.\n  Mr. Speaker, we have particularly felt the effects in my State of \nWyoming, where we find ourselves in an absolutely indefensible \nsituation. Fires are being caused and worsened by Federal \nmismanagement. Eight years of Federal policy opposing proven methods of \nforest management and, instead, focusing on efforts to prevent all \nhuman use of our forests have done significant damage.\n  This damage is not just to the forests that we have had to watch \nburn, Mr. Speaker, but we have also seen tremendous damage to our water \nin postfire situations where the water is contaminated with ash; \nsignificant damage to wildlife habitat, the health of our forests, to \nproperty, and, most importantly, Mr. Speaker, to human life.\n  Under the bad policies and the mismanagement from the Federal \nGovernment, we have seen our forests become overgrown, accumulating \nunsafe levels of hazardous biofuels that have become an absolute \ntinderbox for these fires. We must take action now.\n  This bill, as my colleagues have pointed out, is a bipartisan effort \nto begin to take the steps we know will help reduce hazardous fuels and \nimprove the management of our forests. We must also act, Mr. Speaker, \nas a Congress, to fix the fire-borrowing issue.

The one on the Oregon side was \nterribly dangerous, man-caused, human-caused. It blew out 14 miles in \none night headed toward Portland.\n\n  These are monster fires. We lost 678,000 acres this year to forest \nfires in my great State of Oregon. It is about two-thirds of the entire \nsize of the State of Rhode Island. It is enormous. This is happening \nyear after year, and the consequences are extraordinary.\n  Smoke chokes our airsheds. Schools literally had to shut down and \nsend kids home because it was too smoky to have them inside the school. \nThe 30th anniversary of Cycle Oregon was canceled. That is a major \nannual bicycle ride that occurs; 30 years, the 30th anniversary, \ncanceled. They couldn't find a way to pull it off. The Shakespeare \nFestival down in Ashland, nine performances had to be canceled; \n$400,000, Mr. Speaker, just in ticket receipts that had to be foregone. \nI am told they had to lay off people as a result.\n  When you think about not only the lost forests--this is what a forest \nlooks like after it is burned--the ground is often sterilized. You \ncan't even go back and replant for a year or two in some cases because \nthere is no soil left.\n  The impacts are enormous on our environment. Those of us who are \nconcerned about the environment, about carbon emissions into the \natmosphere,\n\n\nin 2015, when a like amount was burned in Oregon, the Forest Service \nestimated the blazes emitted more than 90,000 tons of fine particulates \nand 14.2 million tons of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. That is \nequivalent to more than 3 million cars; 3 million cars.\n  The cause of these increasingly catastrophic fires, as Dr. John \nBailey of the Oregon State University's College of Forestry pointed out \nduring a hearing earlier this month in our Energy and Commerce \nCommittee, in some cases, the forest landscapes in my part of Oregon, \neastern Oregon that would have historically held about 20 trees per \nacre, have more than 1,000 trees growing there today.\n  You see, we have stopped management. In many cases, we have stopped \nfire. The forests continue to grow, and die, and build, and get more \ndense, and so when fire does strike, it is with devastating \nconsequence.\n  My friend from Florida, and he is my friend, when he gets \nthunderstorms in Florida in the summer, he gets a lot of rain with it, \nI bet. If we have thunderstorms in Oregon, we don't get the rain. We \nwent nearly 90 days without any rain, but we still got lightning.

And smoke. Just like every \n     other season of the year.\n       The Methow Valley's clean, clear air--one of its key \n     attractions--is anything but clean and clear for extended \n     periods of the year. In fact, the Methow Valley has four \n     seasons of smoke, said Liz Walker, head of the Methow Valley \n     Clean Air Project.\n       And it is not insignificant amounts of smoke, Walker said. \n     Air pollution in Twisp is among the worst in the state, based \n     on data from the Washington Department of Ecology.\n       Each season in the Methow Valley brings its own source of \n     air pollution. In recent years, the all-too-familiar pall of \n     wildfire smoke has hung over the valley for days or weeks \n     during summer. As wildfires are put out by cooler, wet \n     weather of fall, the valley enters another phase of smoke \n     produced by prescribed burning in national forests, outdoor \n     burn piles and wood stoves for home heating.\n       In spring, prescribed burning begins again, as well as more \n     burn piles. ``Maybe a respite in June and early July, and \n     then wildfire season will be upon us,'' Walker said.\n       Although wildfire season can bring health-threatening \n     amounts of smoke to the valley, like last summer's Diamond \n     Creek Fire, poor air quality is a real concern in winter as \n     well, Walker said. ``We're susceptible to inversions and \n     stagnation in the winter months'' that trap wood stove smoke \n     on the valley floor, she said.\n       Smoke is the air pollutant of greatest concern in the \n     Methow Valley, and is monitored by the Department of Ecology. \n     It is known as PM2.5, which means particulate matter that is \n     2.5 microns or smaller. These tiny particles are most \n     frequently caused by incomplete combustion, and can stay \n     airborne and can travel long distances, increasing the \n     likelihood that humans and animals will inhale them.\n       Data collected by a Department of Ecology air monitor in \n     Twisp ranked air quality at that site among the eight most-\n     polluted places in the state in 2016, Walker said. ``By \n     several of the measures the Department of Ecology uses to \n     look at PM2.5 pollution reported at air quality monitors \n     across the state, Twisp ranks among the worst in air \n     pollution--worse than metro Seattle or Tacoma. This is even \n     after PM2.5 from wildfire smoke is subtracted out,'' Walker \n     said.\n       There was insufficient data from the air pollution monitor \n     in Winthrop to assess air quality there last year, ``but it \n     is typically only slightly better than Twisp,'' Walker said.\n\n\n                              Public cost\n\n       ``Our valley cares a lot about this, and we're working \n     together to improve it. There's a real public health cost to \n     air pollution. Anyone who has sat around a campfire, or gone \n     for a strenuous hike on a smoky day has had a firsthand \n     lesson in the toxicity of smoke,'' Walker said.\n       Walker's concern about health impacts come from her \n     training as an environmental health toxicologist. Harmful \n     effects range from the inability to exercise outdoors, to \n     respiratory distress and infections, to increased risk of \n     cancer.\n       ``For vulnerable populations--babies, children, pregnant \n     women, elders, and anyone with heart or lung issues--bad air \n     days can mean serious health repercussions. For everyone, \n     chronic exposure to high levels of PM2.5 can potentially \n     trigger or exacerbate conditions such as headaches, asthma, \n     bronchitis and cardiovascular disease.''\n       There are economic costs of air pollution in the Methow \n     Valley as well, she said. ``We're a tourist economy, \n     dependent on the natural beauty of the valley,'' Walker said.\n       The Methow Valley Clean Air Project was launched in 2015 by \n     Raleigh Bowden, a local physician, after she saw people \n     suffering health effects of poor winter air quality, Walker \n     said. A key goal of the project is improving air quality \n     during the home heating season, October through March.\n       ``Due to our valley's frequent winter inversions, smoke \n     from woodstoves and outdoor burning pollutes our air to \n     frequently unhealthy levels,'' Walker said. ``We've focused \n     on the home heating season because this is when we can make \n     behavioral changes to improve our air quality. This is a \n     controllable source of pollution, as contrasted with \n     pollution from wildfires.''\n       The Clean Air Project outlines measures residents can take \n     to reduce pollution from wood stoves, including: Properly \n     season wood so that it is dry and burns cleaner; clean \n     chimneys yearly; build small, hot fires and don't damp them \n     down; comply with burn bans; upgrade to certified stoves or a \n     wood-burning alternative; weatherize homes.\n       The organization is also working to reduce outdoor burning \n     of yard waste and provide alternatives, including \n     ``vegetation drives'' sponsored by the Clean Air Project, \n     Walker said.\n\n\n                           Successful drives\n\n       Vgetation drives, supported by grants and partnerships, \n     were held in the fall of 2016 and spring of 2017, and another \n     drive is scheduled next spring. Past drives have collected \n     about 20 tons of vegetation, which prevented hundreds or \n     thousands of hours of smoke, Walker said.\n       The yard waste was dropped off by residents and hauled to \n     the county landfill during the first drive, conducted over \n     two days. During the second drive, conducted over eight days \n     in partnership with the Town of Twisp, residents delivered \n     vegetation to a site near the Twisp wastewater treatment \n     plant, where it was chipped and offered free for landscaping \n     and mulching.\n       ``The most unusual community participant brought his load \n     strapped to the back of his bicycle--now that's commitment to \n     clean air!'' Walker said.\n       The Clean Air Project also partnered this year with the \n     Pine Forest Homeowners Association to provide support for \n     chipping branches and slash created when underbrush and trees \n     were thinned and limbed as part of Pine Forest's ongoing \n     Firewise efforts. The debris would otherwise have been \n     burned.\n       Next spring's vegetation drive will be conducted in \n     partnership with the Okanogan Conservation District, Walker \n     said. She suggested that residents who have been accumulating \n     yard waste cover their piles this fall instead of burning \n     them, and haul them to the vegetation drive in the spring to \n     be chipped.\n       Walker acknowledged that it takes extra effort, and a \n     different mindset, to participate in a vegetation drive \n     rather than burn yard waste. ``It's hard. Our valley is long. \n     It requires a truck, loading it up and hauling it in,'' she \n     said. ``People have been outdoor burning in the valley \n     forever. It's how you get rid of your stuff when you live out \n     in the country.''\n       However, Walker said, many valley residents have been \n     supportive of the vegetation drives. ``People really \n     appreciate this as an option. They don't want to impact the \n     health of families and the community,'' she said.\n       For people who want to continue the longstanding local \n     tradition of burning yard waste, the Clean Air Project \n     suggests ``best practices for burning outdoors in the most \n     safe and clean way,'' Walker said.\n       ``Make sure the pile is as bone dry as possible. Make sure \n     you know what is a good day, with good ventilation, but not \n     too much wind. We've interacted with Fire District 6 and \n     smokejumpers. There are lots of folks with tons of knowledge \n     about how to build a hot, clean pile,'' she said.\n       The Clean Air Project is overseen by a volunteer advisory \n     group. The Methow Valley Citizens' Council is fiscal sponsor \n     for the organization. More information is available on the \n     Methow Valley Clean Air Project Facebook page.\n\n\n\n\n", "turn": 37, "speaker": "Mr. NEWHOUSE", "itemno": 42}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "N000189", "text": "  Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my friend from Florida for \ntoday's debate.\n  The issue of proactive management of our Nation's Federal forests is \ncritically important to the future and economic well-being of our whole \ncountry as well as to the health of our Federal lands and safety of our \nrural communities.\n  Let me say that, if you have never been through a rural community \nthat has had to face the devastation of a catastrophic fire, you are \nwelcome to come to the State of Washington and see firsthand exactly \nthe kind of damage that these fires can do.\n  This is of the highest priority, and I urge all my colleagues to \nsupport this rule as well as the underlying bill in order to combat \nthese catastrophic wildfires and reform the way in which we manage our \nforests.\n  This rule provides for consideration of H.R. 2936, the Resilient \nFederal Forests Act of 2017. This is bipartisan, it is comprehensive, \nand it aims at addressing the disastrous consequences of catastrophic \nwildfires by utilizing the tools the Forest Service and other agencies \nhave to reduce the threats posed by these fires, by insects, by disease \ninfestation, and by dangerous old forest overgrowth.\n  As I said, my district in central Washington and millions of acres \nacross our great country continue to face this threat. We must take \nsteps to prevent and address these fires, which this bill will do by \nreforming the way we prepare for, respond to, and fund wildfire \nresponse and mitigation efforts. These threats will only continue to \nworsen not only for my constituents, but for people all around the \ncountry.\n  We are recognizing sustained drought conditions. Mismanagement and \nfailure to conduct maintenance of our forests on Federal lands will \ncontinue to plague this issue. The underlying legislation is essential \nand desperately needed to change the outdated, unsustainable, and \nuntimely dangerous system of Federal forest management on these lands.\n  Mr. Speaker, this is a straightforward rule allowing for \nconsideration of a critical piece of legislation that will help protect \nour rural communities and ensure we are prepared to respond to these \ndevastating, catastrophic fires.\n  I appreciate the discussion we have had today.

It is a \n     vote about what the House should be debating.\n       Mr. Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of \n     Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the \n     previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or \n     control the consideration of the subject before the House \n     being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous \n     question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the \n     subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling \n     of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the \n     House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes \n     the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to \n     offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the \n     majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated \n     the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to \n     a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to \n     recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (R-Illinois) said: \n     ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman \n     from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to \n     yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first \n     recognition.''\n       The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous \n     question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an \n     immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no \n     substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.'' \n     But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the \n     Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in \n     the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition, \n     page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the previous \n     question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is generally \n     not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member \n     controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of \n     offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by \n     voting down the previous question on the rule. . . . When the \n     motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the \n     time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering \n     the previous question. That Member, because he then controls \n     the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for \n     the purpose of amendment.''\n       In Deschler's Procedure in the U.S. House of \n     Representatives, the subchapter titled ``Amending Special \n     Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on \n     such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on \n     Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further \n     debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues: \n     ``Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a \n     resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control \n     shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous \n     question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who \n     controls the time for debate thereon.''\n       Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does \n     have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only \n     available tools for those who oppose the Republican \n     majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the \n     opportunity to offer an alternative plan.\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 45}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "N000189", "text": "  Mr. NEWHOUSE.
