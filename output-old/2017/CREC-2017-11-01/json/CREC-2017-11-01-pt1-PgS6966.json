Mr. President, I wish to congratulate Unker's Therapeutic \nProducts for its 35th year in business. This is an impressive milestone \nfor their organization.\n  Unker's Therapeutic Products' story of starting out with Patrick \nHenry's hard work in his garage to being a staple in Wyoming and even \nsponsoring racecars is the embodiment of the American dream. I am \npleased to hear of the company's success and of the plans to continue \nthis business for years to come. Unker's Therapeutic Products provides \nboth good jobs and much-needed services to the people of our towns and \ncommunities. It is greatly appreciated. Good businesses make for \nstrongly knit communities, and that helps us all.\n  President and CEO Patricia Pendelton and all the folks at Unker's \nTherapeutic Products can be very proud they have served Weston County \nand the State of Wyoming for so long. Their hard work and determined \neffort have played a part in its current and continued success.\n  I extend my best wishes and congratulations to Patricia and to \neveryone who is a part of this company.\n  Thank you.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. ENZI", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "Senate", "num": "177", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "S6966", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "1", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "35TH ANNIVERSARY OF UNKER'S THERAPEUTIC PRODUCTS", "id": "CREC-2017-11-01-pt1-PgS6966", "title": null}
