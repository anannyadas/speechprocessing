Mr. Speaker, last week, the Labor-HHS \nAppropriations Subcommittee had a most remarkable hearing on Down \nsyndrome, which moved us to a new understanding of this disability.\n  DS is a genetic disorder that affects over 300,000 men, women, and \nchildren in America. It is the most common chromosomal disorder and the \nmost frequent genetic cause of learning disabilities in children.\n  Each year, approximately 6,000 babies in the United States are born \nwith Down syndrome, a condition resulting from an extra 21st \nchromosome. Sixty years ago, people with DS had a life expectancy of \nless than 20 years, and most lived their lives in institutions. Today, \ndue to early medical care and being raised in loving homes, these \nchildren can expect to live well into their sixties.\n  Last week's hearing was one of the most emotionally charged and \ninspirational hearings I can recall as a member of this subcommittee. \nThe room was filled with children and adults with DS and their \nfamilies, including my young constituent, Jose Cisneros. Amidst the \ntears, laughter, and applause, we heard inspiring stories about the \namazing accomplishments of DS teens and young adults in sports, \nscouting, community activism, and film acting.\n  We learned that they are graduating from high schools, attending \ncolleges, and working at jobs in their communities.\n  And, most importantly, we saw how these young Americans are teaching \nour country about the value of diversity and inclusion, while at the \nsame time increasing the happiness quotients of those lucky enough to \nbe in their very wide circle of friends.\n  We also learned some very surprising and amazing facts about Down \nsyndrome. Researchers told us that individuals with DS are medically \nvery special. On the one hand, they are highly predisposed to \nautoimmune disorders such as thyroid disease and rheumatoid arthritis; \nchildren with DS are 50 times more likely to develop\n\n\nchildhood leukemia, and virtually all adults with DS will develop the \nbrain pathology of Alzheimer's by the age of 40.\n  But they also said that due to a small difference in their genetic \nmakeup, persons with Down syndrome are naturally protected from heart \ndisease, high blood pressure, and most solid-tissue cancers. \nResearchers said studying these unique genetics could help discover \nways to prevent or cure diseases such as cancer, autoimmune disorders, \nand Alzheimer's disease.\n  With such promising potential, one would think the Federal Government \nwould invest heavily in Down syndrome research. Unfortunately, what we \nlearned was that over the last two decades, DS has been one of the \nleast funded genetic conditions at the NIH.\n  This hearing left no doubt about the need for a significant and \nsustained investment in Down syndrome research. A trans-NIH DS \ninitiative could help not only find answers and cures for DS, but \ndiscover its mysteries, which could answer questions about other \nserious and life-threatening diseases.\n  While the benefits of DS research are unquestionable, it will take \ntime to realize its full potential. In the meantime, we must ensure \nthose living with DS can access and afford high-quality, coordinated \nhealthcare and the long-term services and support they need to live \nproductive lives in their communities.\n  Medicaid long-term supports and Medicaid community-based services \ngives them that opportunity by enabling them to maintain gainful \nemployment and stay in their homes and in their communities. Sadly, \nacross our country, thousands of people with Down syndrome are on very \nlong waiting lists for those services.\n  As lawmakers, we have an obligation to find a bipartisan way to \nprotect and expand Medicaid services so all individuals with DS and \nother debilitating diseases have access to the lifelong interventions \nand support they need.\n  The time has come for this country to embrace the gift and potential \nthat Down syndrome brings to our society. The 300,000-plus Americans \nliving with DS today want and deserve the same opportunities available \nto all of us: to live a full life and to reach their true potential.\n", "turn": 1, "speaker": "Ms. ROYBAL-ALLARD", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "177", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H8298-H8299", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "1", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "DOWN SYNDROME", "id": "CREC-2017-11-01-pt1-PgH8298", "title": "DOWN SYNDROME"}
