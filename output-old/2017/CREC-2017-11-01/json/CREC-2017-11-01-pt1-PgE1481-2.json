Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize an individual \nwho has had a tremendous impact on Northern Virginia. Eileen Curtis, \nPresident and CEO of the Dulles Regional Chamber of Commerce, is \nretiring after leading the Chamber since 1994.\n   During her tenure, the Dulles Chamber has established itself as one \nof the leading business advocacy groups in the region, adding to the \nquality of life for our residents in the Dulles Corridor and beyond. I \nhave been proud to work with the Chamber on a host of issues, perhaps \nmost significant being Rail to Dulles. The Chamber was instrumental in \nthe foundation of the Dulles Corridor Rail Association, which helped \nlobby for federal funding which was eventually secured to help \nconstruct the Silver Line. The 23-mile long Silver Line has spurred \nmajor economic development along the Dulles Corridor and has been \nsingled out by Fairfax County executives as one of the main reasons \nbehind Fairfax County's continued economic success.\n   In addition to Rail to Dulles, Eileen has worked with the Chamber to \nenhance the region in other ways including advocating for STEM \neducation in our schools, forging partnerships with the business and \neducation communities, creating greater opportunities for our immigrant \ncommunity, and establishing new local festivals and events to bring the \ncommunity together. These efforts are among the many reasons why \nNorthern Virginia is routinely recognized as one of the best places in \nthe United States in which to live, work, raise a family, and start a \nbusiness.\n   Eileen's efforts have been drawn recognition from across the region. \nThe Chamber's efforts in education have been honored by Fairfax County \nPublic Schools on multiple occasions and the Washington Business \nJournal routinely lists the Dulles Chamber as being one of the largest \nin membership. Eileen herself has been recognized as Woman of the Year \nby the Herndon Business & Professional Women and as Executive of the \nYear by the Virginia Association of Chambers of Commerce Executives. \nThese accolades speak to the strength of Eileen as a leader and the \ndedication that she has shown to our community. There can be no doubt \nof the positive impact that she has had on our community and our region \nis better for her efforts.\n   Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating Eileen \nCurtis on her retirement and in thanking her for her outstanding \nservice to Fairfax County and Northern Virginia. While she may be \nretiring, I am confident that she will remain engaged on the issues \nthat are close to her heart. I wish her great success in all her future \nendeavors.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. CONNOLLY", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 3}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "177", "extension": true, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "E1481", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "1", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "RECOGNIZING EILEEN CURTIS", "id": "CREC-2017-11-01-pt1-PgE1481-2", "title": "RECOGNIZING EILEEN CURTIS"}
