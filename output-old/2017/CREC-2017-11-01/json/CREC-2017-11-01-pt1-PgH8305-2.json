Mr. Speaker, today is the last day of baseball, but, more \nimportantly, it is the first day of open enrollment for the Patient \nProtection and Affordable Care Act.\n  This year, enrollment only runs from November 1, today, through \nDecember 15. This is half the length of last year when open enrollment \nextended until January 30. It is 6 weeks shorter, so to sign up, get \nstarted today. You only have 45 days to do it. This is something the \nTrump administration is doing to\n\n\nmake it more difficult and less likely people will sign up.\n  Don't let them do this. Sign up for your healthcare. During this \nshortened enrollment period, there will also be 12-hour periods of \nscheduled maintenance when the website will be inaccessible. These \nperiods will occur every Sunday morning, except one, during the open \nenrollment period. December 15 is the last chance for individuals to \nsign up for health insurance for 2018, unless you have a major event \nlike getting married, having a child, or moving.\n  In previous years, individuals were notified of autoenrollment with \ntime to change their choice. This year, that happens on December 16, a \nday after open enrollment ends, so there is no reason to do it. It just \ntells you what you have got, and you don't have the opportunity to \nchange. So individuals should not rely on autoenrollment. They should \nuse healthcare.gov to find the best plan for them and their families.\n  In many cases, there are affordable plans. In 2018, in Tennessee, 88 \npercent can find a bronze plan for under $75.\n\n\n  In Memphis, many consumers earning $30,000 to $48,000 a year can find \nsilver plans for under $100. This is particularly true for those in \ntheir late forties to age 64.\n  You may qualify for premiums and cost-sharing reductions like in past \nyears. In 2016, 88 percent of Tennesseans on the exchanges received \npremium assistance, and 58 percent received cost-sharing reduction \nsubsidies.\n  This is still true even as the President attempts to sabotage the \nPatient Protection and Affordable Care Act.\n  Marketing funding and funds for navigators to help people through the \nprocess have both been slashed. In spite of that fact, we are going to \ntry to find some navigators still around and have a townhall in Memphis \npossibly Saturday, November 11. We are still in the process of \nscheduling that, but we want all of our people to get that chance. So \nwe encourage all Americans to get that chance.\n  Cost-sharing reduction subsidies will be available for individuals \nwho qualify for silver plans despite Trump's decision to stop the \ngovernment from reimbursing insurers.\n  The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act is the law of the \nland. All current efforts to repeal and replace have failed because \nthey have not come up with a better plan. Healthcare is difficult, and \nwe came up with a plan that needs some tweaking but not repealing.\n  Memphis has recently seen a decrease in the disparity of breast \ncancer mortality rates between Black and White women, a clear \nindication that access to affordable care saves lives.\n  Memphis has done excellent work at expanding access to screenings and \ncoverage. In addition to local efforts, the Affordable Care Act has \nhelped to reduce or even eliminate copayments that women have to pay \nfor preventive screenings, including mammograms.\n  Access to affordable healthcare has saved lives in Memphis and \nthroughout this country. The open enrollment for the Affordable Care \nAct starts today and runs through December 15. Avail yourselves of \nthose opportunities.\n", "turn": 1, "speaker": "Mr. COHEN", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "177", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H8305-H8306", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "1", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "SIGN UP FOR HEALTHCARE NOW", "id": "CREC-2017-11-01-pt1-PgH8305-2", "title": "SIGN UP FOR HEALTHCARE NOW"}
