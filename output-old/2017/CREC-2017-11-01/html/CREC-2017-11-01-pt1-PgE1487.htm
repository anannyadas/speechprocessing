                      Wednesday, November 1, 2017

  Mr. YOUNG of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and 
congratulate the Animal Rescue League of Iowa for being named the 2016 
501(c) of the Year at the Des Moines East and South Chamber of Commerce 
Annual Dinner and Awards Ceremony earlier this year.
  The Animal Rescue League (ARL) of Iowa is the largest nonprofit 
animal shelter in Iowa. ARL cares for thousands of animals every year, 
and offers a wide range of services to the public. From adoption, 
behavior training, spay/neuter services, and education, ARL aims to 
help people become responsible pet owners, as well as to help prevent 
animals from ultimately ending up in shelters.
  Mr. Speaker, I am honored to represent non-profit organizations like 
the Animal Rescue League of Iowa in the United States Congress and it 
is with great pride that I recognize them today. I ask that my 
colleagues in the United States House of Representatives join me in 
congratulating them for this outstanding recognition and in wishing 
them all nothing but continued success.

                          ____________________
