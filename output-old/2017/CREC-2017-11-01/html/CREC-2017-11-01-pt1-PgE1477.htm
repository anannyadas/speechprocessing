                      Wednesday, November 1, 2017

  Mr. YOUNG of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and 
congratulate Wilma Hughes of Bedford, Iowa for being named the Lioness 
of the Year by the Bedford Iowa Lioness Club.
  Wilma has been an active member of her community for many years. She 
is a dedicated church member, helping with bereavement dinners, folding 
newsletters, Friday night dinner preparations, playing for Sunday 
services and she's active on church committees. On top of that, she 
also bakes pies for the American Legion bingo night and volunteers with 
the Taylor County Fair Booth each year. She worked alongside her 
husband, Glen, for 48 years at their family farm and raised three 
children.
  Mr. Speaker, I am honored to represent community leaders like Wilma 
in the United States Congress and it is with great pride that I 
recognize her today. I ask that my colleagues in the United States 
House of Representatives join me in congratulating her for this 
outstanding recognition and in wishing her nothing but the best.

                          ____________________
