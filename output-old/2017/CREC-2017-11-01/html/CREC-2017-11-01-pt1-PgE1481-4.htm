                       RECOGNIZING DANIEL DUNCAN

                                 ______
                                 

                        HON. GERALD E. CONNOLLY

                              of virginia

                    in the house of representatives

                      Wednesday, November 1, 2017

  Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize my good friend Daniel 
(Dan) Duncan as he steps down after serving for 10 years as President 
of the Northern Virginia Labor Federation, AFL-CIO (NoVA Labor.) As 
President of NoVA Labor, Dan led the largest labor council in the 
Commonwealth of Virginia and which represents nearly 70 unions and 
locals. In this role, he has been responsible for consolidating the 
missions and concerns of the various unions and their members into one 
unified voice while ensuring that all opinions are heard and respected.
   Dan has dedicated his life to improving the lives of working 
families. He is committed to the mission of NoVA Labor which is to 
bring economic justice to the workplace and social justice to our 
communities. He learned these values from an early age--his grandfather 
was a shop steward at a shipyard in Cleveland, Ohio and his father was 
a rank and file Machinist. Dan joined his first union, the Retail 
Clerks Union, in 1973 at the age of 17 while working for a grocery 
store in Tennessee.
   After graduating from the University of Chattanooga in 1978, Dan 
worked as a newspaper reporter. He later became director of the Fort 
Lauderdale senior employment program with the National Council of 
Senior Citizens (NCSC) which was formed in 1961 and evolved from the 
Senior Citizens for Kennedy organization. Working with the 
administration

of President John F. Kennedy, the NCSC was instrumental in rallying 
support for comprehensive health insurance for senior citizens. These 
efforts bore fruit when President Lyndon B. Johnson signed Medicare 
into law in 1965. NCSC's efforts were instrumental in passing this 
landmark legislation and the organization, now known as the Alliance 
for Retired Americans continues its fight to protect and preserve 
Medicare and Social Security.
   Dan then accepted a position with the Seafarers International Union 
where he has served for 30 years in various positions. For the last six 
years, Dan has held the position of Executive Secretary-Treasurer of 
the Maritime Trades Department.
   In his roles with individual unions as well as with the Northeast 
Florida Central Labor Council, the Northern Virginia Central Labor 
Council, and the NoVA Labor Federation, Dan has worked tirelessly to 
advocate for working families and support state and federal legislation 
that would even the playing field for the backbone of our society--the 
middle and lower class who deserve a fair wage for honest work and 
other employer related benefits.
   I have personally known Dan Duncan and his wife Karen for many years 
and have thoroughly enjoyed our countless conversations and discussions 
on issues of importance. While we have on occasion disagreed, mainly on 
their terrible taste in baseball teams, but also occasionally on the 
best way to achieve a certain objective, we both know and understand 
that we share the same goals. These exchanges of ideas and opinions 
have been invaluable to both of us as we continue to represent and 
serve our constituencies.
   Mr. Speaker, I ask that my colleagues join me in commending Dan 
Duncan for his efforts on behalf of the working men and women of our 
country and in thanking him for his service. Although he is stepping 
down from his position of President of NoVA Labor, I am confident that 
he will continue his efforts to strengthen and protect the rights and 
benefits of all and I wish him success in all of his future endeavors.

                          ____________________
