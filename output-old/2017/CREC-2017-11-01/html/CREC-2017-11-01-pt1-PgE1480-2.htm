 IN RECOGNITION OF NATIONAL HOSPICE AND PALLIATIVE CARE MONTH AND WEST 
                            VIRGINIA CARING

                                 ______
                                 

                         HON. DAVID B. McKINLEY

                            of west virginia

                    in the house of representatives

                      Wednesday, November 1, 2017

  Mr. McKINLEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to call attention to November 
as being National Hospice and Palliative Care Month and to recognize a 
passionate steward of a non-profit hospice--West Virginia Caring.
  Under the leadership of Ms. Malene Davis, West Virginia Caring's 
hospice and palliative care has helped citizens in 12 counties receive 
attentive and respectful care. As we consider the importance of 
compassionate and dignified care during one's end of life, we must 
protect the fair and adequate compensation for non-profit hospice and 
palliative care provider organizations. I continue to be vigilant of 
the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services as well as the 
intermediary contractors who review and recommend reimbursement rates 
on a case-by-case basis. For our families, friends and the American 
people, this is an important aspect of our healthcare responsibility.
  During this month, I call particular attention to the many 
physicians, nurses, caregivers and volunteers who offer invaluable 
patient service under the Medicare Hospice Benefit. I thank them for 
their skills and for their compassionate care.

                          ____________________
