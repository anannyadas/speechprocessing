  Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Assistant Chief 
Michael Schrage on his 50 years of service as a volunteer firefighter 
with the Crystal City Fire Department in Crystal City, Missouri. A 
celebration will be held on November 13, 2017 to honor Assistant Chief 
Schrage and commemorate his more than 50 years of service starting in 
1967.
   Born to Robert and Wanda Schrage on September 7, 1953, Mr. Schrage 
was one of five children. On August 11, 1976, Mr. Schrage married his 
beloved wife of 39 years, Janet Sue. Janet and Michael had one 
daughter, Brandi, and have also welcomed into the family Brandi's 
husband, Daniel and their granddaughter, Audri. In 1975, Mr. Schrage 
joined the Joachim Plattin Ambulance District. During that same year, 
he began working with his father, Mr. Robert (Bob) Schrage, at the 
family business, Schrage Electric. Mr. Schrage earned his certificate 
in Fire Science Technology from Jefferson College on May 23, 1978. In 
1990 when his father retired, Mr. Schrage took over the family business 
and is still operating it today. Throughout his life, Mr. Schrage has 
served the Festus, Jefferson R-7, and Crystal City Fire Departments. 
Since 2009, Mr. Schrage has served as the commissioner for the Festus 
Special Road District. Additionally, he serves his community as a 
member of the Twin city Area Chamber of Commerce and Elks Lodge 1721. 
He also attends Good News Community Church.
   Throughout Mr. Schrage's service, he has held the position of Fire 
Fighter, Captain, and Assistant Chief. Mr. Schrage is currently the 
Assistant Chief at the Crystal City Fire Department. In 2013, he was 
given the award of Fire Chief of the Year in Jefferson County. In 2016, 
he was the Grand Marshall at the Jefferson County Fire Engine Rally and 
the Crystal City Homecoming.
   Mr. Speaker, I ask you to join me in recognizing Assistant Chief 
Michael Schrage on 50 dedicated years of service to his community. The 
commitment he has shown to the Crystal City Fire Department has been 
greatly appreciated.
