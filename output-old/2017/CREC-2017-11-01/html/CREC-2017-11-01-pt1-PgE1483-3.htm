                      Wednesday, November 1, 2017

  Mr. YOUNG of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and 
congratulate Capital Chiropractic & Rehabilitation Center of Des 
Moines, Iowa for being named one of the 2016 Businesses of the Year at 
the Des Moines East and South Chamber of Commerce Annual Dinner and 
Awards Ceremony earlier this year.
  The Business of the Year award celebrates a local business that is 
dedicated to serving their community. Since Dr. Chris LoRang launched 
Capital Chiropractic & Rehabilitation Center in 2013, it has won 
numerous awards for the service they provide in family and sports 
medicine to people of all ages. The clinic encourages employees to be 
active in the community, and you can find them involved in 
organizations around the area, including neighborhood associations, 
school foundations, chamber of commerce council's and chiropractic 
societies.
  Mr. Speaker, I am honored to represent local businesses like Capital 
Chiropractic & Rehabilitation Center in the United States Congress and 
it is with great pride that I recognize them today. I ask that my 
colleagues in the United States House of Representatives join me in 
congratulating them for this outstanding recognition and in wishing 
them all nothing but continued success.

                          ____________________
