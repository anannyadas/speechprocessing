  Mr. CARTER of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor First 
Sergeant Will Williams, U.S. Army, Retired, of Round Rock, Texas, for 
his selfless dedication and service to our nation and his continued, 
unparalleled contributions to his community. I am honored to award him 
a Congressional Veteran Commendation.
  Following his enlistment in 1976, SGT Williams contributed 24 years 
of service that included deployments from Panama and Somalia, to Desert 
Shield and Desert Storm as an Army Ranger, Small Weapons Specialist 
with the 2nd Division. His commitment to keeping our nation safe is in 
his blood. Three generations of his family served in combat roles in 
the United States Army, and among the three they share 4 Bronze Star 
Medals.
  SGT Williams' service and sense of duty did not culminate with his 
military service. Upon returning to Round Rock, SGT Williams dedicated 
his civilian life to the uplifting and betterment of his community. In 
2013, he helped raise $50,000 for Dell's Children's Hospital and over 
$10,000 for the Ronald McDonald House. In Round Rock, SGT Williams 
organized a food drive, sent out a care package to deployed soldiers, 
and provided clothing and supplies to 300 foster kids through Project 
Care.
  His service has been recognized and appreciated throughout the 
community. SGT Williams was recognized with the Service to Mankind 
Award by the Round Rock Sertoma Club, received the Leadership Award 
from the ``Heart of Texas Award'' organization, and was honored with 
the Governor's Lone Star Achievement Award from Texas Governor Greg 
Abbott.
  I commend First Sergeant Will Williams' selfless service to his 
community and nation. His commitment to excellence and citizenship 
reflect the best values we hold as Americans. I join his family, 
friends, and colleagues in saluting his great work and dedication to 
our country.
