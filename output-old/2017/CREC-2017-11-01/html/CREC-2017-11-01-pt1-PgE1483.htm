           RECOGNIZING THE 60TH ANNIVERSARY OF FAIRFAX WATER

                                 ______
                                 

                        HON. GERALD E. CONNOLLY

                              of virginia

                    in the house of representatives

                      Wednesday, November 1, 2017

  Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize Fairfax Water on the 
occasion of its 60th anniversary. There are few human needs more 
precious and more critical than access to fresh and safe drinking 
water. Indeed, we have seen what can happen when those needs are 
neglected, as the tragedy in Flint, Michigan reminds us. Prior to the 
creation of the Fairfax County Water Authority (now known as Fairfax 
Water), water was supplied to Fairfax County through many small, mostly 
private water systems, and a limited number of public systems. There 
was no standardization between systems and each system maintained its 
own rate schedule and level of service. In order to improve service 
reliability, establish equitable rates, and provide effective fire 
protection throughout Fairfax County, the Board of Supervisors created 
Fairfax Water in September 1957 for the purpose of ``acquiring, 
constructing, operating and maintaining an integrated water system for 
supplying and distributing water.''
   The acquisition of water systems began in 1959 with the purchase of 
the Annandale Water Company. Over the next eight years, Fairfax Water 
acquired an additional 17 systems and began to build a comprehensive 
water-supply system. By the end of 1967, Fairfax Water had 832 miles of 
mains, 3,354 fire hydrants, and 54,000 metered accounts serving more 
than 425,000 people. By 1982, that number had grown to more than 1,800 
miles of mains, more than 10,300 fire hydrants and nearly 126,000 
metered accounts serving more than 650,000 people. By 1994, it would 
reach more than 2,700 miles of water mains, more than 17,300 fire 
hydrants and more than 197,300 meters.
   Those numbers show a county undergoing tremendous growth in both 
population and urbanization. The challenges associated with that are 
numerous and the temptation of providing service while overlooking the 
quality of that service is real. However, Fairfax Water has never 
allowed itself to fall into that trap. Instead, it has approached every 
new challenge with its mission in mind: providing safe, clean drinking 
water to Fairfax County residents and ensuring that the County's water 
supply is maintained. There have certainly been no shortage of 
challenges--from supply issues stemming from the use of a single source 
(the Occoquan River) to natural disasters to the threat of terrorism, 
Fairfax Water has risen to meet those challenges. Its work stands as 
testament to the strength and character of the ethos of public service 
in our community.
   Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating 
Phillip Allin, Charles Murray, the members of the Board of Directors 
and the entire staff of Fairfax Water. I thank them for their service 
to our community and for maintaining the proud legacy of this 
organization while adapting it to meet the challenges of the future.
