  Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Ms. Amanda 
Walsh of Davis, California, who embodies the values of a great teacher, 
educator, and mentor, and displays unparalleled dedication to her work. 
For Ms. Walsh, teaching is not just a job, but a calling. As an 
educator at Pioneer Elementary school, she has a positive and lasting 
impact on the children she teaches every day. Ms. Walsh is dedicated to 
the overall wellbeing of all students, ensuring that they are safe, 
fed, and taken care of. She can frequently be found working late to 
keep parents up to date and involved in their children's education.
   Beyond her work in the classroom, Ms. Walsh finds many ways to serve 
her community. Over the years, she has been actively involved with the 
Parent Teacher Association and coordinated fundraising efforts for 
local schools. Ms. Walsh has volunteered her time for the Davis Little 
League and Davis Legacy Soccer Club.
   A mother of three boys, Amanda is always busy, staying involved in 
her sons' education, music, and sports activities. Between her roles as 
a mother and a teacher, Amanda is dedicated to the wellbeing and 
success of children.
