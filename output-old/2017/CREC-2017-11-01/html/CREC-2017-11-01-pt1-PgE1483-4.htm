         RECOGNIZING THE 10TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE OAKTON LIBRARY

                                 ______
                                 

                        HON. GERALD E. CONNOLLY

                              of virginia

                    in the house of representatives

                      Wednesday, November 1, 2017

  Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize the Oakton Library on 
the occasion of its 10th anniversary. This project represents the 
fulfillment of a promise I made to this community more than a decade 
ago, during my time as both Providence District Supervisor and Chairman 
of the Fairfax County Board of Supervisors.
   Working with engaged citizens, we identified a need for new meeting 
space as well as a new library in the Oakton community. But we didn't 
stop there. We rolled up our sleeves and went to work. We worked with 
developers to secure the necessary land, with my colleagues on the 
Board to secure and pass the necessary bond referendums and with the 
community to raise awareness and support for this necessary addition. 
These efforts bore fruit and in 2007 we celebrated the dedication of 
the new Oakton Library. Ten years later, the library stands as a pillar 
of the Oakton community and I am confident that it will continue to 
serve that role for many more decades to come.
   I wish to give special recognition to the members of the Friends of 
Oakton Library, who worked with myself and others side by side on every 
step of this project. Together, we guided what was once just a concept 
into a brick-and-mortar reality.
   We are incredibly fortunate in Fairfax County to have such dedicated 
citizens, who go out of their way for the betterment of the lives of 
others. I have often said that local government is where the rubber 
meets the road. The level of accountability is absolute. You either 
solved the problem or you didn't . . . and everyone knows where you 
live and has your phone number! My colleagues on the Board of 
Supervisors and I accomplished a lot together during my time in Fairfax 
County government, but the completion of the Oakton Library remains one 
of my proudest moments in local government. A testament to what can 
happen when like-minded individuals are willing to back up their words 
and desires with concrete, often unglamorous actions. The Oakton 
community and indeed all of Fairfax County is better off today because 
people were willing to put in the work.
   Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating the 
Friends of Oakton Library and the entire Oakton community on this 
important anniversary. I commend them for their contributions to 
Fairfax County and wish them great success in all their future 
endeavors. I am confident that we will be observing many more 
anniversaries of this library still to come.

                          ____________________
