                        TRIBUTE TO DEIDRE DEJEAR

                                 ______
                                 

                            HON. DAVID YOUNG

                                of iowa

                    in the house of representatives

                      Wednesday, November 1, 2017

  Mr. YOUNG of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and 
congratulate Deidre DeJear on being named the Iowa Small Business 
Administration Minority Business Champion of the Year.
  Each year, during National Small Business Week, the Iowa Small 
Business Administration announces winners of the Iowa Small Business 
Week Awards. Deidre is the president of the business marketing company 
Caleo Enterprises. She's also a passionate advocate for low- to 
moderate-income individuals and families, helping to strengthen their 
financial opportunities and knowledge. She led the United Way of 
Central Iowa's Financial Capability project, where since 2012 over 
20,000 people have gained access to financial systems and improved 
their financial management skills. Deidre has created several programs 
to provide financial and business education in Central Iowa, among 
which three ``boot camps'' have seen 1,300 people come and learn about 
finances, business and non-profits.
  Mr. Speaker, strong communities are built upon people like Deidre, 
who go above and beyond their own self-interests and devote their time 
and energy to helping others. It is an honor to represent leaders like 
her in the United States Congress and it is with great pride that I 
recognize her today. I ask that all of my colleagues in the United 
States House of Representatives join me in congratulating Deidre on 
this outstanding recognition and in wishing her nothing but continued 
success.
