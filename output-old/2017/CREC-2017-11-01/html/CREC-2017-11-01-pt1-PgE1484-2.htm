                      Wednesday, November 1, 2017

  Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize the recipients of the 
26th Annual Best of Reston Awards for Community Service. These awards 
are the result of collaboration between Cornerstones and the Greater 
Reston Chamber of Commerce and are presented to individuals, 
organizations, and businesses whose extraordinary efforts make our 
community a better place.
   I have been proud to represent this community since my days as 
Chairman of the Fairfax County Board of Supervisors. The level of civic 
engagement celebrated by these awards is a testament to the community 
spirit of Reston. I have often said that civic engagement is a key 
indicator of a healthy community and tonight's event proves that Reston 
is one of the healthiest communities in all of Northern Virginia! That 
is due in no small part to the actions of those honored here this 
evening and I extend my congratulations to all of tonight's honorees. I 
also wish to thank Kerrie Wilson of Cornerstones and Mark Ingrao of the 
Greater Reston Chamber of Commerce for their tireless efforts on behalf 
of others and in making our community one of the best places in the 
country in which to live, work and raise a family.
   It is my honor to include in the Record the following recipients of 
the 2017 Best of Reston Awards:
   Corporate/Business Leader:
   Odin, Feldman and Pittleman, PC
   Small Business Leader:
   CST Group

   Community Leader:

   Vade Bolton-Ann Rodriguez Legacy Award:

   Mr. Speaker, I ask that my colleagues join me in congratulating the 
2017 Best of Reston honorees for their tremendous contributions. I 
thank Cornerstones and the Greater Reston Chamber of Commerce for 
continuing this wonderful tradition, and I express my sincere gratitude 
to these individuals, businesses, and organizations for lending their 
time and energy to the betterment of our community.
