                   RETIREMENT OF MAYOR RAYMOND BODNAR

                                 ______
                                 

                         HON. MICHAEL F. DOYLE

                            of pennsylvania

                    in the house of representatives

                      Wednesday, November 1, 2017

  Mr. MICHAEL F. DOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to 
recognize a remarkable public servant from my district, Mayor Raymond 
G. Bodnar of Munhall, Pennsylvania, who is retiring after 53 years of 
service to his community.
  Mr. Bodnar has been the Mayor of Munhall Borough for the last 30 
years, but his service to his nation and community began long before 
that. As a young man, he served in the Army during the Korean Conflict 
and was honorably discharged in 1955. In addition to working for 40 
years for the U.S. Steel Corporation, he served eight years as auditor 
of Munhall and another fifteen as a member and then President of the 
Munhall Borough Council. In 1987, he was elected mayor, a position 
which he has honorably filled for the last three decades, and in which 
he has worked tirelessly to improve the Munhall community.
  During his career, Mayor Bodnar has supported and secured funding for 
such important projects as developing the Munhall waterfront, 
revitalizing the town's Main Street, modernizing the police department, 
and introducing public safety and crime prevention programs.

  Beyond his duties as a civil servant, he has also given back to his 
community in countless ways, including managing the youth Munhall 
Baseball League, organizing summer athletic programs, working with Boy 
Scouts, Girl Scouts, and church groups, and teaching local government 
to youth groups and schools. He is also a member of a number of 
community service organizations, including Knights of Columbus No. 
2201, the Catholic War Veterans Association, the Homestead Elks, and 
the Steel Valley Salvation Army Board ofDirectors.
  For more than 50 years, Raymond Bodnar has demonstrated wholehearted 
dedication to public service and community involvement, and I think 
that we can all learn something from his example. I wish to 
congratulate the mayor on his retirement and commend him for his 
lifetime of devotion to the Munhall community.
