                 A LIFE WELL-LOVED IS A LIFE WELL LIVED

                                 ______
                                 

                          HON. JOHN GARAMENDI

                             of california

                    in the house of representatives

                      Wednesday, November 1, 2017

  Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Mr. Albert O. 
Orta for his selfless service to our nation.
   Albert Orta's extensive career began in 1947 after completion of his 
entry level training at Lackland Air Force Base as a member of the 
United States Air Force. There, he tracked and noted weather cycles. 
Soon thereafter, he was promoted to work on the base's radar and 
communication equipment as an electronics technician.
   After his service with the United States Air Force, Mr. Orta 
continued to serve his country as an engineer with the United States 
Department of Defense at Lackland Air Force Base. His talents for 
engineering were well recognized and his responsibilities increased. 
Early in his career, he found himself traveling to well over fifty 
countries briefing Commanding Generals and U.S Embassy Ambassadors on 
communicative data and command post installation projects on behalf of 
the United States Military. His missions took him to Europe, the 
Philippines, Indo-China and to countries in Africa and South America, 
just to name a few.
   Mr. Orta also worked on military aircraft as a radar engineer and 
found himself assisting on the improvements and installation of radar 
systems in the early B series military aircraft: B29, B36, B47 and B52. 
Mr. Orta's work was so noted as a leader and accomplished engineer that 
he was assigned to equipping and testing radar systems in the early F 
series military aircraft: F84, F86A, F89, F102 and F106. His proud 
accomplishment was his role as the lead engineer in the development and 
installation of new radar technology for the United States Air Force's 
F102 Delta Dagger, a $6 million project at the time of his assignment.
   Mr. Orta's outstanding accomplishments and his willingness to serve 
our nation faithfully and to the best of his abilities in all positions 
was recognized by President Jimmy Carter and a host of Generals and 
Ambassadors acknowledging his incredible service to our nation through 
his work with the U.S. Department of Defense.
   Albert Orta and Mary Louise Guerrero married in June of 1949 and are 
blessed with 12 children, 31 grandchildren, and 29 great-grandchildren. 
Throughout his career and travels he recognized that sharing stories of 
his travels were important life lessons. There is no greater devotion 
of a father who returned home from a mission to share the experiences 
he encountered of a different life, different culture and hardships to 
emphasize the importance of hard work, the importance of quality 
education, to learn to be resilient and to appreciate the freedoms we 
enjoy today. He stands proud that his children and grandchildren are 
successful in their own professional careers; some educators, leaders 
in the private industries, medical field, financial advisors, some with 
a heart for public service and some who proudly served our country in 
the military.
   Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues in the United States House of 
Representatives to join me in honoring Albert O. Orta for his 
distinguished career and his proud service to our country; and to Mary 
Louise Orta for her service in standing alongside her husband, 
supporting him and their family throughout his missions.
