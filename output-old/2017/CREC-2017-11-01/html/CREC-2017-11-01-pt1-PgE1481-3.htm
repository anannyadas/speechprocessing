     HONORING THE MEMORY OF FIREFIGHTER ROBERT ``SKIPPY'' TILEARCIO

                                 ______
                                 

                           HON. PETER T. KING

                              of new york

                    in the house of representatives

                      Wednesday, November 1, 2017

  Mr. KING of New York. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the memory 
of longtime New York City Firefighter Robert ``Skippy'' Tilearcio, who 
passed away last Wednesday from a malignant tumor resulting from his 
months of recovery efforts at Ground Zero.
  Skip was a tireless advocate for the Zadroga 9/11 Healthcare Act. He 
came to Washington about six times to fight for its extension in 2014 
and 2015, even before he was diagnosed with a fatal tumor. I had the 
privilege of meeting Skip Tilearcio when he would make these painful 
trips to Congress. On his final visit Skip was confined to a wheelchair 
but his spirit was as strong as ever. Skip truly personified the 
courage of New York's Bravest.
  Skip Tilearcio was the 15th firefighter to die this year alone from a 
9/11 related illness. Many more are sick and suffering from these 
dreaded 9/11 illnesses. But because of Skip Tilearcio's heroic and 
successful effort to extend the Zadroga Act, these brave first 
responders will receive the very best medical care and treatment. My 
sincerest condolences go out to his wife Tina and his two children 
Tatiana and Robert. R.I.P. Firefighter Robert ``Skip'' Tilearcio.
