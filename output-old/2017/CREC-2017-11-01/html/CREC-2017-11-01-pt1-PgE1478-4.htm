  Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Brynda Stranix 
of Yuba City, California, a pillar of the community who exemplifies the 
qualities of a true public servant. She is a proven leader who embodies 
a passion to help others. Brynda currently serves as President and 
Chief Operating Officer of the Yuba-Sutter Economic Development 
Corporation.
   Brynda's passion to help the community thrive is reflected in her 
present and previous work experience in the field of economics. She 
joined the Yuba-Sutter Economic Development Corporation (YSEDC) in 2001 
with 22 years of experience in administrative management, accounting 
and public relations. Since joining YSEDC, Brynda has worked tirelessly 
with local businesses as well as public and private community leaders 
to identify ways to improve and expand business in the area.
   Brynda takes great pride in her community; she currently serves in 
eleven officer roles on boards and commissions for economic 
development, and is a member of twenty-nine various advisory committees 
who deal with critical issues from healthcare to homelessness and 
women's issues. When Brynda is not busy attending a meeting, you will 
always find her attending a community event.
   Brynda was presented with the 2016 Athena Leadership Award for 
achieving the highest level of professional excellence for her 
contributions in improving the quality of life for others, especially 
women, in realizing their full potential. Brynda was born and raised in 
Yuba City and takes pride in raising three delightful grandsons.
