 HONORING THE ENTREPRENEURIAL SPIRIT OF MEREDITH COREY-DISCH, OWNER OF 
                            COMMUNITY LOAVES

                                 ______
                                 

                        HON. JOHN H. RUTHERFORD

                               of florida

                    in the house of representatives

                      Wednesday, November 1, 2017

  Mr. RUTHERFORD. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to ask the United States 
House of Representatives to join me in recognizing Meredith Corey-
Disch, a leader and business owner in my district, who was a recipient 
of a spot at the James Beard Foundation's Inaugural Class of the 
Women's Entrepreneurial Leadership Fellowship program. This program, 
hosted at the prestigious Babson College, aims to help female chefs and 
owners grow their businesses by cultivating women's leadership in the 
culinary industry.
   Meredith Corey-Disch and her business partner, Sarah Bogdanovitch, 
are exceptional entrepreneurs. Their business was founded on the belief 
that it should be local, community focused space that provides organic, 
traditional foods with shared work and fair pay. ``Community Loaves'' 
began in 2011 in Jacksonville, as an organic bike-delivered 
subscription bakery. The pair then opened a bread shop in 2014, where 
they served all-organic bread and pastries for breakfast and lunch. 
They kept the business community focused by holding special pizza 
nights and farm to table dinners in their garden and invited 
surrounding neighbors to these events.
   Meredith began her love of bread making through an apprenticeship in 
a bakery, while brainstorming ways she could start a business people 
would enjoy back in her hometown of Jacksonville. She can be described 
as thoughtful, kind, generous, and creative. With these skills, along 
with her passion of bread making, Meredith will continue to spread her 
passion throughout Northeast Florida. We need more creative small 
business owners like Meredith. She has been a true example of 
leadership for women in Northeast Florida and I look forward to seeing 
her future culinary successes.
   Mr. Speaker, I applaud Meredith Corey-Disch for her leadership in 
not only the culinary community, but in Northeast Florida as well.
