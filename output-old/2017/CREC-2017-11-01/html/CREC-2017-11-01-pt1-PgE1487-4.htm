                      Wednesday, November 1, 2017

  Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, I recognize and 
congratulate Colonel Mark Shade on his recent retirement after years of 
service as Deputy Commanding Officer of the United States Army Training 
Center and Fort Jackson. Colonel Shade was commissioned after 
graduating from The Citadel in 1989 and his first duty assignment was 
at Fort Hood Texas, as a Platoon Leader in support of the 1st Calvary 
Division during Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm. After 
attending the Combined Logistics Officer Advanced Course and the 
Petroleum Officers Course at Fort Lee, Colonel Shade reported to the 
10th Mountain Division and served as the Assistant Support Operations 
Officer for 1st Brigade. He was then selected to Command Headquarters 
and Headquarters Company and Alpha Company of the 10th Forward Support 
Battalion.
  After attending the Tactical Officer's Education Program at the 
United States Military Academy at West Point, and receiving his Masters 
in Education (Counseling and Leader Development) in 1999, Colonel Shade 
was the Tactical Officer for company A3. He then attended the United 
States Army Command and General Staff College at Fort Leavenworth, 
Kansas. Colonel Shade served in a multitude of leadership and staff 
positions within the 25th Infantry Division, and was the G4 for United 
States Army Cadet Command at Fort Knox prior to assuming his final 
position at Fort Jackson.
  Colonel Shade has multiple combat deployments to Operations Desert 
Shield/Desert Storm, Operation Iraqi Freedom, Operation Enduring 
Freedom, and Operation New Dawn. He has been awarded two legions of 
Merit, four Bronze Star Medals, the Defense Meritorious Medal, three 
Army Meritorious Service Medals, two Army Commendation Medals, two Army 
Achievement Medals, the Combat Action Badge, and the Airborne Badge. I 
am grateful for the service of Colonel Mark Shade and his family to the 
Midlands community and to the United States of America.
