                      Wednesday, November 1, 2017

  Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition 
of the American Museum of Tort Law, located in Winsted, CT, which 
celebrated its second anniversary on September 25, 2017. In honor of 
its history and continued importance as a national educational 
institution, I would like to commemorate the museum and celebrate this 
milestone.
   Since its founding by Ralph Nader, the American Museum of Tort Law 
has attracted national acclaim from media outlets including Politico, 
the New Yorker, the Boston Globe and the Washington Post. Its vital 
importance to our citizenry has been recognized by former Supreme Court 
Justice Sandra Day O'Connor. Thousands of people have attended the 
museum and have come away educated, entertained, and impressed by its 
presentation.
   The mission of this unique institution is to educate, inform, and 
inspire Americans about their legal system, with a focus on the right 
of trial by jury and the benefits of tort law. Through school group 
visits, self-guided tours, quality curated programing, and its website, 
the museum has shown true dedication towards the fostering of greater 
civic knowledge and awareness.
   Moving forward, the museum has an ambitious plan to expand, 
including not just on-site operations, but broadening its reach by 
traveling across the country and becoming a resource for practitioners, 
judges, and legal scholars.
   I have thoroughly enjoyed the opportunity to personally visit the 
American Museum of Tort Law. As a former history teacher, I can attest 
to the tremendous value this museum provides through the details and 
historical context that brings to life the law and justice. Tort law 
has improved the lives of so many and this museum tells that story.
   I am proud to have such an exciting and important institution 
located in my district. Congratulations to the American Museum of Tort 
Law on celebrating its second anniversary. May it continue to educate 
and inspire for generations to come.
