  Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Ms. Anna Eaton 
of Vacaville, CA, who exemplifies the qualities of selfless service and 
possesses a passion for serving our youth. Since 2013, Anna has 
distinguished herself as the Executive Director of the Vacaville 
Neighborhood Boys & Girls Club where she helps provide a safe and 
caring place for youth to learn and grow. During her tenure, she has 
expanded the program to five sites and significantly enhanced the 
club's focus on support and mentorship of the members as they are 
prepared for future life success.
   Ms. Eaton was also founder of Starbound Theatre, a recreation based 
youth program, helping to bring the joyful experience of theatre to the 
at-risk and diverse youth of Fairfield, Vacaville, American Canyon, 
Dixon, and Napa. Ms. Eaton also serves in shaping strategic groups 
within Vacaville Unified School District to address future programs and 
curriculum, as well as be the catalyst for three youth summits for 
teens in the Will C. Wood Interact Club. Anna also serves on the Board 
of Directors for the Vacaville Rotary Club as the Youth Services 
Director and advisor to the Will C. Wood High School Interact Club.
   Anna was born in Vietnam and came to America as a young child with 
her family as they escaped from Saigon as the United States Forces 
withdrew. She is a proud mother of four and proud American who 
dedicates her life to giving back to the country that has afforded her 
so many opportunities. ``Life is more meaningful when we evolve into a 
purpose greater than ourselves.''
