  Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Barbara (Babs) 
Cotter of Yuba City, California, who exemplifies the qualities of 
selfless service and possesses a deep desire to help others in the 
community.
   Barbara Cotter, a retired educator dedicated her entire career doing 
what she loved best; making a difference in the lives of elementary 
school children. Her career spanned over a period of 38 years; 33 in 
the Yuba City Unified School District. As an elementary school teacher, 
she was inspiring, beloved, and revered by her students and fellow 
teachers alike.
   In 1986, after surviving a life threatening medical diagnosis, she 
had an overwhelming desire to give back to a community that helped her 
through her recovery. She became a Reach to Recover coordinator, and 
eventually a board member for the American Cancer Society. Barbara's 
heart of service didn't stop there, she also volunteered for the 
Community Memorial Museum of Sutter County, the State Convention 
Planning Board for Philanthropic Educational Organization, Middle 
Mountain Foundation, and Girls on the Run.
   In 2009, Barbara Cotter was honored with the Caroline S. Ringler 
Perpetual Service Award for outstanding service to the Museum and has 
been appointed to a lifetime position on the Museum Commission.
