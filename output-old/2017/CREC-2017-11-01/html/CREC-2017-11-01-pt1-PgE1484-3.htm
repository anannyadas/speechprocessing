                      TRIBUTE TO JENNIE BARANCZYK

                                 ______
                                 

                            HON. DAVID YOUNG

                                of iowa

                    in the house of representatives

                      Wednesday, November 1, 2017

  Mr. YOUNG of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and 
congratulate Drake Women's Basketball Coach Jennie Baranczyk on being 
awarded the 2017 Madelyn Levitt Community Service Award.
  The Madelyn Levitt Community Service Award is annually presented to 
Drake University faculty or staff members who have ``demonstrated 
personal commitment to volunteerism and community service.'' Jennie 
just completed her fifth season at the helm of the women's basketball 
team for the Drake Bulldogs, where not only she, but a number of her 
players, has won numerous awards and recognitions. Off the court, she 
leads her team in giving back to the community, reaching their annual 
1,000 hour goal of community service for four straight years. 
Organizations throughout the Des Moines area, and the people they 
serve, have benefited from the team's generous efforts.
  Mr. Speaker, I am honored to represent community leaders like Jennie 
in the United States Congress and it is with great pride that I 
recognize her today. I ask that my colleagues in the United States 
House of Representatives join me in congratulating Jennie for this 
outstanding recognition and in wishing her nothing but continued 
success.

                          ____________________
