                      Wednesday, November 1, 2017

  Mr. ROTHFUS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of Mr. Darryl 
DiOrio for his forty-seven years of service and leadership in the 
Johnstown community.
  Mr. DiOrio holds degrees from Saint Vincent College, the Pennsylvania 
State University and Saint Francis University.
  He has devoted his entire career to working in the steel industry, 
including twenty years at Bethlehem Steel Corporation, six years as 
President and CEO of Johnstown Wire Technologies, and nineteen years as 
President and CEO of Gautier Steel Ltd.
  Under Mr. DiOrio's leadership, Gautier Steel recovered from a near 
shutdown to a multi-million-dollar operation.
  Furthermore, Mr. DiOrio saved thousands of family-sustaining jobs by 
helping keep both Johnstown Wire and Gautier Steel in the Johnstown 
area.
  Mr. DiOrio's leadership and great care for the community will leave 
an impact on Johnstown for years to come.
  I would like to congratulate Mr. DiOrio on his recent retirement and 
wish him the best of luck in his future endeavors.

                          ____________________
