     RECOGNIZING ELLUCIAN OF RESTON, VIRGINIA ON ITS GRAND OPENING

                                 ______
                                 

                        HON. GERALD E. CONNOLLY

                              of virginia

                    in the house of representatives

                      Wednesday, November 1, 2017

  Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Ellucian on the 
occasion of the grand opening of its new office space in Reston, 
Virginia. Based in Fairfax County since 1987, the opening of this new 
headquarters location speaks to the growing presence of technology 
companies in not only Fairfax County, but the Dulles Corridor as a 
whole. We are continually reminded of why this area is rapidly 
developing a reputation as the Silicon Valley of the East.
   Established in 2012 by the merger of Datatel and SunGard Higher 
Education, Ellucian and its parent companies have been serving the 
higher education community since 1968. What began as a single office 
has expanded into 20 regional offices employing over 2,900 individuals 
all over the world.
   As a former member and Chairman of the Fairfax County Board of 
Supervisors, I know firsthand that the quality of life we enjoy in 
Fairfax County is directly tied to the strength of our education 
system. This is especially true when it comes to higher education. 
Providing the gateways for students to succeed is essential and I 
commend the staff of Ellucian for working to create and maintain those 
opportunities.
   Mr. Speaker, to prepare the leaders of tomorrow, institutions of 
higher education must have the services, tools, and technologies to 
engage and foster student success. For nearly fifty years, Ellucian has 
provided support to these institutions in order for them to achieve 
their goals. It is critical that our nation focus our sight on 
improving student outcomes to better compete in the world economy and I 
thank Ellucian and its dedicated staff for their efforts in this area. 
I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating Ellucian on the grand 
opening of its new headquarters and in wishing it great success in all 
future endeavors.

                          ____________________
