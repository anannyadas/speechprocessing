                    in the house of representatives

                      Wednesday, November 8, 2017

  Mr. YOUNG of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and 
congratulate Bill McAllister of Clarinda, Iowa who recently retired 
from the Page County Sheriff's Department with 37 years of service in 
law enforcement.
  Bill's service to our country began as a member of the United States 
Army Military Police. He later began his career in law enforcement in 
1980 with the Nebraska City, Nebraska Police Department, as well as 
graduating from the Nebraska Law Enforcement Training Center. He joined 
the Clarinda Police Department in 1982 as a patrolman and was 
eventually promoted to Sergeant. Bill graduated from the Iowa Law 
Enforcement Academy and was awarded the 1987 Silver Star for Bravery 
from the American Police Hall of Fame. He was selected Outstanding 
Officer by the Clarinda Optimist Club in 1997, and that year, joined 
the Page County Sheriff's Department as a Deputy Sheriff.
  Page County Sheriff Lyle Palmer said, ``Bill earned numerous 
certificates and attended classes every year to continue his knowledge 
of law enforcement. Bill had the ability to read people and he was a 
great benefit to the Sheriff's Department. He served the citizens of 
Page County with dignity and honor.''
  Mr. Speaker, I'm proud to represent community leaders like Bill in 
the United States Congress and it is with great pride that I recognize 
him today. I ask that my colleagues in the United States House of 
Representatives join me in congratulating Bill for this outstanding 
achievement and in wishing him nothing but the best in his retirement.

                          ____________________
