            HONORING THE SERVICE OF THE JERIKOVSKY BROTHERS

                                 ______
                                 

                            HON. JASON LEWIS

                              of minnesota

                    in the house of representatives

                      Wednesday, November 8, 2017

  Mr. LEWIS of Minnesota. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 
service of the Jerikovsky brothers of South Saint Paul, Minnesota. 
These nine brothers, the sons of Jacob and Stephania Jerikovsky, served 
bravely in the United States' Armed Forces during World War II and the 
Korean War, all of them returning home safely to their family.
   Emil, Nick, Jacob Jr., William, Robert, Earl, Edward, George, and 
Richard Jerikovsky all have the distinction of being a part of a 
remarkable feat in U.S. military history. It is unprecedented to have 
nine siblings from one family serve our country in the United States' 
Armed Forces, and this feat speaks to their family's patriotism and 
selflessness.
   These nine first generation Americans were all proud members of VFW 
Post No. 295 in South Saint Paul, Minnesota. The Jerikovsky brothers 
have made a positive impact on our community, state, and country, and 
we are fortunate to have such selfless citizens who make sacrifices to 
protect our freedoms.
   I know that the Jerikovsky brothers' legacy of service to country 
and fellow man will inspire all Minnesotans and Americans.
