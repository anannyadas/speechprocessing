                        RECOGNIZING BILL STANLEY

                                 ______
                                 

                           HON. JOE COURTNEY

                             of connecticut

                    in the house of representatives

                      Wednesday, November 8, 2017

  Mr. COURTNEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate my dear 
friend Mr. Bill Stanley on being named this year's William Crawford 
Distinguished Service Award winner by the Chamber of Commerce of 
Eastern Connecticut.
  A native of Norwich, CT, Bill began his outstanding public service 
career in journalism, writing for local publications like the Norwich 
Bulletin and the New London Day. He then transitioned to government, 
working briefly as a campaign press secretary for Governor O'Neill 
before spending the next six years at Rome, Frankel & Kennelly. In 
1996, Bill became Director of Corporate Communications for the William 
W. Backus Hospital in Norwich, where he worked until 1999. He currently 
serves as vice president of Development and Community Relations at 
Lawrence + Memorial Hospital. On a personal note, I have known Bill 
since my days as a rookie state legislator at the Connecticut General 
Assembly. He is deeply involved in the politics and community of his 
beloved Southeastern Connecticut, willing to throw himself into any 
cause that improves the region. Although passionate in his beliefs, he 
is a true gentleman and respectful of any and all people he interacts 
with, which is a lot.
  Throughout his full and prestigious career, Bill has always found 
time to volunteer for numerous causes across Eastern CT. Currently he 
is Board Chairman of his alma mater's foundation, the Three Rivers 
Community College Foundation. He also sits on the United Way of 
Southeastern Connecticut's board of directors. Bill served nearly 20 
years on the board of directors for the Chamber of Commerce of Eastern 
Connecticut, including two terms as chairman. He previously served as 
chairman of the New London Redevelopment Agency and was a board member 
at St. Jude Common and the USS Connecticut Commissioning Committee. 
From 1996 to 1999, he was Chairman of the American Heart Association's 
Southeastern Connecticut Heart Walk and continues to serve on its 
Executive Leadership Team.
  Mr. Speaker, please join me in congratulating my dear friend Bill on 
receiving this noble recognition. May others always look to him for a 
great example of leadership and service.

                          ____________________
