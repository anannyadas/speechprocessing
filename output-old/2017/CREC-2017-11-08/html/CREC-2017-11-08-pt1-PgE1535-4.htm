                              of michigan

                    in the house of representatives

                      Wednesday, November 8, 2017

  Mr. BERGMAN. Mr. Speaker, it is my honor to recognize the Keweenaw 
National Historical Park upon the occasion of its 25th Anniversary. 
Through committed preservation and community engagement, the Keweenaw 
National Historical Park has become an indispensable part of Northern 
Michigan.
  For over 7,000 years, the Keweenaw area has been a source of natural 
resources and cultural enrichment. Native peoples first utilized its 
easily accessible and workable copper to create tools and items for 
trade. Later, copper became the center of growing industries and 
cosmopolitan communities in the Keweenaw. This rich history is 
preserved through the hard work of the rangers and volunteers at the 
Keweenaw National Historical Park.
  The celebration of the park's anniversary is the perfect recognition 
of efforts to preserve our history, culture, and beautiful landscapes. 
Today, the park continues to raise the bar of innovation through 
programs and partnerships with state and local governments, private 
businesses, and nonprofit organizations. Its steadfast work has helped 
give the people of the Keweenaw Peninsula and all of the Upper 
Peninsula a sense of unity and common heritage.
  Mr. Speaker, I congratulate the Keweenaw National Historical Park for 
its 25 years of success and community investment. Michiganders can take 
immense pride in knowing that the First District is home to such an 
important institution of historical, cultural, and environmental 
preservation. On behalf of my constituents, I wish the Keweenaw 
National Historical Park all the best in its future endeavors.

                          ____________________
