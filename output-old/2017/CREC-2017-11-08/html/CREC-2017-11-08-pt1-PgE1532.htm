HONORING PETE CIARROCCHI AND CHICKIE'S AND PETE'S CRAB HOUSE AND SPORTS 
                                  BAR

                                 ______
                                 

                          HON. ROBERT A. BRADY

                            of pennsylvania

                    in the house of representatives

                      Wednesday, November 8, 2017

  Mr. BRADY of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor my friend 
Pete Ciarrocchi, Chairman and CEO of the world famous Chickie's & 
Pete's Crab House and Sports Bar. Since 1977, Chickie's & Pete's 
locations have been rightfully called the best sports bars in 
Philadelphia. So none of us were surprised when they were voted ESPN's 
No. 1 Sports Bar on the East Coast.
  Every Philadelphian knows that Chickie's & Pete's and Philly sports 
go hand in hand. The only thing better than pre-game, post-game or game 
watching at the restaurant is enjoying their food at the stadium. And 
of course, you can't leave without an order of Pete's world famous 
Crabfries.
  But Mr. Speaker, Pete Ciarrocchi is more than a successful 
businessman. He's one of Philadelphia's finest citizens. He is one of 
the owners of the three time Arena Bowl champion Philadelphia Soul 
Arena Football Team. He is also one of our leading philanthropists 
serving on the Aria Health Foundation Board of Trustees and on the Holy 
Family University Business Advisory Board. Pete is a Mummer, who is 
active with The Polish-American String Band.
  But most importantly, Pete is a proud husband and father. His lovely 
wife Lisa and three sons Peter, Blaise, and Anthony are his first loves 
and the foundation on which the rest of his world is built.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask that all of my colleagues join me in honoring Pete 
Ciarrocchi and Chickie's & Pete's Crab House and Sports Bar as they 
celebrate their 40th Anniversary tonight.

                          ____________________
