             RECOGNIZING THE SERVICE OF MR. RICHARD VOUTOUR

                                 ______
                                 

                         HON. JAMES P. McGOVERN

                            of massachusetts

                    in the house of representatives

                      Wednesday, November 8, 2017

  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to recognize the service of 
Mr. Richard Voutour. Rick is a United States Marine Corps veteran, and 
he has served for over a decade as a friend and advocate of the 
veterans of Massachusetts as a distinguished Veterans' Service Officer.
  Rick was born on January 7, 1963, in Webster, Massachusetts. He 
entered the Marine Corps at age 18 and completed training at Parris 
Island, South Carolina and Camp Pendleton, California.
  Throughout his distinguished career, Rick has consistently received 
recognition for his exemplary service to our nation, including: the 
Meritorious Service Medal, the Navy and Marine Corps Commendation 
Medal, Navy and Marine Corps Achievement Medal with one star, the Navy 
Unit Commendation, and the Meritorious Unit Commendation.
  Mr. Speaker, this alone would be an impressive list of achievements 
that deserves our respect and gratitude. But after 23 years of service 
in the Marine Corps, in places as far away as Djibouti, Valetta, and 
Amman, Rick decided to return home to Massachusetts and serve his 
nation in a new way as the Director of Veteran Services for Leominster, 
Massachusetts.
  In his 13 years as a Veterans Service Officer, Rick has helped 
countless veterans and their families throughout Central Massachusetts 
obtain the benefits and services that they deserve. From obtaining 
military record and medals--to assisting with medical care and 
benefits, every veteran that walks into Rick's office is treated with 
the dignity and respect he or she deserves. There are thousands of 
veterans in Massachusetts right now whose lives have been changed for 
the better by Rick. His dedication to improving the lives of veterans 
serves as an inspiration to me and an example for our community.
  But don't just take my word for it, Mr. Speaker. Many others have 
seen Rick's steadfast advocacy for veterans and his dogged 
determination to assist those who have sacrificed so much to proudly 
serve this country. Just this year, Rick was named Veterans Service 
Officer of the Year by Massachusetts Secretary of Veterans Services, 
Francisco Urena.
  Mr. Speaker, on behalf of the United States Congress and of the 
people of Massachusetts, I would like to thank and recognize Mr. 
Richard Voutour for his service to our country, and for his work every 
day to improve the lives of veterans in Massachusetts.
