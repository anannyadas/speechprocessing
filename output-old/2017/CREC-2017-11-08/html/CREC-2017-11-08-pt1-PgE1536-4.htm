                    in the house of representatives

                      Wednesday, November 8, 2017

  Mr. ROKITA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to acknowledge and celebrate 
the 50th anniversary of the India Association of Indianapolis (IAI). 
The IAI is a non-profit organization that unites Indian-Americans 
located in the central Indiana area. It has become a vital cultural 
bridge between Indian-Hoosiers and the community.
  The IAI was founded in 1968 by fifteen families living in the 
Indianapolis area. Today, the IAI has a membership that exceeds 2,000 
families and continues to climb. There are over 30,000 Indian-Americans 
living in the Indiana. The IAI has been a valuable voice for all 
Indian-Hoosiers and has increased understanding of India, Indian 
people, and Indian culture in central Indiana.
  The mission of the IAI is to promote the cultural activities of 
India, to foster cultural exchange between people of India and the USA, 
and to carry out educational and charitable activities. Over the course 
of the last 50 years, the IAI has performed its mission admirably and 
has enriched the community immeasurably. It has played a crucial role 
to protecting, preserving, and promoting Indian traditions and has 
showcased the beauty of India to the Indianapolis community.
  Whether it's the annual Diwali celebration, the Holi Festival, the 
yearly marking of India's independence, or a cricket game meant to 
foster friendship between the Indian and Pakistani-American community, 
the IAI has been a constant force of goodwill in Central Indiana. The 
IAI has grown exponentially since it was founded and is destined to do 
bigger and better things in the future. Indiana is lucky to have such 
an organization in its midst and I acknowledge the IAI, its leadership, 
and all its members.
  Mr. Speaker, on the occasion of its 50th anniversary, I would like to 
salute the India Association of Indianapolis.
