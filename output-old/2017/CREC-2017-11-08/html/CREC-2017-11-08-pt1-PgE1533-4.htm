                           HON. PETE SESSIONS

                      Wednesday, November 8, 2017

  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a poem, on behalf 
of Albert Carey Caswell, to honor the men and women and families of The 
Armed Forces, for their selfless service to our Nation on this upcoming 
Veteran's Day.

     And over the many years
     All in our Nation clear,
     Has been one constant here
     The men and women of The Armed Forces who hold our Nation 
           dear
     Whose valor, honor, courage, faith, selflessness, and 
           sacrifice perseveres
     While, in the darkest of days of night they all stood without 
           fear
     Who at a moment's notice into the face of hell would so 
           appear,
     All so we can all he here
     This Veteran's Day stand for something, because they stood 
           for you
     The ones who fought and bled for all that's true
     And stand for that old Red, White, and Blue
     All in what they would do
     Ready to die for their brothers and sisters in arms to their 
           left and right so true
     And remember what all of their families must go through
     On this Veteran's Day, please remember our Nation's real 
           who's who
     Stand for something because they stand for you
     When, in the darkness of war comes into view
     Teaching us all how men and women of honor behave so true
     Who came home without arms, legs, and scars upon their face
     But, for the greater good they gave
     Stand,
     Stand for something noble,
     Because they all stood so you can live the American Dream
     While, over the generations so rose to the top America's 
           Dream
     Honor all those who fight the fight,
     Who today still stand at the ready on this very night,
     Who turn the dark into the light
     Stand, for those on the battlefields of honor who watched 
           their Brothers and Sisters die,
     And had to bury them all with tears in their eyes,
     Stand, on this Veteran's Day and every day,
     For The Armed Forces, their families, and the ones who gave
     Stand, because where would we all be?
     If it were but not for the likes of all of these who stood 
           for you and me
     Stand, because freedom is not free
     But, only bought and paid for by all of he defenders of the 
           free
     Stand, because they live and they die for you,
     They bleed and they cry for you
     All so you can turn your back on them,
     And they don't ask you how you caught your disease
     Stand for our Veteran's on this Veteran's Day and everyday
     For what they give and gave
     Because, it's all they ask.

                          ____________________
