    RECOGNIZING THE LIFE OF FALLEN MISSISSIPPI ARMY NATIONAL GUARD 
              SPECIALIST (SPC) JAMES ANDERSON CHANCE, III

                                 ______
                                 

                            HON. TRENT KELLY

                    in the house of representatives

                      Wednesday, November 8, 2017

  Mr. KELLY of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, today I rise in memory of 
Mississippi Army National Guard Specialist (SPC) James Anderson Chance, 
III, who paid the ultimate sacrifice while defending our nation on 
November 6, 2003, during Operation Iraqi Freedom. SPC Chance was killed 
when his vehicle struck a landmine in Husaybah, Iraq. SPC Chance was 
assigned to C Company, 890th Engineer Battalion, Army National Guard, 
based in Columbia, Mississippi.
  According to the Associated Press, SPC Chance volunteered to lead his 
convoy. He did not want his comrades to risk their lives if they had 
spouses or children. SPC Chance, a Kokomo, Mississippi native, was 
close to his parents, James and Patricia Ann Chance. Allen Chance, SPC 
Chance's brother, said he always lived close to his parents so he could 
look after them. ``He was worried and he was trying to get it where he 
could come home for a few days to see her,'' Allen said. Mrs. Chance 
recently said her son was a good man who always made her laugh.
  SPC Chance was remembered in a post on a memorial website. ``SPC 
Chance, a true soldier, never complained, and moved out at a moment's 
notice,'' First Lieutenant (lLT) Robert Enochs of Saucier, Mississippi 
wrote. ``Thanks for your love, dedication, and sacrifice for our 
country. I wish there were many more like you. We love and miss you 
dearly. We will never forget you.''
  SPC Chance joined the U.S. Army in 1997 after he graduated from 
Kokomo High School. He served one tour of duty in the Army. In 2002, he 
joined the Mississippi Army National Guard to pursue higher education 
opportunities.
  A memorial service was held for SPC Chance at the Kokomo United 
Methodist Church which is located across the street from his childhood 
home. He was laid to rest at the Kokomo Community Cemetery.
  SPC Chance is survived by his mother, Patricia Ann Chance; his 
brother, John Allen Chance; and his nephew, Samuel Chance.
  SPC Chance will always be remembered for the sacrifice he made to 
protect America. He made his family and our nation proud.
