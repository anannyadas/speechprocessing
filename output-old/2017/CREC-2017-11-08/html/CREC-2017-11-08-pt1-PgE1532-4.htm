  Ms. FRANKEL of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate 
Christian D. Searcy and Steven L. Daniels for receiving the 2017 Anti-
Defamation League's (ADL) Palm Beach Jurisprudence Award. This award 
acknowledges those individuals who have made outstanding contributions 
to the legal profession as well as the community in which they live. I 
have had the honor of knowing both these gentleman for many years and 
commend their worthy recognition.
  Christian D. Searcy is President and CEO of Searcy Denney Scarola 
Barnhart & Shipley, P.A. For 43 years, he has litigated cases primarily 
involving catastrophic injury and death in venues throughout Florida, 
as well as other states. He has been honored numerous times for his 
exceptional advocacy and extraordinary contributions to the cause of 
justice. He is well known for his generous contributions to many non-
profit organizations committed to helping the disabled, improving 
education, and advancing community causes.
  Steven Daniels has played a significant role in the South Florida 
Jewish community since the 1980s. He has been an integral member of the 
local and national ADL leadership. Steven has also served as President 
of Temple Beth El in West Palm Beach as well as the Jewish Community 
Center of the Palm Beaches. He has earned the ``Super Lawyer'' 
distinction from Florida Trend magazine, and is currently the managing 
partner for the West Palm Beach and Boca Raton offices of Saul Ewing 
Arnstein & Lehr.
  Christian Searcy and Steven Daniels share the distinction of 
excellence in their profession and the advancement of fairness and 
justice in the community, the founding principles of the ADL.
  I congratulate and thank them both.
