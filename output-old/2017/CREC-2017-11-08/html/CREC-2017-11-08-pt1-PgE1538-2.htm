                                 ______
                                 

                           HON. JACK BERGMAN

                              of michigan

                    in the house of representatives

                      Wednesday, November 8, 2017

  Mr. BERGMAN. Mr. Speaker, it's my honor to recognize the Northwestern 
Michigan College Aviation Program upon the occasion of its 50th 
Anniversary. Through innovation, passion, and dedication, NMC Aviation 
has become an indispensable part of Northern Michigan.
  Founded in 1967, NMC Aviation came from small beginnings with three 
planes and five instructors. In just 50 years, it has grown to be one 
of the most respected aviation programs in the country. Today, they 
continue to raise the bar of innovation through ground-breaking courses 
and program partnerships with Michigan high schools and colleges across 
the world. Its instructors have real life experience, and its students 
have access to exceptional training and resources.
  As a commercial pilot of 22 years, I know the great need for quality 
pilots in our global economy, as well as the dedication and skill this 
profession requires. NMC Aviation has proven itself to be one of the 
best institutions of its kind at training the next generation of 
pilots.
  Mr. Speaker, it's my honor to congratulate the NMC Aviation Program 
for its 50 years of success and community investment. Michiganders can 
take immense pride in knowing that the First District is home to this 
outstanding institution. On behalf of my constituents, I wish the 
Northwestern Michigan College Aviation Program all the best in its 
future endeavors.
