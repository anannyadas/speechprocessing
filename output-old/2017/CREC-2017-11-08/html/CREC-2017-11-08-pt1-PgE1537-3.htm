  Mr. YOUNG of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and 
congratulate McGwire

[[Page E1538]]

Midkiff of Carter Lake, Iowa for winning the Class 3A, 126-pound 
bracket at the Iowa High School State Wrestling tournament earlier this 
year. McGwire is a student at Thomas Jefferson High School in Council 
Bluffs, Iowa.
  Iowa has a long and proud history of strong wrestling programs in our 
state, producing college and Olympic champions for years. Winning a 
state championship is the culmination of years of hard work and 
commitment, not only on the part of McGwire, but his family and 
coaches, as well.
  Mr. Speaker, the example set by McGwire demonstrates the rewards of 
hard work, dedication, and perseverance. I am honored to represent him 
and his family in the United States Congress. I ask that my colleagues 
in the United States House of Representatives join me in congratulating 
McGwire on competing in this rigorous competition and in wishing him 
nothing but continued success in his education and his wrestling 
career.
