                   HONORING THE LIFE OF VIRGIL HANKS

                                 ______
                                 

                           HON. JODY B. HICE

                               of georgia

                    in the house of representatives

                      Wednesday, November 8, 2017

  Mr. JODY B. HICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the 
life and legacy of one

[[Page E1539]]

of my constituents and an American hero, Corporal Virgil Hanks. 
Corporal Hanks passed away last week at the age of 96, just a few days 
before Veterans Day.
  Corporal Hanks joined the United States Army Air Corps in 1942 and 
was honorably discharged from the military at the end of World War II 
following four years of service. In 2015, in his hometown of Social 
Circle, Georgia, I had the distinct honor of presenting Corporal Hanks 
with a certificate of Congressional Recognition and a World War II 
Victory Medal for his valuable and selfless contribution to our 
Nation's wartime efforts.
  Virgil Hanks will be remembered as an incredibly kind and humble man, 
dedicated to his late wife, siblings, and children, whom he loved 
fiercely. His legacy of service survives to this day throughout 
Georgia's 10th Congressional District, and he will be buried at the 
Georgia National Cemetery with his other brothers and sisters in arms.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in a moment of silence to 
honor the life of Corporal Virgil Hanks, a hero who deserves the 
respect of all Americans and will be sorely missed by so many in the 
community.
