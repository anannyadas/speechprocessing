    HONORING DONALD E. ROSPERT, OHIO VETERANS HALL OF FAME INDUCTEE

                                 ______
                                 

                            HON. JIM JORDAN

                                of ohio

                    in the house of representatives

                      Wednesday, November 8, 2017

  Mr. JORDAN. Mr. Speaker, the Ohio Veterans Hall of Fame will hold a 
ceremony in Dublin on November 9 to mark the induction of its 2017 
class. I am honored to commend to the House one of these inductees: 
Donald E. Rospert of Bellevue.
   A graduate of Norwalk's St. Paul High School and of Bowling Green 
State University, Mr. Rospert is a Marine Corps veteran of the Vietnam 
War. He speaks regularly at area schools to share his experiences in 
Vietnam and instruct students on proper flag etiquette and display. He 
also participates in the color guard during Bellevue High School's home 
football games.
   He and his brother, Kenn, cofounded the Wounded Soldiers Fund in 
2005 to help local families with loved ones injured in Iraq or 
Afghanistan. The fund has aided more than a dozen area families.
   Donn and Kenn also designed, created, and secured funding for 
Bellevue's Fallen Soldiers Memorial, and were instrumental in bringing 
The Wall That Heals (a traveling replica of the Vietnam Veterans 
Memorial) to Bellevue for display this year.
   Mr. Rospert takes great pride in the work of the local branch of Big 
Brothers and Big Sisters of America, with which he was affiliated for 
nearly two decades. He personally mentored several local youths and 
remains in contact with one to this day.
   Mr. Speaker, selection for the Hall of Fame is a high honor accorded 
to no more than 20 Ohioans each year. To be considered for induction, 
individuals must not only serve the nation honorably in the military 
but also reflect the high value of service to others in their post-
military careers.
   I am pleased to join in the accolades for Mr. Donald E. Rospert and 
his outstanding record of service as he is inducted into the Ohio 
Veterans Hall of Fame.
