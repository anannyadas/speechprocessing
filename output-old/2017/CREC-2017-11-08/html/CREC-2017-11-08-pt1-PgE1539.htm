            CELEBRATING THE 100TH ANNIVERSARY OF HONOR BANK

                                 ______
                                 

                           HON. JACK BERGMAN

                              of michigan

                    in the house of representatives

                      Wednesday, November 8, 2017

  Mr. BERGMAN. Mr. Speaker, it's my honor to recognize Honor Bank upon 
the occasion of its 100th Anniversary. Through its trusted services, 
reliable staff, and community engagement, Honor Bank has become an 
indispensable part of Northern Michigan.
  Founded in 1917 as Honor State Bank, just $20,000 in capital and a 
determined staff built the bank into the community institution it is 
today. Over the course of 100 years, Honor Bank forged its path to 
success through World Wars and financial crises, all while maintaining 
its commitment to the community it was built upon. Today, the bank's 
capital has grown, yet it still promotes its ideals of independent 
community banking.
  The bank's Honor Code of integrity, hard work, responsibility, 
teamwork, and reliability is illustrated through its Giving Back to our 
Communities program. During each month of this year's anniversary 
celebrations, Honor Bank is highlighting the work of a local non-profit 
agency chosen by the bank's employees. Through this Agency Spotlight, 
customers and employees are encouraged to donate needed items, and 
employees volunteer on average 100 minutes per month to the selected 
agency. These charities have included the Betsie Valley District 
Library, Michigan Blood, and the Benzie Food Pantry. Honor Bank 
continues to set a positive example of what can be achieved when a 
company is built around a community.
  Mr. Speaker, it's my honor to congratulate Honor Bank and its staff 
for 100 years of success, service, and community investments. 
Michiganders can take great pride in knowing the First District is home 
to such dedicated citizens. On behalf of my constituents, I wish Honor 
Bank all the best in its future endeavors.

                          ____________________
