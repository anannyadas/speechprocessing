                                 ______
                                 

                            HON. DAVID YOUNG

                                of iowa

                    in the house of representatives

                      Wednesday, November 8, 2017

  Mr. YOUNG of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate and 
recognize Diana Deibler for being named a 2017 Women of Influence 
honoree by the award-winning central Iowa publication, Business Record.
  For 18 years, the Business Record has undertaken an exhaustive annual 
review to identify a standout group of women who have made a 
significant difference in business, civic and philanthropic endeavours 
throughout the Greater Des Moines Area.
  Diana has spent her life utilizing the work ethic instilled upon her 
at an early age after growing up on her family's farm in Donnellson, 
Iowa. She dreamed of being a television anchor but found herself going 
down a different path as a broadcast reporter and producer. Later, she 
used the skills and experience she gained in the news business to have 
a successful career in marketing and consulting. Her success allowed 
her to also dedicate her time and talents to the Des Moines community, 
serving nine years on the board of Mercy Medical Center, and nine years 
on the Mercy College of Health Sciences board.
  Mr. Speaker, it is a profound honor to represent leaders like Diana 
in the United States Congress and it is with great pride that I 
recognize and applaud her for utilizing her talents to better both her 
community, and the great state of Iowa. I ask that my colleagues in the 
United States House of Representatives join me in congratulating Diana 
on receiving this esteemed designation, thanking those at Business 
Record for their great work, and wishing Diana nothing but continued 
success.
