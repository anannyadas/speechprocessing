   TRIBUTE TO PAUL OREFFICE, FORMER CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD OF THE DOW 
                            CHEMICAL COMPANY

                                 ______
                                 

                         HON. JOHN R. MOOLENAAR

                              of michigan

                    in the house of representatives

                      Wednesday, November 8, 2017

  Mr. MOOLENAAR. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to Paul 
Oreffice, the former Chairman of the Board of The Dow Chemical Company, 
upon his 90th birthday.
  Paul was born in Venice, Italy and came to the United States with his 
family when he was 17 years old. He went on to attend Purdue University 
and graduated with a Bachelor's Degree in Chemical Engineering in 1949. 
After serving in the U.S. Army during the Korean conflict, Paul began 
his career at Dow Chemical in Midland, Michigan.
  Following international assignments in Switzerland, Italy, Brazil and 
Spain, Paul became the first president of Dow Chemical Latin America in 
Coral Gables, Florida, in 1970. In 1971, he was elected as a member of 
the Board of Directors, and later as president of Dow Chemical U.S.A. 
in August 1975. Paul was named president and CEO of The Dow Chemical 
Company in May 1978 and chairman in May 1986.
  As a humanitarian, Paul received the Encomienda del Merito Civil 
(Order of Civil Merit) in 1966 from the government of Spain and in 1978 
he was honored with the title ``Grand Ufficiale'' by the Italian 
government. Paul is the first person to receive both the Societe de 
Chimie Industrielle's Palladium medal and SCI America's Chemical 
Industry medal, which he received in 1981 and 1983, respectively.
  Paul has been especially helpful in giving back to Michigan's Fourth 
Congressional District through his intentional engagement of the 
community. His involvement in bringing the Midland Soccer Club and the 
Greater Midland Tennis Center to life has not only provided 
opportunities for the local youth to come together to be active within 
the community, but also brings tourism to the area through tournaments 
and other events. Paul's involvement in philanthropy touches not only 
the Midland community, but reaches across the country as he is a 
Trustee of the Rollin M. Gerstacker Foundation, served as a Senior 
Member of the MD Anderson Cancer Center Visitors Board, and he served 
as Chairman of the Board of the Parkinson's Foundation from 2003 to 
2007. His strategic thinking and continued contributions have greatly 
impacted families across the district and the country.
  On behalf of the Fourth Congressional District of Michigan, I am 
honored today to recognize Paul Oreffice for his lifetime of work in 
chemical engineering and for his commitment to the Midland Community.
