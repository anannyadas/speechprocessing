             VETERAN URGENT ACCESS TO MENTAL HEALTHCARE ACT

                           HON. DOUG COLLINS

                               of georgia

                    in the house of representatives

                       Tuesday, November 7, 2017

  Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 
918, the Veteran Urgent Access to Mental Healthcare Act.
  As Veterans Day approaches, we remember the debt of gratitude we owe 
our nation's veterans, who have sacrificed greatly to protect our 
freedoms.
  Tragically, about 11 to 20 out of every 100 veterans who served in 
Operations Iraqi Freedom or Enduring Freedom have PTSD in a given year. 
As researchers work diligently to understand the increase in veteran 
suicides--now at a troubling 22 veterans per day--it is important to 
understand that service-related mental stress is not limited to 
veterans who receive honorable discharges.
  The Army has released at least 22,000 combat veterans diagnosed with 
mental health conditions or traumatic brain injuries since 2009 for 
alleged misconduct--meaning that many who have served in uniform may 
fall through the VA's cracks as they attempt to access mental health 
services.
  The Veteran Urgent Access to Mental Healthcare Act recognizes this 
issue and expands the boundaries of mental health care covered by the 
VA to better serve those who serve us--including those with PTSD that 
affects their service.
  The lack of access to mental health care remains an unfortunate 
reality for too many veterans. This bill would extend a helping hand to 
combat veterans struggling with the effects that their service has on 
their mental health. It would ensure that a population at a high-risk 
for suicide receives the care and support its men and women deserve.
  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and I thank 
veterans across the country for their service.
