                      TRIBUTE TO JENNIE BARANCZYK

                                 ______
                                 

                            HON. DAVID YOUNG

                                of iowa

                    in the house of representatives

                      Wednesday, November 8, 2017

  Mr. YOUNG of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and 
congratulate Jennie Baranczyk, head coach of Drake University's women's 
basketball team, for being named a 2017 Women of Influence honoree by 
the award-winning central Iowa publication, Business Record.
  For 18 years, the Business Record has undertaken an exhaustive annual 
review to identify a standout group of women who have made a 
significant difference in business, civic and philanthropic endeavours 
throughout the Greater Des Moines Area.
  Jennie is no stranger to success. During her time as a member of the 
women's basketball team at the University of Iowa she was named First 
Team All-Big Ten in 2003. Her outstanding athletics accomplishments 
early on in her career have translated into her new role as the head 
coach of Drake University's women's basketball team. In her first year 
as head coach, Jennie was given a team that finished with a record of 
11-20 the prior year. Her unyielding commitment to excellence and hard 
work have turned the fortunes of the basketball program around, 
finishing last season 28-5, champions of the Missouri Valley 
Conference, and making an appearance in the NCAA Basketball Tournament.
  Mr. Speaker, it is an honor to represent leaders like Jennie in the 
United States Congress and it is with great pride that I recognize and 
applaud her for utilizing her talents to better both her team, her 
community and the great state of Iowa. I ask that my colleagues in the 
United States House of Representatives join me in congratulating Jennie 
on receiving this esteemed designation, thanking those at Business 
Record for their great work, and wishing Jennie a long and successful 
career.
