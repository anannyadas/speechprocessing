                      Wednesday, November 8, 2017

  Mr. KELLY of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, today I rise in memory of Army 
Staff Sergeant (SSG) Brian Lee Freeman who paid the ultimate sacrifice 
while defending our great nation on November 7, 2005, during Operation 
Iraqi Freedom. SSG Freeman was killed when a vehicle-borne improvised 
explosive device detonated near his dismounted patrol in Baghdad. Also 
killed were First Lieutenant (1LT) Justin S. Smith, Specialist (SPC) 
Robert C. Pope, II, and Private First Class (PFC) Marion A. Reyes. SSG 
Freeman was assigned to the 3rd Squadron, 3rd Armored Cavalry Regiment, 
Fort Carson, Colorado.
  SSG Freeman, a Caledonia, Mississippi native, enlisted in the U.S. 
Army in 1997. Pat Freeman, SSG Freeman's mother, said her son was 
married to his wife, Leah for 14 months. According to the Associated 
Press, Mrs. Freeman said prayers from family and friends helped them 
through a difficult time. ``The Army has been very kind to us and 
helped us through this bad time in our lives,'' she said. ``We know 
Brian is in a better place and we will see him again someday. We call 
him our angel now.''
  A scholarship was established in his memory of SSG Freeman at 
Caledonia High School. Twelve scholarships have been awarded over the 
years. Bill Lawrence, the former mayor of Caledonia, recently said that 
SSG Freeman's late father, Glen Freeman, worked hard to build support 
for the development of the Veterans Memorial, located at the Ola J. 
Pickett Park. The family also donated an American flag and flagpole to 
the facility. The memorial includes two battle crosses--one for SSG 
Freeman and one for Staff Sergeant (SSG) Jeffrey Dayton, a Caledonia 
High School graduate who was killed in Iraq in 2004.
  At the time of his son's death, Mr. Freeman told the Associated Press 
that SSG Freeman meant everything to the family. ``This boy was a hero. 
Our son was everything to us. People don't realize what it is to lose a 
child,'' he stated. Mrs. Freeman said SSG Freeman demonstrated bravery 
and courage as a soldier. She said her son saved the life of their 
unit's medic who he talked out of riding with them in the Humvee on the 
day of the incident. SSG Freeman told the medic that he may be needed 
if something happened to them.
  The funeral for SSG Freeman was held at the Lowndes Funeral Home in 
Columbus. SSG Freeman was laid to rest at Rowan Cemetery in Caledonia, 
Mississippi.
  SSG Freeman is survived by his mother, Pat Freeman; his wife, Leah; 
her son, Bradley Thomas; his sister, Lisa Nichols; his uncle, Rick 
Merryman; his aunt, Karen Merryman; his brother-in-law, Ronnie 
Christian; and his sister-in-law, Linda Christian.
  SSG Freeman's service and sacrifice to protect America will not be 
forgotten.
