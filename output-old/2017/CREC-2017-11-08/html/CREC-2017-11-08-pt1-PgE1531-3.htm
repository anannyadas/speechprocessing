  Mr. HUDSON. Mr. Speaker, I was unable to vote on this day because I 
was attending the memorial service for the 3rd Special Forces Group 
soldiers who were recently killed in action while serving in Niger.
  Had I been present, I would have voted yea on Roll Call No. 610, 611; 
nay on Roll Call No. 612, 613; yea on Roll Call No. 614, and 615.
