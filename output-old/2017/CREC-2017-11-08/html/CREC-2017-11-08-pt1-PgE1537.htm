                      Wednesday, November 8, 2017

  Ms. LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the longstanding career 
of Ronald Johnson, a fearless leader for more than three decades in the 
fight against HIV/AIDS. His leadership spans numerous esteemed 
organizations and agencies including the Gay Men's Health Crisis, 
Minority Task Force on AIDS, City of New York, Presidential Advisory 
Council, AIDS Action, and United AIDS from which he is now retiring.
  Following the Stonewall Uprising in 1969, the gay community of New 
York City witnessed the rising swell of the HIV/AIDS epidemic. 
Throughout the 1980's, the number of AIDS-related deaths climbed higher 
each year. In 1981, amidst widespread fear and uncertainty, Dr. 
Lawrence Mass and Larry Kramer founded the first New York City 
nonprofit devoted to HIV and AIDS awareness, testing, education, 
advocacy, and prevention. They called it the Gay Men's Health Crisis 
(GMHC).
  Mr. Johnson began volunteering with GMHC in 1984, while continuing 
his service as the Assistant Executive Director of the University 
Settlement, a nonprofit social service program that assisted immigrants 
and low-income families with fulfilling their health, education, and 
housing needs. After volunteering for a few years, Mr. Johnson was 
invited to join the GMHC's Board of Directors.
  Mr. Johnson served as Executive Director of the Minority Task Force 
on AIDS and in 1992 was appointed the Citywide Coordinator for AIDS 
Policy for the City of New York. Known for being both forceful and 
persuasive yet guided by facts, Mr. Johnson helped the city develop a 
comprehensive strategy for stemming the HIV/AIDS epidemic through 
proactive education, prevention, and treatment. He strengthened the 
city's AIDS hotline and testing programs, needle-exchange program, and 
housing and medical care services for AIDS patients.
  By 1996, Mr. Johnson was rewarded for his efforts as he witnessed a 
sharp decline in New York City's HIV and AIDS-related deaths. His 
programs were working and he had the data to prove it. He later joined 
the Presidential Advisory Council on HIV/AIDS, where he helped design 
the policy thinking and best practices for the President's Emergency 
Plans for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR).
  Today, on behalf of California's 13th Congressional District, I am 
honored to commend Ronald Johnson for his long career advocating for 
the prevention and treatment of HIV and AIDS. His service and devotion 
has saved lives, inspired hope, and made this world a remarkably safer 
and better place.
