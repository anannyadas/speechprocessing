                               of georgia

                    in the house of representatives

                        Monday, November 6, 2017

  Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 
1066, the VA Management Alignment Act.
  The men and women who have bravely served our country in uniform 
deserve the peace of mind that the VA will work for them--not against 
them.
  Over the past few years, our nation's veterans have too often 
experienced outrageous wait times, long lines, and mismanagement at VA 
facilities across the country. In the wake of these scandals, the 
members of this body have passed multiple bills aimed to right these 
wrongs and improve VA functions. Unfortunately, we hear far too often 
of problems continuing to plague the halls of VA medical facilities.
  The VA Management Alignment Act directs the Secretary of the VA to 
report to Congress the steps the Department will take to ensure that 
the organizational structure of the VA is both efficient and effective.
  Supported by groups including the American Legion and the American 
Federation of Government Employees, this bill seeks to chart a 
meaningful path forward to better serve those who put their lives on 
the line to serve us. It is integral that the VA make clear the steps 
it will take to ensure that our nation's veterans have access to the 
quality, timely care that they deserve.
  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and I thank 
veterans across the country for their service.
