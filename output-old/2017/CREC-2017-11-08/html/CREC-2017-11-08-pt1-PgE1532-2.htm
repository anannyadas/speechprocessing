                                of iowa

                    in the house of representatives

                      Wednesday, November 8, 2017

  Mr. YOUNG of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate and 
recognize Mary Sconiers-Chapman, community leader and retired higher 
education administrator, for being named a 2017 Women of Influence 
honoree by the award-winning central Iowa publication, Business Record.
  For 18 years, the Business Record has undertaken an exhaustive annual 
review to identify a standout group of women who have made a 
significant difference in business, civic and philanthropic endeavours 
throughout the Greater Des Moines Area.
  After receiving a degree in elementary education from Drake 
University in Des Moines, Iowa, Mary began a long successful career 
educating our future generations. She immediately began teaching after 
graduation and worked her way up to principal in the Des Moines Public 
School system. As her passion for education continued to grow, Mary 
decided that working in higher education was next and became executive 
dean of Des Moines Area Community College (DMACC), ultimately retiring 
in 2013 as the vice president of strategic partnerships after 23 years 
with the school. While Mary is a dedicated educator, she is also 
passionate about service to her community. She was instrumental in the 
creation of the Evelyn K. Davis Center for Working Families that 
focuses on assisting individuals and families in finding jobs, 
educational opportunities, and job training.
  Mr. Speaker, it is a profound honor to represent community leaders 
like Mary in the United States Congress and it is with great pride that 
I recognize and applaud her for utilizing her talents to better both 
her community, and the great state of Iowa. I ask that my colleagues in 
the United States House of Representatives join me in congratulating 
Mary on receiving this esteemed designation, thanking those at Business 
Record for their great work, and wishing Mary nothing but the best.
