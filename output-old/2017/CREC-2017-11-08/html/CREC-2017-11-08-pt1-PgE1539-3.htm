  Mr. YOUNG of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and 
congratulate Martin Aldrich of Clarinda, Iowa for being selected as the 
2016-17 Educator of the Year by Schmitt Music Company. The Schmitt 
Music Company operates music stores in 7 Midwest states, offering help 
to over 13,000 students per year with music lessons, and employing 
nearly 400 people, many who are professional musicians. They are 
dedicated to recognizing teachers who go above and beyond in their 
musical careers.
  Martin is the Band Director at Clarinda Middle School in Clarinda, 
Iowa. He has served in that position since 2003. A graduate of 
Morningside College and the University of Kansas, he serves as the 
Southwest Iowa Bandmaster's Association representative for middle 
school affairs and has served as district president of the Southwest 
Iowa Bandmaster's Association. He also fills a leadership role in the 
Journey of Excellence Mentor Program for first year teachers and is a 
member of the District Leadership Team, which focuses on teacher 
professional development activities for visual arts, music, and 
physical education.
  Mr. Speaker, I applaud and congratulate Martin for earning this 
award. He is an excellent example of how hard work and dedication can 
affect the future of our youth and their education. I ask that my 
colleagues in the United States House of Representatives join me in 
congratulating Martin for this outstanding recognition and in wishing 
him nothing but continued success.
