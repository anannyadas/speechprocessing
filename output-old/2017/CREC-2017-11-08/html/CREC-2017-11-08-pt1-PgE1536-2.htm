                            HON. DAVID YOUNG

                                of iowa

                    in the house of representatives

                      Wednesday, November 8, 2017

  Mr. YOUNG of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and 
congratulate Robert Thompson, of Afton, Iowa, for receiving the 2017 
East Union's Military Service Recognition Award.
  The Afton Star Enterprise reported that ``Robert Thompson was a 1957 
Afton High School graduate who enlisted in the U.S. Army, serving from 
1957 to 1979. He had two assignment periods in Viet Nam during the Viet 
Nam War, and while there received two Bronze Star Awards and a Silver 
Star for his action in combat and a Purple Heart for a combat-related 
injury.'' In addition to his service in Vietnam, Robert was stationed 
in other locations, like Iceland and Panama, before returning home to 
Afton with his family. He retired from the Army in 1979.
  Mr. Speaker, I'm proud to represent Iowans like Robert in the United 
States Congress and it is with great pride that I recognize him today. 
I ask that my colleagues in the United States House of Representatives 
join me in congratulating Robert for receiving this outstanding 
designation and in wishing him nothing but the best.

                          ____________________
