  Mr. KELLY of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, today I rise in memory of Army 
(SGT) Sergeant Courtland Anshun Kennard who paid the ultimate sacrifice 
while defending our great nation on November 9, 2006, during Operation 
Iraqi Freedom. SGT Kennard was killed when an improvised explosive 
device detonated near his vehicle in Baghdad, Iraq. Also killed was 
Staff Sergeant (SSG) Gregory W.G. McCoy of Webberville, Michigan. SGT 
Kennard was assigned to the 410th Military Police Company, 720th 
Military Police Battalion, 89th Military Police Brigade, Fort Hood, 
Texas.

  Retired Army Sergeant (SGT) Douglas Kennard, SGT Kennard's father, 
recently said his son grew up living on military bases in the United 
States and Germany. SGT Kennard graduated from General H.H. Arnold High 
School in Weisbaden, Germany in 2002. SGT Kennard followed in his 
father's footsteps when he enlisted in the U.S. Army in 2003. ``He 
wanted to join the Army,'' Mr. Kennard said. ``I am extremely proud of 
him. I was always proud of him.''
  Pamela Pleasant, SGT Kennard's aunt, said she was always proud of her 
nephew. ``He was an awesome kid,'' Mrs. Pleasant said. ``He had a smile 
that would light up a room. He was so humble. I miss him terribly.''
  SGT Kennard was remembered by a fellow soldier on a memorial website. 
``I will always remember your smile, Kennard,'' Sergeant (SGT) Michele 
Martin wrote. ``He is a very special person and a soldier. He was 
always there for his fellow comrades. When you were down, his smile 
always cheered you up. I will always cherish Kennard in my heart and 
always remember the great sacrifice he took for this great nation and 
his family to be free.''
  A funeral was held for SGT Kennard at Mount Pelier Missionary Baptist 
Church in Starkville, Mississippi. SGT Kennard was laid to rest at 
Memorial Garden Park, which is located near Mississippi State 
University in Starkville.
  SGT Kennard is survived by his parents, Douglas and Darlene Kennard; 
his brother, Jamahl Kennard; and his aunt, Pamela Pleasant.
  SGT Kennard gave his life to protect our nation. His service will 
always be remembered.
