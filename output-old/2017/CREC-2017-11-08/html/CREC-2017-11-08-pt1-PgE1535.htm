                                 ______
                                 

                            HON. DAVID YOUNG

                    in the house of representatives

                      Wednesday, November 8, 2017

  Mr. YOUNG of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and 
congratulate Zach Barnes of Southeast Polk High School for winning the 
Class 3A, 145 pound bracket at the Iowa High School State Wrestling 
tournament earlier this year.
  Iowa has a long and proud history of strong wrestling programs, 
producing college and Olympic champions for years. Winning state 
championships is the culmination of years of hard work and commitment, 
not only on the part of Zach, but also his parents, his family, coaches 
and fellow teammates.
  Mr. Speaker, the example set by Zach demonstrates the rewards of 
dedication, and perseverance. I am proud to represent him and his 
family in the United States Congress. I ask that my colleagues in the 
United States House of Representatives join me in congratulating Zach 
on competing in this rigorous competition and in wishing him nothing 
but continued success.

                          ____________________
