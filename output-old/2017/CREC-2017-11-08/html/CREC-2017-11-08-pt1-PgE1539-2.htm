                      TRIBUTE TO BLUE STAR MOTHERS

                                 ______
                                 

                            HON. TODD ROKITA

                               of indiana

                    in the house of representatives

                      Wednesday, November 8, 2017

  Mr. ROKITA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and salute Blue 
Star Mothers in honor of Military Family Appreciation Month. Blue Star 
Mothers are mothers, stepmothers, grandmothers, foster mothers and 
female legal guardians who have children serving in the military, Guard 
or Reserve, or who are veterans. These women provide support for the 
service members that make up our military, the veterans on the 
homefront, and the families of our service members and veterans.
  The Blue Star Mothers started in the United States 75 years ago 
during World War II in Flint, Michigan. On January 22, 1942, the Flint 
News Advertiser printed a coupon asking mothers of servicemen to return 
the coupon after filling it out. The following February, 300 mothers 
came together for their first meeting and decided to form a permanent 
organization. They started working in hospitals and train stations, 
packed care packages for soldiers, and became a working part of 
homeland security during times of war.
  Today, Blue Star Mothers have a presence in 40 states consisting of 
almost 300 chapters nationwide. In the State of Indiana, we have seven 
chapters that I would like to recognize directly. These chapters are 
the Blue Star Mothers of Indiana out of Monticello, the Blue Star 
Hoosier Mothers out of Crawfordsville, the North Central Indiana Blue 
Star Mothers out of Kokomo, the St. Joe Valley Blue Star Mothers out of 
South Bend, the Fort Wayne Area Blue Star Mothers out of Fort Wayne, 
the Hoosier Heartland Blue Star Mothers out of Kokomo, and the Indy 
Blue Star Mothers out of Indianapolis. Each of these groups has had an 
incredible impact on our community and on the Hoosier service members 
and their families.
  These women know what it means to serve our country. They live it 
each and every day. It is with their help and strength that we are able 
to have the greatest military the world has ever seen. Behind each of 
our heroes, both at home and abroad, you will likely find a Blue Star 
Mother providing them the support, encouragement, and courage they need 
to fight our foes. Mr. Speaker, we need more Americans like the Blue 
Star Mothers.
