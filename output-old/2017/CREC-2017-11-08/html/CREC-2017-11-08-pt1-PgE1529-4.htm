                      Wednesday, November 8, 2017

  Mr. VISCLOSKY. Mr. Speaker, it is with sincere admiration that I 
recognize the Asian American Medical Association, which hosts its 41st 
Annual Gala on Saturday, November 11, 2017, at Avalon Manor in 
Merrillville, Indiana. Each year, the Asian American Medical 
Association pays tribute to prominent, outstanding citizens and 
organizations for their contributions to the community. In recognition 
of their efforts, these honorees are awarded the prestigious Crystal 
Globe Award.
   The Asian American Medical Association has been a tremendous asset 
to Northwest Indiana. Its members have dedicated themselves to 
providing quality medical services to the residents of Northwest 
Indiana and have served their communities through many cultural, 
scholastic, and charitable endeavors.
   At this year's Annual Gala, the Asian American Medical Association 
will present the Crystal Globe Award to one of Northwest Indiana's 
finest citizens, Mr. Joseph Costanza. Mr. Costanza began practicing law 
after graduating from the Northwestern University School of Law in 
1961. Throughout his illustrious career, Mr. Costanza has served as 
counsel for many organizations including the East Chicago Economic 
Development and Redevelopment Commissions, East Chicago Parks 
Department, Ogden Dunes Parks Department, and the former American Trust 
and Savings Bank of Whiting, Indiana. Mr. Costanza also served as 
special counsel for the Town of Ogden Dunes and as general counsel for 
the former First National Bank of East Chicago, Indiana.
   Mr. Costanza has volunteered much of his time and efforts to 
numerous charitable and civic organizations throughout the region, 
including Calumet College of Saint Joseph, the East Chicago Chamber of 
Commerce, Saint Catherine Hospital, the Community Foundation of 
Northwest Indiana, the Indiana Historical Society, and the East Chicago 
Urban Enterprise Academy, to name a few. For his lifetime of dedication 
to the community of Northwest Indiana, Joseph is worthy of the highest 
praise.
   Joseph's commitment to the community and his career is exceeded only 
by his devotion to his amazing family. He and his beloved wife, 
Aurelia, have four children, eight grandchildren, and two great-
grandchildren.
   Mr. Speaker, I ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues 
join me in commending the members of the Asian American Medical 
Association, as well as this year's Crystal Globe Award recipient, Mr. 
Joseph Costanza. For his devotion to his remarkable career and his 
outstanding service to the community of Northwest Indiana and beyond, 
Joseph is most deserving of the honor bestowed upon him and serves as 
an inspiration to us all.
