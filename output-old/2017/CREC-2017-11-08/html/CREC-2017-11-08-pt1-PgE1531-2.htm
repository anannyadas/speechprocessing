                                 ______
                                 

                            HON. DAVID YOUNG

                                of iowa

                    in the house of representatives

                      Wednesday, November 8, 2017

  Mr. YOUNG of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and 
congratulate Alex Thomsen of Underwood High School for winning the 
Class 1A, 126 pound bracket at the Iowa High School State Wrestling 
tournament earlier this year.
  Iowa has a long and proud history of strong wrestling programs, 
producing college and Olympic champions for years. Winning two state 
championships in a row is the culmination of years of hard work and 
commitment, not only on the part of Alex, but also his parents, his 
family and coaches.
  Mr. Speaker, the example set by Alex demonstrates the rewards of hard 
work, dedication, and perseverance. I am honored to represent him and 
his family in the United States Congress. I ask that my colleagues in 
the United States House of Representatives join me in congratulating 
Alex on competing in this rigorous competition and in wishing him 
nothing but continued success.

                          ____________________
