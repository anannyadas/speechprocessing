Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to a special \nplace: Montana.\n  From our snowcapped mountains to our nearly endless prairies, Montana \nis an awe-inspiring place of tremendous beauty. We call it Big Sky \nCountry, the Treasure State, the Last Best Place, and we call it home.\n  When Montana first became a territory in 1864, it was the Wild West. \nProspectors, cattle ranchers, and settlers overcame scorching sun and \nblistering cold to establish our Nation's 41st State.\n  But there is something even more special than the beauty of an \neastern Montana sunset or being knee-deep in a crystal-clear mountain \nstream. It is the people of Montana. Montanans are kind, warm, \ngenerous, and hardworking people.\n  On November 8, 1889, our special place became part of something even \nmore special, the land of the free and the home of the brave. Today, \nMontanans celebrate the 128th anniversary of our statehood.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. GIANFORTE", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "182", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H8644", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "8", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "CELEBRATING MONTANA'S STATEHOOD", "id": "CREC-2017-11-08-pt1-PgH8644-3", "title": "CELEBRATING MONTANA'S STATEHOOD"}
