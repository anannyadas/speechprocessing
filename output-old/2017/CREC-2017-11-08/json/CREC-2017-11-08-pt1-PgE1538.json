Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor Pacifica, California, a sea-\nsprayed city in my district blessed by salty breezes, soaring \nshorebirds and the collective smile of residents that rivals in \nintensity the warmth of the sun itself. On November 22, 2017, Pacifica \nis a spritely 60 years old.\n  Residents love this town, and there's no doubt as to why. The views \nof the Pacific Ocean are spectacular, the shoreline is captivating. If \nyou wish to stroll through the sand and to hunt for seashells, bring \nyour children to the beach and spend a few hours listening to the waves \nand gazing at the gulls overhead or the snowy plover nearby, Pacifica \nis the place to be.\n  Although sunshine is the predominant feature of Pacifica, fog \noccasionally arrives. Well, actually, more than occasionally. But it is \nquiet and serene in Pacifica when fog shrouds the shore and the \nmountains.\n  For hundreds of years, Pacifica was home to a village of the Ohlone \ntribe. Pacifica's creeks and ample supply of fish and nuts fed \ngenerations. These residents lived in balance with nature, thriving on \nthe ocean side of the San Francisco Peninsula and trading with other \nvillages on the bay side.\n  The Spanish explorer Don Gaspar de Portola arrived in 1769 and \nclimbed the mountain behind Pacifica to a point now known as Sweeney \nRidge. From that point, Portola was the first European to discover the \nexistence of San Francisco Bay. In the next decades, thousands \nfollowed, leading to the establishment of Mission Delores and the \ncreation of early San Francisco. Pacifica fed San Francisco from crops \nplanted throughout the San Pedro Valley. In 1839, a Mexican land grant \nto Don Francisco Sanchez was made and it almost exactly matched the \nboundaries of modern-day Pacifica.\n  While much of modern-day Pacifica might be unrecognizable to the \nOhlone or to Don Francisco Sanchez, one characteristic of those early \ntimes would easily be recognized: families. Both in the distant past \nand today, Pacifica teems with families. The school district is highly \nregarded and has over 3,000 students from grades K through 8. Parents \nfrom biotech companies and other global corporations drive a few extra \nmiles to work every day so that they may live in a community with \nquality schools and a web of soccer teams and gymnastics programs that \nallow children to thrive amidst friends. The annual family-friendly \nPacifica Fog Fest draws tens of thousands from throughout the Bay Area \nto enjoy the sun, music, a hometown parade, and all of the cheese and \nnachos needed to earn a mother's scorn.\n  Civic life in Pacifica is energetic, to say the least. In recent \nyears, the city has completed such notable projects as the \nundergrounding of utilities, the creation of a dog park, the \ncommencement of a parking program at state beaches, improvements to the \nsenior/community center, protection of environmental resources around \nthe creeks and on the beaches, and numerous other public improvements \nthat augment Pacifica's natural splendor.\n  The city's leadership is as strong today as ever, and it meets the \nchallenges of modern governance head on. For example, City government \nillustrates its love-hate relationship with Mother Nature by joyfully \npaying to protect the snowy plover's nesting areas while scrambling to \npay to prevent the erosion of bluffs to the beaches below. The council \nknows that if you walk along the beach near Pedro Point, you're \nprobably walking on the sand that once existed as the bluff, a few \nmiles north, that supports Esplanade Boulevard. Such is the duty of \nleadership in Pacifica where a councilmember must pay to maintain \ninfrastructure in the coin of the realm while delivering sand and \nrefurbished habitats for endangered species for free to the ultimate \nadministrator of Pacifica's fate: Mother Nature.\n  Congratulations to the City of Pacifica upon 60 years of formal \nincorporation, from November 22, 1957 to the present. From tail fins on \ncars to shark fins in the ocean, the city has done well for itself. \nWith its loving population and visionary leadership, there are many \nmore adventures to come for this little place by the sea that 39,000 \ncall home and celebrate as a place to embrace life, family and \nneighbors.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Ms. SPEIER", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 3}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "182", "extension": true, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "E1538", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "8", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "IN RECOGNITION OF THE 60TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE CITY OF PACIFICA", "id": "CREC-2017-11-08-pt1-PgE1538", "title": "IN RECOGNITION OF THE 60TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE CITY OF PACIFICA"}
