Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor our \nNation's veterans. I would like to take a moment to thank our Nation's \nheroes for their selfless service to our country.\n  It was a privilege to welcome home veterans on the Indy Honor Flight \nlast month after they traveled to D.C. to visit memorials honoring \ntheir service and the sacrifice of our Nation's Armed Forces. It was \nboth a humbling and inspiring opportunity to meet so many veterans who \nare patriots in every sense of the word. We owe it to them and their \nfamilies to ensure they have access to quality care and the services \nthey deserve.\n  I am proud to see many important veterans bills pass through the \nHouse this week and look forward to continuing our work in Congress to \nsupport our American heroes.\n  To all of our veterans, we thank you for your service, and enjoy \nVeterans Day. We salute you.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mrs. BROOKS of Indiana", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "182", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H8606", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "8", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "HONORING OUR NATION'S VETERANS", "id": "CREC-2017-11-08-pt1-PgH8606-6", "title": "HONORING OUR NATION'S VETERANS"}
