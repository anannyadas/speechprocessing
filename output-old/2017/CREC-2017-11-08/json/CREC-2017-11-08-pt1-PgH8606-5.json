Mr. Speaker, I rise today to discuss the \nneed for tax policy that benefits hardworking families in New Hampshire \nand all across this country.\n  We are long overdue for real tax reform, but, unfortunately, the plan \nunveiled by my Republican colleagues is more of a giveaway to \nmillionaires, billionaires, and corporate special interests.\n  In fact, consider this: 80 percent of the tax breaks in their bill go \nto the wealthiest 1 percent of Americans. This is while cutting $500 \nbillion from Medicare and $1 trillion from Medicaid. That trade is, \nfrankly, unconscionable. This bill is a bad deal for Granite Staters \nand a bad deal for the American people.\n  The Republican tax plan eliminates important deductions for \nhardworking middle class families. It caps property tax deductions, \neliminates student loan interest deductions and the medical deduction \ntax credit. The plan even ends the Work Opportunity Tax Credit that \nencourages employers to hire veterans.\n  House Democrats are offering a better deal. I urge my Republican \ncolleagues to work with us to support working families.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Ms. KUSTER of New Hampshire", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "182", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H8606", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "8", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "THE REPUBLICAN TAX PLAN", "id": "CREC-2017-11-08-pt1-PgH8606-5", "title": "THE REPUBLICAN TAX PLAN"}
