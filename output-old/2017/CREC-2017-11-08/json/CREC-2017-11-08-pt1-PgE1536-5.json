Mr. Speaker, today I rise in memory of Army \n(SGT) Sergeant Courtland Anshun Kennard who paid the ultimate sacrifice \nwhile defending our great nation on November 9, 2006, during Operation \nIraqi Freedom. SGT Kennard was killed when an improvised explosive \ndevice detonated near his vehicle in Baghdad, Iraq. Also killed was \nStaff Sergeant (SSG) Gregory W.G. McCoy of Webberville, Michigan. SGT \nKennard was assigned to the 410th Military Police Company, 720th \nMilitary Police Battalion, 89th Military Police Brigade, Fort Hood, \nTexas.\n\n\n  Retired Army Sergeant (SGT) Douglas Kennard, SGT Kennard's father, \nrecently said his son grew up living on military bases in the United \nStates and Germany. SGT Kennard graduated from General H.H. Arnold High \nSchool in Weisbaden, Germany in 2002. SGT Kennard followed in his \nfather's footsteps when he enlisted in the U.S. Army in 2003. ``He \nwanted to join the Army,'' Mr. Kennard said. ``I am extremely proud of \nhim. I was always proud of him.''\n  Pamela Pleasant, SGT Kennard's aunt, said she was always proud of her \nnephew. ``He was an awesome kid,'' Mrs. Pleasant said. ``He had a smile \nthat would light up a room. He was so humble. I miss him terribly.''\n  SGT Kennard was remembered by a fellow soldier on a memorial website. \n``I will always remember your smile, Kennard,'' Sergeant (SGT) Michele \nMartin wrote. ``He is a very special person and a soldier. He was \nalways there for his fellow comrades. When you were down, his smile \nalways cheered you up. I will always cherish Kennard in my heart and \nalways remember the great sacrifice he took for this great nation and \nhis family to be free.''\n  A funeral was held for SGT Kennard at Mount Pelier Missionary Baptist \nChurch in Starkville, Mississippi.
