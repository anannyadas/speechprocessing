Mr. Speaker, I am here to speak about the Republican's \nbillionaires-first tax bill.\n  Mr. Speaker, the Tax Policy Center determined they will raise taxes \nfor approximately 38 million middle class households. Americans agree \nthat we need more jobs, higher wages, and lower taxes. But the \nRepublican bill rewards billionaires, prioritizes corporate profits, \nand hurts working families.\n  It is welfare for the wealthy paid for by the hardworking middle \nclass American. It fails the President's own Trump test, which says \ntheir tax plan would not benefit the wealthiest of us. Guess what. It \ndoes.\n  Worst of all, New Jersey families suffer the most. The bill guts the \ncritical State and local tax deduction. That means one-fourth of all \nNew Jerseyans will be paying more taxes.\n  Why should billionaires receive tax relief instead of New Jersey's \nmiddle class families?\n  Americans must reject this billionaires-first, bloated, backwards \nbill. It will do nothing to raise wages or bring real relief for \nworking families.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. NORCROSS", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "182", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H8647", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "8", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "BILLIONAIRES-FIRST TAX BILL", "id": "CREC-2017-11-08-pt1-PgH8647-3", "title": "BILLIONAIRES-FIRST TAX BILL"}
