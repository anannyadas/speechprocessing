Mr. Speaker, it is increasingly obvious \nwhat a sham of a tax plan the Republicans have proposed, slashing taxes \non the superrich and large corporations at the expense of the middle \nclass.\n  What is less well known, and what the Republicans don't want to talk \nabout, is their proposal to repeal tax-exempt private activity bonds \nand, therefore, to kill the same public-private partnerships that they \nprofess to support.\n  States, local governments, and private partners around the country \nuse private activity bonds to finance a wide array of infrastructure \nprojects, like highways, airports, hospitals, water treatment \nfacilities, and affordable housing.\n  In North Carolina, for example, private activity bonds financed and \nupgraded the terminal at Raleigh-Durham International Airport and are \nbeing used by our State housing agency to attract investors for new \nmultifamily housing developments worth more than $700 million.\n  If Republicans get their way, these projects would die on the vine, \nand more than 6,200 units of affordable housing would simply disappear.\n  How does that help working families realize the American Dream?\n  At a time when funding for housing and infrastructure is continually \nsqueezed, the last thing we should do is push through a plan that would \nhamstring our State and local governments and destroy our ability to \nleverage private investment.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose the Republican tax plan.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. PRICE of North Carolina", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "182", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H8608", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "8", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "GOP TAX PLAN KILLS HOUSING AND INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENT", "id": "CREC-2017-11-08-pt1-PgH8608", "title": "GOP TAX PLAN KILLS HOUSING AND INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENT"}
