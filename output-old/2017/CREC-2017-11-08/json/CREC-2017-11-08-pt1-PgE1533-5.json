Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the \nlife of Jan Platt and to honor her legacy for the Tampa Bay community. \nShe will always be remembered as an environmental pioneer, champion for \n``ethics in government'' and inspiration for her selfless service.\n  Born in St. Petersburg, Jan lived in Tampa for most of her life and \ngrew up with a love for Tampa Bay and its natural environment. She \ngraduated from Hillsborough High School in 1954 and earned a degree in \npolitical science from Florida State University, where she graduated \nPhi Beta Kappa, in 1958. During college, she was President of the \nStudent Senate, Student Body Vice President, and even recognized \namongst her peers as the ``Most Outstanding Senior Woman'' in her \ngraduating class. After graduating she began her career as a \nschoolteacher and taught at both Hillsborough and Plant High Schools \nbefore finally being elected to serve on the City of Tampa's City \nCouncil in 1974. Four years later, she was elected to Hillsborough \nCounty's Board of County Commission, where she proudly served for 24 \nyears.\n  Jan served her community in countless ways. She established the \nAgency on Bay Management, the Tampa Bay Estuary Program and the \nEnvironmental Lands Acquisition and Protection Program. She led as the \nPresident of the Suncoast Girl Scout Council and the Hillsborough \nCounty Head Start Community Foundation INC. Jan endowed a scholarship \nin honor of her sister, Bobbie Lou, at the\n\n\nFlorida State University College of Music. She was also an active \nmember of the Friends of the Library. Because of her support for \nlibraries, in her honor, the Tampa-Hillsborough County Public Library \nnamed one of their branches, the ``Jan Kaminis Platt Regional \nLibrary''.\n  Additionally, Jan was the recipient of the University of South \nFlorida's Women in Leadership and Philanthropy Lifetime Achievement \nAward, recipient of the Hillsborough County Bar Association's Liberty \nBell Award, and she was inducted into the Hillsborough County's Women's \nHall of Fame in 2012.\n  I was honored to serve alongside Jan during my time on Hillsborough \nCounty's Board of County Commission. She was an inspiration to me and \nmany others throughout her career in elected office. A passionate \nleader, Jan's love of the environment led her to devote herself to \nprotect and preserve our community's natural resources.\n  Jan Platt inspired me to be a better public servant. She was honest, \nethical and loved our Tampa community--from the waters of Tampa Bay to \nthe pristine, wooded areas she worked to protect. Throughout her career \nserving our community, even in times of great change in local governing \nbodies, Jan was steadfast in her leadership and it was a great honor to \nlearn from her and know her. I hope her commitment to ethics in \ngovernment will inspire another generation of passionate leaders to \nserve.\n  Mr. Speaker, on behalf of the citizens of our Tampa Bay community, I \nam proud to honor the life of Jan Platt and pay tribute to her \noutstanding contributions to the Tampa community. Jan is survived by \nher husband Bill, son Kevin, his wife Michele and granddaughter Emma. \nShe leaves an indelible legacy for future generations to enjoy our bay \nand its waters the same way she did.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Ms. CASTOR of Florida", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 3}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "182", "extension": true, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "E1533-E1534", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "8", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "JAN PLATT", "id": "CREC-2017-11-08-pt1-PgE1533-5", "title": "JAN PLATT"}
