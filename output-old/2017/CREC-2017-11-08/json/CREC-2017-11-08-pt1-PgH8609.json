Mr. Speaker, let me see if I can inject some truth into \nthis.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise to oppose the deficit-exploding Republican tax \nplan that rewards billionaires first, and then asks hardworking \nAmericans to pay for it.\n  The Trump Republican tax scam will raise taxes for millions of \nworking families. It will kill jobs in the home construction industry. \nIt will punish student loan borrowers. This reckless plan will repeal \nthe deduction for State and local income and sales tax. I would remind \nmy colleagues in the majority: If you vote ``yes,'' you are voting for \na $900 billion tax increase on American families.\n  This bill is not conservative. It is not pro-family. It is not pro-\nworker. It will kill jobs and reward the wealthy and corporations at \nthe expense of everyone else.\n  Vote ``no'' on the GOP tax scam, and let's pass a real tax reform \nbill that puts middle class families first.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. CLAY", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "182", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H8609", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "8", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "TAX PLAN WILL RAISE TAXES", "id": "CREC-2017-11-08-pt1-PgH8609", "title": "TAX PLAN WILL RAISE TAXES"}
