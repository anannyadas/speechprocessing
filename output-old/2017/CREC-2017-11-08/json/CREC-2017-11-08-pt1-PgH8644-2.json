Mr. Speaker, 17 years ago, the United States began a 2-\nmonth-long crash course in voting machines and election infrastructure. \nThe 2000 Presidential election opened our eyes to the fact that voting \nequipment in most places was out-of-date and unsafe.\n  We didn't learn the lessons of 2000, and in 2017, America's election \ninfrastructure remains in a bad state. We must act immediately.\n  First, we need to help all local and State governments replace their \noutdated paperless machines with more secure systems.\n  Second, we need to require postelection audits of all paper records \nto make sure that the results tabulated by voting machines have not \nbeen hacked.\n  Third, we need to help election officials at the local level upgrade \ntheir database and election infrastructure to protect against all cyber \nattacks.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting all \nefforts to modernize and protect our voting infrastructure and \nlegislation dealing with cyber attacks.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. PAYNE", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "182", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H8644", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "8", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "THE STATE OF AMERICA'S VOTING INFRASTRUCTURE", "id": "CREC-2017-11-08-pt1-PgH8644-2", "title": "THE STATE OF AMERICA'S VOTING INFRASTRUCTURE"}
