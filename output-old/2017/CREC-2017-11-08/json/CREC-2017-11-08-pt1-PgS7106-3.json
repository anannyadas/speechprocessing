Mr. President, as we prepare to commemorate Veterans Day \nthis weekend, I would like to offer my sincere appreciation to the \ndedicated veterans who have served our country so bravely over the \nyears. Only in a great country such as ours do we have so many willing \nand able citizens who volunteer for duty. These selfless individuals \nunderstand the importance of protecting our country and are willing to \ngive their lives to do it.\n  Many of these brave men and women make the ultimate sacrifice, such \nas my own brother, Jesse Morlan Hatch who was killed in World War II. \nSSG Aaron Butler of Utah also comes to mind. Staff Sergeant Butler was \ntragically killed in the line of duty last summer while serving in \nAfghanistan. The valor of patriots like Jesse and Aaron is indicative \nof all men and women who volunteer to serve in our Armed Forces. I have \nalways had a deep-rooted respect for America's servicemembers and her \nveterans.\n  On behalf of the State of Utah, I would also like to express our \nhumble gratitude for our Nation's veterans and active servicemembers. \nThroughout\n\n\nthis weekend, Utah will host a variety of ceremonies, all dedicated to \ncelebrating our veterans. The town of Magna will be hosting its annual \nVeterans Day parade; the town of Howell will be naming its community \ncenter after SGT Rocky D. Payne, who was killed in Iraq in 2005; and \nthe students of Granite Park Junior High School will be hosting a \nspecial Veterans Day assembly. With events being held all across our \nState, it is clear to see that Utahns hold our Nation's veterans in the \nhighest esteem. I am honored to represent a State that honors our \nveterans.\n  I would also like to personally acknowledge the city of Layton, which \nwill be hosting a grand Veterans Day parade to be followed by the \ngroundbreaking ceremony of a new Vietnam War memorial wall. I could not \neven begin to describe the endeavor that Mayor Bob Stevenson, the city \nof Layton, the Utah State Legislature, and so many others have \nundertaken to bring this wonderful memorial to Utah. I am grateful for \ntheir leadership, and I am delighted to see this memorial become a \nreality.\n  I will close today by saying this: To all veterans and your families, \nthank you. Thank you for your sacrifice, for your commitment, and for \nyour dedication to this Nation and its citizens. Most of all, thank you \nfor your patriotism and faith in America. To our Nation's veterans we \nowe a debt of gratitude that can never be fully repaid.\n  (At the request of Mr. Schumer, the following statement was ordered \nto be printed in the Record.)\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. HATCH", "itemno": 0}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 1}], "header": {"chamber": "Senate", "num": "182", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "S7106-S7107", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "8", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "VETERANS DAY", "id": "CREC-2017-11-08-pt1-PgS7106-3", "title": "VETERANS DAY"}
