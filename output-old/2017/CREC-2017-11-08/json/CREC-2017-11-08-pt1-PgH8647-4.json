Mr. Speaker, I stand here today to shed light and to \nput a face on an imperative issue, the imperative issue of affordable \nhousing. I am here representing neighborhoods like Marble Hill, Inwood, \nWashington Heights, Hamilton Heights, Morningside Heights, Harlem and \neast Harlem, and the northwest Bronx.\n  Public housing and public housing capital funding is imperative for \nmany of my constituents. Just to shed some light on the magnitude of \nthis problem, Mr. Speaker, in the 13th Congressional District, there \nare 62 housing developments--62 public housing developments.\n  There are a total of 340 buildings, and, within those buildings, \nthere are 34,609 apartments where families live; so 62 housing \ndevelopments out of 326 for the entire city of New York, 340 buildings \nout of 2,462 buildings in the city of New York, and 34,609 apartments \nout of 176,692 apartments across the city of New York.\n  In fact, Mr. Speaker, public housing houses over 400,000 residents. \nIt is larger than many cities in many States across the Nation, and \npublic housing capital funding is imperative and necessary for my \nconstituents.\n  Not only do these residents rely on stable, affordable housing to \nstay close to their families and be near their jobs and schools, but \nour city relies on these residents who are also teachers, home \nhealthcare workers, caregivers, and taxi drivers. They run our city. In \nfact, they are an integral part of the economic engine of the city. \nThey are part of our local economy. They fuel our economy on a daily \nbasis. Mr. Speaker, these folks really represent the economic engine of \nNew York City.\n  As you will hear from my colleagues, affordable housing--public \nhousing--and its residents are under threat. After a decade of funding \nreductions, the President's administration made one thing clear: they \nplan to drastically accelerate funding reductions for HUD. This turns \nthat housing agency, essentially, into an absentee landlord, into a \nslumlord, if you will, administrating public housing developments \nacross the country that are in decrepit and seriously embarrassing \nconditions.\n  The administration's fiscal year 2018 budget proposal revealed a $7.6 \nbillion cut, almost a 20 percent cut to HUD, and a two-thirds cut to \npublic housing capital needs.\n  Now, New York City has a need of $17 billion to do point work, roof \nwork, boiler work, and elevator work to improve the quality of life of \nthe residents of these housing developments. Yet the administration has \nproposed a $7.6 billion cut. This is a national crisis, an affordable \nhousing national crisis.\n  We have Members from California to Texas to New York who all believe \nthat affordable housing should be at the forefront of our progressive \npriority. It is a fundamental cornerstone of the American Dream that we \ncannot afford to let slip away.\n\n\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the distinguished gentlewoman from the State \nof Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).", "turn": 3, "speaker": "Mr. ESPAILLAT", "itemno": 6}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "J000032", "text": "  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, let me give my greatest appreciation to \nthe gentleman from New York, who will remain at the podium as he has \nyielded to me, and to thank him for the leadership that he has given to \nso many issues.\n  Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman for the leadership work \nthat he took to Puerto Rico that will need housing, and the U.S. Virgin \nIslands that will need housing. The neighborhoods that he has just \nmentioned, I am quite familiar with. I know those neighborhoods in New \nYork. I have relatives in New York.\n  But I also know the neighborhoods in Texas, and I know the public \nhousing developments. I want to join the gentleman in that terminology \nbecause, remember, it used to be the projects. But we know that public \nhousing developments are where people live. It is where they raise \ntheir children. When you have a home in the public housing development, \nit needs maintenance, elevators, window reinforcement, hallways cleaned \nup, painting done, and, yes, debugging, and brick-by-brick repair, or \nit may be a new addition.\n  All of my life, I have met my classmates in public, elementary, and \nmiddle school, and they live in the housing developments, many of whom \nI could go back to, and they are doctors, lawyers, teachers, business \npersons, and Congresspersons. They are upstanding citizens. But we also \nknow that they have said to us that you have allowed these public \nhousing developments to deteriorate so that children of families who \nlive there now may be subjected to violence and drugs, and it is not \ntheir home.\n  Let me tell you why we are in that predicament.\n  Right now, as we speak, they are marking up the tax scam. If you look \nat this pie, you will see that it will be impossible for any moneys to \ngo for public housing or affordable housing because 80 percent of the \ntax cuts will go to the 1 percent. That means that we will lose $1.5 \ntrillion in revenue.\n  What Congressman Espaillat is talking about is that we will be losing \nand will not be able--as the budget that was passed evidences with $2.4 \ntrillion in cuts in domestic discretionary spending, it will not allow \nthe work that we are calling for today: reconstruction, new build, \nrehab, repairs, and adding to the housing stock in America for our \npeople who are in need.\n  Let me show you this. It may not be exactly in our neighborhood, but \nit shows you what happened in a disaster. This is a house, or a place \nwhere people would be in a house. I could go to Texas after \nHurricane Harvey and find houses in this condition. I could go to Port \nAransas or Rockport. I can go to Third Ward or northeast Houston.\n\n  In our community, Mr. Speaker, we have what we call blue tarps after \nthe hurricane, and they stay on because people are in houses that they \ncannot afford to repair. They need affordable housing.\n  Do you know what? They want to live in historic neighborhoods like \nFifth Ward where Barbara Jordan grew up, Sunnyside, South Park, Third \nWard, Acres Homes, northeast Houston, and Independence Heights, but \nthey need housing.\n  So I join the gentleman in saying that this is a travesty. This is a \ndisgrace. We need funding for affordable housing. Hurricane Harvey has \nmade it even more disastrous because there are people in housing now \nright in my district--and I hear you in northeast Houston where the \nwalls are pulled out and the mold is on because they need affordable \nhousing. They need Section 8 vouchers and clean housing.\n  Mr. Speaker, let me tell you about the affordable housing and public \nhousing. I have lost 112 units through Hurricane Harvey in \ncondemnation, and I may lose more out of a total of 201 in one \nparticular two-story area of Clayton Homes; and then 2100 Memorial, we \nare fighting to not lose the housing that is needed there.\n  So I want to join and thank the Congressional Progressive Caucus and \nthank the gentleman for leading this Special Order. I want to make sure \nthat I keep this picture up for America to know that unless we fight \nagainst these dastardly cuts, whether you are in a disaster area and \nhave lost your home; or whether you are in a city like New York and are \nfacing the deterioration of public housing, or the elimination of units \ntaken offline; or whether you are in Houston, Texas, under the Houston \nHousing Authority and you are losing units, the cry is for the families \nof America.\n  Who do we care for? Some of them are families of Active-Duty \nsoldiers. Some of them are families of veterans. So I would join the \ngentleman in crafting and working on stopping the bleeding of losing \naffordable housing for the many millions of Americans who need it and \nwelcome it, and for the millions of children who deserve it.\n  Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding to me, and I thank \nhim again for his leadership.", "turn": 4, "speaker": "Ms. JACKSON LEE", "itemno": 7}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "E000297", "text": "  Mr. ESPAILLAT. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentlewoman from \nTexas for her eloquent remarks regarding this pressing need, this \nnational crisis of housing.\n  Let me just share with you some other numbers that will further \nensure that the American people understand in full depth this crisis.\n  In my district, as I said earlier, there are 75,463 residents of \npublic housing out of 400,000 citywide. There are 34,035 NYCHA families \nin the district out of 174,283 citywide. Twenty-five percent are \nchildren who are subject to mold like you see right here on this easel, \nMr. Speaker, mold that contributes to asthma and to other respiratory \ndiseases that then lead to absenteeism in the schools and long-term \nproblems for young people and children who live in these public housing \nunits.\n  In addition to that, Mr. Speaker, 21 percent of the residents of \nthese housing developments are seniors over 62 years old who are also \nsubjected to mold, chipping paint, and elevators that don't work. They \nhave to go up and down 18 or 20 stories. Some of them are in \nwheelchairs or have some real challenges getting around. Yet the \nFederal Government and its Department of Housing and Urban Development, \nHUD, continue to be an absentee landlord abandoning them to their own \nfate. Fifty-two percent of those residents, Mr. Speaker, are on fixed \nincomes, and 46 percent across the city have an employed family member. \nSo these are the numbers that are very telling to this national crisis.\n  The reduction in capital funding which leads to the deterioration of \nbuildings' roofs and facades, failure of boilers, leaks, mold like we \nsee right here, and other unacceptable conditions are devastating to my \nconstituents, and they contribute to a public health crisis, asthma, \nrespiratory disease.\n  Americans need a better deal for housing. As we continue negotiations \non the fiscal year 2018 appropriations and the administration prepares \nthe fiscal 2019 budget proposal, we need to ensure that public housing \nis adequately funded.\n\n\n  Sufficient capital funding is imperative for my district and the \ncountry, and it ensures the creation of jobs through capital work.\n  Investing capital dollars in public housing repair would also yield \nemployment in our communities. It also ensures the reduction of \nnegative health outcomes and healthcare costs related to the \ndeterioration of housing conditions. It also results in quality, stable \nhousing for low-income Americans, which is one of the most important \nfactors in the alleviation of poverty.\n  Americans need a better deal for housing. I hope that my colleagues \nremember the constituency that we serve, particularly the most \nvulnerable ones like the residents of public housing, and we continue \nto fight back against budget cuts. Growing the public housing capital \nfund must be elevated as a priority.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr. Gomez).", "turn": 5, "speaker": "Mr. ESPAILLAT", "itemno": 8}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "G000585", "text": "  Mr. GOMEZ. Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman Espaillat for leading \nthis important Special Order.\n  It is no secret that many cities in our country face an affordable \nhousing crisis. That crisis is particularly acute in California, as \neveryone in my State, from the Bay Area to Los Angeles to the Inland \nEmpire, will tell you.\n  California is a desired destination for people from all over the \nworld, many of\n\n\nthem skilled, tech-savvy young people who moved to California for our \nclimate, culture, or commerce. This is especially true for my home city \nof Los Angeles, which boasts cultures and cuisines from all over the \nglobe, allowing anybody to feel at home.\n  Unfortunately, the growth of affordable housing has not kept pace \nwith the population growth. This disconnect has created a housing \naffordability crisis that is exacerbating economic inequality and \nforcing lifelong Angelinos out of neighborhoods they grew up in.\n  The lack of housing raises rents on working families, which, in turn, \nthreatens the vibrant hubs of Latino, Black, and Asian culture \nthroughout my district, potentially stripping these neighborhoods of \ntheir character that made them so unique and desirable to live in in \nthe first place.\n  Our affordable housing crisis has left more than 400,000 households \nin the city of Los Angeles and 900,00 in L.A. County in what they call \na precarious housing situation. A precarious housing situation means \nthat the dwelling is substandard, families are doubled up, or they \nspend more than half their income on housing.\n  That is 1.3 million people in precarious housing situations, \nteetering on the edge of homelessness, one bad day away from losing the \nroof over their head. That is on top of 58,000 homeless individuals in \nLos Angeles County.\n  Simply put, the affordability crisis in California threatens our \nState's great legacy to provide economic opportunity for all.\n  In Los Angeles, we have seen that, when we target our resources to \nhelp specific populations, we get results and we save lives. In 2015, \nL.A. City housed more than 15,000 people, including 2,600 veterans and \n2,800 chronically homeless people, more than any other city in the \ncountry.\n  Despite the historic housing shortage and a staggering mental health \ncrisis, my city has proven that policymakers can tackle this problem if \nwe have a coordinated effort at the State, local, and Federal levels.\n  L.A. is stepping up. So is the State of California. L.A. passed \nmeasure HHH, which is $1.2 billion to help individuals who are \nhomeless. The California State Legislature passed 15 housing bills and \na $4 billion bond to be on the ballot in 2018.\n  But we can't do it on our own, and we don't need the Federal \nGovernment to undermine our efforts by undermining their role and \nresponsibility at the Federal level. Unfortunately, our Republican-led \nFederal Government doesn't believe in being a good partner and doesn't \nbelieve in combating unaffordable housing and homelessness. They have \nchosen to starve vital agencies like Housing and Urban Development and \nzero out funding for agencies such as the Interagency Council on \nHomelessness.\n  Cities like L.A. and States like California need responsible Federal \npartners to tackle issues like homelessness so they can make tough \nchoices and make sure we have a housing situation that serves all \npeople. That starts with actual Federal investment in projects and \nprograms that help people, not just the rich. That is why the \nRepublican tax cut plan is such a sham and deserves to go back to \nwhatever dark corner of Republican dogma it came from.\n  As it stands right now, the Republican tax plan would cut the \nproduction of affordable housing in half by eliminating multifamily, \ntax-exempt housing bonds. It would also repeal the 4 percent tax credit \nand provisions authorizing the use of tax-exempt private activity \nbonds. Taken together, these provisions account for 50 percent of all \naffordable housing production and would make our affordable housing \ncrisis even worse.\n  Republicans in Congress only claim to care about giving States the \npower to pursue their own policies. It would be great if their actions \nmatched their words and they actually worked with our great cities and \nStates to address important problems instead of making them worse.\n  I ask for all of you to consider that any tax plan not exacerbate the \nhousing crisis in our country.\n  Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative Espaillat for leading this \nimportant Special Order.", "turn": 6, "speaker": "Mr. GOMEZ", "itemno": 9}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "E000297", "text": "  Mr. ESPAILLAT. Mr. Speaker, earlier, I talked about some of the \nproposed budget cuts that HUD has brought forward for this fiscal year. \nLet me tell you, the American people, what some of the programs are \nthat will be negatively, adversely affected by these cuts on a daily \nbasis.\n  Section 8, a program that provides rental assistance to help low-\nincome individuals and families, more than 125,000 households in New \nYork City's NYCHA complexes depend on Section 8 vouchers, 39,000 of \nwhich are administered by the city's HPD Department. Approximately half \nof the voucher recipients are elderly and disabled.\n\n  Community Development Block Grants help the city enforce housing \nquality standards. More than half of the city's Community Development \nBlock Grant allocations support housing quality standards funding; \n500,000 inspections have been conducted, 8,000 emergency repairs, \n16,000 housing litigation cases, and emergency shelters for 1,000 \nhouseholds, just in 2016.\n  The Low Income Housing Tax Credit, nationally, 90 percent of the \naffordable housing is financed through the Low Income Housing Tax \nCredit. The Low Income Housing Tax Credit and tax-exempt bonds have \nhelped create and preserve over 116,000 safe, quality, affordable homes \nin New York City.\n  These programs will be compromised and lead to apartments with mold, \nchipping paint, leaky pipes, dysfunctioning elevators, failing boilers, \nand leaky roofs. So this is a major national crisis.\n  Let me share with you some of my constituents' stories. Now that we \nhave talked about numbers, let's talk about what these numbers mean and \nwho they impact.\n  Let's talk about, for example, a lady named Maria Pacheco, who has \nlived in the UPACA 6 development for 12 years. She is retired from \nworking at the stock market. This is what she had to say about the \nimportance of making capital improvements to her public housing \nbuilding:\n\n       If NYCHA fixes the entrance doors and the walkway in front \n     of the development, more seniors would be able to get out of \n     their apartments more often. There are a number of seniors \n     who do not come out of their apartments because they are not \n     able to open the entrance doors. Those doors are really heavy \n     and the walkway is dangerous, and a lot of seniors fear they \n     will fall.\n\n  Maria Pacheco needs a better deal in housing from Congress. Seniors \nare too afraid that they will fall.\n  During Secretary Ben Carson's listening tour--by the way, Mr. \nSecretary, New York City is still waiting for you to see our public \nhousing complexes and the conditions that they are in--during his so-\ncalled listening tour, this is what he had to say to a development in \nColumbus, Ohio, that is partially funded by HUD: ``Compassion means not \ngiving people a comfortable setting that would make somebody want to \nsay: `I'll just stay here. They will take care of me.' ''\n  Mr. Secretary, ``a comfortable setting,'' you said. Public housing \noften lacks consistent heat and hot water. That is far from being \ncomfortable.\n  Public housing elevators often break down. That is far from being \ncomfortable.\n  Public housing often has no heat and hot water and mold on the wall. \nThat is far from being comfortable.\n  I think my constituent Birdie Glen, age 78, who lives in the Jackie \nRobinson Development with her husband and great-grandson would disagree \nwith you, Mr. Secretary. She is retired from the Department of \nEducation, and this is what she had to say:\n\n       If they fix the boilers in the Jackie Robinson Development, \n     the residents would be more grateful and appreciative. The \n     lack of consistent heat and hot water has caused a lot of the \n     residents to get sick. Adults as well as children have been \n     visiting the doctor's office more frequently due to getting \n     sick because of no heat and hot water.\n\n  This has become a public health crisis as well. During the winter \nmonths, residents experience more illnesses in the Jackie Robinson \ncomplexes because the boilers need to be replaced.\n  Another resident, Felicia Rodriguez, 70 years old, who lives in the \nGaylord Houses, says:\n\n       In my 2 years living at Gaylord, I have experienced severe \n     flooding, water damages in different areas of my apartment. \n     If we had repairs and upgrades in our development, we will \n     value our homes and neighborhood. We need to ensure we get \n     the repairs completed in a timely manner to avoid further \n     damages to our infrastructure.\n       Gaylord has significant leaks due to the pipe damage, brick \n     gaps, roof damage. These problems affect our health, our \n     hygiene, and\n\n\n     economic issues for many seniors in Gaylord development. By \n     making major roof and brick repairs at Gaylord White Houses, \n     we will eliminate leaks, flooding, and damage to the top \n     floors of these apartments.\n\n  This is a public health crisis.\n  Let's talk, Mr. Speaker, about public health and mold.\n  In every city, there is an aging public housing development complex, \nand a lack of investment for decades means that many buildings pose \ngreat, great health risks to the residents. In New York City, a \nmajority of NYCHA buildings are more than 60 years old. Public housing \nauthorities have endured decades of Federal disinvestment. For many, a \nlack of affordable funds means that repairs have spiraled out of \ncontrol. Some units are so damaged that they cannot be lived in.\n  Citywide, there are 2,300 NYCHA units that are vacant, and many need \nextensive renovations to become safe homes again. Not only is the lack \nof Federal investment hurting the number of public housing units \navailable, but vacant units almost always make public housing less safe \nfor current residents.\n  Speaking to DNAinfo, Jisele Hearne elaborates how vacant units make \nthe Harlem River Houses less safe: ``Of course, we are worried. Anyone \ncan come in and you don't know what they are going to do. They can . . \n. leave the gas on. It's not safe living someplace where nobody is \nmonitoring.''\n  Harlem River Houses has been plagued with mold for many years, and \nunits on the top floors have remained uninhabited.\n  Mold affects 328 NYCHA properties, and the situation has only \nworsened after Hurricane Sandy. That was in 2012. We need capital \ninvestment not just to eradicate the appearance of mold; we need to \naddress the root cause of that. We need to replace leaky roofs, \ncrumbling pipes, and all ventilation systems to make sure the mold is \ngone forever, for good.\n\n\n  The health of children, families, and seniors is at stake. The CDC \nreports that exposure to mold can lead to coughing, wheezing, eye and \nskin irritation in otherwise healthy people.\n  For small children, exposure to mold may lead to asthma, leading to \nabsenteeism in the schools. For vulnerable residents, such as seniors \nor small children, mold may lead to much more serious medical \nconditions.\n  The government is the landlord of public housing complexes across the \ncountry, and we cannot expect public housing residents to deal with \nconditions that would be deemed unacceptable in the private market. It \nis our solemn duty to make sure that public housing residents have \nhomes that allow them to lead healthy and productive lives.\n  If we can afford to spend $1.75 million remodeling one unit in public \nhousing--that is the White House that I am referring to, which is \npublic housing. If we could spend $1.75 million to renovate the most \nexpensive public housing unit, the White House, then surely, Mr. \nPresident, we can afford to guarantee safe homes for public housing \nresidents.\n  If President Trump can spend $291,000 on office walls, then America's \n1.16 million units of public housing should have walls free of mold, \nlike the one we see right here, and other safety hazards. Unlike the \nWhite House, residents of public housing cannot afford lavish \nrenovations. They depend on us, and we must not fail them.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Lee), my \ndistinguished colleague.", "turn": 7, "speaker": "Mr. ESPAILLAT", "itemno": 10}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "L000551", "text": "  Ms. LEE. Mr. Speaker, first let me thank Congressman Espaillat for \nyielding and for his tremendous leadership and advocacy to ensure that \nour communities have access to affordable housing, regardless of their \nincome, regardless of their background. I want to thank the \nCongressional Progressive Caucus and him for leading this Special Order \ntonight because it is so important that the public really understand \nthe issues that we are dealing with here in Washington, D.C., on behalf \nof the American people.\n  Tonight, of course, we are calling on the Trump administration and \nour colleagues across the aisle for greater investments in affordable \nhousing, including in public housing.\n  Affordable housing should be a basic right. No one should have to \nchoose between placing food on the table or paying their rent, \nespecially not in the wealthiest country on Earth. Sadly, right now, \nour country is in the midst of an affordable housing crisis. Half of \nall families in this country are forced to spend more than 30 percent \nof their hard-earned income on housing.\n  Over 38 million families struggle to pay rent and put food on the \ntable every day because they pay more than one-third of their income on \nhousing. Right now there are only 12 counties in the entire country \nwhere a minimum-wage worker is able to afford a modest two-bedroom \napartment.\n  Simply put, the housing crisis in America has reached epidemic \nproportions. It is really a state of emergency. Nowhere is this \nepidemic more evident than, for example, in my own district. The \naverage renter in Oakland, California, for example, would be forced to \nspend a staggering 70 percent of their income on housing if they were \nto move today--70 percent--and many are being forced out.\n  In Oakland, the number of homeless individuals increased by 25 \npercent this year to more than 2,700 people. In all of my county, \nAlameda County, the homelessness population has increased by nearly 40 \npercent in the last 2 years to more than 5,600 people.\n  Now, these people have settled into encampments with all of their \nfurniture and belongings across the streets of cities in my district. \nIt is unconscionable and devastating that this un-American reality \npersists across the country.\n  Yet, instead of working to address this crisis, Republicans have \nslashed funding, mind you, for housing assistance programs to their \nlowest level in 40 years. In the Republican fiscal year 2018 budget, \nthere are over $200 billion in cuts from programs that everyday \nfamilies depend on, like SNAP, agricultural subsidies, and housing \nassistance.\n  What is worse, the Trump budget slashes the budget of the Department \nof Housing and Urban Development by nearly 15 percent. The Secretary of \nHUD, I guess, supports this, which is mind-boggling because he is \ncharged with developing housing strategies so that everyone can have \ndecent, affordable housing. To cut it by 15 percent makes no sense.\n  This endangers the livelihoods of millions of low-income seniors, \npeople with disabilities, families with children, veterans, low-wage \nworkers, families living with HIV and AIDS, which they all depend on \naffordable housing programs.\n  Our Progressive Caucus colleagues and I are here tonight to say that, \nreally, enough is enough. We demand affordable housing for every person \nin our Nation, regardless of who they are and where they live, and we \nare not giving up.\n  Earlier this year, I introduced a renters' bill of rights. It is H. \nCon. Res. 74, which affirms that all renters have the right to safe, \ndecent, and affordable housing. It calls for greater enforcement of \nantidiscrimination laws that protect communities of color from \nburdensome regulations. It calls on Congress to increase funding to \nprotect every American's right to livable and affordable housing.\n  So as a member of the Appropriations and Budget Committees, I am \ncommitted to advancing the American Dream for all, and that is \naffordable housing. People deserve to have a decent and safe place to \nlive to raise their families.\n  So to everyone across the country who worry about paying rent or \nwhether they can finally, at the end of the day, buy a home, I say: \nKeep raising your voices and keep bringing what we call street heat to \ndefend your communities, because you have got allies in the \nCongressional Progressive Caucus. You have got them in this House of \nRepresentatives, especially Democrats. We are not going to give up \nfighting for you.\n\n  I want to thank Congressman Espaillat for holding this Special Order \ntonight because I think the public, given this crisis--and it is a \ncrisis, it is an epidemic, it is an emergency--people need to know we \nare here fighting for them, and we are going to continue fighting until \neveryone in America has a decent, safe, and affordable place to live.", "turn": 8, "speaker": "Ms. LEE", "itemno": 11}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "E000297", "text": "  Mr. ESPAILLAT. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentlewoman from\n\n\nthe State of California for her eloquent words.\n  Mr. Speaker, I would like to highlight another factor that \ncontributes to the problem of the lack of affordable housing, and that \nis the decreasing affordability crisis in New York City.\n  Historically, New York City was built on inclusivity, and it is here \nthat people from all walks of life come in and they coexist. It is this \ndiversity that contributes to the success of this great experiment \ncalled America, this great experiment called New York City. It is young \npeople moving here from Tennessee and immigrant families from the \nDominican Republic, like my family, for their own American Dream right \nhere in New York City. And New York City's success is one piece of the \nnational picture of urbanization.\n  This enormous change in cities across the country includes an influx \nof more people, often young and from diverse backgrounds. This means we \nneed the visionaries in expanding our housing supply, especially our \naffordable housing supply.\n  Mr. Speaker, that is why we are here today, to highlight on this \nnational crisis of a lack of affordable housing. America has a housing \ncrisis--an affordable housing crisis. Working and middle class New \nYorkers have felt the brunt of fewer options available on the market.\n  Countless middle- and low-income families cannot afford to live in \nthe neighborhoods they have known their entire lives. They must give up \nliving close to jobs, schools, familiar neighbors, and everything else \nthat defines their community.\n  The very foundation of our city is threatened when households must \nmake difficult choices between basic necessities and rent. That is \ntruly a fight for the soul of our neighborhoods, our cities; and they \nare often forced to leave these houses and communities.\n  This is not a crisis that affects only a few. It impacts many New \nYorkers. Sixty-nine percent of New Yorkers rent their homes, and nearly \nhalf of renters struggle to pay rent every month. Many are one \nunexpected bill away from debt or eviction.\n  While this situation is dire for those struggling to pay rent in \ntheir apartments now, there are virtually no options for low-income New \nYorkers. Minimum-wage workers will need to have three full-time jobs or \nwork at least 119 hours per week to be able to afford a two-bedroom \napartment at market rate.\n  Not only is it physically impossible, but we should not ask that of \nworkers in our city. The crisis of affordability nationwide will not \nvanish if ignored. So long as New York's economy is thriving, rents \nwon't plateau or fall on their own. Developers will continue to eye \naging buildings for redevelopment and build new luxury apartments. \nRather than leave the creation and preservation of affordable housing \nup to chance or whims of the market, we must be intentional about \nfunding affordable housing.\n  We already have a housing stock of 176,000 units of public housing in \nNew York City alone. That is the lifeline of hundreds of thousands of \nresidents, but it is in dire need of investment.\n  If we care about diversity and care about inclusion, we must put our \nmoney where our mouth is and we must repair and preserve public housing \nfor a future of increasingly expensive cities.\n  Another aspect of the lack of affordable housing and the income gaps \naffecting New York City is the dynamic of gentrification. Mr. Speaker, \nI have the distinct honor of representing Harlem, which recently was--\nthere was an attempt to change its name to SoHa by speculators, people \nwho want to turn Harlem, a traditional iconic neighborhood of New York \nCity, into something else.\n  There are Harlems in every State across the country. There are \nHarlems in every country around the world. Harlem is a personality. It \nis an attitude. Harlem is for those who feel that perhaps they don't \nhave a voice but they want to fight to get to another level. That is \nHarlem. It is a spirit.\n  Harlem, which, during the latter half of the 20th century, was \nplagued with crime and abandonment, is now falling victim to its own \nsuccess. Rents have risen and many long-term residents have been \ndisplaced.\n  The same is happening in Washington Heights, Inwood. Neighborhoods \nthat saw over 100 homicides every year and that now are down to low \nsingle digits are seeing a dramatic increase in rent and affordability; \nand many folks who have been living there for decades, like my family, \nare now having to make tough choices of whether they remain in the \nneighborhood that they love or have to move somewhere else.\n  Even among those who remain, they still face additional challenges \nbecause the neighborhood they have known for so many years now feels \nunfamiliar. For many, the fear of displacement is ever-present.\n  Mrs. Gwen Walker, a resident of the General Grant Houses in \nMorningside Heights since the 1950s, was speaking to The New York Times \nwhen she shared her thoughts on displacement, saying the following: \n``But the feeling is, `What am I going to do? Where are we going to \ngo?'''\n  Gentrification was a frequent topic of conversation among Mrs. Walker \nand her neighbors.\n  So I continue to highlight the fact that not only do we have a public \nhousing crisis, not only does that lead to a public health crisis, but \nalso the skyrocketing cost of living has created gentrification, has \nmade it very difficult for working people--the engine of the economy of \nthe city--to make ends meet.\n  These residents are worth protecting, and low-income New Yorkers \nshould not be pushed aside every time a speculator or developer thinks \nthat a building, a block, or a neighborhood could be worth more money.\n  For neighborhoods that have already gentrified, public housing is the \nonly standing thing between them and displacement. They are the \nlifeline for many tenants, and unlike market rate housing, they will \nnot raise rent on their residents when the neighborhood improves.\n  This is paramount. This is paramount for many low-and fixed-income \nNew Yorkers because they are not further burdened for not abandoning \ntheir homes.\n\n\n  And the displacement continues to occur in New York City, Madam \nSpeaker. It is a harsh reality after tenants on the private market are \nevicted, bought out, or cannot afford a rent increase. After losing \ntheir home, families have few choices. Some families end up in \novercrowded apartments, if they are lucky, living with another family \nmember or living with a stranger.\n  David, who is a Mexican immigrant, lives in Washington Heights. He \nlives with 12 other people in a 750-square-foot section of the \nbasement. Another 14 people live in the other half.\n  He explained, speaking to New York Magazine, that, for $100 each, \nthey get 40 square feet, a children's bunk bed, and a refrigerator \nsalvaged from the trash. Their basement is hard to move around in and \nimpossible to walk anywhere but to the leaking bathroom down the \ncramped hall or to the small living room with the scavenged sofa. The \nbasement costs David and his 27 roommates almost $3,000 a month.\n  This is not an uncommon experience. Citywide, two-thirds of all \nMexicans live in overcrowded conditions. David described his journey \nand realization of what living in New York City would be like for him:\n\n       From the airport, I went to my brother's place in \n     Washington Heights. He was living with his child and pregnant \n     wife, along with another couple and their kid--six people. I \n     was the seventh. In only one room.\n\n  America should know this: there is a public housing and affordable \nhousing crisis across the country, and HUD proposes to dramatically cut \nthe programs that guarantee the services for this housing.\n  David also experienced the loss of his home and an understanding that \nhis place in the city is always vulnerable.\n  This is all happening, Madam Speaker, while Republicans continue to \ndevise, to plan, premeditatedly, to plan their tax reform that will \ngive the rich, the 1 percent, a handsome tax cut while punishing the \nmiddle class and working class sectors of America.\n  There is only one unit of public housing that is worth over $390 \nmillion, Madam Speaker, and it is the White House. The White House does \nnot have mold. The White House does not have crumbling pipes. The White \nHouse does\n\n\nnot have severe water damage or asbestos because the White House is not \nplagued by disinvestment.\n  President Trump does not pay rent, and he is not in danger of being \npriced out of his neighborhood. And yet President Trump and \ncongressional Republicans are proposing to strip cities of their \nability to create and maintain affordable housing for those who most \ndesperately need it.\n  The Ryan-McConnell tax bill is a lie that is being sold to the \nAmerican people as a promise, a promise that claims that everyday \nAmericans will benefit and see more dollars in their pockets. But it is \na scam; it is a shell game; and it will make richer the rich and leave \neverybody else behind.\n  The proposed tax plan eliminates funding for low-income housing tax \ncredits, which are responsible for many affordable developments. The \nneed for affordable housing is ever growing, and the low-income housing \ntax credit must be expanded, not eliminated, to keep up with demand. \nFor New Yorkers, every dollar in their paycheck matters when it comes \nto being able to pay rent.\n  Removing the State and local tax deduction, called SALT, places an \nunfair double tax on State residents. States who choose to provide \nhigh-quality services through taxation will be unfairly punished. This \nunjust punishment will be felt mostly by those who live paycheck to \npaycheck.\n  In some neighborhoods in New York City, residents spend as much as 80 \npercent of their income on housing and transportation. Removing the \nState and local tax deduction means that families who already make \ntough decisions about food, rent, and other bills now have fewer \ndollars in their pockets to make those decisions.\n  For families that have saved up enough to participate in the American \nDream of owning their home, they no longer will be able to use the \nmortgage interest tax deduction to help them finance their homes. For \nmany hopeful families, eliminating the mortgage interest tax deduction \ncloses the door to that opportunity.\n  The low-income housing tax credit, the State and local tax deduction, \nand the mortgage interest tax deduction are the foundation from which \nwe can build affordable communities. We will not give in to the GOP tax \nscam; we will not play in a shell game; and we will not give \nbillionaires even one more dollar. America deserves a better deal.\n  Madam Speaker, I close by saying that, in my home State of New York, \nthe Empire State, and particularly in my district, for the last 75 \nyears, it has been represented by two giants: first, by the late and \ngreat Adam Clayton Powell, Jr., who made history right here in these \nChambers; and for the last 46 years, by the ``Lion of Lenox Avenue,'' \nCharles B. Rangel.\n  Underfunding of affordable housing in that district starves public \nhousing and is compromising the health of public housing residents. \nHUD's capital backlog of $26 billion cannot be added to. We must be \nresponsible and take hold of this challenge.\n  For the public health of our constituents, to preserve the American \nDream, I urge my colleagues to vote and make affordable housing a \npriority.\n  Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.", "turn": 9, "speaker": "Mr. ESPAILLAT", "itemno": 12}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. Tenney).
