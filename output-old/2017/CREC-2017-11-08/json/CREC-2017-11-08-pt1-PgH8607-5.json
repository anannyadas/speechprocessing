Mr. Speaker, earlier this year, Army Sergeant Josh \nRodgers was killed in action during a raid targeting an ISIS prison in \nAfghanistan, making the ultimate sacrifice while working to free those \nimprisoned by evil.\n  A native of Bloomington, Illinois, in my congressional district, \nSergeant Rodgers' heroism and bravery have not been forgotten. A \ngraduate of Normal Community High School in 2013, where he competed on \nthe track and football teams, his teachers, teammates, and coaches \nremember him fondly. They say he was a natural leader and a hard worker \nwho believed it was his duty to serve his country in the military.\n  That is why I am proud to stand here today to announce the \nintroduction of a bill, with the support of the entire Illinois \ndelegation, Republicans and Democrats, that would rename the post \noffice in Bloomington, Illinois, the Sergeant Josh Rodgers U.S. Post \nOffice.\n  Mr. Speaker, there is no way to truly thank Sergeant Rodgers or his \nfamily, but it is my hope that this building will serve to honor him \nand remind all of us of the price of our freedom.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. LaHOOD", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "182", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H8607", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "8", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "HONORING SERGEANT JOSH RODGERS", "id": "CREC-2017-11-08-pt1-PgH8607-5", "title": "HONORING SERGEANT JOSH RODGERS"}
