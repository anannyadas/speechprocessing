Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize America's \nveterans.\n  Saturday is Veterans Day, a time to recognize our bravest men and \nwomen who answered the call to defend our great Nation against our \nenemies. Words are not enough to say thank you for everything you have \nendured and sacrificed on America's behalf.\n  As a fellow veteran, and on behalf of the good families of \nMississippi's Fourth Congressional District, I want to convey my \nappreciation to you and your families.\n  Many of us have seen the perils of war and conflict. Many have been \ninjured in the line of duty, and many have paid the ultimate sacrifice \nbefore the altar of freedom.\n  Because of this display of sacrifice, future generations may enjoy \nthe blessings of what our country stands for: the right to life, \nliberty, and the pursuit of happiness. I am proud to have had the \nopportunity to serve alongside such brave men and women.\n  So, veterans, we are a free nation because of the bravery of you and \nyour families. Happy Veterans Day, and God bless you.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. PALAZZO", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "182", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H8645", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "8", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "HONORING VETERANS DAY", "id": "CREC-2017-11-08-pt1-PgH8645-4", "title": "HONORING VETERANS DAY"}
