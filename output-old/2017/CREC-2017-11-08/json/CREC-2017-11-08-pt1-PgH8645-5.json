Mr. Speaker, I rise to join the chorus of Americans \nacross the country who are gravely concerned about the reckless \nRepublican tax plan.\n  Middle class families in my district know that this plan won't help \nto get them ahead, and it is not because they are doing the math wrong. \nThe plan throws a buffet full of enormous tax cuts for multinational \ncorporations and billionaire real estate investors, and it leaves \nhardworking families to fight for table scraps.\n  Tens of millions of middle class families will ultimately face a tax \nhike, and the repeal of the State and local deduction raises taxes on \nmany families in my district in California.\n  For example, in Orange County, my constituents deduct an average of \n$6,500 a year using the SALT provision. This proposal sends them a \nbill.\n  Republicans are asking my constituents to pay more, only to let \ncompanies that expand overseas pay less. That simply doesn't make \nsense.\n  I urge all of my colleagues, especially my neighbors in California, \nto reject this tax hike on middle class families.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. LOWENTHAL", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "182", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H8645", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "8", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "GOP TAX PLAN", "id": "CREC-2017-11-08-pt1-PgH8645-5", "title": "GOP TAX PLAN"}
