SUZANNE BONAMICI\n\n                               of oregon\n\n                    in the house of representatives\n\n                      Wednesday, November 8, 2017\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "B001278", "text": "  Ms. BONAMICI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to H.R. 2936, \nthe Resilient Federal Forests Act of 2017. The fire season this year \nwas devastating in Oregon and across the west. It destroyed forestland, \nreduced air quality, and left a lasting mark on our communities. \nCongress must increase funding for wildfire suppression and fire \nprevention actions on public lands. At the same time, Congress can and \nmust do this while maintaining foundational environmental laws. I \ncannot support this bill because it undermines the bedrock science-\nbased decision-making processes undertaken by land management agencies, \nand would make it more difficult for states to receive federal funding \nfor wildfire disasters.\n   I strongly support provisions in the bill that would find new and \ninnovative ways to use wood as a building material for tall wood \nbuildings. Cross-laminated timber and other innovative wood products \ncreate sustainable building materials, generate more value from timber \nharvests, and translate into more jobs in rural Oregon and around the \ncountry.\n   This legislation does not do enough to help communities fund \nwildfire suppression. It includes a process that would slow local \naccess to much-needed funds, and it calculates funding without regard \nto true wildfire disaster needs. I joined my colleague, Congressman \nSchrader, in submitting an amendment that would address these problems \nand increase available funding for wildfire suppression. Unfortunately, \nthe amendment was not accepted for floor consideration by the Rules \nCommittee.\n   I have heard from counties, families, teachers, and school \nadministrators in forest counties in my district who have told me they \nwill\n\n\nface great hardship if they do not receive the Secure Rural Schools \npayments they are owed. The last authorized Secure Rural Schools \npayment was distributed in FY 2016. Earlier this year, I joined my \ncolleague Congresswoman Cathy McMorris Rodgers in introducing \nbipartisan legislation to reauthorize the program through FY 2017. I am \nfrustrated the majority did not use this opportunity to reauthorize the \nSecure Rural Schools program and provide certainty to the forest \ncounties who rely on these funds to educate students.\n   I am also concerned that this bill limits public participation in \nthe management of public lands. It reduces the consideration of forest \nmanagement alternatives to two options--action or no action. It creates \noverly broad exclusions for projects to skirt environmental review \nunder the National Environmental Policy Act and the Endangered Species \nAct. In addition, it reduces opportunities for the public to engage \nmeaningfully in these decisions. As a former consumer protection \nattorney, I am concerned about the inclusion of an arbitration pilot \nprogram that would force many challenges to federal forest management \ndecisions to go through an agency-run arbitration process instead of \nthrough the judicial system.\n   We must manage our federal forests better, but we can do so without \nincluding these harmful provisions. I urge my colleagues to come back \nto the table and develop a more appropriate and effective solution.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Ms. BONAMICI", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 3}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "182", "extension": true, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "E1529-E1530", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "8", "month": "November"}, "related_bills": [{"type": "HR", "context": "TITLE", "congress": "115", "number": "2936"}, {"type": "HR", "context": "OTHER", "congress": "115", "number": "2936"}], "doc_title": "OPPOSING H.R. 2936, THE RESILIENT FEDERAL FORESTS ACT", "id": "CREC-2017-11-08-pt1-PgE1529-5"}
