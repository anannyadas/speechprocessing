Mr. Speaker, earlier this week, I had \nthe opportunity to visit the Pregnancy Resource Clinic in State \nCollege, Pennsylvania, Centre County, Pennsylvania's Fifth \nCongressional District.\n  The Pregnancy Resource Center is the only community-funded medical \nclinic in State College that specifically addresses unplanned pregnancy \nin a Christ-centered atmosphere. Through education and encouragement, \nthe Pregnancy Resource Center empowers both men and women to make \ninformed life choices.\n  Mr. Speaker, I had the opportunity to meet with Executive Director \nJenny Summers and many members of the Pregnancy Resource Center staff \nto see, firsthand, the important services that it provides to the \nregion.\n  The Pregnancy Resource Center, importantly, upholds the sanctity of \nlife. It encourages clients to continue the pregnancy to full term \nrather than choosing abortion for their unborn child.\n  Mr. Speaker, this is always important, but even more so this month \nduring National Adoption Month. Each year, loving families adopt \nthousands of children and provide them with the love and support of a \nfamily and their forever home.\n  I commend the Pregnancy Resource Center for the essential services it \nprovides and celebrate the gift of adoption to both children and \nparents alike.\n\n\n                         REBOOT Combat Recovery\n", "turn": 1, "speaker": "Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "T000467", "text": "  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, on Saturday, the Nation \ncelebrates Veterans Day, a day where we honor all those who have served \nin the Armed Forces.\n  As we pay tribute with ceremonies and parades, we must remember that \nfreedom is not free. Many of our veterans live with the effects of war \nlong after they have been discharged.\n  Mr. Speaker, I recently had the opportunity to learn about a group \nthat is helping combat veterans heal the wounds of war. REBOOT Combat \nRecovery is a Christian-based program structured in a 12-week course \nfor veterans and their spouses to share their struggles and to begin \nthe healing process.\n  Many of our vets suffer in the form of anger, anxiety, depression, \nsocial withdrawal, and, most tragically, too often, suicide.\n  The REBOOT Combat Recovery program is free. It has more than 50 \nlocations in 23 States and more than 1,600 graduates. REBOOT \ncommunities are safe, private, and mostly led by veterans.\n  As we honor our veterans this weekend, let us remember that every \nveteran's story is different. Let us help them find the answers to heal \nand to recover from the effects of war.\n", "turn": 2, "speaker": "Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 3}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "182", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H8600", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "8", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "VISITING PREGNANCY RESOURCE CLINIC DURING NATIONAL ADOPTION MONTH", "id": "CREC-2017-11-08-pt1-PgH8600", "title": "VISITING PREGNANCY RESOURCE CLINIC DURING NATIONAL ADOPTION MONTH"}
