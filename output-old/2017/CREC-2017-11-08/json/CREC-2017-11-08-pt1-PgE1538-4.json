HICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the \nlife and legacy of one\n\n\nof my constituents and an American hero, Corporal Virgil Hanks. \nCorporal Hanks passed away last week at the age of 96, just a few days \nbefore Veterans Day.\n  Corporal Hanks joined the United States Army Air Corps in 1942 and \nwas honorably discharged from the military at the end of World War II \nfollowing four years of service. In 2015, in his hometown of Social \nCircle, Georgia, I had the distinct honor of presenting Corporal Hanks \nwith a certificate of Congressional Recognition and a World War II \nVictory Medal for his valuable and selfless contribution to our \nNation's wartime efforts.\n  Virgil Hanks will be remembered as an incredibly kind and humble man, \ndedicated to his late wife, siblings, and children, whom he loved \nfiercely. His legacy of service survives to this day throughout \nGeorgia's 10th Congressional District, and he will be buried at the \nGeorgia National Cemetery with his other brothers and sisters in arms.\n  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in a moment of silence to \nhonor the life of Corporal Virgil Hanks, a hero who deserves the \nrespect of all Americans and will be sorely missed by so many in the \ncommunity.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. JODY B.
