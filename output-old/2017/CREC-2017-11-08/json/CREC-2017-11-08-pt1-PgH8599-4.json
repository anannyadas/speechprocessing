Mr. Speaker, Monday I returned from my third trip to \nPuerto Rico since Hurricane Maria devastated the island almost 2 months \nago.\n  I wish I could report that a lot of progress is being made, but I \ncan't. It is still a disaster, and it is a stain on the reputation of \nthe United States of America.\n  Most places don't have power. Generators, the sound you hear humming \nin every corner of the island like metallic coquis, are running ragged \nfrom overuse.\n  In many places, the water is not on because the power is not on to \npump it, and drinkable water mixes with sewer water all over the \nisland. As you can see from this picture, people are tapping mountain \nsprings and, in this case, are using it mostly for laundry, thank \ngoodness, because the mountain water in many cases is contaminated from \nhumans and animals.\n  This man is a police officer, first responder, but he is learning to \nmake do just like every other Puerto Rican family. Everywhere you go, \nyou see Puerto Ricans making do.\n  So think about your life without power, cell service, water, lights, \nfans, in some cases food. Imagine the dialysis patient or the elderly \nman in an electric wheelchair who uses oxygen tanks to breathe. I met \nthose people in Puerto Rico.\n  How do you get to physical therapy or regular prenatal visits when \nthere are still roads and bridges that have simply vanished?\n  On the one hand, when I am in Puerto Rico, I am confronted by the \nvery best of mankind, the people who are helping strangers, feeding \ntheir neighbors, and pitching in wherever they can.\n  On the other hand, when I am in Puerto Rico, I am confronted with the \nhuman tragedy of people who, like all of us, depend on the government \nfor basic assistance and help after a major disaster and have received \nnothing.\n  Yes, the damage is massive, but there is no task Americans cannot \naccomplish if we put our minds and backs into it.\n  Mr. Speaker, this is the Head Start building in Loiza. As you can \nsee, the roof is torn up and there is metal sheeting that was blown \naround. The people in Loiza are forming a brigade to rebuild the \nstructure so they can reopen the Head Start building.\n  One of the things I was doing in Loiza was bringing money to get them \nstarted, raised by the Puerto Rican Agenda in Chicago from the people \nof Chicago. Individuals in Chicago are investing in the well-being of \npeople in Loiza. They have never met them, but they are investing in \nthem.\n  They are not calling in expensive contractors or companies from \nMontana, and they are not waiting for the folks from FEMA or the U.S. \nmilitary. They are not waiting for Donald Trump to grant Puerto Ricans \na little more time now that he has made it clear that he will not \npersonally give them his grade A help forever. Nope. The people of \nChicago are getting help to the people of Puerto Rico before any \nofficial resources are coming to their rescue.\n  It boggles the mind that it has come to this.\n  Here is another more difficult case. A bridge and a road were washed \naway by the storm. This is near Jayuya, Puerto Rico, but it could be \nalmost anywhere on the island. More than 6 weeks after the storm and \nnothing, not even orange cones or a guardrail to keep people from \ndriving off into danger.\n  If you live up the side of this hill, you are not going anywhere any \ntime soon until something changes, because the Army Corps of Engineers \nhas decided just to not show up and are missing in action.\n  Mr. Speaker, I should not have to give this speech almost 2 months \nafter the storm. We should have accomplished much more. The people of \nPuerto Rico pretty much understand that President Trump doesn't want to \nhelp them and really doesn't care.\n  The passports and documents that they have that say citizens of the \nUnited States should have been printed with small print that says: Yes, \nPuerto Ricans are citizens of the U.S. for the purposes of being \ndrafted and going to war, but not when it comes to being helped.\n\n\n  Puerto Ricans are coming to grips with how little they can expect \nfrom the President and his administration.\n  They are finding ways to make do, just as the people of Chicago are \nmaking do by sending their own help in their own way. It shouldn't have \nhad to come to this, but it has.\n  Puerto Ricans are learning to make do, just like these two young \nwomen who are getting married on the beach in Vega Alta, Cerro Gordo. I \nmet them. They let me take this picture.\n  Life goes on, even when the government has turned its back on them.\n", "turn": 1, "speaker": "Mr. GUTIERREZ", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "182", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H8599-H8600", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "8", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "PUERTO RICO 6 WEEKS AFTER HURRICANE MARIA", "id": "CREC-2017-11-08-pt1-PgH8599-4", "title": "PUERTO RICO 6 WEEKS AFTER HURRICANE MARIA"}
