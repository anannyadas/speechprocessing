Mr. Speaker, I rise today to talk about nutrition and, \nmore specifically, malnutrition. My family and I have traveled across \nthe country doing mission work, from the poorest country in this \nWestern Hemisphere, Haiti; to the plains of Kenya; across Mexico; and \nthroughout Central America.\n  On those trips, I went there as a physician thinking that I could \nhelp people, but what I quickly discovered was that, despite how many \nantibiotics or bottles of IV fluids that I had, without proper \nnutrition, without proper water and sewage treatment, I was simply \nrunning into a headwind in a war that I could never win.\n  Unfortunately, across the globe, there are almost 1 billion people \nwho suffer from malnutrition, and it is a problem that doesn't exist \njust across the world. It also exists in my own district, in my own \ncommunities. We think that actually about 12 percent of the United \nStates households have food insecurity issues, and, in households with \nchildren, the number goes up to 16 percent of food insecurity issues.\n  It would be my opinion, without this hierarchy of needs being met, \nthe hierarchy of the needs of proper water, proper sewage, and proper \nnutrition, that you will never have a healthy community. Without a \nhealthy community, you will never see economic growth.\n  This battle against malnutrition is long running. In recent years, \nmany in the hunger community have recognized the value of fighting \nmalnutrition in targeted ways. One way was popularized by Roger Thurow \nin his book, ``The First 1,000 Days: A Crucial Time for Mothers and \nChildren--And the World.''\n  Research shows that good nutrition actually begins before conception. \nGood nutrition starts before conception, continues throughout the \nwoman's pregnancy, and, especially, those first 2 years after a child's \nbirth are very important.\n  As a practicing obstetrician for 25 years, I see over and over the \nimpact of proper nutrition. Proper nutrition in those first 1,000 days \nstarts with a well-balanced diet and adequate calories. Additionally, \nwe always try to start our prenatal vitamins at least 3 months before \nconception.\n  You might ask: Why is that important? What we have found is that if \nthere is adequate folic acid in a woman's body, along with adequate \niron, it decreases birth defects, and it decreases premature birth and \nlow birth weights. Specifically, folic acid decreases neural tube \ndefects. So those two vitamins are particularly important that we \ncontinue in these diets preconceptually, during the pregnancy, then \nafter for at least the first 2 years.\n  A child that receives the proper 1,000 days of nutrition has a lower \nchance of obesity, heart disease, and chronic illnesses. The child is \n10 times more likely to overcome serious childhood illnesses and is \nmore likely to fulfill their full God-given potential.\n  What we know and understand is that the most vulnerable will succumb \nto viruses, whether it is the elderly or the infants, if they don't \nhave proper nutrition. An investment during this critical time period, \nthese first 1,000 days, not only impacts the development of the child, \nbut results in a higher likelihood of healthiness in generations to\n\n\nfollow, allowing the benefits of adequate nutrition to compound over \ntime.\n  As we in Congress begin to consider the reauthorization of the new \nfarm bill, we have been reviewing many programs targeting hunger and \nmalnourishment. These programs allow our State governments and \nnonprofits to promote nutrition and assist in providing food for women \nand children, both here at home and around the globe. I am especially \nproud of the McGovern-Dole International Food for Education program, \nbut what we, of course, call in Kansas the Dole-McGovern International \nFood for Education program.\n  This program has provided over 44 million people in low-income, food-\ndeficient countries across the world with a meal during the school time \nto help those kids do better in school. This is made possible by \ndonations from the U.S. agricultural products and the kindness of \nAmericans.\n  Food for Peace is another lifesaving food assistance program that, \nfor more than 60 years, has helped tens of millions of people get \nenough to eat through emergency development and nutritional support \nprograms.\n  Not only do these programs provide the food necessary to help these \ncountries provide good nutrition for women and children, they benefit \nU.S. national security and foster goodwill.\n  Lending a helping hand to those around the globe is a classic \nAmerican value, but assisting those here at home is an absolute \npriority. This is being achieved through the special Supplemental \nNutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children, the WIC program as \nmost of us have called it. I have got such great, firsthand experience \nin seeing how important this WIC program is to pregnant women and \nbreastfeeding women. It is not only the vitamins that we give them, but \nit is the extra education that we give them to help raise their \nchildren in a healthy environment.\n  So we need to provide Federal grants to these States through the WIC \nprogram that are used to provide food supplements and nutritional \neducation to low-income mothers and babies. Nutrition is so critical \nfor these first 1,000 days, it goes far beyond anything that I can say \nor any statistics I can quote. As we continue to strive for improved \nnational global health, the importance of these first 1,000 days should \nnot be underemphasized.\n  The United States has an opportunity to make a global statement in \nadvancing this initiative. No matter where you are in the world, you \ncan be assured that community health, economic growth, and quality of \nlife begins with good nutrition.\n", "turn": 1, "speaker": "Mr. MARSHALL", "itemno": 3}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 4}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "182", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H8602-H8603", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "8", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "PROPER NUTRITION FOR EVERYONE", "id": "CREC-2017-11-08-pt1-PgH8602-2", "title": null}
