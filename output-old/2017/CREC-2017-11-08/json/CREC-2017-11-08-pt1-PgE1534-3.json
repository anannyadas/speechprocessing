Mr. Speaker, it is with a heavy heart and \nsolemn remembrance that I rise today to pay tribute to a great woman \nand sincere friend, Veloris ``Jean'' Williams-Edwards. Jean passed away \non October 29, 2017. Funeral services will be held at Mount Calvary \nBaptist Church in Alexandria, Virginia on Saturday, November 11, 2017 \nat 11:00 a.m.\n  A native of Wooten's Crossroads, North Carolina, Jean was born to \nGeorge T. and Lacy Ann (Mott) Williams, as the fourth of eight \nchildren. A product of the Greene County School System, she graduated \nfrom Greene County Training School in 1959. She went on to attend North \nCarolina Agriculture and Technical State University (NC A&T) where she \nearned a Bachelor of Science degree in Special Education. After earning \nher Bachelor's degree, she earned a Masters of Arts in Teaching from \nthe University of Maryland.\n  In 1964, she married the love of her life, Leon Edwards, and they \nbuilt a life that was based on the love of God, the love of each other, \nthe love of family and the love of people. They knew that the love of \nthese could lead one to a close and fulfilling relationship with God \nbecause they are an embodiment of His greatest commandments: to love \nHim with all your ``heart, mind and soul'' and to ``love thy neighbor \nas thyself.''\n  Jean's passion for education persisted during her professional career \nas a teacher, a vocational development specialist and a transition \ncoordinator, where she taught her students to be of service to others. \nAfter her career in education, she went on launch a dress shop, work as \na promoter for various events, and work alongside her husband at \nEdwards Trucking Company (which evolved in to a productive \ntransportation company), before becoming a staff assistant in the \noffice of former Speaker of the House, Newt Gingrich. The treasured \nrelationships she developed and the exciting daily operations of the \nOffice of the Speaker made her experience on Capitol Hill beneficial.\n  Maya Angelou once said, ``A great soul serves everyone all the time. \nA great soul never dies.'' Jean was undoubtedly great because of her \ndevotion to her work, and the compassion she showed for her friends and \nloved ones.\n  On a personal note, Jean became a trusted friend on Capitol Hill. I \nwas truly blessed by\n\n\nher friendship as I started my congressional career. Her advice, \ncounsel and assistance were invaluable.\n  Jean was preceded in death by her siblings; Gerald Lee Williams, \nMarjorie (Daisy) Williams, George Earl (Bob) Williams, and Melvin \n(BoBo) Williams.\n  She is survived by her husband of 53 years, Leon A. Edwards; her son, \nReginald Edwards (Sherry); her daughter, Tiena Edwards; two sisters, \nDorothy Clark (Washington, D.C.); Sabrina Hickman (Greenville, NC); two \ngrandchildren, Reggie (Chaz), and Miesha; two great-grandchildren, \nMiayah-Joy Keith and Somer-Hope Keith; two God-children, Julia Chaney \n(Winston) and Malika Taylor-Phillips; and a host of relatives and \nfriends.\n  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues in the House to join my wife, \nVivian, and me in extending our deepest sympathies to Jean's family and \nfriends during this difficult time. May they be consoled and comforted \nby their abiding faith and the Holy Spirit in the days, weeks, and \nmonths ahead.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. BISHOP of Georgia", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 3}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "182", "extension": true, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "E1534-E1535", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "8", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "IN REMEMBRANCE OF MRS.
