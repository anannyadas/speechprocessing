Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor the life of one \nof my constituents, Greg Wood, who passed away on October 14, 2017, at \nthe age of 70.\n  In tribute to Greg, who served in the United States Marine Corps and \nwas wounded in action during the Vietnam War, my office arranged for an \nAmerican flag to be flown over the U.S. Capitol. I am so glad that our \ncountry raised the flag in Greg's honor, because Greg did so much to \nsupport and defend this country. Greg fought to protect the fundamental \nfreedoms that our flag represents.\n  This Saturday is Veterans Day, when our nation pauses to express \ngratitude to all those who honorably served, both living and departed. \nThe day before, I will attend a ceremony at the Park Maitland School in \nOrlando, where we will formally present the flag to Greg's widow, \nDonna. Donna was kind enough to talk to my office about her late \nhusband, about what mattered most to him, and about how he lived his \nlife.\n  Greg was many things--a Texan at heart despite spending most of his \nlife in the Sunshine State; a well-educated man who earned a master's \ndegree in finance; an adventure-seeker who once rode his motorcycle \nfrom the United States all the way down to Panama; a respected \ncommercial real estate broker; a sports lover; a fisherman and a \nhunter; and a pillar of our central Florida community.\n  But, as Donna made crystal clear, Greg was--above all--a U.S. Marine \nand a family man. These two roles defined him. They were the core of \nwho he was. They gave his life purpose and meaning.\n  In a speech that he delivered many years ago to members of the Marine \nCorps, President Ronald Reagan said: ``Some people spend an entire \nlifetime wondering if they made a difference in the world. But the \nMarines don't have that problem.''\n  Greg volunteered to serve in the Marine Corps in March 1966, when he \nwas only 18 years old. After basic training, Greg was sent to Vietnam, \nwhere he served as a forward observer--directing artillery fire onto \nenemy targets. Working as a forward observer, especially in Vietnam, \nwas an exceptionally dangerous job.\n  The Marines are famous for their bravery, discipline and toughness. \nGreg was a Marine's Marine--respected and even revered by his brothers \nin arms for his courage and commitment. Despite his youth, Greg was a \nnatural leader of men. They followed him, and they trusted him. Some \neven thought he might be invincible, and did not want to go out on \npatrols unless Greg was going with them.\n  Friendships forged in war are uniquely deep and intense. Greg lost \nmany good friends in Vietnam--and, as Donna tells us, he carried these \nlosses with him for the remainder of his life. On some days, the \nmemories haunted Greg, and he struggled with feelings of sadness and \nguilt. Like any warrior who has seen his fellow warriors fall, Greg \nnaturally asked himself: ``Why them and not me?''\n  Physically, as well as psychologically, Greg did not leave Vietnam \nunscathed. One fateful day, while out on a mission, he was shot and \ncritically wounded--earning a Purple Heart. When Greg awoke hours later \nin a military hospital, a priest was administering his last rites. \nAlthough he survived, doctors told him he was unlikely to live past age \n35. In a sense, then, Greg's entire life was one big case of beating \nthe odds.\n  After being honorably discharged from the Marines, Greg was \ndetermined to become successful professionally and personally--in part \nto honor his fallen comrades who never had the chance to build a career \nor a family of their own. As Donna told us, nearly everything that Greg \ndid later in life was shaped by his formative experience in Vietnam, \nwhether for better or for worse.\n  One of Greg's daughters, Kristina, told me that her father loved war \nmovies, but they always made him cry. It is clear that Greg had complex \nfeelings about war itself, but that he cherished the American soldiers, \nsailors, airmen and--of course--Marines who fought these wars. It \ndidn't matter whether they served in World War II, Korea, Vietnam, \nAfghanistan, or Iraq. He felt a sacred bond with all of them.\n  In addition to his military family, of course, Greg treasured his own \nfamily--which includes Donna, four children, and eight grandchildren. \nBy all accounts, he was a loving husband and father, who coached Little \nLeague, served as a Boy Scout leader, and did all the big things and \nlittle things that great dads do.\n  So, I hope Greg has been reunited with the friends he lost in \nVietnam. I hope he is happy and at peace. And I hope he knows how much \nhis life mattered to his family and to the country he so nobly served.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mrs. MURPHY of Florida", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 3}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "182", "extension": true, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "E1537", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "8", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "HONOR THE LIFE OF GREG WOOD", "id": "CREC-2017-11-08-pt1-PgE1537-2", "title": "HONOR THE LIFE OF GREG WOOD"}
