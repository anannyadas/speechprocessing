Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the patriotism of \nWest Lutheran High School in Plymouth, Minnesota, and their annual \nVeterans Day celebration.\n  Every day, the students at West Lutheran recite the Pledge of \nAllegiance, even when they did not have enough flags for their \nclassrooms. So the senior American Government class raised $1,200 to \npurchase flags that will honor their alumni who have answered the call \nto serve in uniform.\n  The West Lutheran Veterans Day ceremony is now a central part of life \nin the Plymouth community, and every year they recognize contributions \nand sacrifices made by those in uniform. This year, veterans will be \ntreated to breakfast, the music of the West Lutheran band, and remarks \nby Tom Warren, Sr., a veteran of the U.S. Army and Operation Desert \nStorm.\n  So, Mr. Speaker, I commend the West Lutheran community for keeping \nthis tradition alive, and I also thank our veterans for the selfless \nacts of courage that keep our country safe.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. PAULSEN", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 3}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "182", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H8644", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "8", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "RECOGNIZING WEST LUTHERAN HIGH SCHOOL FOR PATRIOTISM", "id": "CREC-2017-11-08-pt1-PgH8644", "title": null}
