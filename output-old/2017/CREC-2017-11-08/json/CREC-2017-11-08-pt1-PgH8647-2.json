Mr. Speaker, female veterans represent the military's \nfastest-growing population with an estimated 2.2 million women, \nincluding 14,000 in my home State of Hawaii, who have served our \ncountry. Yet, when these women come home or transition to civilian \nlife, they are still facing a VA that was created by and for men and is \nill-equipped to understand and serve their unique needs.\n  Women veterans have lower rates of access to the VA than men, but \nface higher rates of post-traumatic stress disorder, military sexual \nassaults, unemployment, and homelessness. We have a responsibility to \ntake care of all of our veterans when they return home, and to make \nsure that they are getting the best care and benefits that they have \nearned and deserve.\n  In recognition of Veterans Day, we must fix this and pass the Deborah \nSampson Act to eliminate barriers and improve quality of care and \nservices, and empower our female veterans alongside our male veterans.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to pass this legislation to address the \nglaring gender disparities at the VA and to ensure that our women \nveterans receive the services that they have earned and deserve.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Ms. GABBARD", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "182", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H8647", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "8", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "PROVIDE MORE FOR FEMALE VETERANS", "id": "CREC-2017-11-08-pt1-PgH8647-2", "title": "PROVIDE MORE FOR FEMALE VETERANS"}
