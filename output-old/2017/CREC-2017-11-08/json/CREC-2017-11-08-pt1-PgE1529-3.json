Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the \nservice of the Jerikovsky brothers of South Saint Paul, Minnesota. \nThese nine brothers, the sons of Jacob and Stephania Jerikovsky, served \nbravely in the United States' Armed Forces during World War II and the \nKorean War, all of them returning home safely to their family.\n   Emil, Nick, Jacob Jr., William, Robert, Earl, Edward, George, and \nRichard Jerikovsky all have the distinction of being a part of a \nremarkable feat in U.S. military history. It is unprecedented to have \nnine siblings from one family serve our country in the United States' \nArmed Forces, and this feat speaks to their family's patriotism and \nselflessness.\n   These nine first generation Americans were all proud members of VFW \nPost No. 295 in South Saint Paul, Minnesota. The Jerikovsky brothers \nhave made a positive impact on our community, state, and country, and \nwe are fortunate to have such selfless citizens who make sacrifices to \nprotect our freedoms.\n   I know that the Jerikovsky brothers' legacy of service to country \nand fellow man will inspire all Minnesotans and Americans.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. LEWIS of Minnesota", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 3}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "182", "extension": true, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "E1529", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "8", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "HONORING THE SERVICE OF THE JERIKOVSKY BROTHERS", "id": "CREC-2017-11-08-pt1-PgE1529-3", "title": "HONORING THE SERVICE OF THE JERIKOVSKY BROTHERS"}
