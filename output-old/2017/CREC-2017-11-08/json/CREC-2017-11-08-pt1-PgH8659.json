Madam Speaker, in the last four national elections, \nAmericans made it clear that we won't accept the economic stagnation \nthat we have suffered during this past decade.\n  Mr. Obama's policies of higher taxes and regulatory burdens \nsuppressed economic growth to a dismal 1\\1/2\\ percent annual average. \nThat is about half of the post-war growth rate of 3 percent.\n  President Reagan averaged 3\\1/2\\ percent annual growth by reducing \nthe tax and regulatory burdens crushing the economy. The result was one \nof the greatest economic expansions in American history.\n  The Trump administration has made significant progress on regulatory \nrelief, as attested by rising wages, employment opportunities, and \ngrowing consumer confidence. But tax relief is vital to finish the job.\n  The imperative should be clear. The American corporate tax rate of 35 \npercent is the highest in the industrialized world. I know there are \nlots of special interest loopholes that go to politically connected \ncompanies that bring the effective rate down to 18.6 percent.\n\n  But that is precisely the problem. Many companies that haven't gotten \nthese breaks have simply fled the country, taking trillions of dollars \nand possibly millions of American jobs overseas. By closing the \nloopholes and lowering the rate to an internationally competitive 20 \npercent, economists tell us that we can add $5 trillion to the American \neconomy over the next decade. That averages about $40,000 per family.\n  Those who dismiss this as tax cuts for wealthy corporations don't \nunderstand the dirty little secret of corporate taxation: corporations \ndo not pay corporate taxes. They only collect them.\n  There are only three possible sources from which they can collect \nthem. The only people who pay corporate taxes are consumers, through \nhigher prices; employees, through lower wages; and investors, through \nlower earnings. That is your pension and 401(k).\n  Lowering the corporate tax rate not only means restoring America's \nglobal competitiveness, but it invariably translates into lower prices, \nhigher wages, and greater returns on savings and investments.\n  The personal income tax side is also important, and this is where I \nbecome concerned that we are getting wrapped around the axle.\n  We have had several unpleasant surprises this past week: the 46 \npercent bubble bracket and now the Joint Committee on Taxation report \nthat, over time, many in the middle class may end up paying higher \nincome taxes.\n  Yes, the average taxpayer will pay less, but this raises the mystery \nof the 6-foot man who drowned in a pond whose average depth was 5 feet. \nIt is now clear that some--perhaps many--families will see tax \nincreases now, and more over time.\n  As desirable as tax simplification is, I wonder if it is a bridge too \nfar, given the timetable we are on, the hyper-partisan political \nenvironment we are in, and the complexities of the Tax Code that are \ncertain to continue to yield unpleasant and unintended consequences.\n\n\n  I urge our leadership and our Ways and Means Committee to consider \nleaving the personal income tax structure intact, but using the budget \nauthority instead to provide a permanent, uniform, across-the-board \nreduction in the rates for all tax brackets.\n  Our back-of-the-envelope estimate is that, using the current \nframework, we can reduce tax brackets by a full 1 percent, averaging \nabout $600 of tax savings for joint filers. If we included the repeal \nof the individual mandate in ObamaCare, we could reduce all tax \nbrackets by 1.35 percent, averaging about $800 of lower taxes for joint \nfilers.\n  I think there are four principal advantages to this approach:\n  First, it leaves no taxpayer behind. Whatever your circumstances, \nwhatever the deductions you claim, you can be sure that your overall \ntax bill will go down.\n  Second, by reducing all marginal rates, it will increase the economic \ngrowth potential of the reform. Productivity depends on how much your \nnext dollar is taxed.\n  That is the marginal rate. We can bring down the top marginal rate \nunder this reform; whereas, under the current proposal, it not only \nstays where it is, but in the bubble bracket, it increases to 46 \npercent.\n  Third, these reforms can be communicated easily to the American \npeople.\n  Fourth, it will remove a vast portion of the opposition that we are \nseeing among various business groups that imperils the entire bill.\n  Madam Speaker, the tax reform bill that emerges from these \ndeliberations will ultimately be judged by the prosperity that it \nproduces and the relief that it brings to all American families.\n  If it is done right, the tax reform bill now taking shape in Congress \ncan deliver us to that day. But if it is done wrong, we will have \nsquandered the most important chance the American people have given us \nto materially improve their lives.\n  I remember the Reagan era. Wages rose, opportunities for better jobs \nabounded, and everywhere you could sense the optimism that comes with \nprosperity and abundance. I want my kids to know what it is like when \nmorning dawns again in the American economy. It is up to us in this \nChamber to make it happen, so we must.\n  Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n", "turn": 1, "speaker": "Mr. McCLINTOCK", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "182", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H8659-H8660", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "8", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "LEAVE NO TAXPAYER BEHIND", "id": "CREC-2017-11-08-pt1-PgH8659", "title": "LEAVE NO TAXPAYER BEHIND"}
