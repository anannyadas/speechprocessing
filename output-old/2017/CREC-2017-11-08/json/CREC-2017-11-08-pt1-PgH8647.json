Mr. Speaker, in Burien, Washington, tomorrow, we will be \nholding an event to provide constituents information on signing up for \nhealthcare coverage under the Affordable Care Act.\n  With open enrollment season beginning last week, I want to make sure \nthat residents of our district know that they have until December 15 to \nsign up. And while the Republican majority has been undermining the ACA \nat every turn, the numbers that are coming in tell a completely \ndifferent story about how important this act is for thousands of \nAmericans across the country.\n  More than 200,000 Americans chose a plan on the first day of open \nenrollment, which is more than double last year. This is all on top of \nthe more than 1 million people who visited healthcare.gov, the official \nFederal website; a one-third increase in traffic from 2016.\n  Mr. Speaker, our State exchange in Washington State has reported a 19 \npercent increase in visits from last year. The surge in enrollment is \npromising and it is a clear repudiation of the Republican's efforts to \nstrip healthcare from millions across the Nation.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to spread the word about how their \nconstituents can get covered.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Ms. JAYAPAL", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "182", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H8647", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "8", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "ENCOURAGE CONSTITUENTS TO SIGN UP FOR A HEALTH PLAN", "id": "CREC-2017-11-08-pt1-PgH8647", "title": "ENCOURAGE CONSTITUENTS TO SIGN UP FOR A HEALTH PLAN"}
