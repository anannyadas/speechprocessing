Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate and \nrecognize Mary Sconiers-Chapman, community leader and retired higher \neducation administrator, for being named a 2017 Women of Influence \nhonoree by the award-winning central Iowa publication, Business Record.\n  For 18 years, the Business Record has undertaken an exhaustive annual \nreview to identify a standout group of women who have made a \nsignificant difference in business, civic and philanthropic endeavours \nthroughout the Greater Des Moines Area.\n  After receiving a degree in elementary education from Drake \nUniversity in Des Moines, Iowa, Mary began a long successful career \neducating our future generations. She immediately began teaching after \ngraduation and worked her way up to principal in the Des Moines Public \nSchool system. As her passion for education continued to grow, Mary \ndecided that working in higher education was next and became executive \ndean of Des Moines Area Community College (DMACC), ultimately retiring \nin 2013 as the vice president of strategic partnerships after 23 years \nwith the school. While Mary is a dedicated educator, she is also \npassionate about service to her community. She was instrumental in the \ncreation of the Evelyn K. Davis Center for Working Families that \nfocuses on assisting individuals and families in finding jobs, \neducational opportunities, and job training.\n  Mr. Speaker, it is a profound honor to represent community leaders \nlike Mary in the United States Congress and it is with great pride that \nI recognize and applaud her for utilizing her talents to better both \nher community, and the great state of Iowa. I ask that my colleagues in \nthe United States House of Representatives join me in congratulating \nMary on receiving this esteemed designation, thanking those at Business \nRecord for their great work, and wishing Mary nothing but the best.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. YOUNG of Iowa", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 3}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "182", "extension": true, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "E1532", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "8", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "TRIBUTE TO MARY SCONIERS-CHAPMAN", "id": "CREC-2017-11-08-pt1-PgE1532-2", "title": "TRIBUTE TO MARY SCONIERS-CHAPMAN"}
