Mr. Speaker, it's my honor to recognize Honor Bank upon \nthe occasion of its 100th Anniversary. Through its trusted services, \nreliable staff, and community engagement, Honor Bank has become an \nindispensable part of Northern Michigan.\n  Founded in 1917 as Honor State Bank, just $20,000 in capital and a \ndetermined staff built the bank into the community institution it is \ntoday. Over the course of 100 years, Honor Bank forged its path to \nsuccess through World Wars and financial crises, all while maintaining \nits commitment to the community it was built upon. Today, the bank's \ncapital has grown, yet it still promotes its ideals of independent \ncommunity banking.\n  The bank's Honor Code of integrity, hard work, responsibility, \nteamwork, and reliability is illustrated through its Giving Back to our \nCommunities program. During each month of this year's anniversary \ncelebrations, Honor Bank is highlighting the work of a local non-profit \nagency chosen by the bank's employees. Through this Agency Spotlight, \ncustomers and employees are encouraged to donate needed items, and \nemployees volunteer on average 100 minutes per month to the selected \nagency. These charities have included the Betsie Valley District \nLibrary, Michigan Blood, and the Benzie Food Pantry. Honor Bank \ncontinues to set a positive example of what can be achieved when a \ncompany is built around a community.\n  Mr. Speaker, it's my honor to congratulate Honor Bank and its staff \nfor 100 years of success, service, and community investments. \nMichiganders can take great pride in knowing the First District is home \nto such dedicated citizens. On behalf of my constituents, I wish Honor \nBank all the best in its future endeavors.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. BERGMAN", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 3}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "182", "extension": true, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "E1539", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "8", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "CELEBRATING THE 100TH ANNIVERSARY OF HONOR BANK", "id": "CREC-2017-11-08-pt1-PgE1539", "title": "CELEBRATING THE 100TH ANNIVERSARY OF HONOR BANK"}
