Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the rule and the \nunderlying legislation. The rule provides 1 hour of debate and makes in \norder all amendments offered at the Rules Committee.\n  I want to note that not one amendment to this rule or to this bill \nwas offered by the Democrats.\n  Mr. Speaker, the Micro Offering Safe Harbor Act is an important step \ntoward helping small businesses grow across our country. Small \nbusinesses aren't just about selling a product or providing a service. \nEntrepreneurs take the risk for a chance to improve their community and \ntheir family's livelihood. These individuals employ our friends and \nfamilies and improve our quality of life. Congress needs to do what we \ncan to help entrepreneurs succeed.\n  Young businesses need to use their limited capital, time, and \nresources to grow their business, not fill out bureaucratic paperwork. \nThis problem has only grown worse since Congress passed the Dodd-Frank \nWall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act in 2010.\n  When Dodd-Frank passed, Congress promised it would protect consumers. \nBut it has only hurt community banks, small businesses, and the middle \nclass. Dodd-Frank's burdensome regulatory regime has caused community \nbanks to disappear across America, making access to capital more \ndifficult for many small businesses.\n  The House passed the Financial CHOICE Act to repeal and replace Dodd-\nFrank, but it currently sits untouched in the United States Senate. I \nhope they will quickly vote to repeal Dodd-Frank and make credit easier \nto access for Main Street.\n  But there is more we can do in the people's House to help create new \njobs and opportunities. All too often the Federal Government creates \nregulations that disproportionately hurt small businesses. While a \nlarge corporation may have a team of lawyers to comply with these \nrules, this is rarely the case for a young business. That is why I \nsupport this bill.\n  This bill ends ambiguity in the law by clearly defining a nonpublic \noffering exemption under the Securities Act. Currently, companies just \nstarting out risk unintentionally violating these laws, which might \ndiscourage them from seeking the capital they need to grow. It is \ncommon sense to ensure our country's laws are clear and to allow small \nbusinesses to operate without fear of accidentally violating the law.\n  Our economy depends on small businesses and those who put everything \non the line to pursue the American Dream. This bill will benefit all of \nus by helping those individuals grow their businesses and create jobs \nin their communities. In order to help our small businesses grow and \ncreate jobs, we need to pass this rule and pass the underlying bill.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.", "turn": 5, "speaker": "Mr. BUCK", "itemno": 7}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "S000480", "text": "  Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me the \ncustomary 30 minutes, and I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, the Securities Act of 1933, which, obviously, was put \ninto effect after the Depression or while it was going on, governs \ncurrent law regarding the sale and purchase of securities like stocks, \nbonds, or options. The intent behind this law is to require that \ninvestors receive necessary information about the securities and to \nprevent fraud when they are sold.\n\n\n  To achieve this, the Securities and Exchange Commission currently \nprohibits the sale or delivery of securities that have not been \nregistered with the agency, with some limited exemptions. Today, these \nexceptions are usually limited to those transactions made with \nsophisticated investors who understand the associated risks.\n  H.R. 2201 would weaken the Securities Act unnecessarily by adding an \nentirely new exemption for certain issuers while removing important \ndisclosure requirements.\n  Let me say that again: while removing important disclosure \nrequirements, in other words, to know what you are buying.\n  It would leave investors vulnerable to fraud by allowing companies to \nsell unregistered securities without the important guardrails that \napply to these transactions today. It is part of the majority's agenda \nthat prioritizes deregulation above all else.\n  Through the Congressional Review Act and many other bills, the \nmajority has been relentlessly attacking safeguards that protect \nconsumers--risking our health, our safety, and our finances. This is \nall in order to make it easier for corporations to engage in \nquestionable business practices.\n  Who loses in the giveaway to big corporations and bad actors? The \nAmerican people do.\n  Mr. Speaker, I have always believed that a bad process leads to a bad \nproduct. This week has put the majority in the history books for all \nthe wrong reasons.\n  Closed rules completely block Members from offering amendments on the \nHouse floor, and just yesterday, with the 49th closed rule of the year, \nthis majority broke the record for becoming the most closed session of \nCongress in history. That is a long time.\n  Let me repeat that. This session of the 115th Congress is the most \nclosed session ever. In fact, our present Speaker has not had an open \nrule.\n  This is not some arcane matter. More than 1,300 amendments have been \nblocked this year through the restrictive rules. It has prevented \naction on matters that touch nearly every sector of society.\n\n  This week we saw another mass shooting in a church. Families gathered \ntogether in a small Texas town, and a man with a gun came in and killed \n26 of them and wounded 20 more. One family lost eight of its cherished \nmembers. Those killed in that attack equal 7 percent of the small \ntown's entire population.\n  Now, this Congress could work together and actually stop these tragic \nmurders because this is the place where we can do that, but under the \nmajority, we can't even get a vote on any measure that would do \nanything about it.\n  If you care about whether we send troops to war in Afghanistan and \nSyria--if you care--then closed rules matter.\n  If you care about protecting whistleblowers or reducing government \nspending, then closed rules matter.\n  If you care about whether we build the President's offensive border \nwall with Mexico or strengthen ethics in the executive branch, then \nclosed rules matter.\n  If you care about protecting the nearly 800,000 young DREAMers \nnationwide, then closed rules definitely matter.\n  The majority has used restrictive closed and structured rules to \nprevent debate and votes on these and many, many other important \nmatters from ever happening here on the House floor.\n  Each of us has been elected to do our job representing our \nconstituents by amending legislation on this floor, but because of the \nclosed process, we are being prevented from doing our jobs.\n  Bills routinely come before the Rules Committee that haven't even \nbeen fully considered by the relevant committees. Such a bill is before \nus today.\n  When Speaker Ryan took the gavel 2 years ago, he said: ``Only a fully \nfunctioning House can really, truly do the people's business.'' Well, \nMr. Speaker, we are not doing the peoples business. We are unable to do \nthe job we were sent here to do. We are unable to take action on the \nthings our constituents care about most.\n  It is no wonder that this Congress is the most unpopular Congress in \nrecent memory. It is past time that we return to regular order and \nstart tackling the major issues that we face.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.", "turn": 6, "speaker": "Ms. SLAUGHTER", "itemno": 8}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "B001297", "text": "  Mr. BUCK.

Mr. Speaker, obtaining accessible and reliable forms of \ncapital is one of the biggest challenges that small businesses and \nentrepreneurs face today. I will say that again. We are not talking \nabout large corporations. We are talking about small businesses and \nentrepreneurs.\n  According to the 2016 Year-End Economic Report from the National \nSmall Business Association, 41 percent of all small businesses surveyed \nsaid that ``lack of capital is hindering their ability to grow their \nbusiness or expand their operations, and 20 percent said they had to \nreduce the number of employees as a result of tight credit.''\n  That is why I introduced the Micro Offering Safe Harbor Act. This \nbill does not create a new securities registration exemption under the \nSecurities Act; rather, it defines what constitutes a permissible \nnonpublic offering, and it provides small businesses with the clarity \nand confidence to know that their offering is not a violation of the \nSecurities Act.\n  If enacted, this will make it easier for entrepreneurs and small \nbusinesses--again, not large corporations--to raise money from family, \nfriends, and their personal network without running afoul of the vague \nand undefined private offering safe harbor provisions in the Securities \nAct of 1933.\n  More specifically, this legislation requires the following three \ncriteria be met simultaneously in order to trigger a safe harbor \nexemption for a security offering: each purchaser must have a \nsubstantive preexisting relationship with an owner; there can be no \nmore than 35 purchasers of securities from the issuer that are sold in \nreliance on the exemption during the 12-month period preceding; and, \nlastly, the aggregate amount of all securities sold by the issuer \ncannot exceed $500,000 during the 12 months preceding the offering.\n  The Micro Offering Safe Harbor Act helps bring clarity to existing \nlaw so that our current and future job creators can easily raise \ncapital within the confines of an easy-to-understand provision without \nthe help of an ever increasingly expensive expert.\n\n\n  Furthermore, the legislation preserves all Federal and State \nantifraud protections. Ultimately, this bill will scale existing \nFederal rules and regulatory compliance for small businesses, thus \nproviding another practical option for entrepreneurs to raise the \ncapital they need to start and grow their business.\n  The timing for this legislation could not be better, as the House \ncontinues to promote job creation and economic growth through this \nonce-in-a-generation effort to reform our Tax Code.\n  As our small businesses and startups continue to provide for over \nhalf of all current jobs and over 65 percent of all net new jobs since \nthe 1970s, we must provide the tools they need to succeed, and this \nlegislation does just that.\n  I thank Chairman Hensarling, Chairman Sessions, and Chairman Huizenga \nfor working to bring this important bill to the floor.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the previous question, \nadopt the rule for H.R. 2201, and vote in favor of the Micro Offering \nSafe Harbor Act when it comes to the floor for consideration.", "turn": 8, "speaker": "Mr. EMMER", "itemno": 10}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "S000480", "text": "  Ms. SLAUGHTER.

Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.\n  Mr. Speaker, today I must ask a question of this Chamber: What makes \nAmerica great?\n  Do we measure greatness by the strength of our economy or by the size \nof our military?\n  Is greatness defined by export prices and profits of corporations?\n  You see, Mr. Speaker, I don't think that is the case. I believe that \nwe are a nation built upon a set of unshakable values. It is our \nability to uphold these values, not the rise and fall of the stock \nmarket, that will ultimately define our greatness.\n  One of our values is this: if you work hard, set goals, and refuse to \ngive up, you can fulfill your dreams. As Americans, this value is \nengrained into all of us. We repeat it each and every day, and we tell \nour kids to follow their dreams, or tell them that they can be anything \nthat they want when they grow up.\n  We say these things, Mr. Speaker, because we believe them. We believe \nthat hard work pays off. We believe that dreams can come true.\n  Yet, on September 5 of this year, President Trump ignored these \nAmerican beliefs when he ended the DACA program. That decision told \nnearly 800,000 young people in this country that their hard work didn't \nmatter and that their dreams of pursuing success might not pay off in \nthe end.\n  These young DREAMers, who are as American as any of us, go to school \nhere, they have jobs here, they raise families in our communities, and \nthey serve in our military.\n  This is why each and every day we fail to pass the Dream Act, we call \nthe values that make our country great into question. If we fail to \npass this bipartisan legislation, then we are no longer a nation where \nhard work pays off.\n  I will be forced to explain that to DREAMers in my district. I will \nhave to tell Minerva, who paid her way through college, that she will \nhave to give up her dream of medical school. I will have to explain to \nLeticia that, despite becoming the first in her family to attend \ncollege, she will not be able to fulfill her dream of serving others as \na social worker.\n  You see, Mr. Speaker, these are real young people with real dreams. \nThey deserve a real answer. They put in the work, they have done \neverything they can to build lives in this country, and we need to come \ntogether to make sure that we uphold our values and allow them to \ncontinue those lives here.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote against the previous \nquestion so that we can bring the Dream Act to the floor for a vote \nimmediately. This country is great because we uphold our values.

Mr. Speaker, I appreciate my friend from Colorado \nallowing me an opportunity to speak on this bill.\n  Mr. Speaker, currently, the Securities and Exchange Commission \nprohibits the sale or delivery of securities that have not been \nregistered with the agency.\n  A large portion of startups--and, really, these are ideas--rely on \nsmall, nonprofit offerings also known as private placements, such as \nwith friends and family. They do a round of offerings in order to raise \ninitial, early-stage seed capital; however, the Securities Act of 1933 \ndoes not define what constitutes a public offering or, conversely, a \nnonpublic offering. As a result, startups may unintentionally violate \nthe act when it seeks to offer securities to potential investors in a \nprivate placement.\n\n  Let's put that in real English. Let's make this actually approachable \nin a way that I think true American entrepreneurs can understand.\n  The reality is, these are people with an idea, a drive to move \nforward and to improve something. They go and offer to their family, or \nmaybe ask of their family, to be a part of that dream, to help with \nsome seed capital, to give them a little bit of their hard-earned money \nto help them achieve their dream.\n  And, guess what?\n  They get to take part in the success of that. There is some risk, but \nthere is also reward.\n  How this really translates is that there might be the doctor who has \ngot a great idea for a new health drink or a new implement to use while \nhe is in surgery. This might be a mom who left the workforce and was \ntaking care of her kids and said: There has got to be a better way of \nmaking sure my kids are getting a healthy meal transported to school; \nor something like that.\n  These are people who are looking around and saying: I can go make \nlife better not for me, not just for my family, but for others. They \nare then trying to pursue that.\n  To address this uncertainty that we have, H.R. 2201, the Micro \nOffering Safe Harbor Act, would implement a simple amendment to the \nSecurities Act of 1933, by making clear what constitutes a nonpublic \noffering.\n  It is going to provide small businesses with needed clarity and \nconfidence to know that their offering is not a Securities Act \nviolation. Think of that. Again, it might be that doctor or that stay-\nat-home mom who is out there just trying to fund an idea, \nunintentionally and with no malice or no understanding that they are \nviolating Federal law.\n  A micro-offering authorized under this bill would allow small \nbusinesses or small entrepreneurs to operate with confidence, and the \ncommonsense requirements to be a part of this are such:\n  Each investor has a substantive preexisting relationship with an \nowner. This is no fly-by friendship. This is somebody who you actually \nknow;\n  There are fewer than 35 purchasers or investors; and\n  Also, the amount cannot exceed $500,000.\n  If you just divide out $500,000, which is a lot of money, by 35 \npeople, that is less than $15,000 a person. That is $14,285, to be \nexact. This is not about helping Wall Street somehow, for crying out \nloud. This is about Main Street.\n  I believe it is important to note, as the sponsor, Mr. Emmer, had \nnoted earlier, that nothing in this bill would remove or inhibit the \nauthority of the Securities and Exchange Commission or the Department \nof Justice from prosecuting securities fraud.\n  With antifraud protections still in place, the legislation \nappropriately scales Federal rules and regulatory compliance costs for \nthese small businesses and entrepreneurs.\n  H.R. 2201 is a commonsense bill designed to help Main Street and not \nWall Street. Simply put, it will allow these small businesses and \nentrepreneurs, these DREAMers, to access capital necessary for their \ngrowth.\n  As I said, Representative Emmer has done a phenomenal job in \nshepherding this through. In a 2016 Capital Markets, Securities, and \nInvestments Subcommittee hearing where we dealt with the bill, he had a \ngreat quote that said:\n  ``The problem with the ability of small businesses to effectively use \nthis exemption is--the term `private offering' is not defined in law. \nNot only does this prevent small business from using the exemption, it \nleaves businesses who try to use the exemption and can't afford a team \nof expensive lawyers--which, again, most small businesses cannot--\nexposed to potential lawsuits and future liability. . . . This \nlegislation will create a bright line safe harbor for small private \nofferings. It will help entrepreneurs open new businesses and expand \nexisting ones.''\n  Mr. Speaker, I applaud the hard work of my colleague, Mr. Emmer, on \nthis bill, and I encourage all my colleagues to vote in favor of H.R. \n2201.", "turn": 14, "speaker": "Mr. HUIZENGA", "itemno": 17}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "S000480", "text": "  Ms. SLAUGHTER.

It is a \n     vote about what the House should be debating.\n       Mr. Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of \n     Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the \n     previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or \n     control the consideration of the subject before the House \n     being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous \n     question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the \n     subject before the House.

On March 15, 1909, a member of the \n     majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated \n     the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to \n     a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to \n     recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (R-Illinois) said: \n     ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman \n     from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to \n     yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first \n     recognition.''\n       The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous \n     question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an \n     immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . .

Listen to the \n     Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in \n     the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition, \n     page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the previous \n     question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is generally \n     not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member \n     controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of \n     offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by \n     voting down the previous question on the rule . . . When the \n     motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the \n     time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering \n     the previous question. That Member, because he then controls \n     the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for \n     the purpose of amendment.''\n       In Deschler's Procedure in the U.S. House of \n     Representatives, the subchapter titled ``Amending Special \n     Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on \n     such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on \n     Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further \n     debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues: \n     ``Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a \n     resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control \n     shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous \n     question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who \n     controls the time for debate thereon.''\n       Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does \n     have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only \n     available tools for those who oppose the Republican \n     majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the \n     opportunity to offer an alternative plan.\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 21}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "B001297", "text": "  Mr. BUCK.
