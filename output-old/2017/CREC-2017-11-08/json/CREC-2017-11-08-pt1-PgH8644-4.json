Mr. Speaker, I rise today to sound the alarm about our \nmilitary operations in Niger.\n  On October 4, four U.S. Army Special Operations Forces were \ntragically killed on a mission in Niger. My deepest condolences to the \nfamilies of these fallen heroes.\n  This is a mission, Mr. Speaker, which Congress still knows nothing \nabout. And as recently as last week, Secretaries Tillerson and Mattis \ntestified before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on this \ntragedy. But one question remains unanswered: Why were our \nservicemembers in Niger?\n  It is outrageous that Congress has been left in the dark about these \noperations. At a minimum, we should have some basic knowledge of the \nmissions we are asking servicemembers to risk their lives for.\n  Myself and others sent a bipartisan letter to the administration \ndemanding that President Trump seek authorization ahead of any future \nmilitary operations in Niger.\n  It is not just Niger. Speaker Ryan needs to stop blocking a debate \nand vote on these ongoing wars. The people deserve answers.\n  What is the holdup, Mr. Speaker? What are you afraid of? Why don't \nyou want the American people to know?\n  Congress, yes, is missing in action. We owe it to our servicemembers \nand our constituents to have a debate and a vote on these ongoing wars. \nCongress needs to do its job.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Ms. LEE", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "182", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H8644", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "8", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "OUR MILITARY OPERATIONS IN NIGER", "id": "CREC-2017-11-08-pt1-PgH8644-4", "title": "OUR MILITARY OPERATIONS IN NIGER"}
