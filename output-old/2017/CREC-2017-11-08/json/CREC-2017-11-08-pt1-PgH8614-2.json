Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Chairman, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 3043, the \nHydropower\n\n\nPolicy Modernization Act of 2017. This legislation, introduced by my \nfriend and colleague from the Energy and Commerce Committee, Cathy \nMcMorris Rodgers, is an important step toward modernizing our energy \ninfrastructure, creating jobs, and, yes, strengthening our economy. I \nwant to thank her for her commitment to this issue.\n  The committee went through regular order with the bill. We held two \nhearings on background issues, one legislative hearing, and both \nsubcommittee and full committee markups, where the bill was agreed to \nby a voice vote. Following the markups, bipartisan committee staff held \nmore meetings to hear from over a dozen Tribal governments to gather \nadditional views.\n  I think that the resulting bill strikes a careful balance. Changes \nwere made to increase State and Tribal consultation requirements, and a \nvery strong savings clause was added to protect States' authorities \nunder the Clean Water Act.\n  Hydropower is an essential component of an all-of-the-above energy \nstrategy for this country. Hydropower is clean; it is renewable and \naffordable base load power. It is good for consumers' electricity \nbills, and it is also good for jobs, which is why labor is strongly \nsupportive of this legislation.\n  There is a tremendous opportunity to expand hydropower production on \nexisting nonpowered dams. Less than 3 percent of the dams in the U.S., \napproximately 2,200 dams, produce electricity. There are also \nopportunities to improve the process for the projects that are due for \nrelicensing. By 2030, over 400 existing projects, with almost 19,000 \nmegawatts of capacity, will begin the relicensing process, and these \nprojects, in fact, may be at risk.\n  Fixing the licensing process would also improve safety. Upgrading the \nperformance of existing dams and utilizing existing nonpowered dams, \ncanals, and conduits would enable investments, which would address \naging dams and, yes, improve overall safety.\n  The duration, complexity, and uncertainty of the hydropower licensing \nprocess creates significant challenges that prevent investments that \nwould create jobs and benefit consumers. The licensing process for a \nnew hydropower development project can last over a decade and costs \ntens of millions of dollars--significantly longer than the time that it \ntakes to construct a natural gas-fired power plant of the same size.\n  This legislation, H.R. 3043, would level the playing field by \nmodernizing the permitting process without compromising environmental \nprotections. The bill improves administrative efficiency, \naccountability, and transparency. It requires balanced, timely \ndecisionmaking and reduces duplicative oversight from the multiple \nFederal agencies that review hydropower applications.\n  This bill brings certainty and timeliness to the licensing process by \nenhancing consultation with Federal, State, and local agencies and \nIndian Tribes, and it requires FERC to establish a process for setting \nthe schedule for review. H.R. 3043 streamlines and improves procedures \nto identify scheduling issues, propose licensing conditions, and \nresolve disputes.\n  This bill also contains provisions to expedite the approval process \nfor an amendment to a license for a qualifying hydro project upgrade. \nWithout the hydropower licensing improvements in this bill--without \nthem--we risk losing investment opportunities in new hydropower \ninfrastructure which would benefit consumers with affordable \nelectricity and expand the use of clean, renewable energy.\n  Again, I thank my colleagues for their work, and the great staff, on \nthis important piece of legislation.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n\n         House of Representatives, Committee on Oversight and \n           Government Reform,\n                                 Washington, DC, October 31, 2017.\n     Hon.

Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong opposition to H.R. 3043, the \nHydropower Policy Modernization Act of 2017.\n  Mr. Chairman, while Members on both sides of the aisle support \nhydropower, unfortunately, the bill before us today is deeply flawed \nand will not modernize or improve the hydropower licensing process. \nInstead, Mr. Chairman, H.R. 3043 would place private profits above the \npublic interest by giving priority of our public waterways to industry \nin order to generate power and profits over and above the rights and \nthe interests of Native Tribes or farmers or fishermen, boaters, and \nother stakeholders who also rely on these public rivers and streams.\n  Mr. Chairman, it is very important for us to remember that \nhydroelectric licenses can span between 30 and 50 years, and, under \nexisting law, a license holder can be granted automatic yearly \nextensions in perpetuity without even having to reapply.\n  Mr. Chairman, this issue is far too important for us not to get it \nright this time. And what does H.R. 3043 actually do?\n  This bill will make the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, FERC, \nthe lead agency over the licensing process and will require Native \nTribes, the States, and other Federal resource agencies to pay \ndeference to the Commission, even in areas where FERC has absolutely no \nexpertise or statutory authority, including on issues regarding \nagricultural water use, drinking water protection, fisheries \nmanagement, and recreational river use. How absurd, Mr. Chairman.\n  Additionally, Mr. Chairman, H.R. 3043 would expand and alter the \ntrial-type hearing provisions on the Federal Power Act, essentially \nrigging the process in favor of industry by providing multiple new \nentry points to challenge conditions designed by Federal resource \nagencies.\n  Mr. Chairman, the threat of these timely and costly hearings may be \nused to coerce agencies to propose weaker conditions, and, at the same \ntime, this bill also shifts the venue for these hearings to FERC, which \nis another very obvious handout and handover to industry.\n  Mr. Chairman, in testimony before the Energy and Commerce Committee, \nwe heard, repeatedly, that a major\n\n\ncause for licensing delays was due to incomplete applications that do \nnot include all the pertinent information that is necessary to issue a \ndecision.\n  Mr. Chairman, H.R. 3043 does nothing, absolutely nothing, to address \nthis very, very serious issue. In fact, this bill will implement strict \ntimelines on Federal resource agencies, States, and Tribes, but does \nnot require applicants to submit all of their information to these \nagencies before the clock actually starts ticking.\n  Mr. Chairman, FERC, itself, the very agency that will be charged with \nimplementing this grossly bad bill, FERC, itself, disputed claims that \nthis bill would streamline the licensing process, noting that the \nlegislation ``could increase the complexity and the length of the \nlicensing process.'' These are FERC's words, FERC's words before the \ncommittee.\n  Mr. Chairman, we cannot allow hydropower facilities to claim a \nmonopoly over our public waterways without mitigating the negative \nimpacts of these facilities on others who rely on these resources and \nwithout, at the same time, without complying with modern environmental \nlaws.\n  H.R. 3043, Mr. Chairman, is opposed by States, opposed by the Native \nTribes, opposed by the outdoor recreation industry and by more than 150 \nnational and local environmental organizations.\n  Mr. Chairman, it is for all of these reasons that I, too, stand in \nconcert and side by side with Native Tribes, the outdoor recreation \nindustry, and the other 150 national and local environmental \norganizations.

Mr. Chairman, I appreciate all of the work \nthat has gone into this legislation, and I rise in support and urge \nsupport of the Hydropower Policy Modernization Act of 2017.\n  Hydropower serves as the Nation's largest source of clean, renewable, \nreliable, and affordable energy. In my home State of Washington, it is \nroughly 70 percent of our electricity that comes from hydropower. It is \none of the reasons that we enjoy some of the lowest electricity rates \nin the country.\n  Only 3 percent of the dams produce electricity, and there is room for \ntremendous potential to increase production of this renewable energy \nresource. In fact, we could double hydropower production and create an \nestimated 700,000 new jobs without building a single new dam, simply by \nupdating the technology in our existing infrastructure and streamlining \nthe relicensing process. But we must reduce the regulatory burden to \nallow this process to move forward.\n  This legislation seeks to streamline the relicensing process in an \ninclusive and environmentally friendly way. On average, it only takes \n18 months to authorize or relicense a new natural gas facility--18 \nmonths--but it can take up to 10 years or longer to license a new \nhydropower project or relicense an existing facility--10 years.\n  Right now, it can be extremely costly and an uncertain process to \nrelicense an existing dam or license a new dam. Investors are pursuing \nother base load sources of energy because of the current regulatory \nprocess. I want to encourage these investments so that we can support \nand expand renewable, carbon-free hydropower.\n  As I understand it, hydropower is well-supported by my colleagues, \nbut many think we are tipping the scales in favor of this source.\n  First, I would like to define industry. We are hearing a lot about \nindustry on the other side.\n\n  In eastern Washington, many of these dams are owned by small PUDs who \npass on all of the costs to the ratepayers. These costs are delivered \nto the people of eastern Washington and throughout the United States. \nThese are not major corporations.\n  I have also heard that we are lowering environmental standards during \nthe licensing process for Tribes and States. At the request of the \nWestern Governors' Association, we added language to clarify that \nnothing in this bill--nothing in this bill--will touch the Federal \nWater Pollution Control Act, the Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act, \nthe Endangered Species Act, the Rivers and Harbors Appropriation Act, \nor the National Historic Preservation Act.\n  I have also heard that we did not allow Tribes and States to testify \non this bill. I struggle with these comments. This bill has gone \nthrough regular order. We have held multiple hearings. We had a member \nfrom the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe on one of the panels. It passed out \nof committee with a voice vote because concerns were raised from the \nTribes, and we committed to sitting down and working with the Tribes to \nattempt to reach some language. I am proud of our efforts in that \nregard, and I am greatly disappointed that, at the end of the day, the \nTribes did not come to an agreement on the legislation.\n\n\n  Although we weren't able to reach that resolution, we do protect the \nintegrity of this legislation.\n  Licenses are complex, but there is no excuse for a process to take 10 \nyears. It is time to update the approval process and make hydropower \nproduction easier and less costly without sacrificing environmental \nreview. That is exactly what the Hydropower Policy Modernization Act of \n2017 will do.\n  Specifically, my legislation designates FERC as the lead agency for \nthe purpose of coordinating all applications of Federal authorizations, \nand establishes coordinated procedures for the licensing of hydropower \nprojects.\n  By designating FERC as the lead when coordinating with agencies, \nStates, and Tribes, there will be added transparency and collaboration. \nThis added certainty in the relicensing process will diminish the \nburden on resource agencies, help avoid unnecessary delays, and \nultimately lower costs to my constituents.\n  My legislation also incentivizes capital-intensive projects like \nupdating turbines or improving fish ladders. Right now, these upgrades \nare only included in the lifespan of a dam's license during the \nrelicensing window.\n  Included in the legislation is an early action provision requiring \nFERC to include all protection, mitigation, and enhancement measures \nduring the relicensing process. In addition, the legislation allows the \ntimely and efficient completion of licensing procedures by minimizing \nthe duplication of studies and establishing a program to compile a \ncomprehensive collection of studies and data on a regional or basin-\nwide scale. At the same time, industry has the option to help pay for \nstudies and staff resources to speed up the process.\n  As a co-chair of the Northwest Energy Caucus, I recognize and I am \nexcited about the tremendous potential hydropower brings not just to my \ndistrict in eastern Washington, but to the country. By utilizing \ncurrently untapped resources and unleashing American ingenuity, \nhydropower production will lower energy costs and help create jobs.\n  This bill is not about changing outcomes or environmental law. This \nbill is about speeding up the process and saving time and money.\n  Mr. Chair, I urge all of my colleagues to support clean American \nenergy and to support the Hydropower Policy Modernization Act of 2017.", "turn": 7, "speaker": "Mrs. McMORRIS RODGERS", "itemno": 11}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "R000515", "text": "  Mr. RUSH.

Mr. Chair, I thank Mr. Rush, our ranking member of the \nsubcommittee, for yielding.\n  Mr. Chair, I rise in strong opposition to H.R. 3043.\n  I support hydropower. It can deliver low-carbon, affordable power if \nit is well-sited and managed. But these facilities, which are licensed \nfor 30 to 50 years, can do enormous harm to fisheries, agriculture, and \nrecreational cultural resources if not properly overseen. The \nhydropower licensing process can be more efficient, but electric \nutilities should not be permitted to operate without license conditions \nthat ensure other public interests are met.\n  As I look at H.R. 3043 and weigh it against the list of stakeholders \nwith interests in the rivers and watersheds\n\n\nthat provide hydroelectric facilities their fuel, I see a bill that is \nunbalanced, regressive, and dangerous; that will harm farmers, \nfishermen, boaters, Tribes, and drinking water.\n  H.R. 3043 will allow private hydropower companies to use public water \nresources to generate power and profit, but without mitigating the \nnegative impacts of their facilities on others who rely on our rivers, \nand without complying with modern environmental laws.\n  H.R. 3043, is a direct assault on States' rights, Tribal rights, and \nit undercuts major environmental laws, including the Clean Water Act, \nthe National Environmental Policy Act, and the Endangered Species Act. \nIt prioritizes the use of rivers for power generation above the needs \nof all other water uses, and it inserts the Federal Energy Regulatory \nCommission into decisions that it has no authority, experience, or \nexpertise to make.\n  So what this bill will not do is speed up the licensing process. FERC \ntestified before our committee that one of the causes of delay in the \nlicensing process was the failure of the applicant to provide a \ncomplete application, yet this bill does nothing to ensure that an \napplicant provides one. It makes no sense to impose a deadline if there \nis no clearly defined starting point in the form of a completed \napplication.\n  How can a State make a decision on a water quality certificate if the \napplicant hasn't submitted the information that State needs to make \nthat decision?\n  While FERC requires applicants to submit a complete application on \nthe matters over which it has direct responsibility, the Commission has \nmany times denied a similar opportunity to State and Federal agencies \nwith regard to matters where they have primacy. In fact, FERC has a \nhistory of merely consulting with other stakeholders while dismissing \ntheir concerns and failing to incorporate minimal resource protections \ninto hydropower licenses.\n  As an example, FERC recently failed to impose a number of conditions \nthe State of West Virginia included in its water quality certificate \nfor a project on the Monongahela River. FERC did this in spite of the \nfact that West Virginia acted in a timely manner. West Virginia acted \nin accordance with its law and delegated responsibility under the Clean \nWater Act.\n  Yesterday, I sent a letter with several of my colleagues to FERC \nexpressing concern over the process it used on this project.\n  This bill virtually ensures that type of situation will be repeated. \nNow, a project that is noncontroversial, supported by the State, is \nlikely to be stalled by hearings and other possible litigation that \ncould have been avoided.\n  Mr. Chair, the truth is that H.R. 3043 treats Federal agencies, State \ngovernments, and Indian Tribes as second class citizens in this \nprocess. FERC is required to consult with them, but consultation does \nnot ensure they will get FERC's support to fulfill their missions.\n  In this bill, all of the discipline is applied to government \nagencies, but none to the applicant. This is especially true in the \ncase of license renewals. Any license that wants to avoid new \ninvestments or operating conditions can certainly do so because FERC \nwill grant them automatic annual license renewal for as many years as \nthey need.\n  Another reason why this bill will not expedite hydroelectric licenses \nis because, rather than streamlining the process, H.R. 3043 greatly \nexpands litigation opportunities, something that will increase the \nexpense and time required to award a license. It does this by providing \nfor a biased, costly trial-type hearing process to secure decisions in \nthe utility's favor.\n  Current law allows a single opportunity to challenge an agency \ncondition to avoid undue expense and delay in the licensing process. \nH.R. 3043 expands the opportunities to challenge agency decisions, \nallows multiple challenges, and moves the venue for these hearings.\n  Not even FERC thinks that this is a good idea. In fact, at our \nhearing on this bill, the Deputy Associate General Counsel of FERC \nadvised the committee to either retain the existing trial-type hearing \nprocess or eliminate it altogether.\n  Well, that advice obviously fell on deaf ears because the bill puts \nthe trial-type hearing process on steroids. In essence, the private \nhydro companies pick the venue, set the rules, and secure additional \npoints in the license process to challenge conditions that Federal \nresource agencies or FERC seeks to impose on a license to protect \npublic interests. FERC warned that this change would increase the \nexpense, complexity, and the length of licensing process--hardly the \ntraits you would associate with streamlining.\n  Ultimately, the bill is a bad bill because it is bad for Native \nAmericans; it is bad for the environment; it is bad for recreation; it \nis bad for farmers and agriculture; and H.R. 3043 is bad for States, \nthat will now find it much harder to protect water quality and manage \nthe waters within their boundaries.\n  Maybe that is why the bill is opposed by States, Tribes, the outdoor \nrecreation industry, and more than 150 national and local environmental \norganizations.\n  Opponents of the bill include the Western Governors' Association, the \nSouthern States Energy Board, the National Congress of American \nIndians, the Environmental Council of the States, the Outdoor Alliance, \nthe National Wildlife Federation, the American Rivers, Trout Unlimited, \nand the League of Conservation Voters, among many others.\n  Perhaps the ultimate condemnation comes from FERC, which, in \ntestimony before our committee, disputed claims that the bill would \nstreamline the licensing process, noting that the legislation ``could \nincrease the complexity and length of the licensing process.''\n  Hydropower facilities are using our most precious resource: water.\n  I don't think it is too much to ask that facilities awarded long-term \nlicenses and free fuel share the rivers with others.\n  Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to oppose the bill.", "turn": 9, "speaker": "Mr. PALLONE", "itemno": 13}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "U000031", "text": "  Mr. UPTON.

In particular, closed-loop pumped storage hydro \nprojects offer the opportunity to store energy for use when it is \nneeded.\n  I have introduced separate legislation, H.R. 2880, with the goal of \nmaking the review process of these projects as efficient as possible. \nBoth H.R. 3043 and H.R. 2880 will allow the Federal Energy Regulatory \nCommission to impose licensing conditions only as necessary to protect \npublic safety, or that are reasonable, economically feasible, and \nessential to protect fish and wildlife resources.\n  I am excited about the possibility some are exploring to build these \nfacilities in abandoned mine lands.

Given that hydropower is \n     an important source of domestic, emissions-free, flexible \n     power needed to ensure consistent and reliable electric \n     service, we must\n\n\n     look to preserve and protect our existing hydropower system \n     and promote new expansion opportunities.\n       H.R. 3043 provides a framework that adds accountability and \n     transparency, eliminates inefficiencies and redundancies, and \n     unlocks innovation and advancements in technology and \n     operations, while protecting environmental values, public \n     participation, and all existing authorities of federal and \n     state decision-makers in the licensing process\n       The current regulatory environment is placing hydropower at \n     risk. The licensing process can result in both new and \n     existing projects taking up to ten years or longer to receive \n     their approvals. This not only creates uncertainty for \n     project owners and developers alike, but burdens electricity \n     customers with additional unnecessary costs and only delays \n     important environmental measures that the industry, resource \n     agencies, and the environmental community agreed upon during \n     the licensing process and want to see deployed.\n       Additionally, the fleet of almost 2,200 hydropower projects \n     across the country supports approximately 118,000 ongoing \n     full-time equivalent jobs in operations and maintenance and \n     25,000 jobs in construction and upgrades. By maintaining our \n     existing fleet and supporting growth in the sector, the \n     hydropower industry could support close to 200,000 jobs. \n     Further local economic development in other industries is \n     also spurred due to access to affordable electricity from \n     hydropower projects. However, we will not realize the full \n     measure of these jobs and economic opportunities without \n     improvements to the licensing process.\n       We believe H.R. 3043 is a moderate proposal developed with \n     bipartisan input and, as such, deserves strong support by \n     both Republicans and Democrats. Please contact any of our \n     organizations for additional information or assistance on \n     this bill.\n           Sincerely,\n         The American Council on Renewable Energy (ACORE), \n           American Public Power Association (APPA), Business \n           Council for Sustainable Energy (BCSE), Edison Electric \n           Institute (EEI), International Brotherhood of \n           Boilermakers (Boilermakers), International Brotherhood \n           of Electrical Workers (IBEW), International Federation \n           of Professional and Technical Engineers (IFPTE), Large \n           Public Power Council (LPPC), Laborers' International \n           Union of North America (LiUNA), National Electrical \n           Contractors Association (NECA), National Hydropower \n           Association (NHA), National Rural Electric Cooperative \n           Association (NRECA), North America Building Trades \n           Council (NABTU), United Brotherhood of Carpenters and \n           Joiners of America (Carpenters).\n", "turn": 11, "speaker": "Mr. GRIFFITH", "itemno": 15}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "U000031", "text": "  Mr. UPTON.

This \nbill would constrain that authority, forcing States to issue rushed \nconditions using incomplete scientific data, or surrender their \nauthority to issue conditions at all. In short, the choice that States \nhave to protect their water and their people is to either do it poorly \nor not at all.\n  We had a fix for this. We had an amendment to H.R. 3043, but it was \nnot made in order. It would have preserved the critical role States \nplay in protecting local water quality by exempting their rights under \nthe Clean Water Act from the bill.\n  For Marylanders in my State, this issue is bipartisan and hits close \nto home. FERC is currently considering the relicensing of a \nhydroelectric dam on the Susquehanna River. The Susquehanna provides 50 \npercent of all of the freshwater that reaches the Chesapeake Bay, \nmaking it a critical driver of the Bay's water quality. Any new FERC \nlicense will need to have conditions that protect the Susquehanna and \nthe Bay from the sediment and nutrient pollution built up behind the \ndam. That is why even Republicans in our State, the secretary of the \nenvironment, and secretary of natural resources sent a letter urging \nCongress to strike the provisions in this bill that would limit \nMaryland's ability to set water quality conditions.\n  I am disappointed that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle \nin this body, who so often remark on the importance of protecting \nStates' rights from usurping Federal agencies, have refused to protect \nStates by bringing this critical amendment to the floor.\n  Mr. Chair, I urge all of my colleagues to oppose H.R. 3043.\n\n", "turn": 15, "speaker": "Mr. SARBANES", "itemno": 19}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "U000031", "text": "  Mr. UPTON.

Mr. Chairman, I want to draw attention, first of all, to \npage 17, line 23, of the bill because we have heard from those who \noppose it that somehow this could adversely undermine the Federal Water \nPollution Control Act, the Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act, the \nEndangered Species Act, the Clean Water Act, et cetera.\n  Line 23 makes it very clear, ``No effect on other laws. Nothing in \nthis section shall be construed to affect any requirement of'' these \nunderlying and very important laws that protect our environment.\n  So I just want to make sure that is in the Record. This is the \ncurrent text of the bill we are voting on today.\n  Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of H.R. 3043, the Hydropower Policy \nModernization Act.\n  Hydropower plays an enormously important role in electricity \ngeneration across the country, and especially in my home State of \nOregon. Hydropower generates 43 percent of electricity in my State. It \nis dependable base load, it is carbon-free, it is renewable, and it is \nvery important to our region.\n  Nationally, hydropower is one of the largest sources of renewable \nelectricity generation. A recent Department of Energy report said that \nU.S. hydropower could grow by almost 50 percent by the year 2050.\n  Thankfully, my good friend from Washington, Cathy McMorris Rodgers, \nintroduced this legislation because, as these entities go to relicense, \nsometimes it costs tens of millions of dollars just to get a renewal of \na government permit to continue to do what you have been doing, and it \ncan take 7 to 10 years to work through the process. By the way, all \nthose costs generally--guess who pays for them? The ratepayers. People \npaying their electricity bill end up paying for all this incredible, \nout-of-control review and regulation.\n  As the committee worked on this legislation under the able hand of \nthe chairman of the Subcommittee on Energy, Mr. Upton, we solicited \nfeedback from all stakeholders as we crafted this. We made a number of \nchanges to address the concerns. We had hearings, and we had lots of \nother individual discussions and roundtables. We added new provisions \nto ensure that States and Tribes are consulted early in the licensing \nprocess to identify and resolve issues of concern.\n  We also made sure that State and local governments could recoup the \ncost of reviewing applications and conducting studies. We even added a \nstrong savings clause that clarifies our intent that nothing in the \nbill shall be construed to effect any requirement of the Clean Water \nAct, the Endangered Species Act, and other environment laws.\n  As a result, we find ourselves here today with bipartisan support for \nthis legislation and the support of the American Council on Renewable \nEnergy, the American Public Power Association, the Business Council for \nSustainable Energy, Edison Electric Institute, the International \nBrotherhood of Boilermakers and Electrical Workers, the International \nFederation of Professional & Technical Engineers, the Large Public \nPower Council, Laborers' International Union of North America, the \nNational Electrical Contractors Association, the National Hydropower \nAssociation, the National Rural Electric Cooperative Association, North \nAmerica Building Trades Council, and the United Brotherhood of \nCarpenters and Joiners of America--those most intricately involved in \nmaking sure we have reliable and clean base load hydropower.\n  Support this modernization legislation.

Mr. Chairman, I thank the ranking member of our \nsubcommittee, the gentleman from Illinois, for his leadership and hard \nwork on the subcommittee and for yielding me this time.\n  Mr. Chairman, I want to express a few concerns with the bill before \nus. But first, let me say that I support hydropower and believe it must \nbe maintained as an important part of our generation mix.\n  Hydro is an excellent source of reliable, zero-emissions electricity \ngeneration. In order to address climate change and increase clean \nenergy production, it is, indeed, critical that we make licensing and \nrelicensing of these projects feasible.\n  This is an important issue for my home State of New York. Hydropower \nresources produce 19 percent of New York State's total electricity \ngeneration in 2016. The average age of New York's hydropower facilities \nis over 50 years, and many projects are expected to go through the \nrelicensing process in the next 15 years.\n  I want to reiterate that Members on both sides of the aisle want to \nsee these projects developed within reasonable timelines. I understand \nthe current challenges in relicensing and the desire to bring greater \ncertainty to the process. However, I do not think the bill before us \nwould address those concerns in a balanced approach, which takes into \naccount the legitimate concerns of State and Tribal governments and \nenvironmental stakeholders.\n  The process that produced this bill was flawed from the beginning. \nThe committee failed to hold a hearing to understand the concerns of \nState and Tribal governments or Federal resource agencies. These \nentities would be those whose authorities may be limited by FERC under \nthis legislation.\n  The bill enables FERC to set a schedule that may limit State and \nTribal governments and other Federal agencies from having the time to \nfully consider and, yes, set conditions on license applications.\n  An enforceable FERC schedule, outside the control of these agencies, \nmay create a perverse incentive for applicants to slow-walk their \nresponses to information requests from other agencies and State \ngovernments, effectively running out the clock and preventing \nconditions from being required on the application.\n  Our water resources are precious. Different stakeholders have a \nvariety of expectations and demands--power generation, recreation, \nwildlife and fish habitat, drinking water, and agriculture. Managing \nthese resources effectively is about balancing those often-competing \ninterests.\n  The Democratic alternative addresses the schedule concern by allowing \nstakeholders to be involved in the creation of the schedule-setting \nprocess. But I also believe FERC has some of the necessary tools \nalready in the underutilized Integrated Licensing Process which \nencourages all stakeholders to engage in a robust, information sharing \nprocess up front.\n  Now, finally, to set the record straight, I listened intently as the \ngentlewoman from Washington State, the sponsor of the bill, spoke to \nthe fact that the Standing Rock Sioux were, indeed, represented at \nhearings, that they had a witness at the FERC hearings. They were there \nto discuss pipelines and not hydro.\n  Mr. Chairman, so I am opposing this bill today, but I hope we can \nmove forward with a truly bipartisan process in the future to improve \nthe licensing process while respecting the needs of all stakeholders.", "turn": 19, "speaker": "Mr. TONKO", "itemno": 23}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "U000031", "text": "  Mr. UPTON.

In fact, only 3 percent of existing dams in the United \nStates produce hydroelectricity. This illustrates the vast opportunity \nin this country for new hydropower generation.\n  In the Water, Power, and Oceans Subcommittee of the Natural Resources \nCommittee which I chair, we have spent much of this Congress crafting \nand advancing legislation to capitalize on these opportunities. \nLegislation such as my bill, the Bureau of Reclamation Pumped Storage \nHydropower Development Act, is intended to promote pumped storage \nhydropower development at existing reclamation facilities. Mrs. \nMcMorris Rodgers' bill in front of us today goes hand in hand with \nthose efforts.\n  Even our friends across the aisle agree with our efforts to promote \nhydropower development. At a May oversight hearing in my subcommittee \non the challenges facing hydropower, committee Democrats helpfully \nsuggested that we should find ways to retrofit all nonpowered Federal \nfacilities with hydropower. We should all agree that improving the \npermitting and approval process for these facilities would be the \neasiest way to achieve this goal.\n  Mr. Chairman, I want to thank Congresswoman McMorris Rodgers again \nfor sponsoring this critical piece of legislation. She has been and \ncontinues to be a champion supporter of hydropower. Just last month, my \nsubcommittee considered another bill authored by the Congresswoman--\nH.R. 3144--that looks to provide certainty and reliability to several \nFederal hydropower projects producing electricity in the Federal \nColumbia River Power System that have been mired in third-party \nlitigation, questionable and expensive judicial edicts, and onerous \nFederal regulations.", "turn": 21, "speaker": "Mr. LAMBORN", "itemno": 25}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "R000515", "text": "  Mr. RUSH.

While the Central \nArizona Project came after President Kennedy,\n\n\nit continues to bring prosperity to Arizona's cities, Tribal \ncommunities, ranches, and farms almost 50 years after its inception.\n\n  The Glen Canyon Dam and other projects affiliated with the Colorado \nRiver Storage Project provided the backbone of a regional economy that \nhas produced year-round and emissions-free hydropower.\n  H.R. 3043 streamlines the permitting process and encourages the \nexpansion of hydropower generation by establishing a single lead \ncoordinating agency, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, FERC, in \norder to facilitate in a timelier manner all hydropower authorizations, \napprovals, and requirements mandated by Federal law.\n  This bill will also dramatically decrease costs to relicense non-\nFederal dams, a huge win for the West.\n  Presently, FERC exercises jurisdiction over 1,600 non-Federal \nhydropower projects at more than 2,500 dams under the Federal Power \nAct.\n  According to FERC, the relicensing workload is increasing \ndramatically. Between FY 2017 and FY 2030, roughly 480 projects \namounting to 45 percent of FERC-licensed projects will begin the \nrelicensing process.\n  Rural co-ops, power companies, and other stakeholders in the West \nneed a clear process without the bureaucracy.

You turn \non the switch, hydroelectric power.\n  My district in northern California is home to two of the largest \nfacilities in the country: Oroville Dam and Shasta Dam. Each of these \nfacilities delivers cost-efficient power, provides flood control, and \ngenerates significant local economic activity for the community via \nstored water and recreation.\n  With local input, which is very important, we need to address the \nstreamlining of this process and expanding renewable hydropower \nproduction in this country to pave the way for new jobs and affordable \npower to consumers everywhere.\n  Relicensing permits ought not be a wish list for every special \ninterest, but, indeed, on measures of the power that can be generated.\n  Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the time, and I wholeheartedly support and \nurge this House to support H.R. 3043.", "turn": 38, "speaker": "Mr. LaMALFA", "itemno": 42}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "R000515", "text": "  Mr. RUSH.

Paul Ryan, Speaker,\n     Hon. Nancy Pelosi, Minority Leader,\n     Honorable Members of the House of Representatives, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Speaker Ryan, Minority Leader Pelosi and Honorable \n     Members of Congress: Yesterday, when the Rules Committee \n     discussed HR 3043, the Hydropower Policy Modernization Act of \n     2017, a number of members of the committee including Chairman \n     Sessions, Congressman Cole, Congressman Newhouse, Congressman \n     McGovern, Congresswoman Cheney as well as the Chairman Walden \n     and Ranking Subcommittee Member Rush (who were testifying), \n     all stressed the importance of ensuring that Indian tribes \n     have their treaty rights and natural resources protected by \n     any actions of the Congress relative to hydropower reform. We \n     greatly appreciate the concerns of these members and the \n     amount of time they spent discussing tribes and dam \n     relicensing. I think many of them were aware of the degree to \n     which the placement of dams has negatively affected a number \n     of reservations, flooding some and damaging salmon runs at \n     others. While there was universal agreement that the rights \n     of tribes and states must be protected, there was not \n     agreement on whether HR 3043 accomplishes that laudable \n     intent. I must tell you that the bill does not do so.\n       First understand what the Federal Power Act (FPA) now says.\n       Under provisions that have been in effect for decades, \n     state governments, pursuant to the Clean Water Act, are able \n     to set water quality standards at hydro dams. Such conditions \n     are mandatory. Allowing states to establish water quality \n     standards, a key aspect of Federalism that many in Congress \n     have always fought for, was a lynchpin of the grand bargain \n     reached when the Clean Water Act became law. While Federalism \n     has not really benefitted Indian tribes, we are surprised \n     that the Congress would weaken the ability of states to \n     protect the public in this fashion. We hope you will read \n     what many states have said in letters to the Committee, i.e., \n     HR 3043 weakens their ability to ensure their standards are \n     met during the licensing process. Letters of this nature have \n     come from entities as varied as the Western Governors \n     Association and the Southern States Energy Board.\n       Also under the longstanding language of Section 4(e) of the \n     FPA, Cabinet Secretaries with authority over ``federal \n     reservations'' are directed to ensure that a proposed hydro \n     project doesn't negatively affect a reservation or interfere \n     with its congressionally designated use. These include all \n     lands and marine reserves in the Federal estate from Indian \n     reservations, to National Forests to Wildlife Refuges. \n     Section 18 of the FPA deals with the establishment or \n     modification of fishways to ensure fish can pass over these \n     dams. The Secretaries of Commerce (for NMFS) and Interior \n     (for USFWS) deal with fish passage and the Secretaries of \n     Interior (for BIA, BLM, USFWS and NPS) and Agriculture (for \n     USFS) deal with protecting federal reservations. They have \n     the authority to propose mandatory conditions on hydro dams \n     to ensure their operation protects these federal resources \n     that belong to all Americans.\n       The legislation weakens the conditioning authority for \n     protecting state water quality, for fishways and for federal \n     reservations by transferring significant decision-making \n     authority to FERC. Under the bill, FERC and the license \n     applicant can challenge the necessity of a condition and have \n     that challenge heard via a trial-type hearing only at FERC \n     before an Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) at that agency. \n     Under present law, decisions such as these are heard by ALJs \n     in the agency making the recommendation, where the expertise \n     resides. This provision in the bill is legislating forum \n     shopping and directing that the decision be made before an \n     entity whose expertise is in areas such as energy markets and \n     safety at power plants. FERC and its ALJs have no expertise \n     relative to Indian treaty rights or the Federal Land Policy \n     and Management Act among many bedrock laws and FERC testified \n     before the Committee that they do not want to be given this \n     newfound authority. While having trial-type hearings at FERC \n     and authorizing FERC to set all manner of schedules in the \n     permitting process will certainly create countless billable \n     hours for attorneys representing license applicants, it will \n     do nothing to protect the interest of Indian tribes or the \n     public at large, and as stated above, is directly contrary to \n     state authority under the Clean Water Act and Secretarial \n     authority now found in the Federal Power Act.\n       Yesterday we heard that this process will expedite \n     licensing but if that is the goal then wouldn't it make sense \n     to determine when an application for a license is complete? \n     Tribes repeatedly asked the hydropower industry to clarify \n     that matter in the bill but they refused. Why? Existing \n     hydropower dam licenses were issued decades ago before any \n     environmental statutes were on the books and many of those \n     dams are fish killers. Under the present law, when a license \n     expires the operator can automatically get annual extensions \n     allowing it to operate under 30-50 year old standards. These \n     extensions can go on for year after year with the operator \n     not having to spend any money to mitigate the damage to fish \n     or other resources. This is more than ironic considering that \n     the hydropower industry is telling Congress that they need \n     the legislation to ensure certainty and time frames in the \n     relicensing process. Additionally, the bill is drafted in \n     such a fashion that FERC can set schedules that are so \n     abbreviated that Tribes, Cabinet Secretaries or States who \n     wish to comment and perhaps undertake a fishery study when \n     necessary may not have the time to properly prepare suggested \n     or mandatory operating conditions. It is noteworthy that FERC \n     told the Committee that they don't see the legislation \n     actually streamlining the application process. Also, we \n     checked today and could find no tribes in support of this \n     bill.\n\n\n       We believe the Amendment in the Nature of a Substitute \n     (AINS) incorporates much of what the majority proposed in HR \n     3043 while incorporating many changes that are reflective of \n     the input that the Committee received from states and tribes \n     who took the time to relay views and concerns to the \n     Committee. A key part is the requirement for a negotiated \n     rule-making to improve and expedite the hydro licensing \n     process by bringing in states, local governments, \n     stakeholders and tribes to FERC to develop a process that \n     will enable FERC to make decisions on license applications \n     within a maximum of three years. We urge you to vote for the \n     AINS. Without such changes it is highly unlikely that the \n     bill will make it through the Senate. Thank you for \n     considering our views.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Jode L.

The consideration of \n     hydropower licenses is a complicated process that must \n     consider the impact of a project on watersheds and numerous \n     species of fish and wildlife before giving operators 50-year \n     licenses to take power from these ecosystems. It takes time \n     to do the necessary studies to determine what types of \n     conditions can best protect these watersheds, including \n     sensitive fisheries habitat, and the resources not only for \n     Treaty-reserved Indian Reservations and resources, but also \n     for the multiple users of these watersheds, including \n     recreation, commercial fishing, and agriculture. If FERC's \n     past actions are any guidance, FERC will impose unrealistic \n     deadlines that the agencies will not meet. This bill will \n     return the Nation back to a time when hydropower projects \n     flooded Indian lands, extirpated entire species of salmon, \n     and destroyed critical cultural resources.\n       Third, this bill would allow FERC for the first time to \n     make a determination that a mandatory condition is \n     inconsistent with the Federal Power Act. This would undermine \n     the Supreme Court's decision in Escondido Mut. Water Co. v. \n     La Jolla Band of Mission Indians, 466 U.S. 765 (1984), which \n     held that the FPA provides no authority to FERC to impose \n     restrictions on the 4(e) conditions submitted by the \n     Secretary of Interior. The current process affords the \n     hydropower industry ample opportunity to consider and respond \n     to potential Sections 4(e), 18, and Clean Water Act \n     conditions. Hydropower licensees can (and in fact do) \n     actively participate in the process by which these conditions \n     are deliberated and set. And while these conditions are not \n     subject to modification by FERC, they are subject to judicial \n     review, and FERC is free to express its disagreement with the \n     conditions, so that FERC's views can also be considered by \n     the courts.\n       Finally, the bill requires the Agency imposing these \n     conditions to prepare a written statement that the Agency \n     gave equal consideration to power generating interests in \n     issuing its 4(e) conditions. Currently, if a hydroelectric \n     project is located on federal lands, including Indian \n     Reservations, the only consideration the Secretary has is to \n     impose conditions that protect those reservations. There is \n     no consideration of other interests.

The proposed changes \n     would abrogate the federal government's overarching trust \n     responsibility to Indian tribes and its ability to uphold \n     tribal treaty rights. Our Tribe is particularly concerned \n     that current legislative reform efforts to consolidate \n     hydropower approval authority within the Federal Energy \n     Regulatory Commission (FERC) unduly favor the interests of \n     private industry at the expense of tribes, local and state \n     governments, natural resources, and local citizens. As our \n     trustee, we urge you to ensure that any hydropower \n     legislation passed out of the Committee will only strengthen \n     Tribes' ability to give input on hydropower licensing \n     decisions at hydropower facilities.\n       The Snoqualmie Tribe is adamantly opposed to legislative \n     reforms efforts that seek to undermine current mechanisms \n     that ensure adequate consideration of the effects of a \n     proposed hydropower project on affected Indian lands and \n     natural resources. In particular, the proposed changes to \n     Sec. Sec. 4(e) and 18 of the Federal Power Act and Sec. 401 \n     of the Clean Water Act would enable FERC to disregard \n     mandatory conditions imposed by federal and state land \n     management agencies. Disregarding the established expertise \n     and mission of such agencies to evaluate and mitigate impacts \n     to Indian lands and natural resources directly undermines the \n     federal government's ability to fulfill its trust and treaty \n     obligations to Indian tribes. For example, Sec. Sec. 34 and \n     37 of the draft legislation would allow FERC to effectively \n     waive conditions necessary to implement the Northwest Power \n     Act, Endangered Species Act, or the Clean Water Act if a \n     state, tribe, or federal agency cannot meet a FERC deadline. \n     Additionally, the proposed schedule of 120 days to complete \n     all ``federal authorizations'' is unworkable in practice and \n     will inevitably lead to such waivers.\n       It is imperative that any legislative reforms to the \n     hydropower permitting process adequately consider and \n     mitigate the impacts to Indian lands, Tribal sacred sites, \n     and natural resources. Historically, American Indian tribes \n     have experienced disproportionate negative effects when dams, \n     including hydroelectric projects, were approved without \n     adequate tribal consultation or consideration of the effects \n     on surrounding natural resources. For example, in the past, \n     hydropower dams have flooded Indian reservations resulting in \n     the permanent loss or damage to Tribal lands and sacred \n     sites.\n       Given the Snoqualmie Tribe is a signatory to the Treaty of \n     Point Elliot of 1855, the federal government has an \n     enforceable fiduciary obligation to act as trustee on the \n     Tribe's behalf. Of critical significance to our people is \n     Snoqualmie Falls, a 268-foot waterfall that is the place of \n     our creation history and our most sacred site. The Falls are \n     an essential part of our cultural and religious practices \n     where we pray, conduct sacred ceremonies, and traditionally \n     buried our dead. Our Tribe is all too familiar with the \n     negative impacts of inadequately planned hydroelectric dams \n     on our culture, lands, and very way of life. For more than \n     100 years, Snoqualmie Falls has been hampered by the \n     diversion of its water for a hydroelectric dam that \n     significantly reduces the strong flow of water and the mists \n     coming from the Falls. Without these, our religious practices \n     are severely limited and we cannot fully engage in our \n     cultural heritage.\n       The current draft hydropower reform legislation does not \n     appropriately balance various stakeholders' interests and, \n     instead, prioritizes private industry interests above the \n     federal governments' responsibility as trustee to Tribes. \n     Accordingly, we urge the Committee to ensure that legislation \n     passed out of the Committee strengthens Tribes' ability to \n     give input on hydropower decisions.\n       Thank you for your consideration on this very important \n     religious and cultural issue to our Tribe. We look forward to \n     working with the Committee to ensure any hydropower reform \n     efforts are suitably tailored to uphold the federal \n     government's trust responsibility to Indian peoples and \n     protect tribal treaty rights.\n           Sincerely,\n     Snoqualmie Tribal Council.", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 50}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                       Skokomish Indian Tribe,\n\n                              Skokomish Nation, WA, June 21, 2017.\n     Re Proposed Amendments to the Federal Power Act.\n\n     Hon.

Frank Pallone, Jr.,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on Energy and Commerce, House of \n         Representatives, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Upton and Ranking Member Pallone: I write to \n     again express the Skokomish Tribe's strong objections to the \n     amendments to the Federal Power Act that are now being \n     considered by the House Energy and Commerce Committee.\n       If this bill is enacted as approved by the Committee, it \n     would represent one of the most significant roll backs of the \n     federal trust responsibility since termination. For more than \n     ninety years the Federal Power Act directed Interior and \n     other land management agencies to impose conditions on \n     hydroelectric projects to protect federal lands including \n     federal Indian Reservations and Treaty protected resources. \n     However, in the first forty years, the federal land \n     management agencies largely ignored this responsibility. As a \n     consequence of this abdication to the Skokomish Tribe, our \n     Reservation and our resources paid a very high price.\n\n\n       Our story is but one of many across Indian country. In the \n     1920s Tacoma City and Light received a license for the \n     Cushman Dam on the North Fork of the Skokomish River. The \n     entire flow of the North Fork of the Skokomish River was \n     diverted from its channel and sent to a power house on Hood \n     Canal (a bay of the Puget Sound). The dewatering of the North \n     Fork completely destroyed a premier salmon run, with grievous \n     economic and cultural consequences for the Tribe. See \n     generally, City of Tacoma v. FERC, 460 F.3d 53, 62 (D.C. Cir. \n     2006); Skokomish Indian Tribe v. United States, 410 F.3d 506, \n     509-510 (9th Cir. 2005) (en banc revised). In terms of direct \n     impact on the Skokomish Reservation itself, the dewatering of \n     the North Fork resulted in an approximately 40% reduction in \n     the flow of the Skokomish River mainstem. This change in the \n     hydrology of the Skokomish River caused one-third of the \n     Reservation to be flooded. Skokomish v. United States, 410 \n     F.3d at 509-510, see also id. at 521 (dissenting opinion of \n     Judge Graber). In short, this project almost completely \n     destroyed the Reservation and the fishery for which the \n     Reservation was established.\n       The original Cushman Dam license expired in 1974 and the \n     Skokomish Tribe spent significant time, energy and resources \n     to ensure that the United States would not once again \n     abdicate its responsibility to the Tribe and sought \n     conditions on the new license that would protect the \n     Skokomish Reservation. At every turn Tacoma and the \n     hydropower industry fought the Tribe. However, in 2006, the \n     Skokomish Tribe won the right for the Department of the \n     Interior to exercise its Federal Power Act 4(e) conditioning \n     authority to protect the Reservation and the Tribe. City of \n     Tacoma, Washington v. F.E.R.C., 460 F.3d 53, 59 (D.C. Cir. \n     2006) (``Cushman'')\n       As a result of this decision, the Cushman project is now \n     being operated in a manner meant to reverse the more than 80 \n     years of damage to the Skokomish Reservation. These changes \n     are slow but, over time, there will be improvements to the \n     flow of the mainstem and flooding will lessen. Reservation \n     lands that are waterlogged and useless will be restored and \n     productive for the Tribe and our members again.\n       The bill now before the Committee would essentially reverse \n     the decision that my Tribe fought so hard for, and will let \n     FERC set the timeline for 4(e) mandatory conditions and other \n     conditions, including Section 18 (fishways) and Clean Water \n     Act Permits. The bill goes on to require the agency to \n     imposing these conditions to give equal weight to power \n     generating interests. Again, this would significantly \n     undermine the federal trust responsibility to my tribe and \n     others. If a hydroelectric project is located on Tribal \n     lands, then the only consideration the Secretary has is to \n     impose conditions that protect that Reservation. There is no \n     balance of other interests. This has been the law for almost \n     ninety years. The Tribe is at a loss for why Congress would \n     want to change this now.\n       Furthermore, the bill before the Committee seeks to have \n     FERC, an agency with no experience or capacity, the \n     responsibility for determining the scope of environmental \n     review that Interior, Commerce, States and even Tribes should \n     take.\n       A change to the Federal Power Act is not needed. First, \n     sections 4(e), 18 and the other related provisions of the \n     Federal Power Act, establish proper checks and balances in \n     the licensing process. While FERC is examining a broad range \n     of issues in connection with the license application or \n     renewal, the Interior Secretary can bring to bear Interior's \n     knowledge and expertise regarding the needs of Indian \n     country, the potential impact of the project on the Indian \n     reservation, and address measures to ensure the proper \n     protection of that reservation. Other sections of the Act \n     likewise establish appropriate checks and balances by \n     recognizing and giving effect to the responsibilities and \n     expertise that such other agencies have on natural resource \n     management--such as that provided by Interior's Fish & \n     Wildlife Service and the Department of Commerce on fisheries \n     and fish passage facilities as well as the vital and \n     longstanding authority exercised by States and Tribes in \n     setting water quality standards under the Clean Water Act. \n     While hydropower is clean energy, it is clean only because of \n     the important role that these other agencies, with the \n     necessary expertise, have in addressing terms and conditions \n     for hydropower licenses. FERC does not have the technical \n     capacity to make these decisions.\n       The current process affords the hydropower industry ample \n     opportunity to consider and respond to potential Section \n     4(e), 18 and Clean Water Act conditions. Hydropower licenses \n     can (and in fact do) actively participate in the process by \n     which these conditions are deliberated and set. And while \n     these conditions are not subject to modification by FERC, \n     they are subject to judicial review, and FERC is free to \n     express its disagreement with the conditions, so that FERC's \n     views can also be considered by the courts.\n       Finally, while the current process may take time to \n     complete necessary studies and vetting of potential \n     conditions, any delay in renewing licenses does not harm the \n     hydropower licensees. As a general matter, until the license \n     renewal process is completed, hydropower licenses are able to \n     operate under their existing licenses which, in our \n     experience, typically do not have many of the conditions \n     needed to protect Indian reservations or natural resources.\n       We urge you to oppose amendments to the Federal Power Act \n     that would undermine the federal trust responsibility to \n     protect Indian Reservations or that would alter the Interior \n     Secretary's authority under section 4(e), the provisions of \n     section 18, or the Clean Water Act.\n           Sincerely,\n     Charles ``Guy'' Miller.", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 51}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                                  ____\n\n\n                 National Congress of American Indians\n\n  The National Congress of American Indians Resolution No. MKE-17-005\n\n\n title: to oppose proposed hydropower amendments to the federal power \n                                  act\n\n       Whereas, we, the members of the National Congress of \n     American Indians of the United States, invoking the divine \n     blessing of the Creator upon our efforts and purposes, in \n     order to preserve for ourselves and our descendants the \n     inherent sovereign rights of our Indian nations, rights \n     secured under Indian treaties and agreements with the United \n     States, and all other rights and benefits to which we are \n     entitled under the laws and Constitution of the United States \n     and the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of \n     Indigenous Peoples, to enlighten the public toward a better \n     understanding of the Indian people, to preserve Indian \n     cultural values, and otherwise promote the health, safety and \n     welfare of the Indian people, do hereby establish and submit \n     the following resolution;

and\n       Whereas, the impacts of hydropower projects located on \n     federal lands often extend far beyond the confines of the \n     specific lands on which the projects are sited; and\n       Whereas, some members of Congress and representatives from \n     the hydropower industry have proposed amendments to the \n     Federal Power Act that would (a) weaken the current \n     protections Indian tribes have through the Mandatory \n     Conditions requirements under Section 4(e) and Section 18 of \n     that Act, (b) roll back efforts to restore fish populations \n     through the requirement of fishways, and (c) unnecessarily \n     limit the available time and scientific information available \n     to federal agencies in deciding what Mandatory Conditions \n     should be included with a license;

Mr. Chair, the substitute amendment that we will consider \nshortly provides Indian Tribes with authority to speak for themselves \nwith respect to the hydropower licensing process.\n  Currently, Mr. Chair, the agencies of the Departments of the Interior \nand Commerce proposed conditions to protect Tribal reservations. If the \nsubstitute is enacted, Tribes that have sufficient capacity can assume \nresponsibility for protecting their own reservations.\n\n\n  The Tribal authority provision is absolutely very important and long \noverdue. As sovereign entities, Tribes have a status different from \nthat of States and Federal agencies. They should be negotiating on \ntheir own behalf to protect their own interests.\n\n\n  Mr. Chair, hydropower projects, a number of which were designed and \nbuilt over the objections of Tribes, resulted in devastating losses of \nTribal lands and fisheries.\n  We can and must do better. Hydropower projects can be designed, \nupgraded, and operated in ways that lower the environmental costs and \npreserve other important uses of the river.\n  Current law and current regulations already provide for consultation \nwith Tribes. In fact, under the integrated license process, applicants \nare required to consult with Tribes 5 years before the current license \nexpires if they plan to seek a renewed license.\n  The integrated license process was designed specifically for the more \ncomplex, controversial hydropower projects, either new projects or \nrelicensing of existing projects.\n  Mr. Chair, many applicants, however, request and are allowed to \npursue their license under the traditional license process that \nincludes less opportunity for consultation. FERC should be denying some \nof these requests, but each and every one of them are granted by FERC.\n  When this happens, controversial projects run into predictable \nproblems that bog down the license process. This is an administrative \nchange that FERC could make that would require no new legislation and \nwould improve the license process.\n  Mr. Chair, this bill does nothing--absolutely nothing--to speed up \nthis problem or fix the process that we have been discussing.\n  Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.", "turn": 43, "speaker": "Mr. RUSH", "itemno": 53}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "U000031", "text": "  Mr. UPTON. Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I \ndon't intend to use all the time that is remaining. I just want to make \na couple of points to my colleagues as we close debate on the general \ndebate on this bill.\n  This isn't a new bill. A lot of us in this body on both sides support \nan all-of-the-above strategy. It includes safe nuclear. It includes \nclean coal. It supports energy efficiencies, renewables, wind, solar, \nand hydro.\n  This bill, H.R. 3043, is not a new bill. In fact, the provisions, \nalmost to a tee, in both the House and the Senate version last year in \na bill that ultimately didn't get conferenced to President Obama, we \ndidn't really have any disagreements on the hydro section. We came to \nan agreement and the House passed the bill as it relates to the hydro \nbill. And the Senate bill passed, as I recall it, 92-8, pretty \noverwhelming, pretty bipartisan. In essence, the same provisions that \nwe have here.\n  I got to say that, throughout the process, we listened to the concern \nraised by some of the stakeholders, including States and Tribes. We \nmade a number of significant changes to the version of the bill as \ncompared to the version again last year that added more strength, more \nhurdles to go through.\n  The biggest change, frankly, that we made was taking the hammer away \nfrom FERC to compel agencies to stick to a deadline. Consequently, no \npermits are going to be granted by default because of a missed \ndeadline. But we also inserted new State and Tribal consultation \nrequirements with a very strong savings clause that clarifies that \nnothing shall affect the Clean Water Act and other environmental laws. \nThat wasn't in the bill last year. That is new this year.\n  So I think that we have accommodated the concerns, particularly when \nmany of the Members that are here in this Congress that were there last \nCongress actually voted for the provisions we had, certainly in \ncommittee as well as on the Senate floor.\n  Again, I just want to read into the Record page 17, line 23: ``No \nEffect on Other Laws. Nothing in this section shall be construed to \naffect any requirement of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, the \nFish and Wildlife Coordination Act, the Endangered Species Act of 1973, \nsection 14 of the Act of March 3, 1899 (commonly known as the Rivers \nand Harbors Appropriations Act of 1899), and those provisions of \nsubtitle III of title 54, United States Code, commonly known as the \nNational Historic Preservation Act, with respect to an application for \na license under this part.''\n  This bill is stronger than the one that most of us supported last \nyear, particularly as it pertains to hydroelectric licensing by FERC.\n  So I commend the action of Mrs. McMorris Rodgers, who, again, carried \nthe water on this in this Congress. I would like to think that we will \nhave a positive vote with Republicans and Democrats supporting the \nbill. We are prepared to now discuss and debate the amendments.\n  Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.", "turn": 44, "speaker": "Mr. UPTON", "itemno": 54}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "C001053", "text": "  Mr. COLE. Mr. Chair, I rise today in opposition to H.R. 3043, the \nHydropower Policy Modernization Act of 2017. However, I would like to \npoint out the positive outcomes this bill would provide to the \nHydropower industry. This bill would improve the administrative \nefficiency, accountability and transparency in the process of expanding \nhydropower generation. It would bring certainty and timeliness to the \nlicensing process, that right now takes decades to move through. This \nbill would require other federal agencies to submit earlier any \nforeseeable issues that would prolong the licensing process, instead of \nwaiting until the last hour as they are able to today.\n  With that said, H.R. 3043 falls short in its treatment of tribal \ncommunities. I believe the proponents of this bill have worked in the \nbest interest of Indian Country, but have unfortunately fallen short. \nFirst, this bill would overturn the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals \ndecision in Tacoma v. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) that \nheld that the Department of the Interior has the mandatory authority to \ndevelop appropriate conditions to protect federal Indian reservations \nunder the Federal Power Act. Also, that FERC has no authority to reject \nthese conditions because the Interior Department did not meet FERC's \nschedule. H.R. 3043, would overturn this decision by allowing FERC to \nput a clock on other Federal agencies and force them to accommodate \ntheir schedule. For example, if the Interior Department misses the \ndeadline then Tribal interests cannot be considered again until the \nnext re-licensing opportunity at least 40 years later.\n  H.R. 3043 does nothing to strengthen the tribal voice in the process \nand truncates our trustee agencies' responsibility. This bill would \nallow FERC to make the determination as to the scope of environmental \nreview for 4(e) conditions, which the Interior Department is already \nrequired to give deference to. Hydropower projects affect entire \nwatersheds, which in turn impact Indian reservations in ways that FERC \nand the hydropower industry have fought to deny. However, in Tacoma v. \nFERC, the Court was again clear that if a project is on Indian lands, \nInterior alone gets to determine what conditions, and by necessity the \nenvironmental review, that are necessary to protect the Indian \nReservation.\n  H.R. 3043 would require Interior to balance energy generating \ninterests against the Agency's trust responsibility to protect Indian \nReservations. Currently, under the Federal Power Act, Interior's only \ninterest is developing conditions to protect federal Indian \nReservations, which, frankly, should only be their interests in line \nwith the Bureau of Indian Affairs, and not the Department of Energy.\n  Finally, H.R. 3043 would overturn the Supreme Court's decision in \nEscondido v. FERC, 466 U.S. 765 (1984) and give FERC the authority to \nmake a determination that a 4(e) condition and fishway condition is \ninconsistent with the Federal Power Act. This is unprecedented change \nin the Federal Power Act, which will undermine the federal trustee \nagency's ability to protect Indian lands and resources.\n  There is nothing in the bill that improves the FERC relicensing in \nregards to tribes and, frankly, would severely undermine tribal \ngovernments and Interior Department's ability to protect tribal and \ntrust resources.", "turn": 45, "speaker": "Mr. COLE", "itemno": 55}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "R000515", "text": "  Mr. RUSH.

Paul Ryan,\n     Speaker, House of Representatives,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Nancy Pelosi,\n     Minority Leader, House of Representatives,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Speaker Ryan and Minority Leader Pelosi: The Vermont \n     Agency of Natural Resources (VTANR) would like to express \n     strong concerns over the proposed Hydropower Policy \n     Modernization Act of 2017, H.R. 3043. While VTANR supports \n     efforts to improve and streamline current hydroelectric \n     licensing processes, the Agency strongly opposes legislative \n     efforts to diminish States' ability to protect water quality. \n     Several provisions of H.R. 3043 would essential curtail the \n     State authority under Section 401 of the\n\n\n     federal Clean Water Act, effectively constraining State \n     agencies' ability to use their independent authority to set \n     license conditions, making it more difficult to protect \n     natural resources.\n       VTANR strenuously opposes provisions of H.R. 3043 that \n     eliminate or reduce States' delegated authority under Section \n     401 of the federal Clean Water Act to develop mandatory \n     licensing conditions protective of natural resources. State \n     agencies serve an essential role in the Federal Energy \n     Regulatory Commission (FERC) licensing process for \n     hydroelectric facilities. H.R. 3043 would designate FERC as \n     the lead agency over federal authorizations related to \n     applications of hydroelectric projects for a license, license \n     amendment, or exemptions. As the lead agency, FERC would \n     establish and control the timeline for licensing review and \n     process for hydroelectric projects. H.R. 3043 appears to give \n     FERC the authority to create a schedule reducing the time a \n     State would have to get necessary scientific studies \n     completed and reviewed to determine specific conditions \n     needed to protect water quality, as required under Section \n     401 of the federal Clean Water Act. This would effectively \n     permit FERC to license a facility before a thorough review of \n     the environmental impacts could be completed. Vermont uses \n     its Section 401 authority to issue water quality \n     certifications with conditions to ensure projects are built \n     and operated in a manner consistent with State environmental \n     laws and protective of the environment and public health.\n       In addition, a provision of H.R. 3043 provides applicants \n     with an opportunity to a trial-type hearing before a FERC \n     Administrative Law Judge whenever there is a dispute of \n     material fact. Under the provisions of H.R. 3043, the \n     decision of the FERC Administrative Law Judge would be final \n     and not subject to further administrative review. Currently, \n     conditions included in a Section 401 water quality \n     certification become mandatory license conditions and cannot \n     be altered or modified by FERC. Further matters of material \n     facts related to Section 401 water quality certifications for \n     hydroelectric facilities are heard at the State level by \n     courts or boards that are familiar with a State's water \n     quality standards and other environmental laws. The allowance \n     for the trial-type hearing before FERC could undermine the \n     States' authority granted under Section 401, making it more \n     challenging to protect water quality and natural resources.\n       Through decades of decisions, federal courts have affirmed \n     the authority of States to impose conditions in federal \n     licenses issued to hydroelectric projects under Section 401 \n     of the Clean Water Act. These decisions recognize that States \n     have the primary responsibility to ensure State water quality \n     standards and other environmental laws are met. H.R. 3043 \n     would undermine this authority by including a provision that \n     would allow FERC to seek resolution between it and States at \n     the federal level, elevating the dispute to the secretary \n     overseeing the federal statute. In the case of the federal \n     Clean Water Act, H.R. 3043 appears to allow FERC to negotiate \n     with the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency \n     or Secretary of Army, who are responsible for Clean Water Act \n     on the federal level, to settle a dispute with between it and \n     a state, effectively cutting States out of the process.\n       Vermont's interest in protecting natural resources is as \n     important and relevant today as ever, particularly because a \n     large number of hydroelectric facilities in Vermont are \n     slated to begin the federal relicensing process over the next \n     five years. FERC issues licenses to hydroelectric projects \n     for a term of 30 to 50 years. As such, many of the projects \n     scheduled for relicensing will likely need significant \n     changes in operations to meet modern water quality standards \n     and to restore State water resources from impacts of project \n     operations. As drafted, H.R. 3043 would reduce VTANR \n     delegated authority under Section 401 of the federal Clean \n     Water Act, creating ways for project operators to circumvent \n     state regulations during the licensing process to allow them \n     to operate in a manner that would continue to degrade the \n     environment and resources of the State.\n       VTANR recognizes the importance of hydroelectric generation \n     in meeting renewable energy goals. We urge you to consider \n     how the federal process can be improved without undermining \n     the very checks and balances that have helped hydroelectric \n     generation be viewed as a sustainable and renewable energy \n     source.\n       We appreciate your consideration of these comments on H.R. \n     3043 and look forward to solutions that improve our energy \n     security and infrastructure while protecting the environment.\n           Sincerely,\n                                             Julia S.

While the \n     State Water Board supports the goals of energy infrastructure \n     modernization, it opposes several provisions as drafted \n     because the Hydropower Discussion Drafts would reduce or \n     eliminate essential protections for California's natural \n     resources.\n       The Hydropower Discussion Drafts would seriously impact the \n     mandatory conditioning authority of the State Water Board \n     under Section 401 of the Clean Water Act, as well as similar \n     authorities of federal agencies. State and federal agencies \n     serve an essential role in the Federal Energy Regulatory \n     Commission's (Commission) hydropower licensing process. The \n     Hydropower Discussion Drafts designate the Commission as the \n     sole lead agency over federal authorizations related to an \n     application for a license, license amendment, or exemption \n     for a hydropower project. As the sole lead agency, the \n     Commission would establish and control the timeline for the \n     hydropower licensing process for all aspects of federal \n     authorization, including Section 401 of the Clean Water Act. \n     As such, the Commission could limit the State Water Board and \n     federal agencies' time to complete their respective actions \n     which could adversely impact the agencies' ability to comply \n     with necessary state and federal laws and may negatively \n     impact public and environmental health.\n       As noted in this letter, the State Water Board is \n     particularly concerned about provisions of the Hydropower \n     Discussion Drafts that would undermine states' authorities \n     under Section 401 of the Clean Water Act. As former Chief \n     Justice Rehnquist observed, there has been a ``consistent \n     thread of purposeful and continued deference to state water \n     law by Congress.'' (California v. U.S. (1978) 438 U.S. 645, \n     653.) This ``cooperative federalism'' is epitomized by \n     Section 401 of the Clean Water Act, which authorizes states \n     to set conditions to protect the waters of their states, and \n     provides that review of conditions of certification is in \n     state court, not by federal agencies. In so doing, Section \n     401 preserves both state authority and the integrity of state \n     procedures and state institutions in overseeing how state \n     agencies exercise that authority. Consistent with Congress' \n     usual respect for state rights in this area, this structure \n     must be preserved. The Hydropower Discussion Drafts \n     inappropriately place limitations on state rights in this \n     area by placing Section 401 of the Clean Water Act in the \n     definition of Federal Authorization and under the \n     Commission's jurisdiction.\n       The State Water Board recognizes the importance of \n     hydropower as a clean energy source that helps provide grid \n     reliability and supports the goal of promoting efficiencies \n     in the Commission's licensing of hydropower projects. To \n     promote such efficiencies, in 2013, the State Water Board \n     entered into a memorandum of understanding with the \n     Commission to coordinate pre-application procedures and \n     schedules between the two agencies. Since implementation, the \n     memorandum of understanding has improved coordination between \n     the State Water Board and the Commission, and is beginning to \n     streamline portions of the licensing process. The State Water \n     Board acknowledges that it has a pending backlog of water \n     quality certification applications, due in part to \n     California's recent drought, and we are committed to acting \n     upon these applications as expeditiously as possible.

Pallone,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on Energy and Commerce, House of \n         Representatives, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Walden and Ranking Member Pallone: Western \n     Governors recognize the importance of renewable energy \n     sources, including hydropower, as critical components of an \n     all-of-the-above national energy portfolio. The West accounts \n     for nearly 70 percent of the nation's hydroelectric power \n     generation, and the Pacific\n\n\n     Northwest is the nation's largest hydropower-producing region \n     Western Governors support improving the efficiency of \n     existing hydropower systems and increasing the amount of \n     electricity generated from new, retrofitted, or relicensed \n     hydroelectric facilities.\n       States are vested with primary authority to manage water \n     within their borders, and they have the authority to develop, \n     use, control and distribute water resources within their \n     boundaries. As expressed in section B(1)(a) of WGA Policy \n     Resolution 2015-08, Water Resource Management in the West.\n       ``While the Western Governors acknowledge the important \n     role of federal laws such as the Clean Water Act, the \n     Endangered Species Act and the Safe Drinking Water Act, \n     nothing in any act of Congress or Executive Branch regulatory \n     action should be construed as affecting or intending to \n     affect states' primacy over the allocation and administration \n     of their water resources.''\n       Western Governors are concerned about provisions in Section \n     34, ``Hydropower Licensing and Process Improvement'' of the \n     proposed Hydropower Policy Modernization Act of 2017. \n     Portions of the language included in the published discussion \n     draft of this proposal are identical to language of Subtitle \n     B, ``Hydropower Regulatory Modernization'' of the proposed \n     North American Energy Security and Infrastructure Act of 2015 \n     (H.R. 8).\n       On July 18, 2016, Governor Steve Bullock and Governor \n     Dennis Daugaard provided correspondence (attached) to the \n     Committee, expressing the Western Governors' concerns over \n     the language included in Subtitle B of H.R. 8, which would \n     have designated the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission \n     (FERC) as lead agency fol all hydropower authorizations, \n     approvals, and requirements mandated by federal law, \n     including hydropower facility licenses and amendments, as \n     well as all permits, special use authorizations, \n     certifications, and opinions. The Governors requested that \n     this language be removed or amended so that existing state \n     hydropower licensing authorities are not replaced, or in any \n     way impeded, by FERC jurisdiction.\n       Western Governors request that the language in Section 34 \n     of the proposed Hydropower Policy Modernization Act of 2017 \n     be removed or amended so that states' existing hydropower \n     licensing authorities are in no way usurped by FERC \n     jurisdiction.

Frank Pallone, Jr.,\n     House of Representatives, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Greg Walden,\n     House of Representatives, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Walden and Ranking Member Pallone: I am \n     writing to express my concerns with the Hydropower Regulatory \n     Modernization Act of 2017, H.R. 3043, which would amend the \n     Federal Power Act to modify certain requirements. The \n     Washington Department of Ecology (Ecology) supports the \n     ostensible intent of this bill to gain efficiency in the \n     licensing of hydropower projects. In addition, we support the \n     goal of improving the certainty and timeliness of the \n     hydropower licensing process. However, provisions in H.R. \n     3043 that modify the authorities of the Federal Energy \n     Regulatory Commission (FERC) would impede or invalidate \n     states' independent authority provided by Section 401 of the \n     Clean Water Act (CWA Sec. 401) to establish license \n     conditions that protect water quality.\n       Our residents and tribes harvest salmon from the Puget \n     Sound up through the Columbia River, and our farmers grow \n     hops in the Yakima River basin. They also depend on water as \n     a source of energy to power their homes and communities, and \n     our industries rely on abundant and consistent energy to \n     build aircraft in Everett, power data server farms in Quincy, \n     manufacture car bodies for electric vehicles in Moses Lake, \n     and process apples along the Wenatchee River basin. Balancing \n     the need for clean energy with the need for safe water \n     supplies begins with the proper management of water as a \n     resource, and it is one of the major focal points of this \n     legislation.\n       Decades of federal court decisions interpreting CWA \n     Sec. 401 have established the states' authority to require \n     conditions in FERC licenses that are necessary to protect \n     water quality. These decisions recognize and affirm the basic \n     principle of federalism embodied in the CWA that states have \n     a primary role and responsibility to ensure state water \n     quality standards are met.\n       Ecology implements the state's Water Pollution Control Act \n     (RCW 90.48). As the state water pollution control agency, we \n     are responsible for implementing federal water pollution \n     control laws and regulations, including state water quality \n     certifications required by CWA Sec. 401 for any federal \n     permit or license that result in a discharge to state waters. \n     Ecology has developed durable partnerships with the \n     hydropower industry in Washington State--the largest of any \n     state in the nation--and has a successful record of \n     accomplishment in expediting water quality certifications \n     that are incorporated as FERC license conditions.\n       In an effort to improve H.R. 3043, my team worked for \n     several weeks with two members of the National Hydropower \n     Association along with staff at the Chelan County Public \n     Utility District in Washington State. Our objective in these \n     discussions was to maintain the intent of this legislation \n     while also protecting states' authority provided in the CWA \n     Sec. 401. Although the group did not reach full consensus, \n     significant progress was made to put forth alternative \n     language that would remove ambiguity regarding FERC and state \n     authority. My team identified a number of changes in language \n     that are necessary to protect independent state authority to \n     condition and certify FERC licenses. If provided more time, \n     and engagement directly with your committee, I am confident \n     that all parties can reach a mutually-satisfactory policy.\n       Ecology appreciates Congress' effort to streamline the FERC \n     licensing process, however, the addition of SEC. 34(b)(2) \n     OTHER AGENCIES AND INDIAN TRIBES, would require states' water \n     quality certification process to follow a schedule under the \n     requirements of the FERC, rather than the schedule in CWA \n     Sec. 401. The timelines and independent state authorities \n     granted by CWA Sec. 401 must remain intact, as both are \n     essential for states to issue water quality certifications. \n     States must also retain the ability to practice a ``withdraw \n     and reapply'' process that has proven necessary for some \n     complex hydropower licenses. If FERC is provided authority to \n     oversee and set a timeline different than that provided under \n     CWA Sec. 401, it undermines states' ability to ensure \n     effectiveness and certainty for protection of water quality.\n       Meanwhile, SEC. 34. HYDROPOWER LICENSING AND PROCESS \n     IMPROVEMENTS (b) designates FERC as the lead agency for \n     federal authorizations related to a license application, \n     license amendment, or exemption for a hydropower license.

HYDROPOWER LICENSING AND PROCESS \n     IMPROVEMENTS (d) also requires states to adhere to deadlines \n     established by FERC, effectively reducing the amount of time \n     a state would have to complete scientific studies necessary \n     to determine whether water quality standards and requirements \n     would be met in accordance with CWA Sec. 401. This will \n     likely create pressure on states to utilize existing \n     information (SEC 3 (b)) rather than new studies to make these \n     determinations.\n       In Washington State, work thus far to provide CWA Sec. 401 \n     certifications for licensing of hydropower facilities have \n     been timely, responsive, efficient, and protective of the \n     state's water quality. While additional work remains, durable \n     partnerships and a strong track record form a solid \n     foundation to build upon.\n       In summary, Ecology opposes this bill in its current form \n     because:\n       FERC will have undue influence on the ability of states and \n     tribes to obtain environmental data and information via \n     studies that are necessary to write CWA Sec. 401 \n     certifications to protect waters in their jurisdiction.\n       It would lock state and federal natural resource agencies \n     into a no-win situation. Agencies will be forced to make \n     regulatory decisions based on incomplete applications that \n     lack the necessary technical information, which would put \n     agencies at risk of missing new FERC deadlines resulting in \n     litigation.\n       We believe this bill provides enough ambiguity for \n     individuals to attempt to preempt state CWA Sec. 401 \n     authority. The bill as written could result in legal \n     challenges and protracted litigation on how the extension of \n     FERC's authority conflicts with states' rights to protect \n     water quality and quantity.\n       Finally, Ecology views many elements of this modernization \n     bill as unnecessary. In July 2005, FERC restructured its \n     process and implementing the Integrated Licensing Process \n     (ILP) that effectively streamlined FERC's licensing process. \n     Over the course of 12 years, Washington State has provided \n     water quality certifications for 16 FERC issued licenses as \n     well as 10 license amendments. The ILP has proven to be a \n     predictable, efficient, and timely licensing process that \n     continues to ensure adequate resource protections. This bill \n     would eliminate the flexibility available in the current \n     system and return to a traditional approach that is less \n     responsive to environmental concerns and more susceptible to \n     litigation.\n       We urge that the provisions of H.R. 3043 that would have \n     the effect of curtailing state authority under CWA Sec. 401 \n     be significantly improved or stricken from the bill.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Maia D.

Mr. Chair, I rise today in support of H.R. 3043, the \nHydropower Policy Modernization Act, sponsored by fellow Energy and \nCommerce committee member and our Conference Chair, Cathy McMorris \nRodgers.\n  Hydropower plays an integral role in generating electricity across \nthe nation, especially back in my home state of Oregon. Hydropower \ngenerates nearly 43 percent of electricity in Oregon and this \ndependable baseload power has helped drive the development of \neverything from value-added agriculture processing to data centers, \ncreating jobs along the Columbia River and throughout Oregon.\n  Nationally, hydropower is the largest source of renewable electricity \ngeneration and a recent Department of Energy report found that\n\n\nU.S. hydropower could grow by almost 50 percent by the year 2050. \nHowever, as my colleagues from the Pacific Northwest and across the \ncountry know, we are not taking full advantage of this valuable \nresource. Unfortunately, the duration, complexity, and uncertainty of \nthe licensing process has raised significant challenges, preventing \ninvestments that would create jobs and benefit consumers.\n  Thankfully, my good friend from Washington introduced this \nlegislation to alleviate these problems and streamline the federal \nhydropower licensing process. The bill before us today didn't just \nemerge from thin air. It is the culmination of five committee hearings \nand markups, along with several bipartisan staff meetings with the \nhydropower industry and tribes that have a stake in the licensing \nproceedings.\n  We solicited feedback from all stakeholders as we crafted this \nlegislation and made a number of changes to address the concerns \nraised. We added new provisions to ensure that states and tribes are \nconsulted early in the licensing process to identify and resolve issues \nof concern. We also made sure that state and local governments could \nrecoup the costs of reviewing applications and conducting studies. We \neven added a strong savings clause that clarifies our intent that \nnothing in this bill shall be construed to affect any requirement of \nthe Clean Water Act, Endangered Species Act, and other environmental \nlaws.\n  In recognition of the regular order committee process, H.R. 3043 \nsailed out of committee unanimously by voice vote. The supporters of \nthis bill, especially labor and industry organizations, recognize the \nvital role it will play in supporting job growth, local economic \ndevelopment, and providing much-needed reforms to the licensing \nprocess.\n  H.R. 3043 seeks to modernize the permitting process by improving \nadministrative efficiency, accountability, and transparency; requiring \ntimely decision making; and by designating Federal Energy Regulatory \nCommission as the lead agency is approving permits. You may be asking \nyourself, `why is this process in need of reform?' The answer is \nsimple. As my colleague from Washington likes to point out, it can take \nup to 10 years or longer to license a new hydropower project of \nrelicense an existing facility. Further underscoring the need for this \nlegislation is the fact that by 2030, over 400 existing projects with \nover 18,700 megawatts of capacity will begin the relicensing process.\n  Mr. Chair, this emissions-free energy resource should not be bogged \ndown in bureaucratic red tape any longer. It's past time we modernize \nthis grossly outdated licensing process, so we can get projects to \nmarket faster and streamline those projects in need of relicensing. At \nthe end of the day, this important legislation promotes hydropower \ndevelopment, creates jobs, and provides consumers across the country \nwith continued access to clean, affordable, and reliable baseload power \ngeneration.\n  I include in the Record the Supporters of H.R. 3043:\n\n       The American Council on Renewable Energy (ACORE); (American \n     Public Power Association (APPA); Business Council for \n     Sustainable Energy (BCSE); Edison Electric Institute (EEI), \n     International Brotherhood of Boilermakers (Boilermakers); \n     International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW); \n     International Federation of Professional and Technical \n     Engineers (IFPTE); Large Public Power Council (LPPC); \n     Laborers' International Union of North America (LiUNA); \n     National Electrical Contractors Association (NECA); National \n     Hydropower Association (NHA); National Rural Electric \n     Cooperative Association (NRECA); North America Building \n     Trades Council (NABTU); United Brotherhood of Carpenters and \n     Joiners of America (Carpenters).", "turn": 47, "speaker": "Mr. WALDEN", "itemno": 61}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "R000515", "text": "  Mr. RUSH.

Its passage \n     would end 95 years of balance in hydropower licensing, \n     tipping the scales against taxpayers and in favor of huge \n     utilities.\n       Hydropower licenses are issued for up to 50 years. Many \n     hydropower facilities that are coming up for relicensing now \n     were first constructed before virtually all modern \n     environmental laws were in place. It is during relicensing \n     proceedings that the public gets the opportunity to ensure \n     that dam owners make the necessary changes to comply with \n     modern laws. The opportunity to mitigate for the damage to \n     the environment, while still providing reliable electricity, \n     only arises once in a generation or two.\n       The balance the Federal Power Act currently strikes between \n     power and non-power values has existed for almost a century. \n     Current law protects the public's right to enjoy its rivers, \n     a right which can and should be compatible with responsible \n     electricity production. However, H.R. 3043 upends that \n     balance. Simply put, the bill is a massive giveaway to \n     special interests at the expense of healthy rivers and the \n     fish, wildlife, and people that depend upon them. If H.R. \n     3043 passes, power company profits will go to the head of the \n     line, ahead of every other user.\n       We appreciate that the House Committee on Energy and \n     Commerce heard testimony from recreational and conservation \n     interests who raised serious concerns about its many \n     provisions. Unfortunately, the Committee\n\n\n     chose to make no changes to reflect the constructive \n     suggestions that the Hydropower Reform Coalition put forward \n     that would improve the licensing process while maintaining \n     environmental protections. The Committee also failed to \n     solicit testimony from states, tribes, and federal natural \n     resource agencies whose authorities will be usurped by the \n     Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) if H.R. 3043 is \n     enacted. You are now being asked to vote on a bill that no \n     state, tribe, or conservation organization publicly supports. \n     The bill under consideration today will only benefit power \n     companies at the expense of every other user of a waterway.\n       H.R. 3043 attempts to streamline the hydropower licensing \n     process by centralizing power and allowing FERC to set an \n     aggressive licensing schedule that all federal and state \n     agencies must adhere to throughout the licensing process. \n     There are no requirements that FERC or the licensee provide \n     the agencies with the information they deem necessary to \n     quickly and competently exercise their Clean Water Act or \n     Endangered Species Act authority. This creates a dynamic \n     where, unless every step of the process proceeds seamlessly, \n     agencies are faced with the impossible decision to either \n     exercise their authority without necessary information (which \n     exposes them to legal liability) or to fail to meet the \n     schedule. This change will constrain federal, state, and \n     tribal agencies use of their independent authorities and rush \n     decision making, potentially making it more difficult to \n     protect water quality, recover threatened and endangered \n     species, and manage tribal-trust resources and public lands.\n       Other provisions of H.R. 3043, such as the changes to the \n     Trial Type Hearing process for alternative conditions, the \n     requirement that federal natural resource agencies conduct \n     costly, wasteful and time consuming review of matters outside \n     of their scope of expertise and jurisdiction, and the \n     requirement that scientific decisions be made only by \n     political appointees in Washington, DC are all examples of \n     how H.R. 3043 tilts the balance toward the interests of \n     power companies.\n       In order to protect clean water, irrigation, meeting tribal \n     treaty and trust obligations, wildlife, recreational fishing, \n     commercial fishing, whitewater boating, water quality, \n     municipal water supply, fire safety, flood control, or any \n     other purpose other than generating power, we urge you to \n     vote NO on H.R. 3043.\n           Sincerely,\n       Alabama Rivers Alliance; American Packrafting Association; \n     American Rivers; American Whitewater; Apalachicola \n     Riverkeeper; Appalachian Mountain Club; Atlantic Salmon \n     Federation; California Outdoors; California Sportfishing \n     Protection Alliance; Cascadia Wildlands; Center for \n     Biological Diversity; Center for Environmental Law and \n     Policy; Columbia Bioregional Education Project; Connecticut \n     River Conservancy; Conservatives for Responsible Stewardship; \n     Defenders of Wildlife; Deschutes River Alliance; Downeast \n     Salmon Federation; Earthjustice.\n       Earthworks; Endangered Habitats League; Endangered Species \n     Coalition; Environmental Protection Information Center \n     (EPIC); Foothill Conservancy; Friends of Butte Creek; Friends \n     of the Kinni; Friends of the River; Golden West Women \n     Flyfishers; Grand Riverkeeper Labrador; Green Latinos; High \n     Country Conservation Advocates; Idaho Rivers United; Illinois \n     Council of Trout Unlimited; Klamath Forest Alliance; Kootenai \n     Environmental Alliance; League of Conservation Voters; Lower \n     Columbia Canoe Club; Maine Rivers; Michigan Environmental \n     Council.\n       Michigan Hydro Relicensing Coalition; Mono Lake Committee; \n     Mousam and Kennebunk Rivers Alliance; National Heritage \n     Institute; National Park Conservation Association; National \n     Wildlife Federation; Native Fish Society; Natural Heritage \n     Institute; Natural Resources Defense Council; Naturaland \n     Trust; North Cascades Conservation Council; Northwest \n     Environmental Advocates; Northwest Resource Information \n     Center; Oregon Kayak and Canoe Club; Oregon Natural Desert \n     Association; Pacific Coast Federation of Fishermen's \n     Associations; Pacific Rivers; Penobscot Paddle and Chowder \n     Society; Planning and Conservation League.\n       Prarie Rivers Network; River Network; Riverkeeper Network; \n     Rogue Riverkeeper; Save Our Wild Salmon; Save the Colorado; \n     Selkirk Conservation Alliance; Southern Environmental Law \n     Center; St. Mary's River Watershed Association; The Lands \n     Council; The Mountaineers; The Sierra Club; Tributary \n     Whitewater Tours, LLC; Tuolumne River Trust; Upstate Forever; \n     Washington Environmental Law Center (see Western \n     Environmental Law Center); Washington Wild; WaterWatch of \n     Oregon; Wild Earth Guardians; Wild Earth Guardians; Wild \n     Washington Rivers.", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 63}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                                  ____\n\n                                     National Wildlife Federation,\n\n\n                                     National Advocacy Center,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, November 7, 2017.\n       Dear Representative: The National Wildlife Federation, with \n     over 6 million members and supporters and its affiliate \n     organizations from 51 states and territories across the \n     country, represents a broad diversity of political views, \n     mirroring the nation. Regardless of party affiliation, these \n     members want their families to be safe, their water to be \n     clean, and ecosystems to be healthy in order to support our \n     nation's wildlife. It is important, then, that any large-\n     scale energy project, including hydroelectric, uphold those \n     values as well. While NWF believes that the United States \n     should pursue a renewable energy future, the country should \n     do so while seeking to minimize harm to local ecosystems and \n     wildlife and gather input from those near hydroelectric \n     facility sites. This is especially important as hydropower is \n     not without environmental impacts, including greenhouse gases \n     released from reservoirs associated with dams. In order to \n     weigh all impacts as well as the benefits, proper review \n     processes should be followed and corners cannot be cut. \n     Because of these long-held standards, NWF opposes H.R. 3043, \n     the Hydropower Policy Modernization Act of 2017.\n       The National Wildlife Federation has long supported robust \n     environmental review processes. Federal and state governments \n     should approach projects with a genuine interest in \n     determining negative effects on the environment, wildlife, \n     and local communities. H.R. 3043 includes provisions that \n     place arbitrary deadlines on project reviews, even when it is \n     clear that a proper study will take longer. Unfortunately, \n     this bill would remove our experts in natural resources from \n     the review process and usurp states' rights to enforce their \n     own standards for hydropower projects. Additionally, \n     considerations of energy supply would be required alongside \n     protections for endangered species, fisheries, and cultural \n     sites, contradicting existing laws. If passed into law, H.R. \n     3043 would likely create confusion and litigation. We have \n     seen in the past how large-scale hydroelectric projects have \n     not always considered potential negative effects. We should \n     learn from our past mistakes, not repeat them.\n       While there was a hearing on this bill, only the Federal \n     Energy Regulatory Commission testified, leaving out important \n     voices. Among those voices left out were tribal leaders, \n     states, and local officials who will be required to abide by \n     these new rules. Not only does this legislation limit input \n     from those near proposed hydroelectric projects, but it also \n     does so for those who live near existing dams seeking a \n     permit renewal. This legislation would constrict the review \n     processes for dams approaching their 50-year review mark. It \n     is important to make sure that these projects, which were \n     built before our current rules were put in place, remain up \n     to the standards we set for human safety and minimal impact \n     to the environment, economically important fisheries, and \n     recreation sites.\n       In short, while this bill and its proponents claim to help \n     our nation move toward a more sustainable and climate-\n     friendly future, we need a system in place that can consider \n     our energy needs in addition to the economic, environmental \n     and cultural needs of our communities. Since climate change \n     is the most significant challenge of our time, we urge the \n     committee and supporters of this legislation to have a \n     transparent and robust discussion, not only of our energy \n     needs but also of potential impacts from hydropower such as \n     wildlife and greenhouse gases. For all of these reasons, \n     National Wildlife Federation recommends you oppose H.R. 3043.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                                     Jim Lyon,\n\n                           Vice President for Conservation Policy,\n     National Wildlife Federation.", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 64}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                             Outdoor Alliance,\n\n                                                 November 6, 2017.\n     Re H.R. 3043, Hydropower Policy Modernization Act.\n     Hon. Paul Ryan,\n     Speaker, House of Representatives,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Nancy Pelosi,\n     Minority Leader, House of Representatives,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Speaker Ryan and Minority Leader Pelosi: We are \n     writing to ask you to oppose H.R. 3043, the Hydropower Policy \n     Modernization Act. If enacted, this bill would have \n     significant negative impacts on outdoor recreation and its \n     associated local economic benefits and would remove \n     opportunities for meaningful local public involvement in \n     hydropower licensing.\n       Outdoor Alliance is a coalition of nine member-based \n     organizations representing the human powered outdoor \n     recreation community. The coalition includes Access Fund, \n     American Canoe Association, American Whitewater, \n     International Mountain Bicycling Association, Winter \n     Wildlands Alliance, The Mountaineers, the American Alpine \n     Club, the Mazamas, and Colorado Mountain Club and represents \n     the interests of the millions of Americans who climb, paddle, \n     mountain bike, and backcountry ski and snowshoe on our \n     nation's public lands, waters, and snowscapes.\n       Our members directly participate in licensing processes for \n     hydropower projects in partnership with state and federal \n     resource agencies. The authorities granted to federal \n     agencies under the Federal Power Act, Clean Water Act, and \n     Endangered Species Act have helped ensure that hydropower \n     operations balance our society's need for power with the \n     benefits of flowing rivers. These benefits include important \n     economic contributions generated through the outdoor \n     recreation economy, and outdoor recreation may be one benefit \n     of hydropower under certain circumstances.\n       Outdoor recreation powers a vast economic engine valued at \n     $887 billion annually with much of this activity focused \n     around water-based recreation, including rivers affected by\n\n\n     hydropower operations. The National Hydropower Association's \n     own website, which promotes the benefits of hydropower, \n     states that ``Swimming, boating, fishing, camping, skiing and \n     hiking are just some of the recreational activities that take \n     place year-round and across the country at sites developed \n     and supported by the hydropower industry.''\n       We are concerned that H.R. 3043 will severely limit the \n     ability of local communities to advocate for recreational \n     benefits in hydropower licensing. If passed, H.R. 3043 will \n     shift responsibilities away from states, federal land \n     managers with locally-based recreation staff, and affected \n     communities, and instead place exclusive authority within the \n     hands of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). \n     FERC is a regulatory agency with no local field staff, \n     frequently with only the ability to participate in one or two \n     site visits in all. As a result, FERC staff are unlikely to \n     have experience and familiarity with local resources and \n     values. The end result of H.R. 3043 would be outcomes that \n     are detrimental to outdoor recreation and local communities.\n       While hydropower provides certain benefits, it also always \n     comes with significant impacts. This legislation would upset \n     an important balance and the cooperative approach to \n     hydropower licensing that effectively ensures that the \n     interests of local communities and their interests in outdoor \n     recreation are represented. Outdoor Alliance finds the \n     hydropower provisions of H.R. 3043 to be deeply problematic, \n     and we oppose any effort to diminish the ability of citizens \n     and public resource agencies to ensure that hydropower \n     licenses include provisions to protect the public river \n     resources that are important to them.\n           Best regards,\n\n                                                Louis Geltman,\n\n                                                  Policy Director,\n     Outdoor Alliance.", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 65}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                              TROUT Unlimited,\n\n                                                 November 6, 2017.\n     Re Trout Unlimited opposes the ``Hydropower Policy \n         Modernization Act of 2017'' (H.R. 3043) and we urge \n         members of the House of Representatives to vote against \n         this legislation.\n       Dear Representative: H.R. 3043 is due for House floor \n     consideration this week. We urge you to reject the bill and \n     instead to develop a bill worthy of broad stakeholder \n     support.\n       Hydropower is an essential component of our nation's energy \n     mix. Hydropower produces energy with low hydrocarbon \n     emissions, but can and does cause massive impacts to \n     watershed health and fisheries habitats. Striking a balance \n     between power and nonpower values, such as fisheries habitat, \n     is essential.\n       To that end, the Federal Power Act assigns oversight and \n     conditioning roles for the natural resource agencies to \n     ensure adequate protections or conditions related to project \n     effects on underlying lands, waters and related resources. \n     These authorities, in particular sections 18 and 4e of the \n     Federal Power Act, and section 401 of the Clean Water Act, \n     contain some of the most useful fisheries conservation \n     provisions in state or federal statute and are critical to \n     minimize and mitigate impacts to trout and salmon habitats, \n     covering issues like fish passage, instream flow below the \n     project and water quality and quantity issues.\n       H.R. 3043 would significantly disrupt efforts to balance \n     power and nonpower values in the licensing process and for \n     all the wrong reasons. If the goal of the bill is to make the \n     licensing process more efficient and expeditious, Congress \n     should support the funding and information needs of the \n     resource agencies, not penalize or further constrain their \n     participation. H.R. 3043 instead would hamstring tribes, \n     states, and federal resource agencies from review and \n     conditioning of FERC licensed hydropower projects by imposing \n     overly restrictive timelines, adding new process hurdles for \n     debating agency requirements on applicants, and greatly \n     restricting the scope and basis on which resource agencies \n     can require conditions or investments to protect non-power \n     resources impacted by the project.\n       The harmful bill could not come at a worse time. Dozens of \n     projects coming up for relicensing soon. Many of them haven't \n     been reviewed since being originally licensed 30-50 years \n     ago. It is more imperative now than ever to ensure strong \n     review of these projects.\n       Instead of H.R. 3043 Congress should support smart process \n     improvements that will benefit applicants and operators while \n     supporting strong protections to balance nonpower values. \n     Smart improvements would include support for incremental \n     upgrades, promote ongoing investment and ongoing study during \n     the life of licenses so that we aren't starting from scratch \n     every 30 to 50 years. A smart approach would ensure that the \n     regulatory requirements for states, tribes and federal \n     resource agencies to permit and condition these projects is \n     fully supported early in the process to reduce conflict and \n     delay. H.R. 3043 misses these opportunities, focusing instead \n     placing arbitrary constraints on environmental review and \n     conditioning agency authorities that will result in increased \n     conflict during licensing.\n       As we have said a number of times before, Congress should \n     take adequate time to hear the views of the tribes, as well \n     as the state and federal resource agencies about existing \n     process hurdles and potential solutions before legislating \n     changes to hydropower project licensing procedures and \n     standards. Some in the industry blame delays and cost \n     overruns on agency inaction and bad decisions, yet the \n     committee has so far not called them to testify. If the \n     committee wants to have a thoughtful legislative process, it \n     needs to hear from the agencies who some claim to be the root \n     of the problem. Although the Energy and Commerce committee \n     and its subcommittee on Energy and Power held hearings on \n     this bill and related hydropower legislation, those hearings \n     did not include these constituencies. Again, we urge the \n     committee and the House to take the time to do the \n     deliberative process in the right way, and build broad \n     support for bipartisan legislation.\n       The most balanced and efficient way to bring new hydropower \n     online, is to ensure that the development is well-sited and \n     appropriately mitigated from the start and to support and \n     encourage early and often investment in evaluating and \n     improving operations over time.\n       This bill fails the test of carefully balancing power and \n     non-power values, such as trout and salmon fisheries and \n     river restoration. Specifically, we urge the House to support \n     and defend--and not weaken as this bill does--resource agency \n     authorities and mandates--including the Clean Water Act, \n     Endangered Species Act and Federal Power Act.\n       We urge you to vote against H.R. 3043.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Steve Moyer,\n     Vice President of Government Affairs.", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 66}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                                  ____\n\n                                                 November 7, 2017.\n       Dear Representative: On behalf of our millions of members \n     and supporters nationwide, we are writing to urge you to \n     oppose H.R. 3043, the Hydropower Policy Modernization Act. \n     This bill is a devastating assault on our nation's rivers and \n     the people and wildlife that depend upon them. Its passage \n     would end 95 years of balance in hydropower licensing, \n     tipping the scales against taxpayers and in favor of huge \n     utilities.\n       Hydropower licenses are issued for up to 50 years. Many \n     hydropower facilities that are coming up for relicensing now \n     were first constructed before virtually all modern \n     environmental laws were in place. It is during relicensing \n     proceedings that the public gets the opportunity to ensure \n     that dam owners make the necessary changes to comply with \n     modern laws. The opportunity to mitigate for the damage to \n     the environment, while still providing reliable electricity, \n     only arises once in a generation or two.\n       The balance the Federal Power Act currently strikes between \n     power and non-power values has existed for almost a century. \n     Current law protects the public's right to enjoy its rivers, \n     a right which can and should be compatible with responsible \n     electricity production. However, H.R. 3043 upends that \n     balance. Simply put, the bill is a massive giveaway to \n     special interests at the expense of healthy rivers and the \n     fish, wildlife, and people that depend upon them. If H.R. \n     3043 passes, power company profits will go to the head of the \n     line, ahead of every other user.\n       We appreciate that the House Committee on Energy and \n     Commerce heard testimony from recreational and conservation \n     interests who raised serious concerns about its many \n     provisions. Unfortunately, the Committee chose to make no \n     changes to reflect the constructive suggestions that the \n     Hydropower Reform Coalition put forward that would improve \n     the licensing process while maintaining environmental \n     protections. The Committee also failed to solicit testimony \n     from states, tribes, and federal natural resource agencies \n     whose authorities will be usurped by the Federal Energy \n     Regulatory Commission (FERC) if H.R. 3043 is enacted. You are \n     now being asked to vote on a bill that no state, tribe, or \n     conservation organization publicly supports. The bill under \n     consideration today will only benefit power companies at the \n     expense of every other user of a waterway.\n       H.R. 3043 attempts to streamline the hydropower licensing \n     process by centralizing power and allowing FERC to set an \n     aggressive licensing schedule that all federal and state \n     agencies must adhere to throughout the licensing process. \n     There are no requirements that FERC or the licensee provide \n     the agencies with the information they deem necessary to \n     quickly and competently exercise their Clean Water Act or \n     Endangered Species Act authority. This creates a dynamic \n     where, unless every step of the process proceeds seamlessly, \n     agencies are faced with the impossible decision to either \n     exercise their authority without necessary information (which \n     exposes them to legal liability) or to fail to meet the \n     schedule. This change will constrain federal, state, and \n     tribal agencies use of their independent authorities and rush \n     decision making, potentially making it more difficult to \n     protect water quality, recover threatened and endangered \n     species, and manage tribal-trust resources and public lands.\n       Other provisions of H.R. 3043, such as the changes to the \n     Trial Type Hearing process for alternative conditions, the \n     requirement that federal natural resource agencies conduct \n     costly, wasteful and time consuming review of matters outside \n     of their scope of expertise and jurisdiction, and the \n     requirement that scientific decisions be made only by \n     political appointees in Washington, DC are all examples of \n     how H.R. 3043 tilts the balance toward the interests of power \n     companies.\n       In order to protect clean water, irrigation, meeting tribal \n     treaty and trust obligations, wildlife, recreational fishing, \n     commercial\n\n\n     fishing, whitewater boating, water quality, municipal water \n     supply, fire safety, flood control, or any other purpose \n     other than generating power, we urge you to vote NO on H.R. \n     3043.\n           Sincerely,\n       American Packrafting Association; American Rivers; American \n     Whitewater; Apalachicola Riverkeeper; Appalachian Mountain \n     Club; Atlantic Salmon Federation; California Outdoors; \n     California Sportfishing Protection Alliance; Center for \n     Biological Diversity; Center for Environmental Law and \n     Policy; Connecticut River Conservancy; Conservatives for \n     Responsible Stewardship; Downeast Salmon Federation; \n     Earthjustice; Earthworks; Endangered Habitats League; \n     Endangered Species Coalition; Environmental Protection \n     Information Center (EPIC); Foothill Conservancy; Friends \n     of Butte Creek.\n       Golden West Women Flyfishers; Grand Riverkeeper Labrador; \n     Green Latinos; High Country Conservation Advocates; Idaho \n     Rivers United; Illinois Council of Trout Unlimited; Klamath \n     Forest Alliance; Kootenai Environmental Alliance; League of \n     Conservation Voters; Lower Columbia Canoe Club; Maine Rivers; \n     Michigan Environmental Council; Michigan Hydro Relicensing \n     Coalition; Mono Lake Committee; Mousam and Kennebunk Rivers \n     Alliance; National Heritage Institute; National Park \n     Conservation Association; National Wildlife Federation; \n     Natural Resources Defense Council; Naturaland Trust.\n       North Cascades Conservation Council; Northwest \n     Environmental Advocates; Oregon Kayak and Canoe Club; Pacific \n     Coast Federation of Fishermen's Associations; Penobscot \n     Paddle and Chowder Society; Planning and Conservation League; \n     Prairie Rivers Network; River Alliance of Wisconsin; River \n     Network; Riverkeeper Network; Rogue Riverkeeper; Save Our \n     Wild Salmon; Save the Colorado; Selkirk Conservation \n     Alliance; Southern Environmental Law Center; St. Mary's River \n     Watershed Association; The Lands Council; The Sierra Club; \n     Tributary Whitewater Tours, LLC; Tuolumne River Trust; \n     Upstate Forever; Washington Environmental Law Center (see \n     Western Environmental Law Center); Washington Wild; \n     WaterWatch of Oregon; Wild Washington Rivers.\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 67}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "  The Acting CHAIR.

Mr. Chair, first of all, I would like to thank the \nchair and ranking member for their collaborative effort to bring this \nbill forward.\n  This amendment, which is supported by colleagues on both sides of the \naisle, is pretty simple. It requires Federal decisionmakers in the \nDepartment of the Interior to consider the threat of invasive species \nwhen installing fishways.\n  This was brought to my attention while looking at a dam on the \nWisconsin River in Wisconsin. Below that dam, we had Asian carp, an \ninvasive species, a huge fish. If that fish was able to get further \nnorth on the Wisconsin River, because of a fishway, you could wind up \nwith this invasive species not only in the northern part of the river, \nbut, and quite frankly, in dozens of lakes throughout northern \nWisconsin.\n  As a matter of fact, given where that dam is, if there is even \nflooding, that invasive species could wind up working its way into Lake \nMichigan and up the Saint Lawrence Seaway. It is very important that \nbefore the Department of the Interior listens to certain \nenvironmentalists, they realize that a fishway at this dam would result \nin big trouble.\n  Because of the devastating effects invasive species can have on the \nenvironment, local fish population, and the economy, this amendment \nwill ensure the Federal agencies take into account all consequences \nbefore installing fishways.\n  Mr. Chair, I include in the Record a letter from Alliant Energy.\n\n                                               Alliant Energy,\n\n                                                 November 8, 2017.\n     Hon. Mark Pocan,\n     Member of Congress, House of Representatives, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Glenn Grothman,\n     Member of Congress, House of Representatives, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Representatives Pocan and Grothman: I am writing in \n     strong support of your invasive species amendment to H.R. \n     3043, the Hydropower Modernization Act of 2017, which is due \n     to be considered on the floor of the U.S. House today. \n     Alliant Energy deeply appreciates your commitment to this \n     pro-environment measure, and for protecting Wisconsin's \n     watersheds.\n       As you know, an Alliant subsidiary, Wisconsin Power and \n     Light, owns and operates a dam located in Prairie du Sac, \n     Wisconsin, on the Wisconsin River. The Prairie du Sac dam, \n     now over 100 years old, is responsible for the formation of \n     Lake Wisconsin, which serves as an enormous recreational and \n     wildlife resource for our state.\n       Over a decade ago, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service \n     sought to impose a fishway requirement on the license for the \n     dam, essentially calling for a ``fishway'' to be installed to \n     allow for the upstream migration of native fish. Since that \n     time, however, scientists and state officials have discovered \n     the existence of non-native, invasive fish species (Asian \n     carp) at the base of the dam. If a fishway were now \n     installed, it seems clear that these invasive species would \n     also be able to migrate--and thereby endanger native fish \n     populations upstream, including Lake Wisconsin.\n       Your amendment would ensure that, in this particular case, \n     the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service would be required to \n     consider the threats posed by invasive species before \n     imposing a fishway condition on a hydroelectric license. We \n     believe strongly that such decisions should be predicated on \n     the most up to date information available, and your amendment \n     will help guarantee that invasive species are not permitted \n     to threaten the Lake Wisconsin watershed.\n       Again, thank you for offering your amendment. Please let me \n     know how Alliant may assist you in ushering this much-needed \n     provision into public law.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                                David de Leon,\n\n                             Vice President Operations--Wisconsin,\n                                                   Alliant Energy.\n", "turn": 55, "speaker": "Mr. GROTHMAN", "itemno": 81}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "U000031", "text": "  Mr. UPTON.

It is time we as the \npeople's House move past the reactionary era of addressing the need to \nrepeal and rebuild after natural disasters and start focusing on \nproactive solutions to mitigate potential damage before natural \ndisasters.\n  A proactive spirit should be fully implemented in our regulations and \nhow we invest in infrastructure. If we had invested, over the last few \ndecades, just a small percentage of the people's treasure that we have \ngranted postdisaster as emergency relief appropriations into \npremitigation efforts, such as the cleaning and maintenance of our \nexisting water management systems, both natural and man-made, much of \nthe resulting damage would not have occurred and many fewer American \nfamilies would have suffered.\n  Representative Babin's amendment will allow a procedural tool for the \nFERC to review licenses for any project located in a region declared by \nthe President to be a disaster area, which will allow us to better and \nmore strategically manage our dams, floodgates, and reservoirs when we \nknow storms like Hurricane Harvey are imminent.\n  Mr. Chairman, I thank Congressman Babin for introducing this \namendment, and I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to \nsupport this commonsense solution, as well as the underlying bill.", "turn": 74, "speaker": "Mr. HIGGINS of Louisiana", "itemno": 104}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "R000515", "text": "  Mr. RUSH.

The need \nfor this arises from a project in my district in Summersville, West \nVirginia. There is what is called a run-of-the-river hydroelectric \nproject in Summersville. There is an MOU between the town--the city of \nSummersville--FERC, and the Army Corps of Engineers.\n  The Summersville hydro project was actually licensed by FERC in 1992 \nand constructed in 2001, with the cooperation of the Army Corps of \nEngineers. It provides enough renewable energy to power 22,000 homes. \nIt might be possible to increase hydropower by adjusting the seasonable \npool levels and managing the releases. Even if this is only for just a \nfew days, it could result in a 15 percent increase in power generation \nfor the surrounding community.\n  Unfortunately, I have heard that even to conduct a study requires \nexplicit authorization from Congress.

Frank Pallone,\n     Ranking Member, House Energy and Commerce Committee, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Walden and Ranking Member Pallone: On behalf \n     of the Kalispel Tribe of Indians, we write to once again \n     voice our opposition to H.R. 3043, the Hydropower Policy \n     Modernization Act. As stated by Kalispel Vice Chairman \n     Raymond Pierre during testimony before the House Natural \n     Resources Committee in April, H.R. 3043 goes much too far in \n     trying to address inefficiencies in the federal hydropower \n     licensing process and will create more problems than it \n     resolves. If enacted, H.R. 3043 will allow hydropower \n     operations to undermine the purposes of Indian reservations \n     and destroy with impunity tribal trust resources. We \n     respectfully call on you to oppose this legislation.\n       The Kalispel Tribe resides on a 5,000-acre reservation on \n     the Pend Oreille River in northeast Washington. Our \n     reservation was created to provide our people with a \n     permanent home, including the ability to use our river and \n     its resources like we have since time immemorial. This \n     purpose has been undermined by the construction and operation \n     of the Albeni Falls, Box Canyon, and Boundary hydropower \n     projects on the Pend Oreille River. The Box Canyon Reservoir \n     flooded ten percent of our reservation. In addition, these \n     facilities have combined to transform our free-flowing river \n     into a fragmented system of reservoirs in which native fish \n     struggle to survive while invasive species thrive. Many \n     Kalispel no longer trust or use the river because of its \n     altered ecology.\n       One of the Tribe's highest priorities is limiting any \n     additional loss of reservation lands and remedying the \n     cultural disconnection to the Pend Oreille River. The Federal \n     Power Act (``FPA'') offers the Tribe its most potent tool in \n     achieving these objectives. No other federal statute affords \n     the same degree of protection to the tribal nations whose \n     reservations are occupied by a Federal Energy Regulatory \n     Commission (``FERC'')-licensed hydroelectric project.\n       Section 4 (e) of the FPA authorizes the Secretary of the \n     Interior to develop mandatory conditions for the approval of \n     FERC licenses that impact Indian reservations. In our case, \n     these conditions are the only way to mitigate longstanding \n     and otherwise unaddressed environmental and cultural impacts \n     caused by FERC-licensed projects. The Pend Oreille Basin will \n     be the recipient of significant conservation investments to \n     restore connectivity and other habitat characteristics that \n     make those projects consistent with the purposes of the \n     Kalispel Indian Reservation because of the 4(e) conditions \n     and Section 18 fishway prescriptions in the Box Canyon and \n     Boundary FERC licenses. This conditioning authority also \n     makes it much more difficult for hydroelectric projects to \n     further flood Indian lands, which is a recurring problem \n     across the United States.\n       H.R. 3043 does not improve the federal hydropower licensing \n     process, but instead weakens its protections for impacted \n     tribal nations. H.R. 3043 detrimentally impacts the Section \n     4(e) conditioning regime and undermines its effectiveness in \n     protecting Indian Country. H.R. 3043 would overturn the D.C. \n     Circuit Court of Appeals decisions in Tacoma v. FERC, which \n     held that the Department of the Interior has mandatory \n     authority to develop appropriate conditions to protect Indian \n     reservations under the FPA and that FERC has no authority to \n     reject these conditions because Interior did not meet FERC's \n     truncated schedule. H.R. 3043 would force the Department of \n     the Interior to comply with FERC's schedule. This change will \n     impair the Department of the Interior's ability to fully \n     examine each project and if it misses a deadline, tribal \n     interests will not be considered until the next relicensing, \n     often fifty years later.\n       H.R. 3043 would empower FERC to determine the scope of the \n     environmental review for 4(e) conditions. This change creates \n     a new burden for FERC in an area in which it lacks expertise. \n     It also would require the Department of the Interior to \n     consider the balance of energy production against its trust \n     responsibility to Indian lands. Interior's only interest in \n     the current process is the protection of Indian lands and \n     that should remain its focus--it is not an arm of FERC.\n       Finally, H.R. 3043 would overturn the Supreme Court's \n     decision in Escondido v. FERC, 466 U.S. 765 (1984) by giving \n     FERC the authority to make a determination that a 4(e) \n     condition or fishway prescription is inconsistent with the \n     FPA. This fundamentally changes the FPA and undermines the \n     Department of the Interior's ability to protect Indian lands \n     and tribal resources.\n       The Kalispel Tribe urges the House of Representatives to \n     reject H.R. 3043. The bill elevates hydropower interests at \n     the expense of tribal rights. If this bill is enacted the \n     Kalispel Tribe will suffer so that hydropower licensing may \n     proceed without protecting tribal lands and trust resources.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Glen Nenema,\n                              Chairman, Kalispel Tribe of Indians.\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 144}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                                  ____\n                                         House of Representatives,\n\n\n                             Committee on Energy and Commerce,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 27, 2017.\n     Hon. Greg Walden,\n     Chairman, Committee on Energy and Commerce,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Fred Upton,\n     Chairman, Subcommittee on Energy,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Walden and Chairman Upton: As Members of the \n     Subcommittee on Energy with strong interest in facilitating \n     improvements in hydropower operations, development, and \n     licensing, we write to urge you to schedule another hearing \n     on this critical topic. We believe a hearing with \n     representatives of states, resource agencies, and Native \n     American Tribes is vital to having a full understanding of \n     how the 2005 hydropower license process reforms are working \n     and what changes may be necessary to further improve the \n     licensing and relicensing process to reduce delays and costs \n     for all parties involved.\n       Hydroelectric power provides substantial, virtually carbon-\n     free, baseload energy at low cost to our manufacturing sector \n     and to residential and commercial consumers. It is an \n     important asset that we believe is essential to maintain.\n       At the same time, however, it is clear that while \n     hydroelectric generation is essentially free of air emissions \n     relative to fossil generation, it is not impact-free. Absent \n     mitigation, hydropower has major negative impacts on fish and \n     wildlife populations, water quality and other important \n     physical and cultural resources, particularly if it is poorly \n     operated or sited. In addition, increased demands for water \n     creates significant challenges of water supply management in \n     some regions. All of these competing interests must be \n     balanced in issuing a license. The Federal Power Act (FPA) \n     respects states' authorities to manage water resources \n     according to state laws allocating water rights. And, the FPA \n     authorizes states and federal natural resource agencies to \n     place conditions on hydroelectric licenses to preserve water \n     quality, protect public lands and Native American \n     reservations, and ensure proper fish passage to preserve \n     healthy ecosystems and fisheries.\n       We were very encouraged by the substance and tone of the \n     Subcommittee's March 15, 2017 hearing entitled ``Modernizing \n     Energy Infrastructure: Challenges and Opportunities to \n     Expanding Hydropower Generation.'' The comments and \n     contributions from witnesses and Members on both sides of the \n     aisle were constructive, measured, and thoughtful, leading us \n     to believe that great potential exists to develop legislation \n     to improve the process for licensing hydroelectric generation \n     and pumped storage in this country.\n       However, the hearing provided an incomplete record with \n     regard to the process of hydroelectric licensing. In order to \n     move forward on considering any legislative changes to \n     current law in a knowledgeable manner, the Committee must \n     hear from those who propose the conditions included in \n     licenses: states, federal resource agencies, and Native \n     American Tribes. Each of these entities has a unique role in \n     the licensing process stemming from its equally unique \n     responsibility for overseeing water rights and managing the \n     many demands on a river and its use. Neither power \n     generation, nor any other single use of a river, should \n     dominate the decision making process.\n       We look forward to working with you on this matter and \n     respectfully urge you to hold a second hearing with these \n     witnesses prior to consideration of any legislative proposal. \n     Thank you for your attention and consideration.\n           Sincerely,\n         Frank Pallone, Jr., Ranking Member, Committee on Energy \n           and Commerce; Bobby L.

Paul Ryan,\n     Speaker, House of Representatives, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Nancy Pelosi,\n     Minority Leader, House of Representatives, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Speaker Ryan and Minority Leader Pelosi: We are \n     writing you on behalf of the members of The Association of \n     Clean Water Administrators (ACWA), Environmental Council of \n     States (ECOS), and The Association of State Wetland Managers \n     (ASWM) to express our concern with provisions of H.R. 3043--\n     Hydropower Policy Modernization Act of 2017. If enacted as \n     written, the draft bill would modify Federal Energy \n     Regulatory Commission (FERC) licensing requirements under the \n     Federal Power Act, and may conflict with the states' \n     authority under Section 401 of the Clean Water Act to protect \n     water quality and provide critical input on federal dredge \n     and fill permits to wetlands and other waters under Sec. 404.\n       Under the CWA and a state's own laws and regulations, \n     states are responsible for advancing the attainment of clean \n     and healthy waters. Section 401 of the CWA requires states to \n     certify that projects impacting navigable waters will comply \n     with applicable water quality standards and other state \n     requirements. Additionally, 401 certification is required for \n     federal dredge and fill permits to wetlands and other waters \n     under Section 404. Under this framework, states and \n     permittees have efficiently been able to balance \n     certification of hydropower facilities while ensuring that \n     water quality standards are met initially or through remedial \n     actions. By weakening Sec. 401 authority, H.R. 3043 would \n     harm the ability of the governmental entity with primary \n     responsibility for water quality protection.\n       Additionally, H.R. 3043 places FERC in control of \n     permitting timetables and limits time extensions. This could \n     restrict states' abilities to gather necessary data and \n     scientific studies for permitting, which are crucial to \n     reaching collaborative, science-based conclusions. Rushing \n     scientific studies and data gathering would result in federal \n     agencies making regulatory decisions without sufficient \n     technical information, and may lead to litigation and less \n     effective oversight of hydropower facilities.\n       H.R. 3043 needlessly impairs state authority granted under \n     the CWA, and undermines ``cooperative federalism,'' a core \n     principle of the Act and the Administration's approach to \n     environmental law. The bill will not improve permitting \n     efficiency, and will likely result in water quality standards \n     being even harder to achieve. ACWA, ECOS and ASWM welcome the \n     opportunity to discuss revisions that would better preserve \n     states' rights under CWA Section 401 and ensure the \n     protection of state water resources.

Paul Ryan,\n     Speaker, House of Representatives, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Nancy Pelosi,\n     Minority Leader, House of Representatives, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Speaker Ryan and Minority Leader Pelosi: The State of \n     Maryland (``Maryland'') provides the following comments on \n     the House of Representatives Bill 3043 (H.R. 3043)--\n     Hydropower Policy Modernization Act of 2017. Although \n     Maryland generally welcomes reforms that streamline the \n     Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) licensing \n     process, Maryland strenuously opposes any provisions in H.R. \n     3043 that would have the effect of curtailing State authority \n     under Section 401 of the Clean Water Act to establish license \n     conditions to protect water quality. Several provisions of \n     H.R. 3043 essentially serve to constrain state agencies use \n     of their independent authorities, making it more difficult to \n     protect water quality.\n       States serve an essential role in the FERC hydropower \n     licensing process when they review applications under Section \n     401 of the Clean Water Act in order to determine whether the \n     construction and/or operation of the facility will meet state \n     water quality standards and requirements. These reviews often \n     result in applicants conducting additional scientific studies \n     and states putting in place requirements (conditions) to \n     ensure that State water quality standards and requirement are \n     met. These types of conditions are essential for ensuring \n     that existing and new hydropower projects are built and \n     operated in a manner that is consistent with state and \n     federal environmental laws and are protective of the \n     environment. These conditions then become conditions of the \n     FERC license.\n       H.R. 3043 designates FERC as the lead agency over federal \n     authorizations related to an application for a license, \n     license amendment, or exemption for a hydropower project. \n     This bill requires states to meet deadlines established by \n     FERC in a schedule that FERC develops for the licensing \n     action. Further, this bill places limits on FERC's ability to \n     easily grant extensions to the deadlines. As the lead agency, \n     FERC would establish and control the timeline for the \n     hydropower licensing process and it appears that H.R. 3043 \n     gives FERC the authority to create a schedule that would \n     reduce the amount of time a state would have to get necessary \n     scientific studies completed and to assess whether water \n     quality standards and requirements will be met as required \n     under Section 401 of the Clean Water Act. Further, not only \n     does this legislation likely place pressure on states to \n     complete their water quality reviews more quickly using \n     existing information, it also provides applicants with an \n     entitlement to a trial-type hearing before a FERC \n     Administrative Law Judge whenever there is a dispute of \n     material fact. Moreover, this legislation declares the \n     decision of the FERC Administrative Law Judge to be final and \n     not subject to further administrative review. This allowance \n     for a trial-like hearing\n\n\n     combined with pressure to use existing science and meet \n     strict deadlines together makes it even more challenging for \n     states to protect water quality.\n       Finally, applications for amendments to existing licenses \n     which qualify as a project ``upgrade'' (which is determined \n     by FERC as to whether a proposed amendment qualifies as an \n     upgrade) obtain even more expedited processing by FERC. In \n     these cases, it appears that FERC would be the decision \n     maker, not the state, with regard to whether the desired \n     amendment to project operations would affect water quality.\n       Decades of federal court decisions interpreting Section 401 \n     have established the states' authority to require conditions \n     in FERC licenses necessary to protect water quality. These \n     decisions recognize and affirm the basic principle of \n     federalism embodied in the Clean Water Act that states have \n     the primary role and responsibility to ensure state water \n     quality standards are met.\n       Maryland's interest in protecting water quality is as \n     important and relevant today as ever, particularly now as \n     FERC considers the relicensing of the Conowingo hydroelectric \n     dam on the Susquehanna River in Maryland. The Susquehanna \n     River provides approximately 50 percent of the fresh water to \n     the Chesapeake Bay and is an important driver of the Bay's \n     water quality. A joint study funded by Maryland and the Army \n     Corps of Engineers concluded that the Dam's loss of capacity \n     to trap sediment and associated nitrogen and phosphorus \n     pollution (nutrients) adversely affects the health of the \n     Bay. The precise nature of the Dam's adverse impacts on the \n     health of the Bay and the circumstances under which they \n     occur are currently the subject of additional study. What is \n     clear, however, is that any new FERC license for the Dam will \n     have to contain appropriate conditions to address sediment \n     and associated nutrient transport and ensure that Maryland's \n     water quality standards are maintained. Without appropriate \n     conditions Maryland may not be able to meet its commitment to \n     achieve EPA's Total Maximum Daily Loads (``TMDL'') for the \n     Bay.\n       In impairing the states' primary roles and responsibilities \n     under Section 401 to fashion conditions in FERC licenses, \n     H.R. 3043 relegates the states--the entities with the \n     greatest interest and expertise in protecting state water \n     quality--to bystander or second-class status. Maryland \n     strenuously objects to the provisions in H.R. 3043 that would \n     make it more difficult for Maryland to ensure water quality \n     through the Clean Water Act Section 401 water quality \n     certification process.\n       Maryland's concerns with the legislation's impact on the \n     Conowingo hydroelectric dam relicensing process could be \n     addressed by making clear that nothing in the legislation \n     alters Section 401 of the Clean Water Act with regard to \n     State authority, role, responsibilities, process and \n     timeline. Further, the legislation should clearly indicate \n     that state actions associated with Section 401 requirements, \n     including the assessment of water quality standard \n     achievement and resulting conditions, are not eligible for a \n     trial type hearing by a FERC Administrative Law Judge for \n     purposes of resolving disputes of material fact. Maryland \n     urges that the provisions of H.R. 3043 that would have the \n     effect of curtailing State authority under Section 401 of the \n     Clean Water Act be stricken from the bill.\n       We thank you for your time and attention to this matter.\n           Respectfully,\n     Ben Grumbles,\n       Secretary, Maryland Department of the Environment.\n     Mark Belton,\n       Secretary, Maryland Department of Natural Resources.\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 147}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "R000515", "text": "  Mr. RUSH.

We all support hydropower, but the process for how we license \nthese projects is far too important for us to get it wrong.\n  While many Members on the minority side have objections to the \nunderlying bill, H.R. 3043, due to its negative impact on States' \nrights and States' prerogatives under the Clean Water Act, my \nsubstitute amendment addresses these issues in a more responsible way.\n  Mr. Chairman, H.R. 3043 will not modernize or improve the hydropower \nlicensing process, but, rather, it simply places private profits for \nindustry over the public interest.\n  Mr. Chairman, we certainly need a more balanced approach, such as the \none provided in my substitute amendment, which contains bipartisan \nprovisions that were included in the hydropower package that both sides \nagreed to in a fit of bipartisanship last December in committee.\n  Mr. Chairman, my amendment contains several provisions to improve the \nlicensing process while also offering incentives to the hydropower \nindustry.\n  This substitute contains a requirement to set up a new licensing \nprocess, but, unlike H.R. 3043, it protects the rights of Federal \nresource agencies, States, and Indian Tribes to impose conditions in \naccordance with modern environmental laws.\n  My substitute also amends the definition of renewable energy to \ninclude all hydropower, just as H.R. 3043 does; however, it expands the \ngoals for Federal purchasing of renewable power beyond the 15 percent \nincluded in H.R. 3043 as an objective, not a mandate.\n  Mr. Chairman, my amendment also contains a ``reward for early \naction'' provision that authorizes FERC to take into account a \nlicensee's investments made over the course of their license in order \nto improve the efficiency or environmental performance of their \nhydropower facility when setting the term of their new license.\n  Mr. Chairman, in testimony before the Energy and Commerce Committee, \nwe heard, repeatedly, that a major cause for licensing delays was due \nto incomplete applications that do not include all the pertinent \ninformation necessary to issue a decision.\n  While H.R. 3043 does nothing to address this issue, my substitute \ndoes so by directing FERC and other Federal resource agencies to \nconvene a negotiating rulemaking with all the stakeholders to develop a \nprocess in which a completed license application will be evaluated and \nissued or denied within a period of not more than 3 years.\n\n\n  Mr. Chairman, my amendment preserves States' and Tribal authorities \nby directing FERC and the Secretary of the Interior to issue guidance \non best practices for engagement with Indian Tribes in the hydropower \nlicensing process.\n  Mr. Chairman, we cannot allow industry profits to supersede the \ninterests of Native Tribes, States, and other important stakeholders.\n  Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.", "turn": 96, "speaker": "Mr. RUSH", "itemno": 148}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "U000031", "text": "  Mr. UPTON.
