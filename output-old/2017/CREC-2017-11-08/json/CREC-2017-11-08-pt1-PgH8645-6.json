Mr. Speaker, I rise tonight to recognize and thank our \nveterans. We will all be doing that this coming Saturday on Veterans \nDay. They sacrificed so much and we are so glad to have them here to be \nable to celebrate and thank them.\n  I recommend that everybody please take part in the events that you \nhave in your community. Go to the parades, go to the barbecues, and \ntake a minute to thank a veteran.\n  Things we can do around here as legislators are like we did this week \nwith several pieces of legislation, helping veterans with VA so that \nthey would have more access for telemedicine, which makes technology \nmore available and provides better doctors for diagnosing veterans and \ngiving them what they need.\n\n\n  The VICTOR Act considers the travel veterans have to take to go for \ntransplants. Wouldn't it be better for them to be closer to home \ninstead of traveling long distances so they and their families can get \nthe care they need and have the access they need locally?\n  Lastly, I will mention the Veterans Crisis Line Study Act. When a \nveteran is in crisis, when a veteran is contemplating suicide, as \nhappens so much these days--20, 22 veterans per day giving up--we need \nto have the Veterans Crisis Line Study Act in place to better modify \nthe crisis line to be effective for them; so that there is someone \nthere so they can have immediate help to get through that time.\n  These are some of the things we can do for veterans as we wish them a \nhappy Veterans Day and thank them for their service. God bless them.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. LaMALFA", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 3}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "182", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H8645-H8646", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "8", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "THANKING OUR VETERANS", "id": "CREC-2017-11-08-pt1-PgH8645-6", "title": null}
