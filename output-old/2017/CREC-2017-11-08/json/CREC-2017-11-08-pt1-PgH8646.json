Mr. Speaker, they are at it again. Corporate lobbyists \nand billionaires are spending whatever it takes to get their way in \nthis town and avoid paying their fair share in taxes. Meanwhile, \nworking people who play by the rules are getting crushed by healthcare \ncosts, childcare expenses, housing payments, and student loan debt.\n  What is the Republican solution for this problem?\n  A $1.5 trillion tax cut for millionaires and billionaires, and a tax \nincrease for tens of millions of hardworking families.\n  This bill is a scam. Republicans are throwing a wealthy five-star \nbanquet for the wealthy and well connected, and saving a few crumbs \nthat fall from the table for the hardworking middle class.\n  Democrats know that American people deserve a better deal. That is \nwhy we are fighting to build an economy that ensures better jobs, \nbetter wages, and a better future; create 10 million new full-time, \ngood-paying jobs; invest in rebuilding our crumbling roads, bridges, \nand schools; lower costs for everything from prescription drugs to \nchildcare; and break up corporate monopolies that are raising costs and \nreducing choices for working families.\n  Republicans might be fine with the status quo that benefits the \nwealthy and powerful special interests. We know the American people \ndeserve better--better jobs, better wages--for a better future.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. CICILLINE", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "182", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H8646", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "8", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "AMERICAN PEOPLE DESERVE A BETTER DEAL", "id": "CREC-2017-11-08-pt1-PgH8646", "title": "AMERICAN PEOPLE DESERVE A BETTER DEAL"}
