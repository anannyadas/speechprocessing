Mr. Speaker, today I rise in memory of \nMississippi Army National Guard Specialist (SPC) James Anderson Chance, \nIII, who paid the ultimate sacrifice while defending our nation on \nNovember 6, 2003, during Operation Iraqi Freedom. SPC Chance was killed \nwhen his vehicle struck a landmine in Husaybah, Iraq. SPC Chance was \nassigned to C Company, 890th Engineer Battalion, Army National Guard, \nbased in Columbia, Mississippi.\n  According to the Associated Press, SPC Chance volunteered to lead his \nconvoy. He did not want his comrades to risk their lives if they had \nspouses or children. SPC Chance, a Kokomo, Mississippi native, was \nclose to his parents, James and Patricia Ann Chance. Allen Chance, SPC \nChance's brother, said he always lived close to his parents so he could \nlook after them. ``He was worried and he was trying to get it where he \ncould come home for a few days to see her,'' Allen said. Mrs. Chance \nrecently said her son was a good man who always made her laugh.\n  SPC Chance was remembered in a post on a memorial website. ``SPC \nChance, a true soldier, never complained, and moved out at a moment's \nnotice,'' First Lieutenant (lLT) Robert Enochs of Saucier, Mississippi \nwrote. ``Thanks for your love, dedication, and sacrifice for our \ncountry. I wish there were many more like you. We love and miss you \ndearly. We will never forget you.''\n  SPC Chance joined the U.S. Army in 1997 after he graduated from \nKokomo High School. He served one tour of duty in the Army. In 2002, he \njoined the Mississippi Army National Guard to pursue higher education \nopportunities.\n  A memorial service was held for SPC Chance at the Kokomo United \nMethodist Church which is located across the street from his childhood \nhome. He was laid to rest at the Kokomo Community Cemetery.\n  SPC Chance is survived by his mother, Patricia Ann Chance; his \nbrother, John Allen Chance; and his nephew, Samuel Chance.\n  SPC Chance will always be remembered for the sacrifice he made to \nprotect America. He made his family and our nation proud.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. KELLY of Mississippi", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 3}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "182", "extension": true, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "E1536", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "8", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "RECOGNIZING THE LIFE OF FALLEN MISSISSIPPI ARMY NATIONAL GUARD SPECIALIST (SPC) JAMES ANDERSON CHANCE, III", "id": "CREC-2017-11-08-pt1-PgE1536", "title": "RECOGNIZING THE LIFE OF FALLEN MISSISSIPPI ARMY NATIONAL GUARD  SPECIALIST (SPC) JAMES ANDERSON CHANCE, III"}
