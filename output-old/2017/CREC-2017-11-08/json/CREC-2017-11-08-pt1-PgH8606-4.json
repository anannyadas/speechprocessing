Mr. Speaker, this coming Saturday marks Veterans Day, a \nday on which we honor and cherish heroes like Lewis Villa from Hopewell \nTownship, Pennsylvania.\n  Nearly seven decades ago, Mr. Villa, a graduate of Aliquippa High \nSchool, followed in the footsteps of his two older brothers by \nenlisting in the Army. He joined the 456th Airborne Field Artillery \nBattalion of the 82nd Airborne and eventually became an Army Ranger \nassigned to 1st Company, 1st Platoon, 1st Squad of the Airborne \nRangers.\n  He deployed in 1950 to Japan, and then Korea, where he was captured \nby communist Chinese forces and spent 28 months in a prisoner of war \ncamp.\n  After returning home, Villa became a mailman, where he met his \nbeloved late wife, Helana, and had two children.\n  Lewis Villa is a treasure of the Aliquippa community, and he rarely \nfails to land a joke, and always lights up a room with laughter. I \nwould like to extend my sincerest gratitude to him as well as to all \nour veterans.\n  Happy Veterans Day, and may God bless them and their families.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. ROTHFUS", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "182", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H8606", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "8", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "HONORING THE SERVICE OF LEWIS VILLA", "id": "CREC-2017-11-08-pt1-PgH8606-4", "title": "HONORING THE SERVICE OF LEWIS VILLA"}
