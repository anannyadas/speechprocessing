Mr. Speaker, November 9 marks the 79th anniversary \nof Kristallnacht. Referred to as the ``Night of Broken Glass,'' the \nGerman high command issued orders to target Jews because of their \nfaith.\n  Disguised as normal citizens, members of the SS and the Gestapo \ndestroyed hundreds of synagogues, looted and vandalized thousands of \nbusinesses, arrested tens of thousands of innocent civilians, and \nkilled nearly 100. This atrocity was a harbinger of one of history's \ndarkest periods, the Holocaust.\n  The anniversary of this grave tragedy serves as a constant reminder \nof what happens when hatred and bigotry flood the minds of our world. \nWhen evil is met with silence and indifference, all of mankind suffers.\n  Unfortunately, the world has not learned a lesson from the past. \nAnti-Semitism has seen a troubling rise across the globe, and we must \ncontinue our fight toward ending this brutal chapter of intolerance.\n  Mr. Speaker, November 9 serves as a reminder of this tragedy, but \nalso as an opportunity to fight this hatred and all forms of hatred, \nand vow to never let such an atrocity to ever occur again.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "182", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H8607-H8608", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "8", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "79TH ANNIVERSARY OF KRISTALLNACHT", "id": "CREC-2017-11-08-pt1-PgH8607-7", "title": null}
