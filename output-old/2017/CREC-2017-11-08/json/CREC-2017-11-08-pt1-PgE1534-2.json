Mr. Speaker, today I rise in memory of Army \nStaff Sergeant (SSG) Brian Lee Freeman who paid the ultimate sacrifice \nwhile defending our great nation on November 7, 2005, during Operation \nIraqi Freedom. SSG Freeman was killed when a vehicle-borne improvised \nexplosive device detonated near his dismounted patrol in Baghdad. Also \nkilled were First Lieutenant (1LT) Justin S. Smith, Specialist (SPC) \nRobert C. Pope, II, and Private First Class (PFC) Marion A. Reyes. SSG \nFreeman was assigned to the 3rd Squadron, 3rd Armored Cavalry Regiment, \nFort Carson, Colorado.\n  SSG Freeman, a Caledonia, Mississippi native, enlisted in the U.S. \nArmy in 1997. Pat Freeman, SSG Freeman's mother, said her son was \nmarried to his wife, Leah for 14 months. According to the Associated \nPress, Mrs. Freeman said prayers from family and friends helped them \nthrough a difficult time. ``The Army has been very kind to us and \nhelped us through this bad time in our lives,'' she said. ``We know \nBrian is in a better place and we will see him again someday. We call \nhim our angel now.''\n  A scholarship was established in his memory of SSG Freeman at \nCaledonia High School. Twelve scholarships have been awarded over the \nyears. Bill Lawrence, the former mayor of Caledonia, recently said that \nSSG Freeman's late father, Glen Freeman, worked hard to build support \nfor the development of the Veterans Memorial, located at the Ola J. \nPickett Park. The family also donated an American flag and flagpole to \nthe facility. The memorial includes two battle crosses--one for SSG \nFreeman and one for Staff Sergeant (SSG) Jeffrey Dayton, a Caledonia \nHigh School graduate who was killed in Iraq in 2004.\n  At the time of his son's death, Mr. Freeman told the Associated Press \nthat SSG Freeman meant everything to the family. ``This boy was a hero. \nOur son was everything to us. People don't realize what it is to lose a \nchild,'' he stated. Mrs. Freeman said SSG Freeman demonstrated bravery \nand courage as a soldier. She said her son saved the life of their \nunit's medic who he talked out of riding with them in the Humvee on the \nday of the incident. SSG Freeman told the medic that he may be needed \nif something happened to them.\n  The funeral for SSG Freeman was held at the Lowndes Funeral Home in \nColumbus. SSG Freeman was laid to rest at Rowan Cemetery in Caledonia, \nMississippi.\n  SSG Freeman is survived by his mother, Pat Freeman; his wife, Leah; \nher son, Bradley Thomas; his sister, Lisa Nichols; his uncle, Rick \nMerryman; his aunt, Karen Merryman; his brother-in-law, Ronnie \nChristian; and his sister-in-law, Linda Christian.\n  SSG Freeman's service and sacrifice to protect America will not be \nforgotten.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. KELLY of Mississippi", "itemno": 3}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 4}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "182", "extension": true, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "E1534", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "8", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "RECOGNIZING THE LIFE OF FALLEN MISSISSIPPI SOLDIER ARMY STAFF SERGEANT (SSG) BRIAN LEE FREEMAN", "id": "CREC-2017-11-08-pt1-PgE1534-2", "title": null}
