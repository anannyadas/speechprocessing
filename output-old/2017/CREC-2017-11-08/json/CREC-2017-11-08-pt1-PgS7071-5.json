We are moving forward \non legislative priorities that will benefit hard-working families \nthroughout the country. We are also continuing to confirm President \nTrump's nominees throughout the Federal Government.\n  Last week, we continued our momentum with the confirmation of well-\nqualified and talented individuals to serve in the Federal judiciary. \nThis week, the Senate is considering multiple nominations to important \nagencies. Yesterday, we confirmed officials to the Department of \nDefense and to the Department of Justice. Soon, they will get to work \nfor the American people.\n  Next, the Senate will vote to confirm Peter Robb as the general \ncounsel of the National Labor Relations Board. As I said yesterday, Mr. \nRobb's experience in employment law will help return the NLRB to its \nrole as an impartial arbiter of labor disputes instead of a political \ncudgel for union bosses and leftwing special interests, as it was under \nthe Obama administration.\n  We will then turn to another qualified individual who will help undo \nsome of the damage of the Obama administration. William Wehrum, \nPresident Trump's nominee to be the Assistant Administrator for EPA's \nOffice of Air and Radiation, will put his experience to good use for \nour Nation.\n  The Office of Air and Radiation is one of the most important parts of \nthe EPA. Unfortunately, under the previous administration, it was also \none of the offices with the most significant overreach. This one office \nwas responsible for 95 percent of the annual regulatory burdens that \nthe EPA forced onto our economy, according to one report, reportedly \ncosting the economy at least $41 billion--this one Agency.\n  So this is an office in desperate need of new leadership from an \nindividual who understands how to implement clean air policies in a \nbalanced way rather than with extreme regulatory overreach. Mr. Wehrum \nis the right person for the job. With more than three decades of \nexperience in environmental policy, he understands the issues before \nthe EPA and how to address them. He even worked in this particular \noffice before serving as Acting Administrator from 2005 to 2007.\n  Mr. Wehrum has earned support from many different corners. His former \nboss at the EPA, Jeff Holmstead, said that ``there is no better \nperson'' to fill this position. The EPA's Deputy Administrator from \n2005 to 2009, Marcus Peacock, said that ``Wehrum's understanding of the \nClean Air Act may be second to none.'' Even the Natural Resources \nDefense Council--not exactly a rightwing organization--had this to say \nabout this nominee's previous experience at the EPA, noting that he \n``achieve[d] important air pollution reductions.''\n  ``Wehrum, Holmstead, and the Bush EPA,'' the NRDC further wrote, \n``deserve credit for these substantial public health and air quality \nachievements.''\n  Nominees like Mr. Wehrum will continue the work of this EPA to undo \nthe damage of the Obama administration's overreach in a reasonable \nmanner. For instance, Obama's Office of Air and Radiation was \nresponsible for the administration's dubious energy regulatory scheme, \nwhich threatened to punish coal families and ship middle-class jobs \noverseas.\n  When Administrator Scott Pruitt came to Kentucky last month, he \nannounced the official withdrawal of that rule. Unlike the previous \nleadership of the EPA, Administrator Pruitt actually cared enough to \ncome to my home State and hear directly from the men and women impacted \nby the Agency's regulations. He is someone who will work with us to \nprotect our environment and save Kentucky families from harmful \nregulations. Mr. Wehrum will work with Administrator Pruitt to help \ncontinue this trend at the EPA. I look forward to the Senate advancing \nhis nomination.\n\n\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. McCONNELL", "itemno": 0}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 1}], "header": {"chamber": "Senate", "num": "182", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "S7071-S7072", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "8", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "NOMINATIONS", "id": "CREC-2017-11-08-pt1-PgS7071-5", "title": "NOMINATIONS"}
