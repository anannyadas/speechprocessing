Mr. President, today I wish to celebrate the \nUnion League Club of Chicago ULCC, and their Salute to Vietnam Veterans \nevent.\n  As a Nation, we must do everything we can to uphold our commitment to \nthose who have worn the uniform of this great Nation and to their \nfamilies who have made significant sacrifices on our behalf. On \nVeterans Day we honor the service of our Nation's heroes and reflect on \nthe debt that we each owe to those who have served this great Nation.\n  Founded during the Civil War, ULCC has been a leader in providing \nsupport for servicemembers and veterans for over 138 years. ULCC, an \nofficial DoD Commemorative Partner, operates its own American Legion \nPosts and collaborates with partner groups that provide support to \nActive-Duty military personnel. ULCC recognizes that, while \nservicemembers may come from different backgrounds and different \nbranches, they all hold the same sense of duty and commitment and \ndeserve our full support.\n  As the daughter of a U.S. marine who fought in Vietnam, our Vietnam \nveterans hold a special place in my heart. I often say that we must \nalways love the warrior regardless of our feelings about the war. Let \nus recommit our obligation to Vietnam veterans by ensuring that they \nhave the healthcare, disability support, retirement benefits, and any \nother resources they have earned.\n  To all of my fellow veterans, to those still serving, and to all the \nfamilies that have sacrificed, thank you from the bottom of my heart \nfor your honorable service.\n  Thank you.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Ms. DUCKWORTH", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 3}], "header": {"chamber": "Senate", "num": "182", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "S7107", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "8", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS", "id": "CREC-2017-11-08-pt1-PgS7107-3", "title": "ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS"}
