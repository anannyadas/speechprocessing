{"content": [{"text": "   Ms. HASSAN. Mr. President, it is with great sadness today \nthat I recognize the life and passing of Gary Wayne Smiledge, 72, of \nGonic, NH.\n  Mr. Smiledge served bravely in the U.S. Army during the Korean war. \nAs a member of the 2nd Infantry Division, stationed at Camp Casey south \nof the DMZ, Mr. Smiledge protected orphanages after serving on the \nfrontlines.\n  When Mr. Smiledge returned to New Hampshire, his service to his \nfellow veterans continued. In addition to being a member of the \nAmerican Legion Post No. 7 of Rochester, he was also heavily involved \nwith the New Hampshire Amputee Group, where he worked with other \nveterans who lost limbs during the course of their service.\n  Mr. Smiledge was a beloved member of his community, and he will be \nmissed dearly. I join all Granite Staters in expressing our profound \ngratitude to veterans like Gary who have fought for the cause of \nfreedom, putting their country and devotion to duty first.\n", "kind": "Unknown", "speaker": "Unknown", "itemno": 0, "turn": -1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 1}], "header": {"chamber": "Senate", "num": "182", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "S7107", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "8", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "REMEMBERING GARY SMILEDGE", "id": "CREC-2017-11-08-pt1-PgS7107-4", "title": "REMEMBERING GARY SMILEDGE"}
