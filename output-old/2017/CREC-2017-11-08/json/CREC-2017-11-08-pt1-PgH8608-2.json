Mr. Speaker, I rise today to oppose the Republican tax \nplan, a tax plan that is of, by, and for the wealthy and well \nconnected.\n  How do we know this?\n  Yesterday, a Republican Congressman told a Capitol Hill reporter: \n``My donors are basically saying, `Get it done or don't ever call me \nagain.' ''\n  There you have it, a window into the true motivation for this bill. \nIt is a massive giveaway to the big donor class. It slashes the \ncorporate tax rate, guts the estate tax to benefit millionaires and \nbillionaires, and creates a new loophole so the superwealthy can \ndisguise their income.\n  What is worse, this Republican tax bill would be devastating for \nmillions of middle- and lower-income Americans. It attacks the State \nand local tax deduction and the mortgage interest deduction. It \neliminates tax deductions for medical expenses and student debt. It \nincreases the deficit by approximately $1.5 trillion.\n  Mr. Speaker, Americans deserve a better deal.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. SARBANES", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "182", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H8608", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "8", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "AMERICANS DESERVE A BETTER TAX DEAL", "id": "CREC-2017-11-08-pt1-PgH8608-2", "title": "AMERICANS DESERVE A BETTER TAX DEAL"}
