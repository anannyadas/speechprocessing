Mr. Speaker, I rise today to ask and highlight which \nAmericans will see their taxes go up every April 15 under the \nRepublican tax scam. Middle class families, teachers, firefighters, \nnurses, veterans, folks paying off student loans, seniors with medical \nexpenses, small businesses, and every homeowner will pay more in taxes. \nOver 50 million Americans will see their taxes go up every April 15.\n  Both students and teachers are hurt by this tax scam. This tax scam \nwill make it harder for teachers to afford supplies for their \nclassrooms. The Republican tax scam eliminates medical expense \ndeductions. The adoption tax credit goes away. Student loan deductions, \ngone. State and local tax deductions for homeowners, forget about it. \nThis tax scam is just wrong.\n  Mr. Speaker, it hurts hardworking American families and it benefits \nthe largest corporations.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. CARDENAS", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "182", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H8608", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "8", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "TAXES WILL GO UP EVERY APRIL 15", "id": "CREC-2017-11-08-pt1-PgH8608-4", "title": "TAXES WILL GO UP EVERY APRIL 15"}
