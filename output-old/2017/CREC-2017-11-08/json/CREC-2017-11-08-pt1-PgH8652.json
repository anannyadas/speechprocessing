Madam Speaker, I rise today as the vice \nchair of the House Agriculture Committee and chair of the House \nAgriculture Nutrition Subcommittee.\n  We are currently working on a farm bill, and the farm bill has \nlegislative policy that really has multiple purposes. One is to make \nsure that Americans have food security, they have access to affordable, \nhigh-quality, and safe food. Also, though, it is just as much about \nmaking sure that we have a vibrant, rural economy, Madam Speaker.\n  Within the farm bill, there is the nutrition title. Tonight, I want \nto spend some time talking about the nutrition title and the importance \nof that nutrition title. Obviously, nutrition matters. We know the \nhealth benefits from getting access to nutritional food.\n  Madam Speaker, there is kind of a value I grew up with growing up in \na rural community. Madam Speaker, I say that one of the worst parts \nabout growing up in a small, rural community is, quite frankly, \neverybody knew your business. If you did something wrong, before you \ngot home, Mom and Dad probably already heard about it. Now, I have to \nsay that was the worst part.\n  The best part about growing up in a rural community is that everybody \nknew your business. And when a family had a need, whether there was a \ncrisis of any type, an emergency, neighbors stepped forward. Neighbors \nhelped neighbors. They stepped forward, whether it was support, love, \nfinancial support, food, physical assistance, whatever that might be.\n  And, for me, that principle, that value of neighbor helping neighbor \nis really what the nutrition title of the farm bill is all about. And \nthe most appropriate place for the nutrition title and our nutrition \nprograms is in the farm bill because, after all, there is not a calorie \nthat is consumed within the nutrition programs that is not raised by a \nfarm family someplace.\n  So this evening, we really want to take some time and zero in on what \nwe call D-SNAP within the nutrition title. SNAP stands for the \nSupplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, Madam Speaker.\n  At one time, it was called food stamps. That was many years ago. That \nstill gets tossed around. But it is really the SNAP benefits today. It \nis supplemental. It is assistance that comes after an individual or a \nfamily, whatever resources they put towards their own foods needs. \nObviously, it is what their family can assist them with and it is what \ntheir community can assist them with, whether that is their church or \nanother civic organization or, perhaps, a food bank.\n  We also have nutritional programs called TEFAP that provide food and \nfood commodities to our food banks as well. That can be the subject of \nanother evening to talk about.\n  Tonight, we want to talk about D-SNAP. Those are specific benefits \nthat come at times of disaster.\n  We know that our country has been really overwhelmed with disasters. \nWe have seen, obviously, hurricanes in the Texas and Louisiana area. We \nhave seen hurricanes in the Florida and Georgia area. We have seen \nmultiple hurricanes in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. We have seen \nwildfires that have taken homes and lives, dramatic wildfires, intense \nwildfires, burning entire neighborhoods and communities in both \nCalifornia and Oregon, specifically.\n  So, this evening, I want to spend a little bit of time talking about \nthose D-SNAP disaster programs. I am very proud about the programs that \nare authorized through the House Agriculture Committee, through the \nfarm bill, through our work.\n  We are working on a farm bill right now. This next one expires in \nOctober of next year, 2018. But because of the rural economy, we feel \nit is very important that we do that ahead of time, and we are hoping \nto accomplish that soon, in the months to come. We will see how that \nworks out.\n  We have got a lot of work to continue to do on it, but that is our \ngoal. The rural farm economy, farm income, has been down by 50 percent \nfor a number of years, so this would be a really positive thing for \nrural America to be able to accomplish this farm bill.\n  So tonight we want to talk a little bit about, specifically, food \nassistance for disaster relief, otherwise referred to as D-SNAP.\n\n  Madam Speaker, there is nothing more important than providing food\n\n\nwhen people find themselves suddenly and often critically in need \nfollowing a storm, an earthquake, a flood, obviously, a hurricane, a \nwildfire, or any other disaster emergency. It is hard enough if you \nhave lost your home or you have lost your place of employment. You \nshouldn't need to worry about where your next warm meal is coming from. \nThat is what our D-SNAP, or our food assistance for disaster relief, \ndoes.\n  I am very proud, as I started to say, of the Agriculture Committee \nand our role within oversight authorizing these programs. But I am also \nvery appreciative of the very dedicated individuals who work at the \nUnited States Department of Agriculture and, specifically, the Food and \nNutrition Service, referred to as FNS, under the leadership of the \nSecretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue.\n  Over the past several months, we have had a number of natural \ndisasters that everyone is well aware of. They have devastated parts of \nour Nation, from Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria to the wildfires on \nthe West Coast. USDA's Food and Nutrition Service, FNS, has worked \ndiligently to ensure that those impacted by these disasters have enough \nto eat.\n\n\n  Now, working in close coordination with the Federal Emergency \nManagement Agency, or FEMA; our State partners; and volunteer \norganizations, FNS has not only ensured that individuals participating \nin our regular nutrition assistance programs continue to receive the \nnourishment that they need, but also that other populations affected by \nthe disaster have access to the food.\n  Madam Speaker, under the authority that is provided through the farm \nbill, and specifically section 301 of the Robert T. Stafford Disaster \nRelief and Emergency Assistance Act, through USDA, we are able to \nprovide administrative flexibilities, including waivers for program \nrequirements in cases of Federal major disaster declarations, which we \nhave seen so many of those in the past few months.\n  We were able to provide technical assistance to State leaders in \nimpacted areas to assist them to determine what flexibilities or \nwaivers are best suited for the stage of the disaster at hand. Requests \nfor waivers and flexibilities are submitted to FNS by State agencies. \nThat is where the need is determined by when those declarations are \nmade. For example, waivers for school meal program operations are \nrequested by the State department that oversees the school meal \nprogram. And waivers from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance \nProgram, or SNAP, as we have talked about, are requested by the SNAP \nState agency.\n  So these flexibilities and waivers in food aid programs are provided \nat different stages in the disaster.\n  In just a little bit, we are going to talk about some of the \ndifferent disasters we have faced in the States and how these programs \nthat are made available through our work in the Agriculture Committee \nhave really been there to serve our neighbors in need.\n  When a disaster is anticipated, an FNS best practice is to work with \nthe State agencies and potentially impacted areas to determine what \nflexibilities are most needed.\n  Madam Speaker, some of these waivers and flexibilities, they range \nfrom early issuance of SNAP benefits; to SNAP automatic mass \nreplacement; and extension of time to report food loss, food loss that \nwas purchased with SNAP benefits, food that was supplemental to assist \nfamilies and individuals in need; a SNAP hot foods waiver.\n  Normally, the food under the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance \nProgram that is purchased, taken home, is nutritional food and prepared \nto be able to serve, and normally hot food purchase is not allowed.\n  When people have lost their homes, when they have lost those types of \ncritical assets, and in the middle of that, being able to have that \nwaiver to be able to go to where there is food that has been cooked, \nwhether it is a convenience store, whether it is a fast food \nrestaurant, although normally not a place that is approved for SNAP \nbenefits, we recognize that may be the only warm food available, given \nwhen you are in the middle or immediately following a disaster, and so \nthose waivers are provided.\n  Special Supplemental Nutrition Programs for Women, Infants, and \nChildren, or the WIC program. FNS has the ability to grant \nflexibilities and substitutions in WIC to disaster-stricken States on \nitems such as fluid milk, bread, juice, cheese, eggs, basic staples, \nfor example, when regional demand and the supply chain disruptions are \npresent.\n  Child nutrition programs. FNS allows for a number of flexibilities \nduring disasters, such as allowing disaster-affected schools and \ninstitutions to provide meals to all children at no cost and to be \nreimbursed at the free reimbursement rate for a limited period of time \nwhen a geographic area is heavily devastated by a declared disaster \nemergency and where the normal processes of food provided in the home \nhas been disrupted. All these things and so much more, Madam Speaker, \nare part of this.\n  We also have a disaster household distribution which is a part of the \nprogram. That is high quality, nutritious, 100 percent American-grown-\nand-produced food. USDA foods are distributed to food banks and other \npartner organizations.\n  In times of disaster, especially when disaster-affected populations \ndo not have access to congregate feeding, in other words, coming \ntogether to be able to get their food, they are in isolated communities \nand/or grocery stores are not operating because of the disasters, a \nState agency may request to operate a disaster household distribution \nprogram, in which food banks and voluntary organizations utilize the \nhousehold-size USDA foods, such as those offered in The Emergency Food \nAssistance Program, what we refer to as TEFAP, to build and distribute \nfood boxes to families. And, of course, the Disaster SNAP that I made \nreference to. D-SNAP is one of many types of food assistance for \ndisaster relief.\n  The D-SNAP is a streamlined version of SNAP that provides temporary--\nand that is important to understand--food assistance for households not \ncurrently receiving SNAP who are affected by a natural disaster. Areas \nwith a Presidential designation of a major disaster with individual \nassistance are eligible to operate a D-SNAP. States have to request \napproval from FNS to operate a D-SNAP in such an area.\n  The timing of the D-SNAP varies with the unique circumstances of each \ndisaster, but always begins after the commercial channels of food \ndistribution have been restored so eligible families can purchase and \nprepare food at home.\n  D-SNAP programs are often paired with supplements for the ongoing \ncaseload to bring their benefits up to a maximum amount.\n  Finally, of the food assistance disaster programs, the final one, \njust briefly, and the eighth one, is infant formula and food. USDA, \nthrough FNS, can make emergency procurements of infant formula and \nfoods for 96 hours after a Presidential declaration and upon request by \nFEMA or a State agency. With these State agencies, local supplies of \nthese products and similar items provided in FEMA's infant and toddler \nkits are typically utilized first before FNS receives a request for \nthese products.\n\n  These are all examples of great programs. When American families are \nhit by these natural disasters to a significant level where \nPresidential declarations of natural disasters are declared, through \nthe Agriculture Committee and mobilized through the United States \nDepartment of Agriculture, and the programs that we authorize under \nthat agency, this is how neighbors help neighbors in need.\n  Madam Speaker, I thought I would just touch briefly on a few of the \nprograms, some of the experiences of how American families have been \nassisted through these programs, starting with August 25, 2017, with \nHurricane Harvey, where it struck Texas.\n  Madam Speaker, we are all familiar with the scenes as we watched the \nunparalleled, just Biblical proportions of rain, 5 feet of rain in just \na number of days.\n  Texas was provided through this program, Supplemental Nutrition \nAssistance Program, or SNAP, a Disaster Supplemental Nutrition \nAssistance Program in 39 counties that were impacted by Hurricane \nHarvey. FNS also approved the State request to issue automatic \nsupplements to ongoing SNAP households in 39 counties that\n\n\nreceived a Presidential declaration of disaster for individual \nassistance. FNS approved the automatic issuance of 2 months of disaster \nsupplement benefits.\n  On September 1, FNS, USDA, approved a policy to provide States with \nflexibility to serve Hurricane Harvey evacuees, States that had chosen \nto either serve evacuees through expedited SNAP rule or through the \nsimplified program rules in the evacuee policy, people who have \nrelocated from their homes.\n  Additionally, on September 1, they issued an automatic mass \nreplacement of August SNAP benefits in 29 declared counties. These mass \nreplacement benefits were issued to replace food that was purchased \nwith August 2017 SNAP benefits but was all destroyed by the hurricanes, \nthe rain, the flooding as a part of that natural disaster. That is just \nan example.\n  Additionally, Texas received a hot foods extension notice. That \nallowed the State's hot foods waiver request to allow recipients to \npurchase hot foods and hot food products prepared for immediate \nconsumption with their benefits at authorized SNAP retailers. As I \nmentioned before, that is normally not a part of the SNAP program, but, \ngiven the recognition, an incredibly important part of that.\n  Another example of application with Hurricane Harvey in Texas, USDA, \nthrough FNS, approved Texas to operate a disaster household \ndistribution program really to address immediate food needs. Packages \ncontaining USDA foods were distributed by local feeding organizations \nto over 23,000 households, beginning September 8, for up to 4 weeks.\n  Then there was a partnership as well, Madam Speaker, where Texas and \nthe Salvation Army used USDA foods to prepare and serve 100,000 meals \nto those in need.\n  FNS informed Texas that it could use The Emergency Food Assistance \nProgram, or TEFAP, USDA foods to provide meals at food pantries and \nfood kitchens to people in need who couldn't reach larger disaster \nfeeding organizations but who were able to gather at small local \norganizations. Those are just a few examples in Texas.\n  Madam Speaker, I want to fast forward to probably a month or so \nlater, October maybe, because disaster comes in all shapes and sizes, \nand some of the devastating wildfires that we had, specifically in \nCalifornia, also reaching into Oregon.\n  Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr. \nLaMalfa). I am really pleased to be joined this evening by my good \nfriend and colleague.", "turn": 3, "speaker": "Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania", "itemno": 4}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "L000578", "text": "  Mr. LaMALFA. Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague from Pennsylvania, \nMr. Thompson, for yielding. I appreciate his efforts tonight in \npointing out the nuances of the SNAP program and what it means in a \ndisaster situation, such as what we have had all over the country in \nhurricanes, and even in my own backyard with the wildfires that we have \nbeen hearing about in the West in general, in my own district, where \nseveral have affected us very negatively, and adjacent areas of \nnorthern California and the wine country, indeed in southern California \nas well.\n  So the flexibility that has been needed, as we found in the SNAP \nprograms through what is known as D-SNAP, which is Disaster and \nSupplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, has been very helpful to \nmany in northern California and even southern California counties as \nwell.\n  So when the California Department of Social Services requested the D-\nSNAP to be put in place, the Food and Nutrition Service did, indeed, \ngrant that in several instances, including October, and more so in \nnorthern California, but in other instances as well in this case, \nindeed, as Mr. Thompson so well explained earlier in tonight's Special \nOrder.\n  Due to power outages from the fires knocking out power, we have food \nloss and spoilage due to those power outages, as well as other \ninstances, and even the ability for people to buy food. Maybe their \nhome is okay, but they wouldn't have the markets available to them in \ntheir community to buy food that they need locally. So the D-SNAP \nprogram has given the flexibility and the ability to source it and have \nit available after these families have suffered losses, including the \nwaiver for some folks who don't have the ability to produce and prepare \nhot food, where, in that case, families can have fairly normal meals in \na time of crisis that is, indeed, a comfort for them and a positive \nthat the flexibility of the program has made available for them.\n  So, indeed, destroyed homes due to fire, the power outages that have \nextended to so many areas and for so long have, indeed, caused these \ncrises for families here. The flexibility of this program, as Mr. \nThompson has pointed out here tonight, has been very helpful in that \ntime of disaster and relief that is needed, and the compassion that \ncomes from people helping each other in these times and these instances \nwhere we have had so much volunteerism, people stepping forward to help \nothers in times of crisis, but you need that little extra push \nsometimes that this program can be helpful for.\n  So I appreciate the FNS stepping forward and approving what the \nCalifornia Department of Social Services has looked at as, indeed, \nworthy disaster relief that has been needed in these areas.\n\n\n  It wouldn't just apply to wildfires as well, where we have had so \nmuch hitting California this year, northern California especially. We \nhad the issue of a possible flood and the crisis at Oroville Dam, when \nthe spillway broke and 188,000 people had to be evacuated due to great \nconcerns about additional failure of the dam.\n  So the ability to have this available, should the timing be right, \nand the qualifications for it being deemed that type of disaster, \nindeed is a comfort for a community when basic needs like putting food \non the table during crisis after a disaster come into play; whether it \nis fire, as was declared here, or it could be possible flood and \nevacuations, things of that nature, that make this a good part of an \nintegral part of keeping a community fed and together.\n  So I appreciate Mr. Thompson allowing me to speak here tonight and to \nbe able to point out how this has worked in northern California during \njust this last month in these horrendous wildfire situations we have \nseen in so many counties. I thank the gentleman for leading this \ntonight and for his attention to this.", "turn": 4, "speaker": "Mr. LaMALFA", "itemno": 5}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "T000467", "text": "  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Madam Speaker, I appreciate the \ngentleman's leadership on the Agriculture Committee.\n  Really, I think sometimes we take for granted basic essentials, such \nas food. Normally, these programs are for people who are, for temporary \nreasons or economic reasons, unemployed, underemployed. We are trying \nto help give people a pathway to greater opportunity through job \ntraining and those types of things.\n  But when disaster occurs, your life changes overnight. So I am very \nproud of the work that we do, of the fact that we are there for all of \nour neighbors in both rural and urban America; when they find \nthemselves in a situation where they are dealing with loss of a home, \nor the loss of a place of employment, or delays of going to work, or \nschools being closed, that we really are in a position to be able--they \nshouldn't have to worry about that next warm meal.\n  Natural disasters do come in all--we just talked a little bit about \nthe wildfires. Certainly, Oregon also is a State that has been the \nscene of wildfires and, specifically, received FNS, disaster and \nnutrition assistance in the form of child nutrition programs, not just \nfrom the flames, but from the smoke, with advisories due to smoke \nadvisories, qualifying air quality alerts, allowing for what we call \nnon-congregate meal service, normally, through a summer food program, \nbasically getting food out to those families, to those kids so that \nthey are--you don't want to be traveling through that heavy smoke.\n  We are all too familiar with another form of natural disaster, and \nthat is hurricanes. We have citizens on a wonderful island, Puerto \nRico, that was hit by not just one but two hurricanes in a short period \nof time, Hurricane Maria and Hurricane Irma.\n  I am joined this evening by a friend and a colleague who represents \nall those many United States citizens living on the island of Puerto \nRico, Miss\n\n\nJenniffer Gonzalez-Colon. I thank the gentlewoman for joining us this \nevening.\n  Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Puerto Rico (Miss \nGonzalez-Colon).\n  Miss GONZALEZ-COLON of Puerto Rico. Madam Speaker, I thank the \ngentleman, my friend, for allowing me actually to speak about what is \nhappening in terms of the USDA--the Department of Agriculture--and all \nthe food programs on the island in terms of disaster, as the gentleman \nwas explaining, how these programs work with the disaster.\n  As we speak, Puerto Rico's still has 60 percent of the island without \npower. As we speak, less than 20 percent of our island is having actual \nrunning water, problems with communications.\n  The first thing people will say is lack of electricity. They will say \nthe lack of a proper home, when you have got more than 60,000 homes \nthat just lost their roof or even are having a lot of damages.\n  So in that regard, the nutritional assistance provided by the U.S. \nDepartment of Agriculture for disaster relief in Puerto Rico has been \nindispensable; it has been important. Actually, the continuous \ncommunication the Government of Puerto Rico is having with the \nDepartment of Agriculture has been the first time, I think, during a \ndisaster in this magnitude.\n  We are living the 49th day after the hurricane. To make matters \nworse, for most of our people, the lack of power and the lack of water \nis just a fraction of the issues. I mean, we have still got a lot of \nschools that haven't returned to impart classes. So that means that you \nhave a lot of kids in their homes without going to school, and a lot of \nseveral structural damages in the homes, businesses, communities, all \naround the island. The amount of flooding, roads and bridges that got \nserious damage or lack functionality is staggering at this time. So the \nnutritional assistance was a concern since before the hurricanes.\n  I need to say that I appreciate Secretary Perdue having a call with \nme and different conference calls regarding different programs. First \nof all, 9 of the 11 programs for disaster in the Department of \nAgriculture, in terms of the farmers, the territories, will never apply \nbecause we are not, in fact, allowed to apply. He made it happen. He \nused flexibility to allow Puerto Rico to access those programs in terms \nof the farmer disaster assistance, and I appreciate that.\n  That happens also with the USDA programs. The USDA officials have \nbeen in contact directly, not just with my office, but with the \nGovernor of Puerto Rico, with the local officials since early on when \nthis problem was hitting the island. As a matter of fact, I was in \ntouch today with them regarding a lot of the problems.\n  I am also pleased with the inclusion of the disaster assistance for \nthe Puerto Rican Nutrition Assistance Program in the second \nsupplemental bill for the disaster relief that was approved here. \nHowever, we still need, of course, a lot of help. We still know that \nthere is a long way to recover ahead of us.\n  Most of the challenges we are facing now are because of the lack of \npower, the lack of electricity. Our people are struggling due to not \nhaving access to their nutritional assistance benefits because there \nare still many stores that remain without power and they cannot process \nthe benefits through the electronic benefits system.\n\n  If the benefits are not used, in the case of Puerto Rico, for a 60-\nday period, they are going to be removed from individual accounts, and \nthen returned to the Nutrition Assistance Program.\n  So that is one of the issues we are still working with the \nDepartment: American citizens losing access to funds allocated for them \nto mitigate food necessities.\n  I would like to encourage the Department of Agriculture to take these \ndifficulties into consideration and explore more avenues for remedial \naction, because I know nobody expected an island or a territory to be, \nafter 49 days, without power. My people are helpless against the lack \nof electricity, yet they stand to suffer greatly because of it.\n  Additionally, the Government of Puerto Rico had to request two hot \nfoods waivers to allow the purchase of hot foods using Nutrition \nAssistance Program benefits. The first one was graciously approved by \nthe Secretary, and I hope the second one that has already been received \nwill be also accommodated.\n  Saying that, I want to thank personally Secretary Perdue and all the \npeople working with FNS, USDA, and the Department of Agriculture, who \nhave been visiting the island, dealing with farmers, dealing with the \nlocal officials. Of course, I just request that the agency remains \nsensitive to the challenges that 3.4 million American citizens are \nfacing on the island. For that, I am thankful, I am grateful.\n  Madam Speaker, I thank Congressman Thompson for allowing me to be \nhere. I know this is not the first time that he is actually fighting \nfor this. He has been a lone leader in that regard, and I want to join \nhim in that effort.", "turn": 5, "speaker": "Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania", "itemno": 6}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "T000467", "text": "  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Madam Speaker, I have to say it has \nbeen very impressive. In the middle of that hurricane, I know that I \ncommunicated with the gentlewoman by text, and she was what we call \nwhere I am from ``hunkered down.'' But she has been there for the \npeople she represents every moment since. I mean, the gentlewoman was \nin the middle of that, and has been there, and has been reaching out \nand building relationships with individuals like Secretary Perdue and \nthe staff from the Food and Nutrition Service, with USDA.\n  I know we were just in a hearing--the gentlewoman and I serve \ntogether on the Natural Resources Committee--and talked a lot about the \npower disruption and how that certainly impacts nutrition, but it \nimpacts quality of life and everything. We take it for granted. We take \nit for granted.\n  So the gentlewoman's leadership to her constituents is just very \nimpressive. They are fortunate to have her, and I am fortunate to be \nable to call her my friend.\n  I think we do have a friend in terms of Secretary Sonny Perdue--a \nmutual friend. He and the staff at the Department of Agriculture are \nreally committed to serving our citizens, serving our families. They \nhave been so proactive in these overwhelming natural disasters that \nhave gone from coast to coast, and in the Caribbean, and just \neverywhere we turned around, and they were absolutely devastating.\n  So as someone who does serve on the Agriculture Committee, I take a \nlot of pride in the fact of seeing what we work on each and every day \nin terms of authorizing programs, to watch those get implemented and \nwatch those really make a difference.\n  The gentlewoman had mentioned the hot food waiver, the first one \nbeing approved through October, November. With the power being out, I \ncertainly would support the gentlewoman's request made to the \nDepartment of Agriculture to continue that. That is not something we \nnormally do.\n  As I explained, we all know that normally, under SNAP, in particular, \nit is food that we purchase, and then take it home and prepare it. But \nif you are without electricity, that is pretty tough to do.\n  Miss GONZALEZ-COLON of Puerto Rico. It is difficult. I just rode out \nthe hurricane down there. We never expect to experience something like \nthis.\n  So this kind of program, the disaster program, is very important not \njust for territories, but for States. You will never know when \nsomething like this will happen to you.\n  The gentleman is thanking me, but you know what? I am receiving all \nthese opportunities and help because I count on people like him to \nactually help me out, reaching the agencies, doing the amendments, and \nthe votes that are needed to approve that kind of relief bill that was \nhere. I couldn't vote for that. Even though I represent 3.4 million \nAmerican citizens, I could not vote, but the gentleman did. So this is \na team effort, and there is a long way to recover. I hope it is going \nto end here.\n  Again, I thank the gentleman for all he has been doing in the \ncommittee--in both committees, actually. I know we can, as a team, work \nout so the people of Puerto Rico may recover soon.", "turn": 6, "speaker": "Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania", "itemno": 7}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "T000467", "text": "  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania.

Madam Speaker, I just want to mention--\nbecause I think we have talked\n\n\nabout the wildfires in California and Oregon. We have heard about the \nterrible--the one-two punch, actually, in Puerto Rico with Hurricanes \nMaria and Irma, and how these programs are stepped up.\n  I want to certainly touch on the other parts of our country where \nAmerican citizens have been impacted as well.\n\n\n  While we are talking about Hurricane Maria, I think it is very \nimportant to talk about our U.S. citizens who live on the United States \nVirgin Islands.\n  This is an area as well where we have been able to mobilize under the \nauthority of the work that we do, and in the Agriculture Committee \nthrough USDA. For the Virgin Islands Department of Human Services, we \nare able to receive a Disaster Supplemental Nutrition Assistance \nProgram as well, in the districts of St. Croix, St. John, and St. \nThomas.\n  This is obviously an island that has been devastated by Hurricane \nMaria. It makes it very difficult to deploy resources, especially in \nthe interior of islands, but I really appreciate how the administration \nproactively anticipated the disaster was going to occur and staged \nresources.\n  As a former EMT, firefighter, and rescue technician, really to be \nable to pre-deploy, to be able to serve those American families--they \nwere in a very difficult situation, and including the work of the \ntremendous staff at the Department of Agriculture, and the food and \nnutrition service, and Under Secretary Perdue's leadership, to be able \nto serve these citizens, that is an ongoing effort.\n  There is no doubt about that. Numerous aspects of our food assistance \nfor disaster relief were deployed there, and we just really appreciate \nthe efforts.\n  In the southeastern United States, actually in addition to Texas and \nin southwestern Louisiana as well, families and individuals in \nLouisiana felt the impact of Hurricane Harvey. They received a waiver \nto allow distribution in August of the Commodity Supplemental Food \nProgram which are food packages that were distributed in 2017, and they \nwere provided in an August food package, and a September food package. \nSo there was assistance under Disaster SNAP as well there. That was \nHurricane Harvey.\n  As we have heard already about Hurricane Irma, the tremendous damage \nthat was done impacted individuals and families in both Florida and \nGeorgia where we saw the supplemental assistance program, or D-SNAP, \nthat was provided to eligible households. Some of the affected counties \nwere able to receive 2 months of benefits to meet their food needs \nwhile they settled back home following the disaster.\n  FNS also approved an extension of the States' hot foods waiver, as \nyou heard about earlier. Those waivers are an important part of what we \ncan do to help people's lives be better immediately following and \nduring the transition time for a temporary period of time following \ndisasters. On September 14, FNS approved a request to begin disaster \nhousehold distribution of 25 to 30 pounds of USDA food packages in \nthose Presidentially declared disaster areas in Florida for a period of \nup to 4 weeks.\n  On September 22, several flexibilities requested by the Florida \nDepartment of Health were approved to assist schools and childcare \ncenters, and sponsor organizations that were operating the Child Care \nFood Program, or CCFP, and those approvals applied to all 67 counties.\n  Of course, as we mentioned, that same disaster incident in the State \nof Georgia that was impacted has served families there, and individuals \nhave been served by these programs. FNS approved the State's request to \nissue an automatic mass replacement of 45 percent of the September 2017 \nSNAP benefits because of food that was damaged, lost, contaminated, and \nneeded to be replaced in 71 counties in Georgia that were destroyed due \nto the disaster.\n  FNS approved the State's request to extend the time period households \nhad to report food losses through individual affidavits, giving that \nflexibility as a part of the process as well, as well as waivers \napplied to schools and residential care institutions that operated \nunder the nutritional assistance programs.\n  Madam Speaker, these are just a few of the examples. We have heard a \nlot about disasters. We continue to hear about them. We have great \nfirst responders. We have resources, our military, our National Guard. \nAll kinds of contractual resources have been deployed by the Federal \nGovernment, State governments, and territorial governments. Among those \nare these nutrition programs.\n  As we prepare to reauthorize the farm bill and to do that here, \nhopefully, by the end of this year, or the very beginning of next year, \nI think it is important to take the time to really understand what a \ndifference these nutritional programs can make in the lives of average-\nday Americans who are facing extraordinary challenges and events in \ntheir life.\n  Again, the nutrition programs are normally about serving those who \nfind themselves temporarily in economically challenging situations with \nthe loss of employment, or underemployment, frequently because of no \nfault of their own. And this supplemental nutrition assistance is to \nhelp them get by. We are also trying to work to make sure we provide \nsome pathways to greater opportunity for those who perhaps would \nbenefit from what I like to call skills-based education to help them \nget a better job and more resources for the family, to be able to take \ncare of these needs independently on their own.\n  But there are individuals who find themselves chronically in need, \nperhaps, because of a significant disability, who need to be able to \nknow that those programs are there, and to rely on them. Then there is \nanother group that we have talked about this evening, those who wake up \none morning or in the middle of the night and find that their lives \nhave changed dramatically, at least for the time being, because of \nnational disasters.\n  Madam Chair, I really appreciate the opportunity to be able to speak \non these issues, and I was very pleased to be joined by a couple of my \ncolleagues this evening.\n  Once again, under general leave, I am going to be submitting some \ncomments by the chairman of the Agriculture Committee, Mike Conaway, \nwho has done a great job of leading the Agriculture Committee, as well \nas Jim McGovern, who is a good friend and very passionate about \nnutrition programs.\n  He has a long record of service in this area, and he and I lead--he \nis the ranking member--the Nutrition Subcommittee.\n  Madam Chair, I am grateful for the opportunity to be here and to \nraise these issues this evening, and I yield back the balance of my \ntime.", "turn": 9, "speaker": "Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania", "itemno": 10}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "C001062", "text": "  Mr. CONAWAY. Madam Speaker, I rise this evening to acknowledge the \nresponse of our communities and Federal agencies to the recent \nhurricanes and wildfires. I would like to first offer my thoughts and \nprayers to families affected by these tragedies.\n  The USDA and FNS play a vital role in providing supplemental \nnutrition assistance when disasters occur by coordinating with State, \nlocal, and voluntary organizations. Nothing is more important that \nproviding food when people find themselves suddenly, and often \ncritically, in need following disaster-related emergencies.\n  FNS has worked tirelessly to provide nutrition assistance to those \naffected by Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria, as well as the Western \nWildfires. Our fellow citizens in Texas, Georgia, Louisiana, Florida, \nPuerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, California, and Oregon have \nreceived assistance including automatic mass replacement of benefits, \nD-SNAP, free school meals, and waivers, ultimately ensuring people have \nenough to eat in their time of need.\n  As Secretary Perdue has said, each disaster situation is unique. The \nUSDA and FNS have demonstrated their ability to respond to each of \nthese unique situations in a timely and effective way.\n  The challenges facing our communities ravaged by hurricanes and \nwildfires are unprecedented. Getting food on the table in a timely \nmanner should not be an additional challenge. I want to recognize the \nfortitude of our fellow citizens as they come together to rebuild after \nsuch devastation as well as acknowledge the USDA's diligence in \naddressing the nutrition-related needs of our fellow citizens.", "turn": 10, "speaker": "Mr. CONAWAY", "itemno": 11}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "M000312", "text": "  Mr. McGOVERN. Madam Speaker, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance \nProgram--\n\n\nknown as SNAP--provides modest food assistance benefits to families in \nneed. The program helps to alleviate hunger, reduce poverty, and \nimprove nutrition across our country on an ongoing basis.\n  SNAP is also designed to help families put food on the table when \ndisaster strikes. In response to recent hurricanes, fires, floods, and \nstorms, officials at the United States Department of Agriculture's Food \nand Nutrition Service (USDA FNS) have worked with other federal and \nstate emergency response agencies to ensure those impacted by disasters \nhave access to food.\n  Flexibilities in SNAP, for example, allow states to issue SNAP \nbenefits early to ensure recipients can stock up on food before a \ndisaster hits.\n  In many cases, SNAP recipients impacted by disaster and power outages \nare able to request additional benefits to replace food they lost, and \nin certain circumstances, are able to use their SNAP benefits to \npurchase hot foods if they lost power and are unable to cook.\n  Disaster SNAP, known as D-SNAP, is a key feature of the program that \nprovides nutrition assistance benefits to families in major disaster \nareas who aren't currently receiving benefits. Importantly, D-SNAP also \nprovides families currently enrolled in SNAP with supplemental benefits \nto help them get by in the wake of disaster.\n  In addition to SNAP, other federal anti-hunger safety net programs \nlike the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and \nChildren (WIC), child nutrition programs, and Disaster Household \nDistribution (DHD) come to the aid of those recovering from disaster.\n  For example, schools in areas affected by disaster can provide meals \nto all kids at no charge and can be more flexible in where and when \nthey serve meals.\n  DHD is another program to allow food banks and other organizations to \ndistribute emergency food boxes filled with nutritious food to people \nthat don't have access to feeding sites or grocery stores in the \naftermath of disaster.\n  Madam Speaker, when disasters hit the United States--and its \nterritories--it is imperative that our government effectively and \nefficiently helps those impacted by these terrible tragedies.\n  SNAP and our other nutrition programs are a key component of disaster \nresponse efforts, providing food to families in need. In the aftermath \nof recent tragedies that devastated Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin \nIslands, Texas, Georgia, Louisiana, Florida, California, and Oregon, \nUSDA was able to respond.\n  I'd like to thank my friend and colleague on the Agriculture \nCommittee, the Chairman of the Nutrition Subcommittee, Mr. GT Thompson, \nfor raising awareness about nutrition assistance in times of disaster.\n  I encourage all of my colleagues to join us in recognizing how \npowerful and effective SNAP and other nutrition programs are in \nresponding to natural disasters. We must work to protect these programs \nfrom cuts or structural changes that threaten the ability of these \nprograms to help families in need.\n", "turn": 11, "speaker": "Mr. McGOVERN", "itemno": 12}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 13}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "182", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H8652-H8657", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "8", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "FOOD SECURITY IN AMERICA", "id": "CREC-2017-11-08-pt1-PgH8652", "title": "FOOD SECURITY IN AMERICA"}
