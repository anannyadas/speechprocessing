Mr. Speaker, yesterday, I got buoyed in a little \ndance step in my walk, not because of partisan politics, but because \npeople in America voted. They voted throughout the Nation and they made \nsizeable changes, not even on partisan politics, but what I love, about \nprinciples. Principles of rejecting divisiveness, the misinterpretation \nof the Constitution, and the wonderment of this Nation is what these \nvoters stood for.\n  I also believe they recognize that they wanted direction that really \nworked for them. If we pass the tax bill, they didn't want it to be a \ntax scam where millions of middle class Americans would pay an increase \nin taxes or they couldn't deduct their medical expenses or student \ninterest rates.\n  The vote yesterday was for a new direction, not for any of us to take \nit for granted, but for us to recognize that it is time now for the \nAmerican people to lead. I am so grateful for the democracy of this \nNation and for the values of the American people. They made a \ndifference yesterday. Thank you for voting.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Ms. JACKSON LEE", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "182", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H8646", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "8", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "PEOPLE VOTED BASED ON PRINCIPLES", "id": "CREC-2017-11-08-pt1-PgH8646-5", "title": "PEOPLE VOTED BASED ON PRINCIPLES"}
