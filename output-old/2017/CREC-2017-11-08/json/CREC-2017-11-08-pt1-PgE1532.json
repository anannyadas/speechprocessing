Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor my friend \nPete Ciarrocchi, Chairman and CEO of the world famous Chickie's & \nPete's Crab House and Sports Bar. Since 1977, Chickie's & Pete's \nlocations have been rightfully called the best sports bars in \nPhiladelphia. So none of us were surprised when they were voted ESPN's \nNo. 1 Sports Bar on the East Coast.\n  Every Philadelphian knows that Chickie's & Pete's and Philly sports \ngo hand in hand. The only thing better than pre-game, post-game or game \nwatching at the restaurant is enjoying their food at the stadium. And \nof course, you can't leave without an order of Pete's world famous \nCrabfries.\n  But Mr. Speaker, Pete Ciarrocchi is more than a successful \nbusinessman. He's one of Philadelphia's finest citizens. He is one of \nthe owners of the three time Arena Bowl champion Philadelphia Soul \nArena Football Team. He is also one of our leading philanthropists \nserving on the Aria Health Foundation Board of Trustees and on the Holy \nFamily University Business Advisory Board. Pete is a Mummer, who is \nactive with The Polish-American String Band.\n  But most importantly, Pete is a proud husband and father. His lovely \nwife Lisa and three sons Peter, Blaise, and Anthony are his first loves \nand the foundation on which the rest of his world is built.\n  Mr. Speaker, I ask that all of my colleagues join me in honoring Pete \nCiarrocchi and Chickie's & Pete's Crab House and Sports Bar as they \ncelebrate their 40th Anniversary tonight.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. BRADY of Pennsylvania", "itemno": 4}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 5}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "182", "extension": true, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "E1532", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "8", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "HONORING PETE CIARROCCHI AND CHICKIE'S AND PETE'S CRAB HOUSE AND SPORTS BAR", "id": "CREC-2017-11-08-pt1-PgE1532", "title": null}
