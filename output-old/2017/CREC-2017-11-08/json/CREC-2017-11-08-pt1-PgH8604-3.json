Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor the outstanding service and \nretirement of one of California's finest, Cathedral City Police Chief \nGeorge S. Crum, Jr. Chief Crum is an exceptional leader in the \ncommunity, dedicating his life to public service for over three \ndecades.\n  He started his career 30 years ago as a police officer with the \nFullerton Police Department. His commitment to keeping our citizens \nsafe earned him many promotions over the years, from sergeant, to \nlieutenant, and, eventually, captain of the Fullerton Police \nDepartment. He was appointed as police chief of the Cathedral City \nPolice Department on December 10, 2014, and recently retired on \nNovember 2, 2017.\n  Throughout his career, his dedication to community engagement has \nhelped to ensure justice and build a strong community. He is a member \nof numerous organizations that promote safety throughout California, \nincluding the Riverside County Law Enforcement\n\n\nAdministrators Association, the Coachella Valley Association of \nGovernments, and the California Police Chiefs Association.\n  Not only has he been a strong leader in law enforcement across the \nregion, Chief Crum is also a leader in molding the minds of our \nstudents. He was an instructor at Fullerton College for nearly 20 \nyears, and he is currently a Public Safety Academy instructor at \nCollege of the Desert in the valley. He serves as a mentor to the next \ngeneration of law enforcement leaders in our region, inspiring them to \nserve their own communities.\n  I am so humbled to have worked with him over the years to keep the \npublic safe, and I am proud to call him a friend. It has also been my \nhonor to work with him on legislation to provide robust benefits to the \nfamilies of public safety officers killed in the line of duty.\n  Chief Crum has given so much to the community over the years, and I \nhave a feeling this will continue even in his retirement.\n  So on behalf of my wife, Monica, and the entire 36th Congressional \nDistrict, I want to thank Chief Crum; his wife, Rebecca; and his \nchildren, Dylan and Madison, from the bottom of my heart, for their \nservice and sacrifice to keep our communities safe.\n  While we are sad to see him retire, I wish him and his family the \nbest during his well-deserved retirement.\n\n\n               Recognizing Pete M. Ortiz on Veterans Day\n", "turn": 1, "speaker": "Mr. RUIZ", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "R000599", "text": "  Mr. RUIZ. Mr. Speaker, this week, on Veterans Day, we honor those who \nhave bravely served in our Nation's military. Our veterans served with \nincredible selflessness; they served with great courage; and they \nserved with sacrifice, often leaving behind spouses, children, and \nloved ones to keep our Nation safe and to protect the freedoms we hold \nso dear. For this, our veterans and their families have earned our \nrespect and our deep debt of gratitude.\n  On Veterans Day, we take a moment to pause and reflect on their \nservice. So today, I want to recognize the life of one of my district's \nfinest members, Pete M. Ortiz.\n  Mr. Ortiz passed away on September 14, 2017, at the age of 76. He \ncame from a family that has committed themselves to serving our country \nin uniform for generations. Since World War II, over 50 members--50 \nmembers--of the Ortiz family have bravely served in our Armed Forces, \nputting their lives on the line to protect our freedoms.\n  Following his family's legacy, Mr. Ortiz honorably served in the Army \nNational Guard from 1956 to 1960. He was awarded the Marksman Badge and \nPistol Bar, an honor presented to soldiers with high marksmanship \nskills. I was proud to help obtain and personally present him with \nthese medals for his distinguished service.\n  Mr. Ortiz was also a beloved member of the Coachella Valley. Not only \nwas he a carpenter and avid fisherman, he was part of a unique desert \nskydive team, the Desert Skydivers of Coachella.\n  All those who knew him remember his zest for life and devotion to \nfamily. One of his greatest joys was getting his entire family together \nfor a barbecue. His family remembers his masterful skills for grilling, \nespecially carne asada, and his dream of one day opening his own taco \nstand.\n  To his wife, Patricia, and children, Pete, Tina, Sherry, and Sally, \nyour father was an example to us all. His bravery, selflessness, and \ncourage in the military are an inspiration challenging us to better \nserve our own communities. His adventures and curious spirit are a \nreminder to us all to live life to the fullest and enjoy the people and \nplaces that bring us joy.\n  So on behalf of my wife, Monica, and my daughters, Sky and Sage, we \nhonor the service and legacy of Mr. Ortiz and his entire family.\n  From the bottom of our hearts, we thank all of our veterans for their \ndedication and sacrifice for our country as we honor their service this \nVeterans Day.\n", "turn": 2, "speaker": "Mr. RUIZ", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 3}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "182", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H8604-H8605", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "8", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "HONORING CATHEDRAL CITY POLICE CHIEF GEORGE S.
