{"content": [{"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "M001176", "text": "  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, we have a very important role in this \nSenate--to provide advice and consent on nominees. Our forefathers, who \nwrote the Constitution, envisioned that this power would be used rarely \nbecause a President, knowing this power existed, would nominate highly \nsuitable people for the post that they were intended to occupy. But we \nhaven't seen highly suitable people coming through this Chamber this \nyear. In fact, we have seen one person after another fabulously \nunsuited for the office or position to which they were nominated.\n  We saw Scott Pruitt, who took on and attacked regulations designed to \ncreate clean air across this country time after time, in a very close \nassociation with the fossil fuel industry that wanted to allow more \nparticulates, more particulates that cause a tremendous amount of \nhealth damage in this country.\n  We saw Betsy DeVos come through this Chamber, an individual who was \nnominated to be Secretary of Public Education but had never stepped \ninside a public school, didn't respect public schools, hadn't had \nchildren in public schools, hadn't volunteered in public schools, and \nwanted to decimate public schools. The best thing we could have done \nfor public schools would have been to turn down that nomination, but \nthis Chamber said: Boy, you know, we are going to do everything we can \nto damage public education.\n  Many of us stood up against that and said: No, let's fight for \nsomeone who can make public education better, not tear it down. But \nthat is not what we got.\n  Now we have another individual to be considered on the floor of the \nSenate, Bill Wehrum. Bill Wehrum was nominated to head EPA's Office of \nAir and Radiation. Bill Wehrum has made a career out of working for \npowerful special interests and attacking any effort to make the air \ncleaner. Is that a person suitable for this role of protecting the air \nwe breathe and making it better, someone who has sought to make it \nworse?\n  During the nomination hearing, I put up a very simple chart. I wanted \nto understand his thoughts about what was driving climate disruption. I \nput up a chart showing what NASA data showed for the solar impact, \nsolar flares, and so forth, about which sometimes people say: Well, \nmaybe it is solar flares that are causing the warming of the planet. \nNASA had data that showed a flat line on that and then a rising \ntemperature.\n  I said: Is there any sign of correlation between these two lines?\n  His response was: Well, what do you mean? It is correlation.\n  He didn't have any understanding of the basics of how to compare one \nthing to another.\n  I put up another chart. The other chart showed all of the activities \nthat are considered to be ones that might contribute to global warming, \nthat are not manmade activities, things like the solar flares and \nvolcanic activity. Again, the NASA data showed a flat line and the \nrising temperature.\n\n\n  I said: Does there appear to be any correlation between this flat \nline and this rise in temperature?\n  He again said: I just don't understand the data. I can't really \ncomment on that.\n  Yet anyone with any basic ability to digest information would \nrecognize that there was no correlation. You didn't have two things \nmoving in the same direction.\n  Then I put up this chart right here. This chart shows that same \ntemperature, observe the black line, and then it shows the line for \nrising carbon dioxide. I said: Well, are these things correlated?\n  Do you see any relationship between one line rising and the other \nline rising?\n  Again, he refused to answer.\n  How is it that we can put someone into a position who cannot even \nlook at and comment on basic data, who has been a hired hand for the \nfossil fuel industry, who has fought to make our air filthier and more \ndamaging to our health?\n  That is the nominee we have, a nominee who has sued on behalf of very \npowerful interests--the EPA, 31 times--to try to degrade the controls \nfor things like mercury, which is a potent neurotoxin that damages the \nbrains of, particularly, our children. Why should we have somebody who \nwants more mercury in our air in this position to consider air quality? \nIt, certainly, does not make any sense to me.\n  He did have a chance to serve in this position, in an acting \ncapacity, back in 2006. So he has been there before. He adopted \nguidelines on mercury emissions that had entire passages lifted word \nfor word from information that had been provided by the industry. The \nindustry did not want to regulate the mercury, and he just took its \nlanguage and said that that is what we will do, that we will do what \nindustry says. He was not working for the American people. He was \nworking for the powerful and the privileged.\n  Then he told an EPA staffer ``not to undertake the normal scientific \nand economic studies'' when crafting important rules. He instructed his \nstaff not to look at the scientific information when constructing \nrules. What did he want them to look at? He wanted them to just take \nthe language from industry. That is certainly not protecting the public \ninterest. As the New York Times wrote, he has sought to ``elevate \ncorporate interests above those of the public.''\n  This is not a position in a company. This is not a position in a \ncorporation. This is a position of public trust. He has failed that \ntest. In fact, he has failed it so badly that, although he was \nnominated in 2006 when there was a Republican majority in this Chamber, \nhis nomination was subsequently rejected by the Senate. Back then, we \nhad folks who really, actually cared on both sides of the aisle far \nmore about air quality. Now it seems like the enormous amount of \nfunding from the Koch brothers for campaigns across the country has \nsquelched any consideration from my colleagues about the quality of the \nair or the quality of our water. This nomination is, certainly, a test \nof that.\n  If my colleagues do care about the quality of our air, they will act \nlike their predecessors did back in 2006, and they will reject this \nnomination. An individual who has betrayed the public trust should not \nbe confirmed to a position of public trust.\n  Thank you.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. MERKLEY", "itemno": 0}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 1}], "header": {"chamber": "Senate", "num": "182", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "S7122-S7123", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "8", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "NOMINATION OF WILLIAM WEHRUM", "id": "CREC-2017-11-08-pt1-PgS7122", "title": "NOMINATION OF WILLIAM WEHRUM"}
