Madam Speaker, I recently toured the newly renovated \nUnited States Capitol dome right nearby and, of course, was well aware \nit contains a striking fresco at the top. The title of that fresco is \nThe Apotheosis of Washington, a bit of a peculiar image for our time, \nbecause it shows a stern, purple-clad George Washington exalted in the \nheavens.\n  Now, on his right is the Goddess of Liberty symbolizing emancipation; \nand on his left, the Goddess Victoria, symbolizing victory. He is \nsurrounded by 13 maidens representing the Thirteen Original Colonies; \nhowever, there is a twist. The backs of several of the maidens are \nturned to Washington, and those represent the colonies of Georgia, \nNorth Carolina, South Carolina, and Virginia as they had seceded from \nthe Union prior to the work beginning the fresco in 1863.\n  Now, Madam Speaker, the imagery continues, and around the rest of the \ndome are six allegorical scenes that do really project the defining \nideas of America at that time. They are: war, science, marine life, \ncommerce, mechanics, and agriculture. Now, these are perhaps old-\nfashioned categories to the modern mind, but then they did convey an \noptimism about the frontier, economic progress, and the potential of \nwhat our new Nation might be able to achieve.\n  Although, Madam Speaker, I had seen these frescos before, something \nstruck me differently this time. These scenes really do grasp an \nincomplete ideal. The Apotheosis of Washington shows a reflective and \nconfident America, but what is missing is a fuller understanding of the \nnature of community, individual dignity, and freedom.\n  The idea of progress is narrowly defined, and that narrow definition \nis actually still with us today, many times as it informs our debate \nhere. We only tend to value things that we can actually measure--things \nlike production, technology, and military victory--and they still rally \nus, and they are important.\n  But, as important as these things are, there is more to life; the \nmore we have grown economically, the more we have grown \ntechnologically, the more our Nation groans. We have to be honest, and \nwe have to ask ourselves: Why?\n  America is a far more complicated country than it was in Washington's \ntime. It is not only due to our size and wealth and amazingly diverse \npopulation, but it is also due to rapidly advancing technology, a 24/7 \nnews media cycle, and a highly competitive global marketplace that has \nmade life more frenetic, more difficult, and, in some cases, much more \nalienating.\n  Today, there is widespread anxiety in our Nation over economic \ninequality, declining opportunity, and the concentration of both wealth \nand power, as well as a new force that is expressing a loss of unity \nand community, and then combine that with this deep search for a sense \nof solidarity.\n  Madam Speaker, while Congress spends much of its time debating \nnumbers, financing, and budgets, a vision for America in its fullest \nsense goes beyond just material dimensions. Our economic vitality must \nnot only be measured in terms of efficiency and growth, but also in how \nwell we advance the cause of human flourishing.\n  In spite of all of these reflective comments, this Friday, our Nation \nwill actually pause, and we will pause for a very important reason: it \nis Veterans Day, and we will celebrate that tradition. So if you are \nstarting to feel overwhelmed by our Nation's struggles, just talk to a \nveteran.\n  If you see these policy battles here as impossible to resolve, talk \nto a vet.\n  If you really do want to reconnect with the ties that bind us, speak \nto a veteran.\n  Madam Speaker, as we are painfully aware, it is not easy to make \nprogress in Congress. Nevertheless, there are times when both parties \nand the administration come together for great good, and actions for \nveterans represent a unique and proper American opportunity to support \nthe men and women who have served our country. So as we approach \nVeterans Day and consider how to celebrate this gift of being an \nAmerican, if we need a reminder, just ask a vet.\n\n\n  Now, back to history for a moment, Madam Speaker.\n  We rightly mark our independence from the British as the beginning of \na new nation, a new experiment in government based in the ideals of \nfreedom. However, freedom most properly expressed is the freedom to do \nwhat we ought.\n  Unlinked to responsibility, to one another, and to higher ideals, \nfreedom can become a meaningless wandering and a search for purpose; \nand progress, no matter how grand it is, is never an end in itself. \nPersons who are disconnected from one another, an economy that is \nuncaring, technology ever accelerating, these are dynamics that can \nactually be both beneficial, but also leave people behind. Independence \nfrom tyranny also means interdependence within community.\n  Now, Madam Speaker, the Capitol dome is over 150 years old. Until \nrecently, chunks of iron--in fact, I saw one; it was nearly this big--\nwere just falling off, and water was seeping through cracks. But now it \nis made whole again. The seams are repaired, and there is new, \noriginal-like glass and a fresh layer of protective coating. Why? \nBecause we chose to do it. We didn't let it fall into ruin. We didn't \nlament its potential collapse. We chose to act.\n  So, Madam Speaker, if we cling to her ideals, this gift of America \nallows\n\n\nus the freedom to preserve unity and to make genuine progress, which is \nthe freedom to be whole.\n  As I approached my office here recently, there was a large crowd of \nmen who had gathered outside my door. I assumed they were waiting to \nsee me, and they were wearing camouflage shirts. There was some \nlanguage on the front of the shirt. As I got closer, I could read it, \nand it said ``United Mine Workers.'' I thought, well, this is a bit \npeculiar to see United Mine Workers from Nebraska. Nonetheless, I \nengaged them in a conversation outside the door thinking I would escort \nthem inside.\n  But they weren't there to see me. They were there to see my neighbor, \nwho represents the State of Kentucky, and that made a little more \nsense. Nevertheless, I greeted these men, and we had a very meaningful \nconversation about work, about security, and about fairness.\n  These men had spent their lives in very hard jobs. I am sure they \nproudly toiled to create reasonable livings for their families. They \nall now showed real signs of physical fatigue. They were in Washington \nto make a plea, a plea for their pensions, which are facing dramatic \nreductions.\n  A similar situation does exist in Nebraska for another group of \nworkers. These men worked for a guarantee that they would be provided \nfor when they could work no more. But given a confluence of factors, \ntheir pensions face a dramatic shortfall, and it is not fair.\n  I lived, Madam Speaker, for 2 years in the area where these men come \nfrom, in a town that had lost half its population in 20 years, in the \nold industrial Rust Belt where the post-World War II economic boom \nbuilt a thriving, stable community, but now where globalized supply-\nside theory has had its most dramatic degenerating economic effect.\n  I said to these men: ``You know that I know where you come from.'' \nOne of them hugged me.\n  Madam Speaker, our country is in pain. Epic hurricanes and floods, \nescalating urban violence and an opioid epidemic among those who are \nself-medicating their own mental or physical or financial anguish, a \nbroken healthcare construct, the aftereffects of bitterly fought \nelections, and now another mass shooting have torn America's heart \napart.\n  In a vibrantly healthy society, there is space in a good, functional \nmarketplace for fluidity, creativity, and innovation, and a person with \nan idea and the drive should be able to pursue it. The benefits accrue \nto the innovator as well as the buyer of the product, to the community \nas well, and those who give the effort. The point is this: a healthy \neconomy is both individualistic and community-oriented at the same \ntime.\n  Innovation and competition can be disruptive, but they must be set \nwithin a fair set of rules. When the system stacks to the wealthiest or \nis outsourced by faceless corporations in the name of advancing \nquarterly profits, exploiting the poor elsewhere and damaging the \nenvironment, it sets in motion a series of things: lost jobs, lost \ncommunity cohesion, and a breakdown of life's stability.\n  Tie this to a loss of the formative institutions in our society of \nfamily life, faith life, and civic life, and we drift. We drift without \na national narrative that can hold, and it makes it much more difficult \nto respond holistically, especially when we have tragedies such as the \nsenseless horror in Las Vegas and now with the unthinkable at the First \nBaptist Church in Sutherland Springs, Texas.\n  But, again, Madam Speaker, I just have to pause and remind myself \nthat, in spite of these difficulties, in spite of sometimes the \ndarkness which can seem overwhelming due to a lack of unity, we will \npause on Friday as a nation, and we will remember our veterans. If it \nis just too much and too overwhelming, if the debates in Congress are \nso bothersome and annoying, go talk to a vet about that deeper sense of \nwho we are and what we still can be.\n  Madam Speaker, in the entryway of the municipal building in a little \ntown of France called Sainte-Mere-Eglise, there hangs an American flag. \nIt is the first thing you see when you walk into the mayor's municipal \nbuilding.\n  Sainte-Mere-Eglise was the site where our paratroopers landed prior \nto the D-day invasion. They landed in the midst of German troop \nformations and had to fight as they were coming down. One paratrooper \ngot hung up on the church steeple and survived the battle. A replica of \nhim still hangs there today.\n  The American flag in the mayor's building, in the municipal building, \nis said to be the first American flag planted on the European continent \nduring the war. It is displayed there in France in a government \nbuilding proudly as a memorial in thanksgiving to America for what we \ndid to save France and to save Europe from tyranny.\n\n  Now, Madam Speaker, most of us today think of war in the traditional \nconstruct. We fought with tanks, aircraft, ships, and infantry. But, \nagain, we are in a rapidly advancing technological new age. Even in \nthis age of drones and asymmetrical terror threats such as improvised \nexplosive devices, most of us still see our defense through a \nconventional lens.\n  But warfare is changing fast and will continue to change. With the \nminiaturization of nuclear weapons, drones, and other technologies, we \ncould see the potential for widespread destruction accelerate. We are \nentering an era that is unprecedented and unpredictable, born from the \nvery technologies that heretofore ensured our own survival. What has \nemerged, Madam Speaker, is a tripolar world, simultaneously increasing \nboth danger and, interestingly, opportunity.\n  On one pole stands China. As this country ascends to economic \ndominance, China is trying to pair its military clout with military \nprojection in key lanes of commerce. The Communist Party leader, \nPresident Xi, projects himself as both a man of virtue and a man of \ndominance. In fact, The Economist magazine recently called him the \nworld's most powerful man.\n  At another pole stands Russia. Though they face demographic problems, \nRussia has, in many ways, raced ahead of us in weapons technology \nsuperiority. It could be argued that the Soviet era was an aberration, \nan actual aberration, of Russia's long tradition of czarist rule. Seen \nin that light, Putin is a new czar type who has moved past Marxist \nideology--Marxist theology, perhaps we should say--to recover Russian \nnationalistic poetry, purpose, and expansionistic power.\n  The third pole is less of a geographic or ideological proposition. It \nis an expression of higher ideals. Now, in traditional terms, Madam \nSpeaker, we call this the Transatlantic Alliance, but, in broader \nterms, it is people from around the world who are guided by a reasoned \nintuitive sense that all persons have dignity and rights and that the \nsystems of governance and economics ought to be ordered around that \nvery proposition. When a person can exercise excellence for themselves \nin partnership with others in community, a community of possibility \nexists.\n  Because, in America, we believe these values are universal, we also \nbelieve that they are more potent than any ideology or accident of \ngeography. That is the long arc of history--born in former ages and \ntranslated over time to our present day.\n  Now, given our vulnerabilities, we understandably and purposefully \ncommit to technological superiority in weaponry. But, as a singular \nproposition, this is illogical because it cannot hold. The \ntechnological gap is closing. There must be more, and it is found in \ntwo pathways:\n  First, back to this idea of our own internal reflection as a country. \nRecently, we saw a Hollywood elite named Harvey Weinstein brought to \nshame for his manipulative perversions. Interestingly, this country had \na flash of collective conscience. The curtain was raised on Hollywood's \ndark hypocrisy. Almost all Americans were aghast, which, importantly, \nshowed our capacity to value human dignity.\n  Second, Madam Speaker, a healthy national conscience gives us the \ncredibility to reinvigorate and rebuild authentic relationships \nworldwide. By incentivizing good economic models and promoting \ngovernment models that are fair, we can create the conditions for our \nown safety, the world's stability, and the world's security.\n  Madam Speaker, a couple weeks ago, I was on my way home from \nWashington to Nebraska. Driving from the airport, I saw a big, red \npickup truck.\n\n\nNow, that is not a very uncommon site in our State, except that on each \nside of the truck was a pole, and attached to each pole was an American \nflag blowing fiercely in the wind. Now, these flags were a bit tattered \non the edges, but, nevertheless, they were proudly displayed just like \nat that little French town, Sainte-Mere-Eglise. It is my hope that this \nis the third pole that can truly hold for our good and the good of \nothers across the world.\n  Now, Madam Speaker, we have talked a lot about the struggles, but \ncloser to home and made in realtime policy, the House of \nRepresentatives has undertaken a sincere deliberation at the moment to \nassist in a structural change to our current economic construct--a new \ntax deal.\n  Now, this is what Andy from Nebraska wrote me recently. He said that \nhe is very encouraged because ``if it makes it into law, my back-of-\nthe-napkin calculations show it could benefit my family by around \n$5,500. For a family of four making about $85,000 a year, that's a big \ndeal.''\n\n\n  Madam Speaker, Americans do need a break, especially working men and \nwomen trying to get a bit ahead, trying to provide for their families. \nFor many, it is harder and harder. Around 50 percent of Americans live \npaycheck to paycheck. That is not fully a Tax Code problem. It is also \nthe harsh reality of social fragmentation, downward mobility, and the \nrising cost of living.\n  Many forces of globalization have not benefited America, leaving \nmillions behind and all too often forgotten. But tax reform can help, \nas long as it is fair and as simple as possible for the benefit of all.\n  We are living in an age where we cannot push the same old policies \nover and over again and expect them to fit into our 21st century \narchitect of living.\n  Moving forward, I believe that the source and strength of the \nAmerican economy will be in the new urbanism of small business, in \nwhich entrepreneurs from village to city will add value through small-\nscale manufacturing, innovative new products, or brokering in repair \nservices. The conditions for entrepreneurial revival may be right on \nthe horizon.\n  Madam Speaker, though the corporate structure of the 1950s has been \nmade temporarily beguiling by the modest show called ``Mad Men,'' but \nno young person I know yearns to work for a company for 25 years and \ncelebrate at the end with a gold watch. That era is over and our Tax \nCode is based on old constructs of what it means to be in business.\n  So, hopefully, as we work ourselves through this important debate, \nthis bill will be sensitive to the needs of all Americans as it begins \nto push for a modernized revenue construct that no longer enables \ncomplex, lawyered-up, quarterly profit-driven multinationals to \nunjustly benefit, for instance, from lower taxes abroad while taking \nadvantage of tax loopholes here.\n  At the same time, it uses the carrot of lower rates to bring foreign \nprofits back to America so that we can revive the Made in America label \nonce again.\n  Madam Speaker, I have spoken tonight about our challenges both at \nhome and abroad, but we know a truly just and good society can only be \npossible if we are both strong and safe.\n  One day, I was in the airport and something interesting happened. A \nnumber of troops were coming off an aircraft on the jetway. There was \nno announcement over the PA system. It just happened spontaneously. The \nterminal began to break out in applause. It just happened. People \nintuited that something was right here.\n  Of course, many people at this moment in our country's history intuit \nthat something is broken, but they also can sense when things are \nright. We can see it, like when we see our troops or we see a veteran, \nthen our instinct emerges to recognize the nobility of self-sacrifice \nfor one another, our country, and its timeless ideals. Our veterans \nhave done so and our people know so.\n  When it just gets a little too overwhelming, Madam Speaker, ask a \nvet. When we lose touch with the source of our strength and greatness, \ntalk to those who have put even possibly their lives on the line for \nthat true source of American strength. Ask a vet.\n  When it seems as though the problems before us are intractable--how \nwe are going to revive an economy that is good and fair to all; how we \nare going create the stability necessary for the proper engagement and \nhealthy engagement and exciting engagement with people from abroad; how \nwill we create international stability--when it just seems too hard to \nget the mind around it, ask a vet who stood in the small village \noverseas, who may have had to fight their way in, but then offers a \nhand up to those who have been placed in harm's way.\n  This Friday is an important holiday. It is a gift to be able to say \nthank you to our veterans.\n  Madam Speaker, may I inquire as to the amount of time remaining?", "turn": 1, "speaker": "Mr. FORTENBERRY", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "  The SPEAKER pro tempore.
