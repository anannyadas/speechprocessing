Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to the \nRepublican tax plan. As I have said many times before, this plan gives \ntax breaks to the wealthy and corporations, over the needs of American \nfamilies, while adding a predicted $2.1 trillion to the national debt \nover the next decade.\n  Particularly devastating for New Jersey is the partial elimination of \nthe State and local tax deduction. More than 25 percent of New \nJerseyans would face a tax hike over the next decade due to this \nchange.\n  Per person, New Jersey taxpayers paid $3,478 more in Federal taxes in \n2015 than they received from the government, more than any other State. \nNot only would the bill aggravate this disparity in New Jersey, it \nwould also eliminate vital deductions that give relief to those \nburdened with high medical costs, student debt, and unexpected losses \ndue to natural disasters.\n  Mr. Speaker, I will not support a one-sided plan that harms New \nJersey and those who are most in need of tax relief.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. SIRES", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "182", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H8606", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "8", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "OPPOSING REPUBLICAN TAX PLAN", "id": "CREC-2017-11-08-pt1-PgH8606-3", "title": "OPPOSING REPUBLICAN TAX PLAN"}
