Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Naval Station \nMayport as it marks 75 years of service to the United States Navy and \nour nation. This base was born of necessity during World War II and has \nserved the United States Navy and our country almost continuously \nsince. Today, it is one of the Navy's most valued and utilized military \nbases and is the country's third-largest naval surface fleet \nconcentration area in the United States.\n  In April 1939, hearing that the Navy was looking to establish an \naircraft carrier base on the East Coast of the United States, citizens \nof Duval County promised to purchase the land that would become home to \nNaval Station Mayport and give it to the Navy. In July of that year \nthey passed a bond that enabled them to solidify the purchase. In \nDecember\n\n\n1939, the Mayport area was selected for the new base.\n  Lt. Commander Maynard R. Sanders assumed command of the new U.S. Navy \nBase in October 1940. Construction began immediately and Building 1, \nthe Administration Building, was opened on Nov. 4, 1941. Although the \nplans for Mayport being a carrier base were put on hold, the base \nbecame a vital crash and patrol boat training facility.\n  When the war began in earnest, the Atlantic Fleet was dispersed \nleaving the shipping lanes along the East Coast vulnerable to attack \nfrom German submarines. The Porgy Patrol, named after the foul-smelling \nporgy fertilizer processing plant in the Village of Mayport, went on \nconstant patrol hoping to spot submarines and reporting those findings \nto the radio tower so aircraft could be launched. Then, on April 10, \n1942, with citizens watching from the shore in Ponte Vedra, the S.S. \nGulf of America was sunk by the German U-boat U-123. Once again, the \ncivilian population stepped up and the Porgy Patrols expanded to \ninclude shrimp boats, trawlers and yachts, which were converted by the \nGibbs Shipyard, now BAE Systems.\n  The marine side of the base with its protected harbor was \ncommissioned as Naval Station Mayport in December 1942. On April!, \n1944, Mayport's air facility, the Admiral David L. McDonald Field, was \ncommissioned as Naval Auxiliary Air Station (NAAS). After the war, both \nthe marine base and the airfield were decommissioned. The United States \nCoast took over the base and operated small boot camps until 1947. \nBecause its location is so pivotal, less than a year later Naval \nStation Mayport was reactivated, and within three years, its land area \nwas expanded and its runway extended. Several name changes occurred \nover the years and during the Cold War, Mayport became the East Coast \nhome for the Light Airborne Multi-Purpose System (LAMPS) squadrons and \nin 1988 the base was re-designated as a naval air station.\n  Naval Station Mayport began teeming with life once again. Investments \ncontinued and growth in land area, activities and command importance \nenhanced its value. As Mayport expanded, it began to accommodate more \nships and sailors with their families. Its role was crucial during the \nCuban Missile Crisis, providing logistical support as well as an \nadvanced staging area for the Second Marine Division. The base has also \nreceived visits from Presidents Nixon and Reagan.\n  The first carrier to be stationed at Mayport was the USS Tarawa (CVS-\n40) and the last carrier to call Mayport home was the USS John F \nKennedy (CV-67) was decommissioned on March 23, 2007. The Navy \ncontinues to entertain the idea of Mayport as a second carrier site on \nthe East Coast but funding is not available.\n  Today, Naval Station Mayport has undergone major developments in \ntechnology, services and infrastructure, making it well positioned to \nact at a moment's notice. The station's protected harbor can \naccommodate 34 ships and its runway is capable of handling most \naircraft in the military's inventory. It is host to the Navy's United \nStates Fourth Fleet, and is home to the USS Iwo Jima, the USS New York \nand the USS Fort McHenry. On November 7, 2014, Naval Station Mayport \nbecame the East Coast home port for the Navy's newest ships, the \nlittoral combat ships. Mayport has become an asset not just to \nNortheast Florida, but to country.\n  I salute the 75th Anniversary of Naval Station Mayport, which \ncontinues to be a major employer and economic stimulator. More \nimportantly, its personnel continue to contribute through their hard \nwork and dedication to the important missions of our nation's defense. \nNaval Station Mayport has a long history of supporting both the local \ncommunity and the country and will continue to do so for years to come. \nI rise today to congratulate them on 75 successful years and hope \nMayport sailors continue to keep their home anchors in Northeast \nFlorida.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. RUTHERFORD", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 3}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "182", "extension": true, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "E1530-E1531", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "8", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "RECOGNIZING THE 75TH ANNIVERSARY OF MAYPORT", "id": "CREC-2017-11-08-pt1-PgE1530-3", "title": "RECOGNIZING THE 75TH ANNIVERSARY OF MAYPORT"}
