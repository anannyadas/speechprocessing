Mr. Speaker, a front-page story in Roll Call \nabout Chief of Staff General Kelly is as misleading as you can get. It \nclearly is an intentional hit job.\n  The headline read: ``Kelly's Antics Rankle Capitol.'' The article \nclaims, ``GOP and Democratic Members are united'' in not wanting \nGeneral Kelly to speak out. But only one Republican, known for his \ncriticism of this administration, is quoted, compared to four \nDemocrats. Of the four Democrats, three are current Members of \nCongress, and one is a former Clinton administration official.\n  So much for balance, and so much for the article's unfounded claim. \nThis is what passes for journalism these days. When you see stories \nlike this one, you begin to understand why the President is right to \nuse the term ``fake news.''\n  I doubt General Kelly will be intimidated, and I hope he will \ncontinue to speak out.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. SMITH of Texas", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "182", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H8607", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "8", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "ROLL CALL FAKES THE NEWS", "id": "CREC-2017-11-08-pt1-PgH8607", "title": "ROLL CALL FAKES THE NEWS"}
