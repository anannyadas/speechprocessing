Mr. President, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee had \na very important hearing last week regarding the 2001 authorization for \nuse of military force, the law that serves as the legal underpinning \nfor the war against al-Qaida and the Taliban. I am grateful to our \nwitnesses, Secretaries Mattis and Tillerson, for making themselves \navailable to the members of the committee and for the straightforward \nand honest answers they provided to us.\n  As we have gotten further and further away from the September 11 \nattacks that resulted in the passage of the 2001 AUMF, I have urged \nCongress to take a fresh look at that authorization. When four soldiers \ndied recently in Niger, I think most Americans--and even some Members \nof Congress--were shocked to learn that we even had troops in that \ncountry. Our troops were not there under the auspices of the 2001 AUMF, \nbut considering that they were reportedly ambushed and killed at the \nhands of an Islamic State affiliate, questions have been raised about \nwhere our forces are and where they are at war with terrorists versus \nwhen they are simply conducting train-and-equip or other missions of \nthat sort.\n  It was encouraging that nearly every member of the Foreign Relations \nCommittee was in attendance at that hearing where the witnesses \ntestified that the administration believes it has ample authority to \nprosecute the war on terrorism and does not need a new AUMF.\n  I can't say I was surprised to hear that testimony. No \nadministration, Republican or Democratic, will ever willingly cede the \nbroad authority given to the executive branch 3 days after the \nSeptember 11 attack. If they were to say that we need new \nauthorization, they would be conceding that they haven't been acting \nwith authorization all this time. So they are never going to say that \nwe need a new AUMF.\n  What has surprised me is that there are Members of this body, the \nSenate, who are content to let this 16-year old authorization remain in \nplace. Some have even suggested that any updates to the AUMF can be \nmade using the appropriations process. Are we really going to start \nusing policy riders on annual spending bills to approve of sending \ntroops into harm's way? We rarely even vote on individual spending \nbills anymore, let alone controversial policy riders to those spending \nbills. Are we truly willing to leave it to the members of the \nAppropriations Committee to update a law that has put our \nservicemembers into harm's way, particularly those of us on the \nauthorizing committee, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee? I hope \nthat we more jealously guard our prerogatives than that.\n  Our inaction on updating the 2001 law has already relegated the role \nof the Senate in authorizing force to that of a cog in the feedback \nloop. I would submit that we in the Senate ought to aspire to be more \nthan that.\n  For 16 years, Congress has been all too willing to let successive \nadministrations use those broad authorities to address new threats and \nto deploy U.S. troops to new places. Beyond Afghanistan, our troops \nhave deployed all over the world, to places such as Yemen, the \nPhilippines, Somalia, and Libya to fight al-Qaida and its affiliates.\n  We have also sent forces to Syria and back to Iraq to defeat ISIS, a \ngroup that didn't even exist in 2001. We need to fight terrorism \noverseas, and I am not suggesting that the United States should shy \naway from these battles. To the contrary, I believe Congress should do \nits duty in supporting these missions by voting to authorize them.\n  In the 16 years since the passage of the 2001 AUMF, approximately 300 \nMembers of the House who voted on it are no longer with that Chamber. \nIn the Senate, of those Senators who voted on the original AUMF, only \n23 Senators remain in their seats today. That leaves approximately 70 \npercent of the entire Congress that has never cast a vote to authorize \nmilitary force abroad. Yet, over the years, deployments have continued \nto new places, combating new foes.\n  The United States is strongest when we speak with one voice. \nTherefore, Congress must have some buy-in on these missions. Our allies \nand other adversaries need to know that the war on terrorism has the \nsupport of Congress. More importantly, our troops need to know that \nCongress is behind them.\n  I know the concept of passing a new, updated AUMF is a tricky one. \nThis is not a conventional war against a sovereign nation in which \nvictory is easily defined. Instead, we are fighting an ideological \nenemy that has no sovereignty and which, over the years, has moved all \nover the world, resulting in many splinter factions that could change \ntheir name at any time with ease.\n  This new kind of war requires a new kind of authorization, one that \nallows Congress's continued buy-in and increases its oversight. Right \nnow, we have neither of these.\n  After working on this issue for several years, Senator Tim Kaine and \nI have introduced legislation that we think gets us in the right place. \nOur bill would authorize the use of military force against al-Qaida and \nthe Taliban\n\n\nand ISIS. It authorizes force against affiliates of those groups and \nrequires the President to report to Congress when he initiates force \nagainst a new group he designates as being associated with al-Qaida, \nthe Taliban, or ISIS. Military operations can begin as soon as the \nPresident has notified Congress. There is no time-lapse required.\n  If Congress doesn't agree with the President's designation, our bill \nallows a 60-day timeframe during which any Member can bring a \nresolution of disapproval to the floor under expedited procedures, and \nadoption of such measure by both Houses would result in the end of \nmilitary operations against that group.\n  Our bill adopts the same process with regard to geography to allow \nCongress to disapprove of military operations in a particular country. \nI recognize that traditional declarations of war and other \nauthorizations of military force haven't referred to a particular \ngeographic area in which operations can take place. But all of our \nprevious military engagements were against sovereign nations with armed \nforces, not terrorist groups that can pop up in any country at any \ntime.\n  If Congress is going to authorize the use of force, we ought to know \nin which countries U.S. troops are operating. Requiring the President \nto notify Congress when he begins operations against one of these \nterrorist groups in a new country is an important check on the \nexecutive branch to ensure there is no overreach.\n  The bar for disapproving the President's decision is high--\nappropriately so. It would require two-thirds of the House and the \nSenate to disagree with the President on his decisions with regard to \nnew associated forces or new countries.\n  Right now, Congress has very little to say over who or where our \nmilitary fights. The only option available is to cut off \nappropriations, and history has demonstrated that simply is not \nrealistic or appropriate.\n  The most recent example of this, as some of my colleagues will \nrecall, was in 2011, when the Obama administration joined the NATO \noperation to help rebels in Libya topple Muammar Qadhafi. The \nadministration never made the case to Congress as to what U.S. \ninterests were served by U.S. involvement. As a result, many Members on \nboth sides of the aisle publicly opposed our intervention in Libya.\n  Yet, when the clock ran out on the time constraints set forth in the \nWar Powers Resolution, Congress did not turn off appropriations because \nwe can't just pull the rug out from underneath servicemembers when they \nare in harm's way overseas. The ``turning off appropriations'' approach \nsimply hasn't worked in the past and is not likely to work in the \nfuture.\n  We need real congressional buy-in and oversight over a conflict that \nhas morphed considerably since 2001--and which we are now being told is \nmorphing to a new continent. S.J. Res. 43 gives us just that.\n  I should note that the bill also includes a 5-year sunset. The sunset \nis not intended to serve as a notice that the war on terrorism will end \nin 5 years. It is there to require Congress to put its skin in the game \nby voting on authorizing force.\n  The administration has signaled its objection to this provision. They \nthink that the war on terrorism could be undermined if terrorists think \nthey just have to wait us out.\n  I worry more that the lack of congressional buy-in undermines the war \nright here at home. Seventy percent of Congress has no skin in the game \nat all. We are free to criticize the President, whether the President \nis Republican or Democrat. That is not right.\n  We ought to have responsibility here. We are the article I branch. We \nare the branch tasked with declaring war and authorizing use of force. \nWe shouldn't shirk our responsibility. We can't let history repeat \nitself and go for another 16 years without voting for the use of force \nagainst terrorists. That is why I support a sunset on any new or \nupdated AUMF.\n  Perhaps the best feature of the Flake-Kaine measure is that it is \nbipartisan. That is an essential feature. I think we can all agree that \npassing an updated AUMF along party lines is perhaps the only thing \nworse than letting the status quo remain. I commend the chairman of the \nForeign Relations Committee, Senator Corker, for signaling that we will \nmove ahead with the markup of the new AUMF.\n  I think Flake-Kaine is a great start, but I am under no illusion that \nthe process of putting a bill together that can garner widespread, \nbipartisan support will be an easy one. But the longer we wait, the \nhigher the risk becomes that we will render ourselves irrelevant when \nit comes to authorizing force. That is a risk the Senate and Congress \nshould not take.\n  I yield back.\n\n\n                   Recognition of the Minority Leader\n", "turn": 2, "speaker": "Mr. FLAKE", "itemno": 4}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader is recognized.\n\n\n                          Republican Tax Plan\n", "turn": 3, "speaker": "The PRESIDING OFFICER", "itemno": 5}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "S000148", "text": "  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, over the past decade, the American \neconomy has generated enormous wealth for wealth holders but, \npainfully, less work and less pay--fewer good-paying jobs--for workers. \nAverage folks are having a harder time keeping up with the ever-rising \ncosts as the rich get richer and corporate stocks soar.\n  Our economy would surely benefit from the kind of tax reform that \ngives small businesses and working Americans a break, while asking the \nwealthiest among us to pay their fair share. ``Their share'' doesn't \nmean they are doing something illegal; it simply means that as wealth \ngoes up and so much money agglomerates to the top, for the good of the \nsociety, the wealthiest should pay more.\n  Unfortunately, the Republican Party has decided to pursue a partisan \ntax bill that would spin our economy even further out of whack, \nlavishing tax giveaways on the wealthy and corporate America, while \nraising taxes on millions of middle-class families over 10 years.\n  A New York Times analysis found that next year, the House Republican \ntax plan would cause taxes to go up on one-third of all middle-class \nfamilies. Those are families who make--I believe it is between $56,000 \nand $150,000. One out of three in that middle-class, upper middle-class \ngroup is going to pay more in taxes, while those at the highest end get \nhuge breaks. By 2026, taxes would go up on nearly half of all middle-\nclass families.\n  I want to salute someone I almost never agree with--Senator Cruz. At \nleast yesterday, he had the courage of his convictions to say that no \nmiddle-class person should pay more, even in New York and California. \nBut that is not the case with this bill. Large numbers of people \nthroughout the country will pay more. Large numbers of middle-class \npeople and people struggling to the middle class will pay more.\n  So when Speaker Ryan says that under the House plan ``Everyone enjoys \na tax cut all across the board,'' as he did yesterday, he is fibbing. I \nreally want to use the ``L'' word, but to be nice, I won't. But Speaker \nRyan, explain to us how you can say with a straight face: ``Everyone \nenjoys a tax cut all across the board.''\n  Every independent analysis and the more honest Republicans say that \nsome middle-class people--a good number of middle-class people--get a \ntax increase. So Speaker Ryan, take it back. Start telling the truth \nabout your bill. We know you are under pressure, but you have always \nbeen an honorable man, and this tax bill is tying you into a pretzel \nwhen it comes to telling the truth about it.\n  Look at what is done here. The personal exemption, which benefits \nlarge families, is gone. Yes, the standard deduction doubles, but if \nyou have four, five, six children, you still pay more, even before they \nstart whacking your State and local deductibility or your college loan \ndeductibility or your healthcare deductibility.\n  Stunningly, the deduction for catastrophically high medical expenses \nis also gone, meaning that among the hardest hit under this plan would \nbe some of the most vulnerable taxpayers. Eight million Americans \ndeduct their out-of-pocket medical expenses because they are over 10 \npercent of their income. They plan their finances around this \ndeduction. These families have someone with a chronic condition--maybe \nan elderly parent who has Alzheimer's, maybe a family with a young kid \nwho has cancer.\n  I met a lady at the airport yesterday. Her name was Bridget. I didn't \nknow who she was. She came over to me pleading. There was sadness in \nher eyes. She said: My son needs an orphan drug. It is very expensive. \nIf I can't deduct the expenses, I don't know what I\n\n\nam going to do. I won't be able to afford the drug. How can our \nRepublican colleagues be so heartless and cruel? I know that you want \nto reduce taxes on corporations, but why do you have to do it at \nBridget's expense?\n  Of course, the House bill takes an ax to State and local \ndeductibility, a bedrock middle-class deduction that affects nearly \nevery State but hits high tax States, like Virginia, the hardest.\n  Any House Republican who watched the returns in the Virginia \nelections last night must be shaken by the overwhelming Democratic \nturnout in suburban areas. According to pollsters, the No. 1 issue was \nhealthcare, and this deduction goes. But overall, suburban Virginia \nsaid no to the Republican way. Suburban families will be the ones hit \nhardest by the elimination of State and local deductions in States like \nVirginia but also in Washington, New Jersey, California, Illinois, \nMinnesota, and Colorado.\n  Just last night, we learned from reporting that the Senate bill is \nlikely to go even further regarding the State and local deduction--full \nrepeal. There are some from my State in New York saying: Well, we have \na compromise. A, the compromise still eliminates three-fourths of the \ndeduction, but, B, that compromise is going bye-bye. The Senate is \ngoing to get rid of it. You can be sure it won't come back in a \nconference committee.\n  So I say to my House colleagues, particularly those from suburban \ndistricts: Stop the elimination of the State and local deduction now \nbefore it is too late. If it happens and you vote yes on this bill, you \nwill be to blame. There is no way to duck and cover behind the SALT \ncompromise any longer because the SALT tax writers have made clear that \nthey want to repeal it entirely in the Senate. Because of the stricter \nSenate budget rules, the Senate language is likely to win out over the \nHouse language.\n  Make no mistake about it, a full repeal of the State and local \ndeduction is coming down the pike one way or the other. Voting to \nadvance the GOP bill is a vote to fully repeal State and local \ndeductibility. I say to my Republican friends from all those suburban \ndistricts where a high percentage of people use the State and local \ndeduction: If you think the results in Virginia and New Jersey were \nterrible for you, wait until you pass a bill that raises taxes on large \nswaths of middle-class families in your district.\n  The debate over the State and local deduction is illustrative of the \ncentral problem my Republican friends have with their tax bill. Every \ntime you pull in one direction and change something to solve a problem, \nyou have to push in another direction, and you end up creating a new \none. It is like pushing on a balloon.\n  Just this morning, Speaker Ryan said the phaseout of middle-class \ndeductions would never happen. They are only there to ``game the Senate \nrules.'' Well, if there is no phaseout, the real cost of the bill will \nbe much higher. I say to my Senate friends who have talked about making \nsure we don't let the deficit go out of control that Ryan is saying we \nare going to let the deficit go out of control and game the Senate \nrules because the phaseout of middle-class deductions will not happen. \nIf there is no real phaseout, the real cost of the bill will be much \nhigher. It is a tough pill to swallow to anyone in this setting on the \nRepublican side who believes in deficit reduction and who believes \nabout $1.5 trillion--their rule--is about as high as you can go.\n  All of this is because our Republican colleagues are rushing this \nbill through. Something like this takes care. It takes hearings. It \ntakes discussion. It takes experts. It takes affected groups all \nweighing in. That takes a while. That is how it is supposed to work. \nThat is how the Founding Fathers wanted it to work. That is how we did \nit with the last successful major tax reform bill in 1986. I was there, \nand I know.\n  To rush a bill of this magnitude through the Congress in a span of a \nfew weeks, with only one party doing the work, is reckless, it is \nirresponsible, and it will lead to a very bad result. It is why our \nRepublican colleagues have such problems.\n  I repeat my plea to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle. \nTake a step back and consider doing tax reform the right way--\nbipartisan, through the committees, input from both sides. We have \nshown, as in healthcare, when we try, we can work together. The Senator \nfrom New Hampshire is on the floor. She was one of the leaders in that.\n  Earlier this year, we came to a good budget deal. Senators Alexander \nand Murray put together a reasonable compromise on healthcare. We can \ndo it again on tax reform. We Democrats want to do real reform, but our \nRepublican friends must abandon this partisan, secretive, reckless \nprocess that will lead to no good for them and for the country and come \nto the table with Democrats.\n  One final point on the matter, Republicans repeatedly promised that \nthe $1.5 trillion reduction in the corporate tax rate proposed by the \nRyan-McConnell tax plan will lead the average American family to \nreceive a $4,000 raise. Yet corporate profits are already at record \nhighs. Wages are relatively stagnant. So color us skeptical that \nshowering corporations with new tax brackets that will result in them \nhaving even more money will end up creating higher wages for workers. \nFar more likely what it will create is another round of stock buybacks \nand dividends, which, by and large, benefit corporate CEOs and the \nwealthy.\n  You don't have to take it from me. David Marberger is the executive \nvice president and CFO--chief financial officer--of Conagra, which I \nbelieve is a major Fortune 500 company. Here is what he told his \nshareholders this fall, the CFO of Conagra: ``In terms of if there is a \ncorporate tax reduction and there's more cash, we bounce back to our \ncapital allocation''--more stock buybacks.\n  Republicans think a corporate tax cut without guardrails would boost \nwages, and we disagree. Later this morning, Democrats will urge our \nRepublican colleagues to put their money where their mouth is and prove \nus wrong. We will be offering an amendment that would snap back taxes \nto the old corporate rate if corporations actually fail to boost their \nworkers' wages. It is that simple. Put your money where your mouth is. \nThe only thing you are hanging your hat on, on this bill, which so \nhurts so many middle-class people is, well, everyone will get a big \nwage increase because we are reducing the corporate rate. We challenge \nyou to accept our amendment. If the wages don't go up, the corporate \ndecrease in taxes is repealed.\n  We are simply telling Republicans, don't write checks to corporations \nthat their employees can't cash. If Republicans fail to support this \namendment, they will confirm that their tax bill is a farce. They \nreally don't believe it, when it comes to boosting wages for working \nAmericans.\n  Mr. President, one final word on the nomination of Mr. Robb to the \nNLRB. The NLRB protects workers' rights to form or join unions, bargain \ncollectively with their employers, and act concertedly for mutual aid \nor protection. It is not clear to me, from reviewing Mr. Robb's \nbackground, that he believes in the mission of the agency.\n  In his experience as a labor and employment lawyer, he has defended \ncompanies against workers' unfair labor practice allegations, age and \nsex discrimination charges, class action age claims, and wage claims. \nThe website of Mr. Robb's law firm brags about his efforts to delay and \ndefeat union organizing at the Millstone Power Station in Connecticut. \nHe was the lead counsel on the notorious Reagan-era case, which \ndecertified the air traffic controllers' union. That resulted in \nPresident Reagan firing 11,000 traffic controllers and barring them \nfrom Federal service.\n  The general counsel for the NLRB sets the priority cases and \ndetermines when to bring charges against employers. It is a crucial \nrole. Peter Robb's record shows he is not up to this job, and he will \nnot defend workers in an agency designed to defend workers.\n  I will be voting no and urge my colleagues to do the same.\n  I yield the floor.", "turn": 4, "speaker": "Mr. SCHUMER", "itemno": 6}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, it is hard to read or to listen to the \nnews these days without hearing about Russia's interference in our \nAmerican democracy, its influence peddling, and about the \nmisinformation that has\n\n\nbeen spreading on social media. I have bipartisan legislation that \nwould address an aspect of this. This legislation is cosponsored by \nSenator Todd Young, and it is legislation that would give law \nenforcement the tools they need to create greater transparency about \nforeign individuals and entities that are operating in the United \nStates in the interest of other governments. It would make it easier \nfor the public to better track information they are receiving, \nparticularly from governments that are hostile to the United States.\n  This bill would give the Department of Justice necessary authority to \ninvestigate potential violations of the Foreign Agents Registration \nAct, which is also known as FARA. We have heard a lot about that. This \nwas legislation that was passed during the thirties, as there was fear \nabout the rise of Nazism and Hitler in Germany and the effort to spread \npropaganda in the United States.\n  This would allow the American public to clearly trace where \ninformation is coming from and who is paying for it. I think, in this \nage of misinformation, that is especially important to the public.\n  At a time when our law enforcement officials, foreign policy experts, \nand leaders continue to grapple with the extent of Russia's intrusion \ninto our democratic elections, this legislation is more urgent than \never. The need for this legislation is perhaps most clearly \ndemonstrated by the case of Russian propaganda networks like RT America \nand Sputnik International. Both networks continually propagate and \nshare content and programming that are designed to very subtly confuse \nand influence audiences worldwide. If you have ever listened to either \nof those channels, you will know there is just this subtle difference \nin how they present information.\n  In the United States, RT America is available on cable TVs across the \ncountry. It is considered to be one of the most high-profile assets in \nVladimir Putin's vast $1.4 billion propaganda machine.\n  According to an assessment made public by the U.S. intelligence \ncommunity in January, RT is the Kremlin's ``principal international \noutlet,'' and it is integral to Russia's information warfare operations \nacross the globe. The Kremlin selects the staff for RT and closely \nsupervises RT's coverage, including disinformation and false news \nstories designed to undermine our democracy. If you have any question \nabout that, watch RT here. It is on the cable network here in the DC \narea.\n  RT News has publicly boasted that it can dodge our laws by claiming \nto be financed by a nonprofit organization and not by the Russian \nGovernment. Recently, the Department of Justice asked RT America to, in \nfact, register as a foreign agent. RT rejected an entirely reasonable \nrequest from the Justice Department to respect our laws. They refused \nto register.\n  How did we respond? Well, we continued to allow RT America to spread \nits disinformation and false narratives. This is unacceptable. We \nresponded that way because we don't have the teeth we need in the law \nto be able to enforce it. That is what my legislation with Senator \nYoung will do. That is why it is so important. It would strengthen FARA \nby giving the Department of Justice authority to compel foreign \norganizations to produce documentation to confirm funding sources and \nforeign connections. This new investigative authority was requested by \nthe Department of Justice, and it is supported by the Government \nAccountability Office, the Sunlight Foundation, and the Project on \nGovernment Oversight. This is a good government piece of legislation.\n  In fact, if this authority that we have in our legislation were in \nplace today, the Justice Department could immediately investigate RT \nAmerica and publicly expose its ties to the Kremlin. In the absence of \nsuch authority, all the Justice Department can do is ask RT to \nvoluntarily adhere to FARA regulations and hope the propaganda outlet \ncomplies. What are the odds of that? Pretty slim. Clearly, based on \nRT's refusal to comply with FARA, the Kremlin is well aware of the \nlimitations that are inherent in our law.\n  As we wait for this commonsense legislation to move forward, the \nKremlin, RT America, and Sputnik continue to wield their harmful \npropaganda and attempt to influence the American public.\n  Since the publication of the intelligence community's January report \non Russia's interference in our 2016 Presidential election, we have \nlearned that Moscow spent millions of dollars buying ads on social \nmedia sites and search engines, often using the very clips that had \nbeen aired by RT on its YouTube channel.\n  Last week, representatives of American social media companies \ntestified before Congress and illustrated the lengths the Kremlin went \nin order to deceptively spread divisive propaganda, all seemingly \nwithout a trace or any clear indication about the origins of these ads \nand RT's news blasts.\n  The misinformation included numerous reports run by RT News on \nsupposed U.S. election fraud and voting. So they spread, and they \nclearly intended to spread confusion about our elections in 2016 to try \nand encourage people to believe our elections don't work, to undermine \nour election process. They talked about machine vulnerabilities. They \nclaimed the results of U.S. elections could not be trusted and did not \nreflect the people's will. Sadly, too many people saw those stories and \nbelieved they were real.\n\n  These are not just random examples of fake news. These stories are \npart and parcel of a broader influence campaign designed and directed \nby the Kremlin's leadership and pedaled by government-funded trolls in \nSt. Petersburg and other front organizations. So in the same way that \nRussia is building up its military force, its navy, its ability to \noperate in space, and its missile program, it has also built up its \npropaganda campaign in ways that are designed to undermine Western \ndemocracies. If we don't pay attention to this, then shame on us.\n  We are, of course, a resilient democracy. We are confident that our \nvalues and institutions will prevail in the free marketplace of ideas. \nOur Constitution, unlike Russia's, protects the right of individuals \nand organizations to spread Russian viewpoints, disinformation, and, \neven, outright lies. But no organization, including RT America or any \nother front outlet for a country that is hostile to the United States, \nhas the right to conceal a foreign funding source and thumb its nose at \nrequests from our Department of Justice.\n  The American people have a right to know if RT America is a Russian \npropaganda organization that takes its direction from the Kremlin. They \nhave a right to know who is funding those programs and what kind of \nmisinformation they are spreading.\n  To that end, I urge my colleagues to put an end to the Kremlin's \ncharade by supporting the Foreign Agents Registration Modernization and \nEnforcement Act. Let's give the Department of Justice the tools it \nneeds to investigate and expose RT America and to fight back against \nthe Kremlin's interference in our democracy.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.", "turn": 6, "speaker": "Mrs. SHAHEEN", "itemno": 8}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to commemorate the \ncourageous service and selfless sacrifice of our Nation's veterans.\n  Honoring our veterans is one of the greatest privileges I have as a \nSenator, which is why I often attend celebrations in Arkansas to \nacknowledge and salute some of the brave men and women who have served \nour Nation in uniform.\n  I recently had the pleasure to recognize the service and valor of 15 \nArkansas veterans during the Arkansas Military Veterans' Hall of Fame \ninduction ceremony. The class of 2017 inductees comes from all across \nArkansas. These veterans served in conflicts ranging from World War II \nthrough the War on\n\n\nTerror. Together, they have earned some of our Nation's most \nprestigious honors and commendations, including the Purple Heart, the \nBronze Star, the Distinguished Flying Cross, the Legion of Merit, and \nthe Silver Star Medal for gallantry.\n  I also had the opportunity to present three Arkansas veterans with \nthe medals and commendations they had earned when I attended the \nVeterans Day celebration in Fort Smith, AR. I am proud of the work that \nwe do to obtain the service medals and recognition that these heroes \nhave earned.\n  We have also worked hard to honor the efforts of Mr. Errol Severe, of \nEureka Springs, AR, as he strives to preserve and promote the role of \njoint service aviation cadets in the 20th century. Mr. Severe, an Air \nForce veteran, operates the Aviation Cadet Museum, which is the only \nmuseum in the United States that exists exclusively to celebrate the \nteamwork, collaboration, patriotism, and courage of the individuals who \ntrained for and fought in the national aviation effort from 1917 to \n1965.\n  As we recognize our veterans and honor the sacrifice and heroism of \nthose who have been called to serve our Nation in uniform, we must \nrecommit ourselves to fighting on their behalf. As a member of the \nSenate Veterans' Affairs Committee, I am committed to honoring the \npromise made to our veterans.\n  We have made tremendous progress during this Congress. In June, \nPresident Trump signed the Department of Veterans Affairs \nAccountability and Whistleblower Protection Act. This strengthens \naccountability at the Department of Veterans Affairs by allowing the VA \nto dismiss bad employees while protecting those who expose wrongdoing.\n  We are also continuing to improve the Choice Act. Earlier this year, \nwe hosted listening sessions with Arkansas veterans to obtain their \ninput on the strengths and the weaknesses of the program, as Congress \ncontinues to expand access to adequate healthcare options for veterans.\n  In addition, we enhanced the post-9/11 GI bill benefits to increase \neducational opportunities. I am proud to have played a role in crafting \nthis law, along with my colleague from Oregon, Senator Wyden. I am \npleased that he can join me on the floor to recognize the importance of \nthe provision we have championed for several years to fix an oversight \nthat prevented combat-injured members of the National Guard and Reserve \nfrom receiving the same GI bill benefits as Active-Duty military \nmembers. This is a great example of Senators on both sides of the aisle \nworking together to get things done.\n  Fixing this clear oversight in the law that unfairly penalized \nwounded and injured servicemembers and kept them from accruing \neducational benefits they rightly earned while in recovery was a \npriority for both of us because these men and women deserved better. To \ncorrect this injustice, we introduced legislation earlier this year, as \nwell as in the last Congress, and I am pleased that it was included in \nthe comprehensive GI reform bill that was signed into law this summer.\n  While we have made improvements, there is still more that needs to be \ndone, including the expansion of VA services for female veterans. I \nencourage my colleagues to support the Deborah Sampson Act to address \nthese concerns, and I urge VA Secretary Shulkin to implement reforms \nwritten in the bill that don't require congressional action. Our work \nmust continue.\n  Today, my colleague from Indiana, Senator Donnelly, and I will \nintroduce legislation to allow veterans who served in Thailand during \nthe Vietnam war era the opportunity to prove toxic exposure in order to \nqualify for VA benefits.\n  Let me take one more opportunity to thank our veterans and their \nfamilies. This country made a promise to our veterans that we must live \nup to, and I am proud to be able to work for them to ensure that we \nfollow through with our commitment.\n  The men and women who put their lives on the line in defense of our \ncountry deserve our undying gratitude. They also deserve our support \nwhen they transition back into civilian life, which is why we must \nsupport efforts to improve their health, their ability to further their \neducation needs, and to pursue their dreams, just as they fought to \nmake that possible for their fellow Americans. That sentiment is shared \nthroughout this Chamber. For all of our disagreements in Washington, we \ntruly do come together in support of our veterans. That is one area of \nagreement.\n  I thank Senator Wyden for his leadership to ensure equal treatment of \neducation benefits for wounded guardsmen and reservists. I was very \nproud to work with him in support of this efforts, and I look forward \nto working with him in the future.\n  Our guardsmen and reservists are called to defend and protect our \nNation, exactly like Active-Duty members.

Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the men and \nwomen of the Nebraska National Guard. For more than 150 years, the \nNebraska National Guard has been protecting our State and keeping our \nNation safe.\n  Established in 1854, the Guard predates the founding of the State of \nNebraska by 12 years, and those who serve in its ranks today carry on a \nproud tradition. Whenever the Nation calls, Nebraska Guard men and \nwomen have been at the leading edge, responding in times of military \nneed and national crisis.\n  When the shadow of fascism spread across Europe in World War II, \nNebraska's 134th Infantry Regiment was there to bring the light of \ndemocracy back to the continent, liberating the French city of Saint-Lo \nfrom Nazi occupation.\n  When terrorists struck on September 11, the Nebraska National Guard \nwas there to answer the call. In the time since, over 10,000 Nebraska \nGuard soldiers and airmen have deployed to fight the War on Terror and \nserve in defense of our Nation. This means that in the last 16 years, \nthere have been only 3 days when every Nebraska soldier and airman was \nat home with their loved ones. Saying no is not part of the culture of \nthe Nebraska National Guard. When the Nation calls, there is no \nhesitation. They go where the mission requires them to go.\n  At this very moment, we can find Nebraska soldiers and airmen \ndeployed all across the globe, protecting our great Nation. Whether it \nis the dozens of National Guard men and women who are currently \nconducting detainee operations at Guantanamo Bay or those preparing to \ndeploy next year to key positions in the Pacific and the Middle East, \nour Guard stands ready to answer the call.\n  The Guard is also playing an important role in working with our \nallies abroad. Since 1993, the Nebraska National Guard has been linked \nwith the Czech Republic through the State Partnership Program. As \nEastern Europe emerged from the heavy hand of communism, the Nebraska \nNational Guard was there working side by side with their military to \ncollaborate, share, and assist, forging a lasting bond that remains \nstrong to this day. This year marks the 25th anniversary of that \npartnership, and we are all extremely proud of the work our Guard is \ndoing to help bring our democracies together.\n  That spirit of service extends to their operations here in the \nhomeland as well. When hurricanes so tragically struck our neighbors in \nTexas, Florida, the Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico, the Nebraska Guard \nwas there to help. The numbers speak for themselves. In Texas, they \nrescued 461 people and delivered 142,000 pounds of cargo, 6,000 pounds \nof bottled water, and 1,000 pounds of medical supplies. During \nHurricane Irma, 102 members participated in an aviation task force for \nsupport operations. Right now, 58 soldiers and airmen are providing \nassistance to the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico.\n  The scope of their response to these disasters is a testament to \ntheir dedication and showcases the flexibility of the Guard's mission. \nWhether it is responding to domestic emergencies, overseas combat, or \nreconstruction missions, these men and women are there to respond with \nspeed, efficiency, and strength.\n  One of the most impressive things about the Nebraska National Guard \nis that these are regular, everyday citizens who decided to answer the \ncall to serve. They are our neighbors, our\n\n\nfriends, our spouses, sons and daughters, ordinary Nebraskans from \nevery background who decided to put on the uniform and make a \ndifference. That is why I am so honored to have a group of the Nebraska \nNational Guard's men and women visiting Washington today. I wish to \ntake this opportunity to personally thank them, their families, and \nloved ones who support them, and all of our National Guard soldiers and \nairmen for their good service. The Nebraska National Guard has seen a \nlot of change in its history, but one thing remains the same: They \nstand ready to serve.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.", "turn": 14, "speaker": "Mrs. FISCHER", "itemno": 16}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, one of the great privileges of this job and \nthe honor of representing Oregon in the U.S. Senate is seeing the way \nOregonians of all backgrounds and beliefs come together to support \nthose who wear or have worn the uniform of the U.S. military. When it \ncomes to honoring our veterans, Oregonians and so many across the \ncountry think in terms of patriotism, not politics and certainly not \npartisanship. There is not a Democratic or a Republican way to support \nour veterans; there is an American way.\n  Recently, I was very pleased to join Senator Moran and Senator Tester \nto introduce bipartisan legislation that would expand the presumption \nto veterans exposed to Agent Orange in the Korean Demilitarized Zone. \nThe VA currently presumes that veterans who served in the Korean DMZ \nfrom 1968 to 1971 were exposed to Agent Orange, but there is evidence \nthat veterans were exposed to toxins all the way back to 1967. Our \nbipartisan bill would extend the presumption date back, making it \neasier for veterans to apply for and receive care and benefits.\n  It is a good bill. It is a bipartisan bill. As we head to Veterans \nDay, I want to make it clear that I am going to do everything I can to \nmake this bill law soon.\n  Given the fact that we will all be home this weekend, I also want to \ntake a few minutes to discuss another bipartisan piece of legislation \nthat is important to the welfare of our veterans and a proposal that \nrecently became law.\n  A few years ago, I learned that wounded members of the National Guard \nand Reserve were losing out on benefits under the GI Bill for time they \nspent in rehabilitation and recovery. These are men and women who put \ntheir lives on hold to serve our country abroad, and when they suffered \ninjuries in the line of duty, their time spent recovering didn't count \ntoward GI Bill benefits, even though it did for Active-Duty \nservicemembers in the same situation.\n  I think it is an understatement to say that is certainly a real head-\nscratcher, to not stand up for our Guard and Reserve to make sure they \nare not losing out on benefits under the GI Bill for the time they \nspend in recovery and rehab. In effect, the Federal law was adding \ninsult to injury by robbing wounded guardsmen and reservists of \nbenefits they earned and should have been receiving all along. \nEstimates show that more than 20,000 servicemembers across our country \nwere affected.\n  I approached our friend and colleague from Arkansas, Senator Boozman, \nand he graciously agreed to team up with me. Senator Boozman made it \nclear that a fellow from Arkansas and a fellow from Oregon were going \nto team up, leave the politics behind, and fix an injustice. We brought \ntogether a bipartisan group. We worked with the Committee on Veterans' \nAffairs, and we were able to get the bill across the finish line. As of \nnow, wounded guardsmen and reservists will get the education benefits \nthey have rightly earned.\n  Especially today, when people are asking about the divisiveness and \npolarization that now consumes so much of the political debate, I \nwanted Senators to know that I really appreciate Senator Boozman always \ntrying to be constructive and a problem-solver. And this is one problem \nthat is getting solved.\n  The law will apply retroactively, meaning that eligible veterans who \nalready lost out will be made whole. Because it is so counterintuitive \nfor servicemembers to lose benefits for being wounded--just think about \nthat, servicemembers losing benefits for being wounded--many of our \nveterans haven't learned they were missing out. They never knew they \nwere missing out. That is why I am very pleased, as I know Senator \nBoozman is, that our law applies retroactively to all service after the \n9/11 attacks.\n  I think it is true that success has a thousand parents, and if I \nthanked everybody on both sides of the aisle for all the work that went \ninto this important bill, we would be here until suppertime tonight. \nBut I do especially want to thank our colleagues, Senators Markey and \nMcCain. They lent important support along the way, as did Chairman \nJohnny Isakson and Ranking Member Jon Tester. Representative Mark \nTakano of California has also been an exceptional advocate in the other \nbody.\n  I also wish to give a special thank-you to MAJ Steve Warren, a \nDepartment of Defense fellow in my office at the dawn of the process. \nHe is considered a real rock star in terms of working for veterans. He \ndid so much to bring this injustice to light and then worked diligently \ntoward a solution. I think it is the judgment of everybody involved \nthat without Steve's inspiration and perspiration, it would have been \nhard to see this injustice fixed and our even being here today, as we \nhead to Veterans Day, to talk about it.\n  I close by way of saying that in this time of partisan rancor and the \nback-and-forth that consumes so much of the political debate in \nWashington, I think what we have shown with this piece of legislation \nand its importance is that our veterans continue to be a unifying \nforce. This good will comes from a deep respect for the All-Volunteer \nForce and for the sacrifices made by military families. It also stems \nfrom an appreciation for the role our veterans play in so many \ncommunities. In Oregon, our vets are small business owners, coders, \nmill workers, and educators. They help students at the Youth Challenge \nProgram in Bend, and they help us fight fires. And suffice it to say, \nthis year those fires were big, they were long, they were brutal, and \nwe saw fires nobody could have even believed could happen, such as the \none that jumped the Columbia River.\n  It doesn't mean that Congress, even with this legislation, always \ngets it right with respect to veterans. There is a whole lot more to be \ndone, particularly ensuring timely access to top-quality healthcare \nthrough the VA or outside of it and ensuring that guardsmen and \nreservists get treated fairly and equitably.\n  I want to say this again on the eve of our taking time out \nspecifically to honor veterans--although in our State, we believe that \nevery day is really Veterans Day--I want to renew my pledge to the \npeople of Oregon that I and my staff will keep working until our vets \nreceive the care and treatment they have earned. We hope the success of \nour GI Bill Fairness Act demonstrates what can be done when the \nCongress sets aside all this business of trying to point score on \npartisanship and puts veterans first.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.", "turn": 16, "speaker": "Mr. WYDEN", "itemno": 18}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I come to the floor to do what the Trump \nadministration has failed to do; that is, to stand up for working \nfamilies and fight for an economy that actually works for all, not just \nfor the richest among us.\n  On the campaign trail, President Trump made promise after promise to \nworkers. He promised to put them first and bring back good-paying jobs \nto their communities. Yet, since day one of his Presidency, we have \nseen him do just the opposite. His administration has rolled back \nprotections for workers and families and prioritized corporate profits \nover working families' financial security.\n  He has put forth nominee after nominee who puts industry interests \nabove the needs of families, like William Wehrum, President Trump's \nnominee to lead the EPA's Office of Air and Radiation. Mr. Wehrum is \nsomeone who\n\n\nhas worked to undermine the core mission of the office he would \noversee. He is a nominee who has demonstrated a willingness to side \nwith protecting Big Business instead of protecting our Nation's most \nvaluable resources and whose independence is truly in question.\n  Unfortunately, when looking at President Trump's record as a \nbusinessman, these decisions do not come as a surprise. President Trump \nspent decades as a real estate developer, cheating workers and \ncontractors out of their hard-earned pay, and he refused to allow his \nown hotel workers to join together and advocate for safer working \nconditions and better wages.\n  President Trump's vision of our economy is one in which workers bear \nthe burden, and the people who live in gilded towers get the benefit. \nThe contrast with Democrats could not be clearer. Last week, Democrats \nrolled out an ambitious agenda to reform our labor laws to, once again, \nempower workers to join together, make their voices heard, and fight \nfor better wages and benefits.\n  Currently, it is extremely difficult for workers to seek justice when \ncorporations violate their rights, and if we want to rebuild the middle \nclass, we have to change that because workers having the right to \norganize and join unions helped to build the middle class we have \ntoday. For many workers in the 20th century, good union jobs helped \nthem to support their families and climb the economic ladder, but over \nthe past few decades, our economy has worked in favor of corporations \nand those at the top. As corporate management and special interests \nhave undermined workers in their right to collectively bargain, we have \nseen, of course, a decline in unions and union membership across the \ncountry. This has allowed President Trump and billionaires like him to \ntake advantage of their workers, and it has given workers little \nrecourse in standing up and fighting for better working conditions.\n  The preamble of the National Labor Relations Act clearly states that \nit is the policy of the United States to encourage collective \nbargaining to give workers a voice, allowing them to speak up for fair \nwages and safe working conditions, and it is the responsibility of the \nNLRB to ensure that workers' rights are protected so they are not taken \nadvantage of. The NLRB gives workers the opportunity to file charges \nagainst corporations when they are illegally fired or retaliated \nagainst for exercising their rights, and because President Trump's own \nbusinesses have had complaints filed against them numerous times, it is \nso critical now that the Board is independent and committed to that \ncore mission.\n  Unfortunately, I have serious concerns about Mr. Robb's commitment to \nthat core mission and to supporting workers' rights so more families, \nnot fewer, have financial security. Mr. Robb has spent most of his \ncareer as a corporate lawyer, representing Big Business and seeking to \nlimit the rights that workers are guaranteed under the National Labor \nRelations Act--the very law he is now asking to be in charge of and \nenforce. He has defended companies against unfair labor allegations, \nage and discrimination charges, and unfair wage and hour claims. If he \nis confirmed, Mr. Robb will have the sole decision-making power as to \nwhich cases will be brought before the NLRB.\n  Given his long history of defending corporations, I don't believe \nworkers can trust him to act with their best interests at heart or to \nstand up to President Trump and his vision of an economy that works for \nthose at the top but that undercuts workers' wages, safety, and rights.\n  I will be voting no on Mr. Robb's nomination, and I urge my \ncolleagues to do the same. I know every single one of my colleagues has \nspoken to working families in his State who feel left behind today--\nfamilies who work full time and who are saving what they can. They are \nstruggling to make ends meet. It is time that we stop prioritizing \ncorporate profits and start focusing on those workers and our middle \nclass. We can only strengthen our economy if we give workers a voice in \nit.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.", "turn": 20, "speaker": "Mrs. MURRAY", "itemno": 23}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, as the world now knows, there was a tragic \nshooting in Sutherland Springs, TX, last Sunday, which took the lives \nof 26 innocent people and injured 20 more. On Monday evening there was \na prayer vigil for those victims. The community gathered to pray and to \npay their respects to the deceased.\n  There are two people in particular who were in attendance, whom I \nwant to highlight: Stephen Willeford and Johnnie Langendorff. I \nmentioned them yesterday, and perhaps you have seen them on the news, \nbut I have been thinking a lot about them lately. In addition to the \ntragedy, this was really one of the things that gives you a little hope \namidst the terrible circumstances. Stephen, of course, is the man who \nresponded to the shooter's rampage by grabbing his rifle and running \ntoward the First Baptist Church. Johnnie drove the truck that chased \nthe gunman down at high speed. In typical Texas fashion, these two \ngentlemen don't consider themselves to be heroes, but I consider them \nto be heroes. They said that they were just doing what needed to be \ndone. Johnnie said it was an ``act now, ask questions later'' kind of \ndeal.\n  I think we in Washington should take more of our cues from people \nlike Johnnie and Stephen. We should show courage, track down anything \nthat is not right, and do our very best to fix it. In particular, \nStephen Willeford--maybe you have to be a Texan or an Alaskan to really \nappreciate what he did. From what I have read, he was an NRA-certified \nshooting instructor. He apparently heard the shooting at the church, \ngrabbed his gun and went there and, basically, ended up stopping the \nshooter from killing more people.\n  The shooter apparently had accumulated enough ammunition to do a lot \nmore damage than he did, but, thanks to the intervention of this \nconcerned citizen, this person who was willing to put himself in harm's \nway actually shot the shooter and discouraged him from doing more. But \nfor his actions, a lot more people would have died on that terrible, \nterrible Sunday.\n  The police can't be everywhere all of the time. That is one reason \nwhy, in my State and around the country, we believe that citizens ought \nto be able to defend themselves under appropriate circumstances.\n  We now know that the gunman was court-martialed by the Air Force and \nconvicted of serious domestic abuse. Under current Federal law, this \nshould have prohibited him from ever purchasing a firearm. The fact \nthat it didn't means that we need to figure out why Federal law wasn't \nfollowed and make darn sure that the relevant information is always \nuploaded into the background check databases.\n  There were multiple errors--human and systematic errors--that should \nhave prevented this shooter from ever buying a firearm. He unlawfully \npurchased four firearms that he wasn't permitted to purchase. Federal \nbackground checks did not turn up his Air Force conviction for domestic \nviolence, a felony, for fracturing the skull of his infant stepson. \nThese convictions were not uploaded on the NICS Federal database.\n  I plan to introduce legislation--and I have been talking to a number \nof colleagues on both sides of the aisle who are interested in \nproviding a solution to this problem, but we are going to introduce \nlegislation to ensure that all Federal departments and agencies, \nincluding the Department of Defense, upload the required conviction \nrecords. My legislation will also encourage to the greatest extent \npossible under the Constitution that State and local governments do the \nsame.\n  We all remember the terrible shooting that occurred at Virginia Tech \na few years ago by a person who had already been adjudicated to be \nmentally ill by the State, but because the State did not upload that \ninformation into the Federal database when he went to buy a firearm, \nthere was no hit, no disqualifier that appeared that would have \nprevented him from buying that\n\n\nfirearm in the first place. We need to make sure those systems work \nevery time.\n  What Sutherland Springs has exposed is that the Federal Government is \nfailing to comply with reporting requirements. This is unacceptable, \nand it must change.\n  Yesterday, Gen. David Goldfein, the Chief of Staff of the Air Force, \ncame by my office, and I am grateful to him for that. I told him that \nit must have been one of his worst days when he found out that the Air \nForce had failed to notify the Federal authorities of the information \nthat would have disqualified this individual from buying a firearm. He \nappropriately expressed grave concern over the fact that the gunman's \nconvictions were not sent to the NICS database. He pledged to get to \nthe root of the problem, and I believe him.\n  It is worth noting that we have tried to address similar problems \nbefore, and we can do it again. In 2015, I introduced a bill called the \nMental Health and Safe Communities Act, which addressed a related \nissue, and that was the failure of State and local authorities to \nupload valuable mental health records into this same NICS database.\n  I think there is a bipartisan willingness in this Chamber to work on \nproblems inherent in the sharing of these records, and I hope my \ncolleagues will join with me in supporting this new legislation once it \nis introduced. We are shooting for the first part of next week. We owe \nit to the men and women and the families of Sutherland Springs to make \nsure that our laws are enforced and that individuals like this shooter \nwith a history of violence do not gain illegal access to firearms.\n\n\n                               Tax Reform\n\n  Mr. President, I want to address the work that the House Ways and \nMeans Committee is currently engaged in and what we will be doing in \nthe U.S. Senate to reform our overly complex, burdensome, and self-\ndestructive tax system. I think there is a lot of momentum gathering \neach day.\n  Yesterday, Senator McConnell, the majority leader, commented on our \nonce-in-a-generation opportunity to overhaul our Tax Code. To \naccomplish this goal, both the House and the Senate are moving forward \non different proposals.\n  This week, the House Ways and Means Committee completed its first 2 \ndays of discussing the House bill unveiled last week called the Tax \nCuts and Jobs Act. At the same time, the Senate Finance Committee is \ncontinuing its work too. Chairman Hatch will continue to guide the \ncommittee through an open process, and members will have the chance to \nengage in productive discussions and debate. That will start once the \nchairman's mark or the base bill is released, hopefully by later this \nweek. Perhaps as early as next week, we will begin the process in the \nSenate Finance Committee of marking up that bill, with Senators \noffering amendments and voting on it. Once both Houses of Congress have \ncompleted their work, my hope is that we can get this bill on the \nPresident's desk by Christmas.\n  Some of our colleagues across the aisle, instead of contributing to \nthe solution to this overly complex and self-destructive Tax Code, have \nbeen lobbing insults from their partisan bunkers, even though many of \nthem have endorsed many aspects of the plans in years past. For \nexample, early on, interestingly, there was criticism of our desire to \nmake our global tax system more competitive so that more businesses \nwill move their manufacturing facilities back to the United States and \nso that we can stamp more of their products ``Made in America,'' \ncreating more jobs here. It is ironic because they were criticizing us \nfor giving tax relief to businesses when people like President Barack \nObama, back in 2011, had endorsed the very same concept, not to mention \nthe ranking member of the Senate Finance Committee, Senator Wyden, and \nSenator Schumer. All of them have endorsed similar proposals, yet they \nwere quick to criticize us for doing exactly the same things that they \nthemselves had previously endorsed. Unfortunately, our Democratic \nfriends are quick to criticize our plans not just because they disagree \nwith them on the merits but simply because it is our proposal and they \nare not interested in working with us across party lines.\n  This is really a shame and a lost opportunity. People are crying out \nfor Democrats and Republicans to work together in the best interests of \nthe country. Unfortunately, our Democratic friends are simply ignoring \nthe urgency of the situation--the stagnation of American workers' wages \nand couples finding it harder to start families or, once they do, pay \nfor a college education.

We \ncan't let them stop us because hard-working families are waiting.

Mr. President, Donald Trump has consistently made \npromises to the American people that he refuses to keep. He says one \nthing and does the exact opposite. His empty promises have already hurt \nmillions of people across the country, from our seniors who depend on \nMedicare and Medicaid, to the LGBTQ community he promised to protect \nand Dreamers living in fear of deportation.\n  Now, with the nomination of Peter Robb to serve as the General \nCounsel at the National Labor Relations Board, or NLRB, Donald Trump \nhas broken yet another promise--this time, to fight for and protect \nAmerican workers. As an independent agency, the NLRB has an important \nmission to enforce our Nation's labor laws, protect American workers, \nand safeguard their right to organize collectively.\n  The NLRB's mission is not to ignore our Nation's labor laws, to go \nafter American workers, or to weaken their right to organize. Yet Peter \nRobb's career has been dedicated to doing all the things that NLRB is \nnot about.\n  Joining the anti-union, anti-worker forces, President Trump has \nconsistently nominated people to the NLRB who are best positioned to \ndestroy and undermine the core functions of the agency itself. Earlier \nthis year, President Trump forced through two management-side lawyers \nto create an anti-worker majority on the NLRB.\n  Today the Senate is debating the nomination of someone who has spent \nhis entire legal career fighting to screw over the very workers the \nNLRB is supposed to protect. If confirmed as General Counsel, Mr. Robb \nwill be responsible for supervising nearly 1,500 agents investigating \nand prosecuting unfair labor practice cases and overseeing elections \nwhere workers decide whether or not to unionize. This is a position\n\n\nof great consequence for millions of workers across our country, and \nthey deserve someone much better than Peter Robb.\n  Mr. Robb has spent his career defending management and employers from \nworkers fighting to form a union, unionized workers on strike, and \nworkers who brought forward discrimination and disability claims. You \ndon't have to take my word for it. Mr. Robb's biography on his own law \nfirm's website tells the story clearly:\n\n       [His] extensive experience includes advising on mergers/\n     acquisitions, plant closings, labor contract negotiations \n     (both large and small), managing lockouts and strikes, \n     securing labor injunctions, discrimination issues and \n     disability claims.\n       His litigation includes defending employers from unfair \n     labor practice charges, age and sex discrimination charges, \n     class action age claims, and wage/hour claims as well as \n     bringing suits against labor organizations. With such vast \n     experience and a no-nonsense approach, Peter's clients look \n     to him for sharp advice, rigorous representation and powerful \n     litigation.\n\n  That is a description on his own law firm's website.\n  Mr. Robb cut his teeth busting unions and retaliating against workers \nas lead counsel at the NLRB in the early 1980s when President Reagan \ndecertified the air traffic controllers union, fired 11,000 air traffic \ncontrollers, and barred them from Federal service. More recently, he \nrepresented Dominion Energy's successful attempt to defeat a union \norganizing campaign at a power station in Connecticut.\n  Management and corporations have a right to hire lawyers like Mr. \nRobb who will vigorously represent their interests, but Mr. Robb is \ncertainly not the right person to lead an agency whose mission is to \nprotect workers' rights, not to go after those rights tooth and nail. \nMr. Robb's record clearly demonstrates that he will side with powerful \ncorporations and special interests over workers who lack the resources \nto defend themselves.\n  Unions built the middle class in Hawaii and across our country. \nInstead of confirming another management protector at the NLRB, we \nshould be working together to protect workers and make it fairer for \nthem to form and to join a union, which is their right.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in opposing this nominee.\n  I yield the floor.", "turn": 31, "speaker": "Ms. HIRONO", "itemno": 36}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise to talk about the affordable \nhousing crisis that is gripping our Nation. When I say ``crisis,'' I \nmean I know that people here are on the precipice of talking about what \nwe are going to do in response to Hurricanes Harvey and Irma and Maria, \nand I would like to say, the housing crisis that will exist in the \naftermath of those hurricanes is real, but there are also even greater \nimplications from the housing crisis that exist today without those \nhurricanes, and it is only going to continue to grow and get worse \nuntil we deal with it.\n  This past February, more than 2,000 families packed into the New \nHolly Gathering Hall in South Seattle. Each family was hoping to hear \nits name called. It wasn't a contest. It wasn't a game. It wasn't the \nlottery. It was a lottery to see if families could get affordable \nhomes.\n  The Mercy Othello Plaza would soon open 108 affordable housing units. \nThat is hardly a match for the more than 2,000 families who were \ninterested in trying to get into one of those affordable units. Based \non the numbers alone, their chance of getting an affordable home was \nlower than an applicant's chance of getting into Harvard.\n  Ninety-five percent of the families attending that night left \ndisappointed, continuing to search for affordable housing. This is just \none story of how the affordable housing crisis is gripping our Nation. \nI am sure every one of my colleagues in the Senate could talk about a \nstory they have heard in their State because this crisis impacts every \nState. It impacts every community, both urban and rural alike.\n  As I have traveled across the State of Washington, I have seen some \nof the most hard-hit areas for affordable housing. I even have veterans \nreturning home not being able to find affordable housing. I have seen \nan aging population living longer and also not having the resources \nwhen looking for affordable housing. I have seen young workers who want \nto be close to where their employment is and yet having to drive so far \naway because that is the only place they could find affordable housing. \nWe have seen homelessness in numbers that harken back to previous days \nwhen we had a true recession.\n  The most damning part of the housing crisis is, we know how to solve \nit. We just need the courage to act.\n  For decades, the housing growth was the most stimulative part of our \neconomy. Throughout the 1980s, housing was 18 percent of GDP. Today \nthat number has dropped to just 15 percent. When people discuss tax \nreform and GDP growth, housing is still one of the ways that economists \nwill tell us that we can grow GDP.\n  In the sixties, seventies, and eighties, if somebody asked, How do we \nstimulate our economy, usually a cheer would go up for housing, but \nsince the economic downturn, we haven't heard that cheer. In fact, it \nis almost as if we have forgotten how stimulative housing is to our \neconomy.\n  The total number of houses built between 2007 and 2016 total just 8.9 \nmillion units, which is far below the 15 million-plus average for every \n10-year period through the seventies and nineties. We are off the pace \nof what it takes to provide affordable housing. As a result, the \nvacancy rates and inventories of homes for sale have also fallen. The \nnational vacancy rate--which is the number of homes for sale--has \nreceded to the 2000 level, erasing all the runup we saw in the housing \nboom. Moreover, homeownership in the United States is now at its lowest \nrate since the 1960s.\n  Twenty million American families, including 11 million renters, are \nnow spending more than half of their income on housing. That means less \nmoney for other essentials like food and healthcare and gas.\n  The National Low Income Housing Coalition tells us that 7.4 million \nmore available affordable homes are needed because we have seen an \nincrease of 60 percent since the year 2000 in the need for affordable \nhousing.\n  So the United States has become a rent-burdened economy. If we don't \naddress this crisis, the problem is only going to get worse. In fact, \none study found that if we don't address this crisis, we are going to \nsee another 25-percent increase in the number of Americans spending \nmore than half of their income in rent.\n  I know my colleagues on the other side of the aisle in the House of \nRepresentatives are talking about what they want to do in tax reform. I \nwould say they should look at this data as it relates to where we are \nwith homeownership and housing and things that would eliminate the \nprivate activity bonds--one of the key drivers of affordable housing \nproduction. It would be a big mistake if they got rid of that. \nObviously, there are units of affordable housing that are being planned \nand built right now. In fact, one estimate is that over 1,000,000 units \nwouldn't be completed just because of the House provision.\n  Obviously, limiting the mortgage interest deduction for new \nhomeowners could potentially increase taxes on homeowners and thereby \nlimit the number of people who could afford a home. Almost one-third of \ntaxpayers nationally claim the property tax deductions. They could also \nsee an impact to that. I hope our House colleagues and our Senate \ncolleagues will see, in light of the housing crisis, what a terrible \nidea those things are.\n  How did we get to this crisis as it exists now? Part of the issue was \ndemand. For starters, the 2007 housing crash pushed millions of \nfamilies into the rental market and reduced wages on working families. \nThe demand for rental housing skyrocketed.\n  Over 7 million Americans lost their homes to foreclosure, and they \ndemanded more affordable places to live. Today the homeownership rate \nis the lowest in our Nation since the 1960s. The last 10 years have \nseen the largest gain of renters on record. The demand for rental \nhousing shows no sign of slowing down.\n  Millennials, like many of the young people we see who want to be \nclose to jobs in our burgeoning economy, are forced to rent instead of \nown. They are seeing that challenged, in big numbers, by the fact that \nthere is not enough supply.\n\n\n  At the same time demand was going up from returning veterans, from \naging seniors, from workplace needs, from many more people needing \naffordable housing after being pushed out of the homeownership market--\nat the same time demand was going up, supply failed to keep pace. \nAffordable housing stock is being, and was being, converted to market \nrate-based units. That means they got taken out of the affordability \nframework.\n  A new report found that the number of apartments being deemed \naffordable for low-income families dropped 60 percent over the last 6 \nyears.\n  With all this pressure and demand of people falling out of home and \nback into the market and pushing things down, we saw so many units that \nwere affordable units get transferred over to market-based rates and \nthereby losing supply.\n  The new production of affordable housing has not filled the gap, and \nproduction of affordable housing is at its lowest 10-year production \nrate on record since 1974. It, too, has played a role in this problem.\n  The combination of increased demand and lack of production has caused \nthe explosion in our affordable housing crisis. The number of Americans \nfacing extreme unaffordability--that means they are paying more than 50 \npercent--has gone from 7 million Americans to 11.2 million Americans. \nThat is a 60-percent increase in the number of people in the United \nStates who are in this area of extremely unaffordable rates for \nhousing.\n  While I know we are going to discuss natural disasters and helping \ncommunities recover--everywhere from the families who have been \nimpacted in Florida, in Texas, and various places--we also have to look \nat the issue of affordable housing everywhere from Seattle and Portland \nand San Francisco to all the way across the country, to Philadelphia \nand Miami and many other places.\n  In the aftermath of Katrina, Congress passed an expansion of the low-\nincome housing tax credit, and it built 28,000 affordable units on the \ngulf. I know my colleagues will want to do something similar for Texas \nand the Gulf States to make sure we are doing something, but we need to \nunderstand that at the time of Katrina, there was a need due to more \nthan 275,000 homes destroyed by that hurricane. Building 28,000 units \nwas barely a blip.\n  The low-income housing tax credit helped rebuild some units, but it \ncame nowhere close to solving the housing crisis in New Orleans. Market \nrates in New Orleans are 35 percent higher after the storm, and 37 \npercent of households are paying more than half of their income in \nhousing. Now, 12 years later, another disaster has hit, and we are \ngoing to try to address this crisis, but the housing burden for \nextremely low-income families in Texas and the major metro areas of \nTexas is among some of the worst in the Nation. That was before the \ncrisis. Before the actual impact of hurricanes, Texas was already at a \ncrisis point.\n  Texas has only 29 affordable units for every 100 low-income \nhouseholds looking for those options. Houston is the third worst in the \ncountry for housing availability for extremely low-income people. Now \nfamilies from Florida to Puerto Rico are going to also be finding a \nvery difficult situation.\n  Expanding the tax credit could help, but we have to do more than just \nexpand the tax credit for those disaster States. We need a very big \nsystematic investment in affordable housing all across the United \nStates, and expanding the low-income housing tax credit is one way to \ndo that. The good news is, we have good bipartisan support for the low-\nincome housing tax credit enacted in 1986. It helped build 3 million \nrental units across this country over the last 30 years. If you want to \nmake a dent in this crisis, both in response to the hurricanes and the \ncrisis that already existed, we need to begin filling that gap by \nincreasing the credit.\n  That is why I joined Senator Hatch in introducing the Affordable \nHousing Tax Credit Improvement Act, something that would help us build \nhundreds of thousands of new units in the next 10 years. I am glad \nSenators Wyden, Portman, Sullivan, Merkley, Scott, Bennet, Collins, \nKaine, Heller, Leahy, Shaheen, Murray, Schumer, Murkowski, Young, \nGraham, Schatz, Booker, Hassan, Isakson, and Sanders are all \nsupporters.\n  We have good, bipartisan support from people who understand that this \ncrisis is real and that it is only going to grow. But we also know that \nthe additional tax credit would create almost 450,000 new jobs over the \nnext 10 years. That is because housing is stimulative to the economy. \nConstruction alone supports over 2 million jobs. And it helps by making \nsure that the economic impact to GDP is realized now through this \ninvestment.\n  It also helps us save money as an economy and a country by putting a \nroof over people's heads. One of the reasons I was so excited to work \nwith Senator Hatch on this was because in his home State of Utah, they \nmade such great progress in dealing with their homeless veteran \npopulation. The community decided that by putting a roof over someone's \nhead, they actually helped lower overall costs. One study found that \nplacing people in affordable housing lowered Federal Medicaid \nexpenditures by an average of 12 percent, and a University of \nPennsylvania study found that taxpayers could save $16,000 per homeless \nperson who was placed in affordable housing.\n  So we need to act. We need to realize that housing provides an \ninvestment in job creation and has historically contributed between 2 \nto 4 percent of GDP growth since the 1980s; that it is an underpinning \nof our economy; and that we need to make sure that our Tax Code works \nand make sure that people are purchasing homes as well as finding \naffordable housing.\n  As our colleagues deal with the end-of-the-year policy issues and \ndeal with our response to these storms, I hope we will realize that \nthis underlying crisis also needs attention. We have worked on a \nbipartisan basis in the past to address it, and we can work on a \nbipartisan basis in the future to both stimulate our economy and solve \nthese problems.\n  Ninety percent of the affordable housing units being built in the \ncountry use these tax credits, so it is only by extending the tax \ncredits, putting a roof over people's heads, that we are going to be \nable to deal with this crisis. The good news is, it helps us save money \nand it helps us with GDP growth.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  I yield the floor.", "turn": 33, "speaker": "Ms. CANTWELL", "itemno": 38}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Moran).

Mr. President, later today we will start the process of \nvoting on the confirmation of William Wehrum for Assistant \nAdministrator for the Environmental Protection Agency's Office of Air \nand Radiation. I take this time to urge my colleagues to reject this \nnominee and vote against his confirmation.\n  The EPA Assistant Administrator for the Office of Air and Radiation \nsupervises national programs and policies for regulating air pollution \nand radiation exposure. Notably, this office administers the Clean Air \nAct.\n  As a member of the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, \nI once again find myself using my voice to say that science and public \nhealth, not partisan politics, should drive the confirmation process.\n  If confirmed, Mr. Wehrum is expected to play a leading role in \ndismantling climate change regulations. Since the Supreme Court \ndecision in Massachusetts v. EPA in 2007 ruled that carbon dioxide and \nother greenhouse gases are dangerous air pollutants, OAR is the office \nthat accepted the endangerment finding and developed the Clean Power \nPlan to address carbon pollution.\n  Given the Trump administration's own admission--or lack of \nsuppression--in the latest update to the National Climate Assessment \n``that it is extremely likely that human activities, especially \nemissions of greenhouse gases, are the dominant cause of the observed \nwarming since the mid-20th century,'' it should be common sense to \nnominate and confirm Administrators who care about our environment and \nour future, including acting on climate change. It is inexcusable to \nconfirm those who disagree with that. I am not convinced that Mr. \nWehrum will act on carbon pollution or any other air pollutant.\n  It would take an extraordinarily independent Assistant Administrator \nto resist the current course at the EPA under EPA Administrator Scott \nPruitt.\n\n\nWe know that we have a challenge at the top. We need as the person to \nhead this Agency a person of integrity who will stand up for what \nscience tells us we need to do in protecting air quality. I would argue \nthat Mr. Wehrum is not that person.\n  Let me go over some of the challenges we face.\n  For example, in January of 2017, the EPA issued itself a 6-month \nextension to respond to Maryland's Good Neighbor petition. The petition \nalleges that 36 powerplants in five neighboring States are preventing \nMaryland from meeting its own obligations under the Clean Air Act. That \ndeadline expired with no EPA action on the petition.\n  On September 27, 2017, Maryland filed suit against the EPA.\n  On October 5 of this year, the Chesapeake Bay Foundation filed a \nsimilar lawsuit because pollution from powerplants is a source of \nnitrogen pollution in the Chesapeake Bay.\n  On October 27, 2017, the EPA denied a separate Maryland petition \nasking the EPA to add nine States to the Ozone Transport Region, \nalleging that these States contribute to the violation of the 2008 \nozone national ambient air quality standards.\n  In its response to the petition, the EPA determined that expanding \nthe Ozone Transport Region is ``not appropriate at this time'' because \nexisting rules will achieve reductions in emissions. The EPA's response \nstates that ``better-targeted approaches, such as those under the Clean \nAir Act's good neighbor provision, would be more effective in \naddressing the 2008 ozone targets.''\n  The EPA's reasoning to deny the Ozone Transport Region petition--that \nexisting rules will adequately address transported pollution--is \npredicated on the sincere implementation of those rules. In fact, \nMaryland did utilize--we did utilize--a ``better targeted approach.'' \nMaryland filed a Good Neighbor petition last November that was ignored \nfor 1 year, prompting the lawsuit against the EPA.\n  Based on his professional history and testimony, I do not have reason \nto believe that Mr. Wehrum will ensure that existing rules will \nadequately address air pollution. While he worked at the EPA during the \nGeorge W. Bush administration, Mr. Wehrum attempted to direct the \nAgency's air requirements to favor markets, earning praise from \nindustry groups he would later represent in private practice. How can \nwe ask Mr. Wehrum to objectively administer the Clean Air Act after a \ncareer spent on one side?\n  Mr. Wehrum has 20-plus years working for the industry as a lobbyist. \nHe has a record of ignoring science in the recommendations that he \nmade. There are examples of where he absolutely disagreed with expert \ngroups--just to give one example, the Academy of American \nPediatricians' assessment on mercury and air toxins submissions. Mr. \nWehrum took issue and disagreed with their findings.\n  He was seen as an unacceptable choice in 2007 when he was nominated \nto lead the same Agency by President Bush, and his nomination was \nwithdrawn over Democratic opposition. So this is not the first time we \nhave had a chance to deal with Mr. Wehrum for this position. In the \ninterim, he has only continued his work to advance industry by \nadvocating for weakening the Clean Air Act.\n  I will continue to stand up for the rights of Marylanders and all \nAmericans to air that is safe to breathe and a climate that is livable, \nand all of us can help in that regard by rejecting this nominee.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.", "turn": 35, "speaker": "Mr. CARDIN", "itemno": 40}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, 1 year ago, the American people went to \nthe polls. The American people demanded a change. They demanded a \nchange from 8 years of too little economic growth and too much \ngovernment control and regulations. The effect was immediate, and the \neffect was incredible.\n  In the past year, we have gotten a lot of very good news about the \nAmerican economy. Right after the election, businesses became much more \noptimistic about the direction of our country and they started hiring. \nLast Friday, we learned that in the United States we have created more \nthan 2 million jobs since election day 2016. Someone said to me: Well, \nyou shouldn't count it from election day. You should count it from \nInauguration Day. Certainly, in my home State of Wyoming, on election \nday there was a confidence, an optimism, a positive feeling that \nstarted just at the moment it was announced that Donald Trump had been \nelected President of the United States.\n  Right now we have the lowest rate of unemployment since the year \n2002. We have seen the economy grow at more than 3 percent for the past \n2 quarters. Consumer confidence just reached the highest level in \nalmost 17 years. All of this is happening since President Trump was \nelected, and this is very good news for America.\n  We can't stop now. We have to do all we can to keep on this path \ntoward a more prosperous country. Americans are optimistic because they \nknow that President Trump is focused on easing the regulations that \nhave held back our economy for the last 8 years. We know that \ngovernment can create opportunity or crush opportunity based on a \ncombination of regulations, mandates, and taxes. We are now in the land \nof opportunity, eliminating the regulations and pulling back on taxes \nto helping our economy grow.\n  The President has signed legislation that we passed in this Congress \nrepealing one after another of the Obama administration's rules, \nregulations, and restrictions. President Trump has issued Executive \norders cutting back on excessive redtape. President Trump has appointed \nvery good people to important jobs who are committed to reining in \nWashington's out-of-control bureaucracy. All of these things are \nimportant and critical to keeping our economy growing.\n  Another big part is what we are trying to do now in terms of cutting \ntaxes for the American people. People want to keep more of their hard-\nearned money in their own pockets.\n  Here in the Senate we now have a once-in-a-generation opportunity to \ncut taxes in a way that will actually help American families. We can \nhelp families directly by raising their incomes, and we can help them \nindirectly by growing the economy. Here is how we can do both, because \nthat needs to be our goal.\n  The first thing we can do is to give people a raise by doubling the \nstandard deduction. If we raise the deduction, people keep more of \ntheir hard-earned money, and it makes taxes simpler. Right now, the \nstandard deduction for a married couple is $12,000. Two-thirds of \nAmericans take this deduction. If we roughly double it, people will not \npay any Federal income tax at all on the first $24,000 they earn. That \nis a big cut. It means that a lot more people will decide to take this \ndeduction instead of having to go through the painstaking process of \nitemizing their deductions on their tax return. It saves them a lot of \ntime, it saves them a lot of headaches, and it saves them the cost of \naccountants and lawyers who have to help figure out the very \ncomplicated tax system in this country. Millions of families will be \nbetter off just from this one tax cut alone.\n  A second thing Republicans are looking to do is to reduce the tax \nrate for small businesses, the people who are creating jobs all across \nthe country. If someone owns a small business in my home State of \nWyoming, she probably ends up paying the taxes on her personal tax \nreturn rather than on a separate business tax return. If we cut her tax \nbill, that is money she can then use to give her workers a raise, to \nhire more people, and to create more jobs in our community. She can put \nmoney back into the business to help grow the economy as well.\n  When you leave more money in people's pockets, they get to decide how \nto use that money--what they decide to spend, what they decide to save, \nand what they decide to invest. People are much better watching their \nown money than the government ever was, giving people value for that \nmoney.\n  So we want to make sure that tax reform includes a break for small \nbusinesses. Around here, they use the\n\n\nwords ``tax reform.'' To me, it is about tax reduction, tax relief, and \ntax cuts. Republicans also want to bring down the rates that Washington \ncharges other businesses. If we can cut the rate businesses pay from 35 \npercent down to 20 percent, that could be an enormous boost to the \neconomy. Economists who look at this say it is like giving the average \nAmerican family a $4,000 a year raise. That is how much the average \nhousehold's income would go up, because workers actually bear most of \nthe burden of taxes that businesses pay.\n  Now, Democrats actually think the money belongs to Washington. It \ndoesn't. It belongs to the people at home who earn it. Democrats often \nthink that if you give Americans even a single dollar in tax cuts, you \nare taking away Washington's money. It is not Washington's money. The \nmoney belongs to the people at home.\n  We know the exact opposite of what the Democrats believe to be true. \nRepublicans know that giving Americans a tax cut is the same as giving \nthem a raise. Every dollar a family doesn't have to send to Washington \nin taxes is a dollar they can use for something better. It is a dollar \nthey can use for food, for shelter, for kids, for education, for things \nthat matter to their family. It is another dollar a small business can \nuse to pay its workers more or reinvest in the business to help grow \nthe economy in that community. Tax cuts mean that people decide how to \nspend their own money; Washington doesn't decide. Families know how to \nuse money much better than Washington ever will.\n\n  As we debate these issues and ideas with regard to tax relief, we \nhave an exciting opportunity to give the American people a raise and to \ngive the American economy a boost. This is something a lot of people \nhave been working on for a long time in the Senate. Over the past 6 \nyears, the Finance Committee has held 70 hearings on how to make our \nTax Code better for all Americans.\n  Republicans are working, and we are listening to make sure that we \nget the tax reform right that the American people and families need. \nWhen it comes to tax cuts, I believe the more the better. The more \npeople who get a tax cut, the better. The more we grow our economy, the \nbetter. It is our job. It is about paychecks. It is about jobs. It is \nabout prosperity. It is about a strong and healthy economy for America. \nThat is what we as Republicans are committed to. We cannot let this \nopportunity pass.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.", "turn": 39, "speaker": "Mr. BARRASSO", "itemno": 44}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, whether one is a progressive, a Democrat, \na conservative, a Republican, or somewhere in between, there is a deep \nunderstanding in this country that we are living in a rigged economy, \nand people are increasingly angry and frustrated about the growing \ninequality and unfairness they see all about them.\n  It is hard to believe, but in the United States of America today, the \ntop one-tenth of 1 percent now owns almost as much wealth as the bottom \n90 percent--one-tenth of 1 percent, bottom 90 percent. A study came out \nfairly recently indicating that in the United States of America today, \nthe three wealthiest people in our country--Bill Gates, Jeff Bezos, and \nWarren Buffett--now own more wealth than the bottom half of the \nAmerican people. Three people own more wealth than the bottom half of \nthe American people.\n  Meanwhile, while the very, very rich get richer, some 40 million \nAmericans are living in poverty. These are people who are struggling \ntoday to figure out how they put food on the table for their kids, how \nthey put gas in the car in order to go to work, how they pay their \nelectric bills, how they deal with childcare. There are 40 million \npeople living in poverty. The middle class is disappearing. People are \nworking two or three jobs. For the first time in the modern history of \nthis country, young people may well have a standard of living lower \nthan their parents'.\n  On top of all of that, we remain the only major country on Earth that \ndoesn't guarantee healthcare to all of our people. Twenty-eight million \npeople today have no health insurance. Many more are underinsured. And \nif our Republican colleagues get their way, they are going to throw \nanother 20 or 30 million people off of their health insurance.\n  It is not only the reality of grotesque levels of inequality that is \nmaking the American people despondent and angry; it is the reality that \nthe people on top, with their wealth and power, can access lawyers and \naccountants who are able to manipulate the system to benefit themselves \nat the expense of everyone else. That is the essence of what a rigged \neconomy is about and what I want to say a few words about today.\n  In my view, one of the great crises facing our world--and we are in a \nworld of many crises--is the rapid movement toward international \noligarchy in which a handful of billionaires own and control not just a \nsignificant part of the American economy but a significant part of the \nworld economy. Needless to say, this is an issue that does not get a \nwhole lot of discussion because, in general, the more important the \nissues are, the less discussion they get within the corporate media or \nwithin the political world that we live in here in the Congress.\n  Let me reiterate. One of the great crises that we face is that a \nhandful of billionaires are moving this entire planet toward an \noligarchic society in which the people on top not only have incredible \nwealth but incredible political power as well.\n  This last Sunday, a group of investigative journalists released over \n13 million files known as the Paradise Papers exposing just how \nhorrific this situation has become. These papers show how a handful of \noligarchs in the United States and throughout the world get richer by \nhiding their wealth and their profits offshore to avoid paying their \nfair share of taxes. The list of individuals implicated in the Paradise \nPapers include billionaires such as the Koch brothers, Sheldon Adelson, \nCarl Icahn, and Robert Mercer. It includes large financial institutions \nsuch as Wells Fargo, Citigroup, and Bank of America. It includes large \nmultinational corporations such as Apple, Nike, and ExxonMobil. It \nincludes members of the Trump administration, such as Secretary of \nState Rex Tillerson, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, chief economic \nadviser Gary Cohn, and Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin.\n  Let's be clear. Offshore tax evasion is a major problem not just for \nthe United States but for governments throughout the world. This is \nreally quite unbelievable. In the year 2012, the Tax Justice Network \nestimated that at least $21 trillion--$21 trillion, a number almost \nbeyond comprehension--is being stashed in offshore tax havens around \nthe world. Imagine that. There is $21 trillion flowing into tax havens \nin the Cayman Islands, Bermuda, Luxembourg--all these places around the \nworld where the billionaire class and large corporations are stashing \ntheir money not only to avoid taxes in the United States but to avoid \ntaxes in Great Britain, France, Germany, et cetera.\n  There is a funny thing about these guys. All of these billionaires \nlove veterans, and they love the military. They want to see us rebuild \nthe infrastructure, and they want to see our kids get a good education. \nBut you know what, they don't want to pay taxes to make that happen. \nThey want ordinary people to pay the taxes. Republicans here want to \nincrease military spending by $50, $60 billion. It is not the \nbillionaires who are going to pay the taxes on that--they have their \nmoney in the Cayman Islands. It is the working class, the middle class, \nupper middle class who will pay, not the billionaires. They love \nAmerica--except when it comes to accepting their fair share to make \nsure that we continue to provide the services our men, women, and \nchildren need.\n  The situation has become so absurd--and this is really how crazy it \nis--that one five-story office building in the Cayman Islands is now \nthe home of nearly 20,000 corporations. This particular building in the \nCayman Islands is called the Ugland House. It is five stories. I know \nthat you can squeeze people into a building--sometimes three or four \npeople live in a room--but I think it is a little bit hard to \nunderstand how 20,000 corporations function in a five-story building. \nOf course the answer is that 20,000 corporations do not function in \nthis five-story building.\n\n\nIt is all a fraud. It is simply a mailbox address for 20,000 \ncorporations that are in this building in order to avoid paying their \ntaxes. They are stashing their profits and their wealth in corporations \nthat use this building as a mailing address.\n  I know we are busy talking about so-called tax reform here, but in \nthe United States alone, offshore tax evasion costs our government \nabout $166 billion in lost revenue each and every year. That is a lot \nof money that could be used to rebuild our crumbling infrastructure--\nour roads, our bridges, our water systems. One trillion dollars--that \nis 8 or 9 years of that $166 billion--could create up to 15 million \ngood-paying jobs. That is money that could be used to provide universal \npre-K for our children so that when kids get ready to go to school, \nthey will be prepared to do the work there. But instead of cracking \ndown on offshore tax schemes, President Trump and my Republican \ncolleagues in Congress are working overtime to pass legislation that \nwould make this absurd situation even worse.\n  At a time when corporations are making recordbreaking profits, my \nRepublican colleagues want to slash taxes for companies that are \nshifting American jobs to China and American profits to the Cayman \nIslands. At a time of massive wealth and income inequality, President \nTrump and the Republicans in Congress want to cut taxes for \nbillionaires by repealing the estate tax on families who inherit over \n$5.5 million. I think the American people grasp the unfairness and the \nabsurdity of the Republican tax proposal.\n  The top one-tenth of 1 percent own almost as much wealth as the \nbottom 90 percent. The very, very rich are getting richer while the \nmiddle class is shrinking, and the Republican response is to give \nmassive tax breaks to the top two-tenths of 1 percent--two-tenths of 1 \npercent. These are families like the Walton family, the wealthiest \nfamily in America, who owns Walmart, who would get up to a $50 billion \ntax break; and the Koch brothers, who have enough money to spend \nhundreds of millions of dollars trying to elect rightwing candidates to \nCongress.\n  There are massive tax breaks for billionaires and at the same time, \nan effort to throw up to 30 million people off of the health insurance \nthey have, massive cuts in education, in nutrition, and in the programs \nthat working families desperately need.\n  Instead of providing even more tax breaks to very profitable \ncorporations and to billionaires and President Trump's Cabinet, maybe--\njust maybe--it might be a good idea to close offshore tax loopholes and \ndemand a fair, transparent, and progressive tax system.\n  I hope the American people are catching on--as I believe they are--to \nwhat a fraud the Republican tax proposal is. Today, one out of five \nmajor, profitable corporations already pays zero in Federal income tax. \nYou can't do much better than paying zero in Federal income tax and be \na profitable corporation, but that is what is going on. Republicans \nwant to make that even worse, and then they want millions of middle-\nclass people, by the end of the decade, to be paying more in taxes. \nThat is absurd, and I hope the American people stand up and demand that \nwe do not go forward with that proposal.\n\n\n                               Healthcare\n\n  Mr. President, on another issue, I want to mention that there is a \ncrisis in primary healthcare, and unless Congress acts immediately, \nthat crisis is likely to become much worse. Millions of Americans are \nat risk of losing their access to healthcare because Congress has still \nnot renewed funding for the community health center program, which \nexpired on September 30.\n  Our Nation's community health centers provide affordable, high-\nquality healthcare to more than 27 million people. What community \nhealth centers do is not only provide high-quality primary healthcare \nbut also dental care, mental health counseling, and low-cost \nprescription drugs. Community health centers not only save lives, they \nalso end up saving money. What they do is keep people out of emergency \nrooms and keep people out of hospitals because people can now go to the \ndoctor when they should. The savings are also, really, quite \nsignificant. Investing in community health centers keeps people \nhealthier, keeps people alive, and saves taxpayers' money.\n  Not only do we have to renew funding for the Community Health Center \nProgram, but we must also improve and expand the National Health \nService Corps, one of the, really, very positive health programs that \nthe Federal Government runs. What this program understands is that for \na variety of reasons, including the fact that many young people leave \nmedical school being $300,000, $400,000 in debt, it is very hard to get \nyoung doctors, dentists, nurses, and nurse practitioners to underserved \nareas in rural America or in urban America. What this program does is \nprovide debt forgiveness and sometimes scholarships for young graduates \nof medical school or nursing school or dental school and says: If you \nare prepared to practice in an underserved area, we will forgive your \nloans. That is a big deal in attracting providers to areas in which we \ndesperately need them.\n  The bad news is that, as every American knows, this Congress and this \ncountry are very politically divided. That is no great secret. The good \nnews and the truth is that in terms of community health centers--\nSenator Ted Kennedy was one of the founders, who worked with \nRepublicans--from the inception of the program, there has been a \nwidespread understanding on both sides of the aisle that communities \nall over America in every State in our country are benefiting from \ncommunity health centers whether they are in rural areas or whether \nthey are in urban areas or anyplace else in between.\n  What I am very happy to note is that there is excellent legislation--\nbipartisan legislation--here in the Senate, introduced by Senator Roy \nBlunt and Senator Debbie Stabenow, that would reauthorize these \nsuccessful programs for 5 years and provide modest increases in their \nfunding. This program not only has the support of virtually, perhaps, \nevery Democrat or every Member of the Democratic Caucus, but I think it \nhas at least 9 or 10 Republican cosponsors. I believe, if that bill \nwere to be brought to the floor of the Senate, it would pass with \noverwhelming support because every Senator here knows of the excellent \nwork that is done by community health centers from one end of this \ncountry to the other.\n  I hope that this issue will get the attention it deserves. It should \nhave been funded at the end of the fiscal year. It wasn't. I just \ntalked to a physician in Burlington, VT, who works for a community \nhealth center. They are worried, and doctors and nurses all across this \ncountry are worried, as are patients, about the lack of reauthorization \nof this very important bill.\n  I hope that this bill will get moved very quickly along with the CHIP \nprogram. There is bipartisan support for it, and I hope that we can get \nit to the floor and get it passed as quickly as possible.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.", "turn": 41, "speaker": "Mr. SANDERS", "itemno": 46}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, this coming week will mark Veterans Day. It \nis an important time for us to reflect on what veterans do for us and \nwhat their families do for us. The sacrifices of both those who serve \nand those who support those who serve are incredibly important.\n  We have half a million Missouri veterans, and one of the great \nprivileges of this job is to get to represent them, their values, and \nthe commitment to freedom in our country that they stand for.\n  A couple of weeks ago I had the opportunity to welcome a group of \nsouthwest Missouri veterans who came to Washington with the Honor \nFlight program. I think the Presiding Officer also does this, but every \ntime I get a chance, if there is an Honor Flight from our State, I try \nto get down there because it is a great time to see and to talk to and \nto thank those who have served us.\n  When the Honor Flights started 20 years ago or so, there were still \nsome\n\n\nWorld War I veterans coming, and then they were almost all World War II \nveterans. Today we see some World War II veterans, Korea veterans, and \nVietnam veterans, all of whom serve in the great tradition of being \nwilling to fight for the freedoms that we enjoy every day. I find it \nhumbling and gratifying to know that those veterans get to come here \nand enjoy the day with each other. In many cases it is the first time \nthey have ever been to the Capitol, the National World War II Memorial, \nArlington, and the other places on the trip that now so many tens of \nthousands have taken.\n  Many of those veterans whom I saw the other day and whom I have seen \nthrough the history of the Honor Flight program were just teenagers \nwhen they answered the call to serve--basically, a little more than \nhigh school kids who knew that something needed to be done and they \nwere able and willing to do it. They fought difficult battles and, in \nsome cases, often under unbearable conditions. Some of them lost their \nclosest friends in the military. Many of them lost comrades in arms. \nSome of them lost comrades right beside them. Some of them lost people \nwho went out on another mission and never came back. Some of their \nfamilies lost a servicemember who never became a veteran.\n  I was down in Perryville, MO, a little town between Cape Girardeau \nand St. Louis, on the Mississippi River. They are building an exact \nreplica of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial--the Vietnam wall. We were \nable to present a flag to the group that raised the money and made the \nplan to replicate the Vietnam Veterans Memorial on the Mall to take it \nback and become part of the Vietnam memorial at Perryville.\n  Our veterans are an extraordinary group of men and women. They really \nstand for the best we stand for as a nation. It is important that with \nnot just honor them on Veterans Day but honor them every day--every day \nthat we live in this free and prosperous Nation that they helped \ndefend.\n  Admittedly, it is hard not to take all of the freedoms that we enjoy \nfor granted because generations of Americans have been willing to fight \nand die to protect those freedoms. Because of that, generations of \nAmericans have benefitted from those freedoms, and it seems to us the \nway people should be able to live everywhere. Maybe too often we think \nit is the way people do live everywhere, but in many parts of the \nworld, having the security to walk out the door every morning, to drop \nyour kids off at school, to go to work and earn a living, to worship as \nyou please, and to build a better life is not available to people in \nother countries the way it is here. That is the debt of gratitude we \nowe to our veterans.\n  This year, one of the areas of great legislative success has been in \nthe work for veterans. Chairman Isakson of Georgia is going to follow \nme on the floor in just a few minutes. He is the chairman of that \ncommittee. He has a great committee, but they have a great chairman. \nThat committee, with its chairman, and the committee in the House have \npassed eight bills, at least, that the President of the United States \nhas signed into law that do a number of things for our veterans.\n\n  We have built on previous progress for improving veterans care. A few \nyears ago, we made the decision that veterans need to have more \nchoices. A veteran shouldn't have to drive by a hospital they would \nlike to go to in order to get to a hospital miles and miles away. They \nshouldn't have to pass three or four facilities that could do as good a \njob or better in order to get to a veterans facility.\n  There are some things our veterans facilities should do better than \nanybody else. They should be better at dealing with post-traumatic \nstress better than anybody else, although they may not be as \naccessible. They should be better at dealing with patients who have \nsuffered from IED attacks, eye injuries, people who work with veterans \nin prosthetics, and those patients who have lost arms and legs in the \nservice of our country. They should be pretty good at that. There is no \nparticular reason they should be good at open heart surgery or kidney \ndialysis or all the other things you go to the hospital for, if that is \nwhere a veteran wants to go. We found out that a lot of veterans would \nrather go closer to home. A lot of veterans would like to go to the \nhospital they are more familiar with when they need their own \nhealthcare. They would like to go to the hospital they have been to \nlots of times with other family members and others.\n  So we really expanded the Veterans Choice Program and expanded the \nmoney available for that program. We try to create these opportunities \nside by side with an existing facility. There has to be some startup \nmoney involved, but, eventually, I think our young veterans will find \nthat they can almost always find a hospital they would rather go to or \na doctor they would rather see.\n  We have increased compensation for veterans with service-connected \ndisabilities. World War II veterans, such as Arla Harrell from St. \nLouis, who suffered a lifetime of illness because he was part of a \nmustard gas experiment, is finally getting both compensation and the \nrecognition that throughout his lifetime his health was impacted by \nsomething that happened while he was serving his country.\n  We have continued efforts to address the problems at the Veterans' \nAdministration by passing legislation to modernize the outdated \nbenefits claims appeals process to make it easier for VA employees to \nbe fired for misconduct.\n  We want to protect employees who point out what is wrong. There have \nbeen plenty of whistles being blown at the VA over the last decade. \nWhile we want to be sure people can blow those whistles, we also want \nto be sure that the VA can quickly and effectively remove employees who \nare not doing what they ought to be doing and, in fact, are \naggressively doing, in some cases, things they shouldn't be doing.\n  We worked to expand the possibility and the opportunity for education \nbenefits by expanding what can happen under the post-9/11 GI bill, \nhelping to connect veterans with employers who provide benefits and \nprograms. The HIRE Vets Act, a bill I sponsored in the Congress, was \npart of the first major pieces of legislation the Congress passed this \nyear. I think that, sometime in the next few weeks, the Department of \nLabor is going to be talking about how we will recognize and evaluate \nemployers who hire veterans, who give veterans credit for skills they \nlearned in the military, and who promote veterans. To every employer \nwho hires veterans, that is a good thing and we should want to do that. \nThe HIRE Vets Act, like the LEED standard for energy, creates a \nstandard so that we can recognize companies that do that in a \nsignificant way. I am pleased that Secretary Acosta in the Department \nof Labor has put that on a fast track so these companies can be \nrecognized for what they do.\n  Our veterans have worked hard and have put themselves in danger to \nkeep us safe. As legislators, we owe them, as we owe those who follow \nin their footsteps, our continued efforts to ensure that those \ndefending our country have everything they need and to show that we are \nalso grateful to those who have defended our country in the past.\n  I yield the floor.", "turn": 45, "speaker": "Mr. BLUNT", "itemno": 51}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I wish to thank Senator Blunt, the \ndistinguished Senator from Missouri, for his eloquent remarks on \nveterans and in support of all the things the Presiding Officer and I \nhave tried to do on the Veterans' Affairs Committee and for pointing \nout the many reasons we in America are so proud of the veterans in \nservice, who allow you and I to be here today. Were it not for our \nveterans, this Republic would not exist.\n  I was wondering how I would start out this speech. I did an interview \nwith a reporter who wanted to ask me a number of questions about the \ncurrent administration and what we were doing for veterans. It turned \nout to be a 35- or 40-minute interview.\n  I said I had to go, and he said: I have one more question for you.\n  This was by phone. So I couldn't look him in the eye, and he couldn't \nsee me.\n  He said: I have one more question for you.\n  When you hear that from a reporter, that means the zinger is coming.\n  He said: Don't you think we could save a lot of money if we didn't \nfight in any more wars?\n  I thought for a minute. I said: We probably could, but there wouldn't \nbe any reason for you and me to exist if we didn't fight any more wars, \nbecause\n\n\nAmerica is the place where everybody wants to be because we are safe \nand we are free and we are independent, because we fight and defend \nwhat we have as a country. I thought I would bring that up in my speech \ntoday because that is the reason we celebrate veterans today. So we \ngive thanks to the men and women who volunteer, who served our country \nin the wars overseas, in the battles overseas, and, sometimes, in the \nchallenges domestically to protect us and keep us free.\n  America is a great country. We don't find anybody trying to break out \nof the United States of America. They are all trying to break in and \nfor a very good reason. It is a safe and free place to raise a family, \nto start a business, and to serve in many other ways.\n  So this year, on the 11th day, at the 11th hour and the 11th minute \nof November, when we celebrate Veterans Day, pause for a minute to say \nthanks for those who have come and gone and for those who are still \nhere who fight to serve and protect us.\n  Always remember that the Congress, shortly after the end of World War \nI, decided that the 11th day--the day the armistice was signed--of the \n11th month, November, with the 11th hour being 11 o'clock in the \nmorning, would be the time the bell would toll to celebrate and pay \ntribute to those veterans. So at 11:11:11 this November 11, we are all \ngoing to toll that bell one more time to give thanks for our veterans \nfor all they have done for us and for all they will do for us in the \nfuture.\n  It is best, when you talk about veterans, to talk about them as the \npeople they were and the people they are, whether they are alive or \nwhether they have passed on. I want to talk about two veterans whose \npaths have crossed my life to point out why we owe them so much and why \nwe have so much to be thankful for. One of them is Jackson Elliott Cox, \nIII of Burke County, GA, which is the Bird Dog Capital of North \nAmerica. It has raised and trained more bird dogs than anywhere else in \nthe country. It is the home of a nuclear power plant, the Plant Vogtle. \nIt is a beautiful rural county in Georgia.\n  Jack was my best friend in college. We met in 1962; we graduated in \n1966. I will never forget that the last time I saw Jack was when he was \nshipping out to go to OCS in the Marine Corps. Jack had decided when he \ngraduated that it was more important for him to volunteer and fight for \nour country because of what was going on in Vietnam than do anything \nelse, so he voluntarily joined the Marine Corps, went to OCS, got his \ncommission as an officer, and became a captain in the U.S. Marine \nCorps. He fought and he died in Vietnam.\n  I will never forget the last words he told me when we put him on the \nbus from Waynesboro, GA, to Atlanta, ultimately, to be shipped out. \nWhat he said is: Johnny, I am sure I am coming back. Don't worry about \nme. Just pray for me. But in case I don't, make sure people remember \nwho Jackson Elliott Cox III was.\n  I said: Jack, I will do that.\n  Sure enough, 2 years later he was shot and killed by a sniper in \nVietnam. He lost his life at the age of 24. He was the finest human \nbeing I had ever known, the nicest guy I had ever met, and my favorite \nfriend in all of my life. He was taken from me because he volunteered \nto serve and fight for our country.\n  I am going to keep today on the floor of the U.S. Senate the promise \nI made to him at the bus station. I want you to know who Jackson \nElliott Cox III was. He was a good old country boy from South Georgia \nwho volunteered to serve his country and risked his life and gave his \nlife so that you and I could be here today.\n  There are thousands of Jackson Elliott Coxes all over the world. In \nfact, there are millions all over the country. There are hundreds of \nthousands of them, and we have so much to thank them for because less \nthan 1 percent of our population has worn the uniform, been in the \nbattle, and fought to save us and protect us as Jackson Elliott Cox \ndid.\n  When you have your chance to meet and become friends with a veteran--\nand all of you will--remember you owe them a debt of gratitude. At some \ntime, when you get the chance to pay that debt back, do what I am doing \ntoday. Don't let their memory ever be lost or forgotten no matter where \nyou go or where life takes you because you wouldn't get to where you \nare going, had they not allowed you to be safe and free to travel that \nroute.\n  The second name I am going to mention is Noah Harris. Noah was from \nEllijay, GA. Noah was a cheerleader at the University of Georgia. On \nSeptember 11, 2001, he turned on his television to see 3,000 innocent \ncitizens, most of them Americans, die in the Twin Towers when al-Qaida \nand Osama bin Laden and the axis of evil attacked our country, took our \ninnocence, killed our people, and changed the world forever.\n  Noah was a cheerleader. We don't have a mandatory draft anymore. You \ndon't have to serve, and he was not serving. He was going to graduate \nin a year and a half. He wanted to be an architect.\n  The next morning, after 9/11, when he left his dorm, he went to the \nArmy ROTC building at the University of Georgia campus. He walked in \nand said: I want to go to OCS. I want to go. After what I saw on TV \nlast night, I want to go fight and get the people who did that to my \ncountry and my friends.\n  They said: No, Mr. Harris you can't do that. OCS is a 2-year program \nat the university, and you are graduating next year. You don't have \nenough time to do it.\n  He said: I will double up on my studies. I will do whatever. I want \nto go. I want to fight for my country and fight the axis of evil.\n  They let him in, and he did. He graduated with honors. A few months \nlater, he graduated as second lieutenant from the U.S. Army at Fort \nBenning in Georgia. Before too long, he was in Gazaria in Iraq, a \nsuburb of Baghdad, handing Beanie Babies out of one pocket while the \nother pocket of his field jacket had his ammunition. He was trying to \nwin over the hearts of the Iraqi children while he was fighting to \npreserve freedom for them and return their country to some form of a \ndemocracy or republic, away from the captives of Saddam Hussein.\n  I knew Noah casually. I know his parents well--Rick and Lucy Harris. \nI know they have mourned every day since they lost Noah in Baghdad when \nhe died in an IED accident, but I know how proud they are of what he \ndid and why he did it. I am proud he was my friend, and I am proud to \nhave known him as well. I am proud to be able to stand on the floor of \nthe U.S. Senate today and talk about Noah Harris and talk about Jackson \nElliott Cox, who were exemplary of all the others who have served in \nthe military--men and women, rich and poor, Black and White, who have \ngone and fought the battle and borne the battle for us so that we could \nbe where we are today.\n  It kind of reminds me of the person who went to Benjamin Franklin in \nPhiladelphia shortly after the Constitution was adopted in Constitution \nHall and said: Mr. Franklin, what have you given us?\n  He paused for a minute and said: ``A republic, if you can keep it.''\n  We have kept it. We have kept it because we have subscribed to the \nConstitution but also because we have a militia and a military. We are \nwilling to fight for what we believe in, protect our citizens, and keep \nour country free. The country that our Founding Fathers gave to us, \nthat was nurtured in the early days of this Republic, which now is \nhundreds of years old, is still there today for lots of reasons but, \nprincipally, the undergirding foundation is a strong and vibrant \nmilitary.\n  When Veterans Day comes, give thanks for the veterans you know. \nMention a couple of them, as I have done here, so their memory and \ntheir names never die, but also so we can lift them up at a time when \nwe pause for just a minute to say thank you for the greatest country on \nthe face of this Earth.\n  Senator Blunt talked about our committee and what we have done this \nyear. I want to take just a minute to reiterate some of the things he \nsaid. There are no Democratic veterans and no Republican veterans; \nthere are only American veterans. They don't go to the battlefield as a \npartisan; they go to the battlefield as an American, and they fight for \nus whether we are Republicans or Democrats. They risk their own life \nand sometimes sacrifice it so that we can do what Ben Franklin said: \nKeep that republic. We owe them a lot. In fact, in many cases, we owe \nthem everything.\n\n\n  We have had a mess at the VA in the last 10 years. They have been the \nlead story on USA Today more than any other agency in the government \nfor failures of the VA to do the job that should have been done. Under \nDavid Shulkin, the Secretary of the VA appointed by President Trump, \nunder the leadership of our committees in the House and the Senate, and \nunder a commitment to bipartisan service by all our Members--which \nmeans we do almost everything unanimously and, if not unanimously, \nalmost unanimously because it is not about getting Republican credit or \nDemocratic credit; it is about doing the right thing for the right \npeople who have done so much for us--we passed the Whistleblower \nProtection Act this year to give whistleblowers in the VA the \nprotection they need to go and turn in to the authorities those \nemployees in the Veterans Administration who are not doing their job. \nWe have given them the safe harbor they need to encourage them to help \nus root out problems, and we are doing that.\n  We passed the accountability bill to shine the light of sunshine on \nthe employees of the VA and to give the authorities in the VA the \nability to terminate and fire, if you will, for cause an employee who \nis not doing the job they should be doing for our veterans. So we hold \na standard of accountability up a little higher for our employees in \nthe Veterans Administration.\n  We are magnifying choice so that our veterans can have more choice in \ntheir healthcare. We can use the private sector as a force multiplier \nso that the government doesn't have to hire all the doctors and \nphysicians and assistants to service the VA. We can get them in the \nprivate sector as well.\n  In the 21st century GI bill, we finally made sure that the GI bill \napplies to everyone, not just World War II or Vietnam war-era veterans \nbut veterans of all conflicts and of all times.\n  We have done everything we can to see to it that the benefits, which \nwe promised them would be there when they left the military, are there \nfor them in retirement and in their later life. The sacrifices they \nmake are great, and the sacrifices we have made to save our veterans \nare great.\n  Today veterans come home from the battlefield 90 percent of the time \nwhen they are wounded. They come home, whereas, in World War I, 10 \npercent came home, and 90 percent died on the battlefield. But because \nof the advancements we have made in armor and protection and healthcare \nservices, a lot of veterans today live when they would not have lived \njust 25 or 30 years ago.\n  The injuries they sustain are far greater than any injuries we have \nknown in warfare before. The signature illnesses are PTSD, post-\ntraumatic stress syndrome, or traumatic brain injury or a prosthesis \nfor an arm or a leg or an eye or some part of the body that is lost in \nbattle. But the trunk of the body is protected by new Kevlar vests that \nare impenetrable by a bullet, so most of them succumb to IEDs and \nexplosives and things of that nature.\n  We have the healthcare to provide them with the best possible \nrehabilitation we can, but you can never really replace a leg or an eye \nor a body part. Once somebody has sacrificed it forever, they wear the \nburden of the battle and of war.\n  We have an obligation, as the Veterans Administration, as the \nCongress of the United States in the House and the Senate, to see to it \nthat we back up those promises our recruiters made when they came to \njoin the military, to see to it that they get those services from their \nVeterans Administration.\n  Dr. David Shulkin is doing a phenomenal job. My ranking member, Jon \nTester, Democrat from Montana, is doing a fantastic job. The House \ncommittee is doing a great job. The Members of the Senate are doing a \ngreat job.\n  In a week and a half, we are going to have our final bill of the year \nwhich, when we pass it, will make us 8 for 8. We will have totally \nreformed the VA and worked with the VA to reform it in such a way that \nour veterans get better service, our taxpayers get more accountability \nfor the dollars we spend, and America remains the great country it has \nalways been--safe and free because of those who volunteer to fight and \nare willing to die on behalf our country.\n  So sometime on the 11th day and, hopefully, at the 11th hour and the \n11th minute of that hour on November 11, you will pause for a minute \nand remember I told you that is when we celebrate Veterans Day because, \nat the time the armistice was signed in World War I, our country \ndecided that would be the perfect time to remember all those who have \nfought in the past.\n  Let's look around, and every time we see a man or woman in uniform, \nstop and say ``Thank you for your service'' because those are the \npeople who are risking their lives so that you and I can do whatever it \nis we choose to do in this land of the free and home of the brave.\n  There are lots of things to be thankful for but nothing more \nimportant than the men and women of the U.S. military.

Mr. President, I am very pleased to have the opportunity \nto speak today on the floor of the Senate after my esteemed colleague \nfrom the State of Georgia. My colleague is the chairman of the \nVeterans' Affairs Committee, and I just want to express my appreciation \nfor his commitment and his work on behalf of all of our great veterans.\n  Like him, I rise today to speak in tribute to our veterans and men \nand women in uniform and all that they do for us.\n  This weekend at events across the country, we will pay tribute to the \nfine men and women who have served in our Nation's Armed Forces. Every \nday--but especially on Veterans Day--we honor these soldiers who have \nleft the comforts of home and family to defend our freedoms and fight \nfor our way of life.\n  Our freedoms have been secured by the sweat and sacrifice of \ncourageous men and women who, throughout our history, have bravely done \nwhat was needed to protect our great Nation. We also recognize that \nthose who serve do not serve alone. We appreciate, too, the sacrifices \nof the families and the loved ones who have supported our veterans in \ntheir service.\n  This Veterans Day, we will honor military members from our ``greatest \ngeneration'' to those men and women fighting in the War on Terror \ntoday. These Americans understand best the words of President Ronald \nReagan when he said:\n\n       Freedom is never more than one generation away from \n     extinction. We didn't pass it to our children in the \n     bloodstream. It must be fought for, protected, and handed on \n     for them to do the same.\n\n  These men and women who have fought for and protected our country \nhave given so much, and we cannot do enough to thank them, whether they \nreturned from Active military duty 7 days ago or seven decades ago.\n  Although we can never repay our debt of gratitude, one of the most \ntangible ways we recognize our veterans' service is by providing these \nmen and women with quality healthcare and support services, including \neducation and work opportunities. With that debt in mind, let me \nbriefly outline some initiatives that we have been working on to \nprovide for our veterans. Congress has passed significant veterans \nbills this year, including legislation that holds the VA accountable \nand ensures that VA employees are putting our veterans first and \nlegislation that updates and modernizes the VA's benefit claims and \nappeals process, reducing wait times for our veterans.\n  Additionally, one of my top priorities is ensuring that our veterans \nhave access to healthcare options closer to their homes and their \nfamilies.\n  This includes improving veterans' access to services under the \nVeterans Choice Program and building on the success of the Veterans \nCare Coordination Initiative at the Fargo VA Medical Center in my home \nState. This effort has decreased the wait time for scheduling an \nappointment under Veterans Choice from 24 days a year ago to 5 or 6 \ndays at present. This initiative can serve as a model to help address \ndelays in scheduling appointments through the Veterans Choice Program \nacross the Nation.\n  We invited Secretary Shulkin, from North Dakota, to see this \nfirsthand, and our Veterans Care Coordination Initiative has since been \nexpanded to\n\n\nthe VA facility in Helena, MT, as well. We believe it will be expanded \nto other locations across the country.\n  We also passed an extension of the Veterans Choice Program earlier \nthis year and secured $2.1 billion in additional funding for the \nprogram. This gives us time to work with the VA on the next phase of \nthe program. In addition to Veterans Choice, we are working to improve \nlocal access to long-term care for our veterans.\n  We secured a commitment from Secretary Shulkin to work with us on the \nVeterans Access to Long Term Care and Health Services Act. We have now \nintroduced this legislation in the Senate, and a companion bill has \nbeen introduced in the House of Representatives. The legislation would \nremove burdensome redtape that prevents nursing homes and other \nhealthcare providers from accepting veteran patients. Our bill allows \nthe VA to enter into provider agreements with qualified healthcare and \nextended care facilities, bypassing complex Federal contracting \nrequirements. This will give veterans more options to access long-term \ncare services closer to their homes, their families, and to their loved \nones.\n  In addition, earlier this year, Congress passed--and the President \nsigned into law--the forever GI bill, which improved and extended \nveterans' access to education and workforce opportunities. This is part \nof our efforts to ensure that we are supporting our veterans as they \ntransition back to civilian life and work here at home. These are just \na few examples of our efforts to ensure our veterans have the resources \nand the support they have so richly earned. While we cannot say thank \nyou enough, in this way, we can honor their courage and their \nsacrifice.\n  We honor Veterans Day because we have the greatest veterans in the \nworld who have committed themselves to protect our Nation, and in so \ndoing, they have transformed this country into the greatest the world \nhas ever known. May God continue to bless our veterans and this great \nNation that they have been protecting and make sure we honor the \nselfless service of all our men and women in uniform, of all our \nveterans, not only on Veterans Day but every day.\n  I yield the floor.", "turn": 49, "speaker": "Mr. HOEVEN", "itemno": 55}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I appreciate the kind words of Senator \nHoeven and his affinity toward veterans. I am here to talk about our \nveterans as well.\n  I come at it from three different perceptions. I chair the Military \nPersonnel Subcommittee in the Senate Armed Services Committee. We are \ntrying to work on things to make sure that when somebody goes out of \nActive Duty into veteran status, we make it as productive as it can be, \nmaking sure they enter back fully into the workforce, the education \nopportunities, and all the kinds of opportunities that are afforded \nthem as a result of serving in our armed services.\n  I also want to take a minute to talk about the person who served but \nnever wore a uniform, and that is the husband or the wife or the \nchildren whom, on this Veterans Day, we should also thank.\n  A lot of times, when I have an opportunity--I live in Charlotte, NC, \nwhere we have nearly 800,000 veterans. It is one of the largest \npopulations of any one State--I make a point to get to the airport a \nlittle bit early so I can go up to the USO and just spend a moment \nmeeting with people who are there transitioning from Active Duty and \nveterans to thank them for their service. Oftentimes, I will thank a \nman or woman, and they will say: I didn't serve; my husband or my wife \ndid. I will say: By virtue of your being a military spouse, you served, \nas did your children.\n  On this Veterans Day, let's make sure we expand those thank-yous to \ninclude everybody who is affected when somebody is deployed in a \ndangerous place or even serving in peacetime. It is a great sacrifice, \nand it is one we should always show our gratitude for.\n  As I said, in North Carolina, we have about 800,000 veterans. We also \nhave one of the highest military concentrations of any State. It is the \nhome of the Global Response Force at Fort Bragg, with over 65,000 men \nand women serving and 38 generals. You go down closer to the coast and \nyou get to Jacksonville, NC, where we have Camp Lejeune. There is a \ndebate over the pronunciation so I will pronounce it both ways, but \nthere we have nearly 45 percent of the Marine Corps. Many people don't \nrealize that. Stationed out of North Carolina, we could go to Seymour \nJohnson, we could go to New River, or go to Cherry Point and see these \nmen and women serving every day--and the ones who served before them \nwho are now part of our veteran population. We should thank them all \nfor their current service or their past service.\n  I say to the Presiding Officer, the Senator from Arkansas, I want to \nthank you for your service because you served bravely in combat \npositions before entering the Senate. That is another amazing thing \nabout the veterans. They continue to serve. If you go to a coffee shop, \nyou may see a huddle of veterans around somebody who is organizing the \nevent. That is probably a veteran making sure veterans are speaking \nwith each other and working through some of the challenges some of them \nhave when they are put in very difficult situations or, if you go into \na community center, you will almost always see a veteran there \ncontinuing to serve, even after they ended their Active-Duty service.\n  On Veterans Day, we should make it a point to go to every person we \nknow who is a veteran and thank them. We should make sure that \neverybody we see in uniform--I will be at the airport probably Thursday \nevening or Friday. I will make it a point to go to every single person \nI see in uniform and thank them for their service. We owe that to them \nfor all they do for us.\n  I think, on the one hand, we need to think about veterans, especially \non Veterans Day, but as Senator Hoeven said, we need to think about \nthem every day. As a Senator, the way we do that is not just by \nthinking but by doing. What more can I do in my capacity on the \nVeterans' Affairs Committee or in my capacity on the Senate Armed \nServices Committee to make service easier and safer? After they move \nout of Active status to veteran status, what more can we do for them? \nThere are a lot of things we can do; one is to make sure they get an \nopportunity to have a job that, in many cases, will leverage the skills \nthey learned when they were in the military into private sector jobs.\n  Mr. President, you and I sponsored a bill--the VALOR Act--that will \nbe brought up before the Senate that helps to actually expedite the \nprocess of having those who have served in the military to get hired. \nIt makes it easier for employers to put them in apprenticeship \npositions, where maybe they leverage some of the skills they learned \nwhile on Active Duty but get them in good-paying jobs to support \nthemselves and their families.\n  There are a number of other things we have to do for others who are \nveterans that I think are particularly important. When we talk about \npost-traumatic stress or talk about traumatic brain injury, those are, \nin some cases, invisible wounds of war. We need to make sure and \nunderstand why it is that nearly every day 20 veterans take their lives \nthrough suicide. To what extent could that be something we just simply \ndidn't know about that veteran? Why are they disproportionately more \nlikely to do it? Many of them, incidentally--the veterans today who \nhave this disproportionately high amount of suicide incidents--are \nveterans from the Vietnam war. We need to figure out how to reach back \nto that population--a significant number of whom never seek VA medical \nservices--to provide them with the resources they need to work through \nthese sorts of challenges.\n  We need to make sure healthcare is available across the map. We need \nto recognize that challenge in North Carolina is vastly different than \nthe same challenge in, say, South Dakota.\n  We have a State population of 10 million people--almost approaching 1 \nmillion veterans. When you include the spouses and families, it is well \nabove it. We need to make sure they are getting healthcare and services \nwhere it is most convenient for them. I think some of that will be \nproviding them with a choice to go to the doctor who makes the most \nsense for them. A lot of it will be providing a brick-and-mortar \npresence of the VA so they can be\n\n\namong other people who are actually dealing with the same sorts of \ncircumstances, and they are actually being served by--about half the \npopulation in our veterans hospitals and our healthcare centers are \nveterans themselves.\n  This is a very important part of the broader solution we need to \nprovide to our veterans as we continue to build a relationship with \nthem for the rest of their lives. We will never finish all the work we \nshould do. We will keep on making installments into a debt we can never \nrepay, but what we need to do on November 11 is support our veterans by \nshowing our gratitude and our thanks for their service. On this \nVeterans Day, make an extra effort to thank a veteran. Thank a veteran \nspouse. Thank the child of a veteran for their service to this great \nNation. We will never be able to fully repay the debt we owe them, but \nwe can make a lot of installments as individual citizens and as Members \nof this Congress. As long as I am in the Senate, that is what I intend \nto do.\n  I say to the Presiding Officer, thank you, again, for your service, \nand thank you to all the men and women who served before.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.", "turn": 51, "speaker": "Mr. TILLIS", "itemno": 57}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I appreciate all of my colleagues from \nboth sides of the aisle who will be joining us here this afternoon and \nthank them for their leadership on our legislation and for taking the \ntime to speak today.\n  We are now exactly 1 week into open enrollment, and it has been 3 \nweeks since Chairman Alexander and I put forward a bipartisan bill to \nstabilize our healthcare markets and lower patients' healthcare costs. \nSo I wanted to come this afternoon to talk for a few minutes about what \nit means that so many people nationwide are signing up for coverage and \nwhy there is no good reason for Republican leadership to wait another \nminute before bringing up our bill for a vote.\n  It is still early, but what we are seeing so far is that millions of \npeople across our country are going to healthcare.gov to shop for \ncoverage. Some 200,000 signed up on the first day. That is more than \ndouble the amount from last year. The vast majority will get tax \ncredits to help cover their costs. In fact, some who are struggling the \nmost will find they can save even more this year because of how our \ncurrent healthcare system absorbs cost increases.\n  But there is no question that premiums are going up in many places \nand that fewer coverage options are available and not every consumer is \nprotected. One woman--Melissa--told the Washington Post this week that \nshe is ``joining the ranks of the uninsured'' for the first time in her \nlife as a 51-year-old. She said that she doesn't qualify for subsidies \nand that given how much her premiums would increase, her insurance \ncosts would have been more than her mortgage payments each month. \nMelissa is one of the people paying the price for President Trump's \nhealthcare sabotage and the Republican leadership's--so far--\nwillingness to cheer him along.\n  It is unacceptable that patients and families are having to take on \nthis burden. Let's remember that when someone goes to sign up for \nhealthcare coverage, they are not doing it as a Republican or a \nDemocrat, they are doing it as a parent or a caregiver or a business \nowner who wants to stay healthy and financially secure.\n  Here in Washington, DC, healthcare has become bogged down in \npolitics, but in cities and towns across the country, it is about \ntaking care of yourselves and your loved ones. That is why so many \npeople are going online to shop for coverage despite the President's \ninsistence that healthcare in the United States was going to \n``implode,'' regardless of the fact that to make implosion a reality, \nPresident Trump--among his many other efforts at sabotage--shortened \nthe enrollment period this year and gutted investments in outreach and \nadvertising and caused premiums for those people to increase by double \ndigits on the average. Patients and families deserve so much better.\n  I have said it before: The frustrating thing is that all this could \nhave been avoided. Way back in September, Chairman Alexander and I were \non the verge of an agreement to stabilize healthcare markets and lower \npremiums for the coming year and for 2019. Our agreement would have \nprovided multiyear certainty on the out-of-pocket cost reduction \nsubsidies that President Trump decided to stop paying even though the \nlaw says he is required to do so. Had we been able to move faster, our \nlegislation would have resulted in lower premiums right away for 2018. \nBut Republican leaders pressed the ``pause'' button on bipartisan \nnegotiations so they could try one more time to jam partisan repeal \nthrough the Senate, and we lost a lot of precious time.\n  Our bill, the Lamar Alexander-Patty Murray Senate bill, would do a \nlot of good right now and over the next years. If Republican leadership \ntakes up our legislation now and passes it, families would see rebates \nthis year and lower healthcare costs next year because our bill is \ndesigned to ensure that the benefit of greater certainty is passed on \nto patients and taxpayers, not hoarded by insurance companies.\n  Our deal would also invest in open enrollment and outreach for 2019, \nso more people would be covered. It would allow States more flexibility \nto innovate as the Affordable Care Act always intended. It would mark a \ncritical step away from this harmful partisanship on healthcare and \ntoward working under regular order on solutions that make healthcare \nwork better for the people we serve.\n  Finally, this legislation would send a critical message to patients \nand families that when Congress sets aside partisan difference and \nfocuses on what is best for our country, we can deliver a result, as \nChairman Alexander often says.\n  More than 200 groups representing doctors, hospitals, State \nofficials, Governors, and patients have endorsed our bill. The \nnonpartisan Congressional Budget Office says it would do exactly what \nit was intended to do--stabilize markets and bring down healthcare \ncosts--while returning $3.8 billion to taxpayers.\n  Twelve Senate Democrats and 12 Senate Republicans cosponsored it. We \nare continuing to build support, and there is no question that it would \npass here with a filibuster-proof majority if it were brought to the \nfloor. And while the Senate shouldn't need President Trump's signoff to \ntake a position on ways to fix the Nation's healthcare system, the \nPresident has supported this process moving forward.\n  So here we are, and right now it is up to Republican leaders. They \ncan choose to stay in a partisan corner and reject an opportunity to \nlower patients' healthcare costs in a bipartisan way, or they can do \nwhat people across the country want them to do and put patients over \npolitics.\n  I do want to note that if Republican leaders hadn't gotten the \nmessage, voters made it pretty clear last night that they reject the \ndeeply harmful partisanship we have seen on healthcare.\n  It is well past time for Republican leaders to give up the ghost on \nTrumpCare, declare it dead, and work with Democrats to get real \nsolutions. That starts with our bipartisan bill to lower healthcare \ncosts and stabilize the markets, because if they don't, they can be \nsure they will be held accountable.\n  I yield the floor.", "turn": 57, "speaker": "Mrs. MURRAY", "itemno": 64}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleague from \nWashington, Senator Murray, and congratulate her and Senator Alexander \non being able to reach agreement to move forward to address the \nuncertainty in the marketplace.\n  Like Senator Murray, I also want to begin with what we are seeing \ngoing on in this open enrollment period. Despite all of the efforts to \nundermine the Affordable Care Act, to shorten the time\n\n\nperiod in which people can sign up, to make it more difficult by having \nthe site closed for part of Sundays, we are seeing a record number of \npeople enroll in the initial days of open enrollment.\n  According to news reports, on the first day alone, about 1 million \npeople visited healthcare.gov and more than 200,000 people selected a \nplan for 2018. That is almost double the number who signed up last year \non the first day.\n  For anybody who is still thinking about it, you have until December \n15, so sign up early. As my colleague from New Hampshire, Senator \nHassan, says, it is the best Christmas shopping you can do--take care \nof your healthcare. Go to healthcare.gov and shop around, get the best \ndeal, and enroll during this open enrollment period.\n  This surge in signups is especially remarkable in light of the widely \npublicized efforts by the Trump administration to depress enrollment. \nThe administration has slashed the advertising and outreach budget by \n90 percent, cut the open onrollment period by half, and shut down the \nmarketplace website for 12 hours on Sundays, taking away valuable \nweekend hours when people have free time to explore plans.\n  I think the healthy volume of enrollments sends two very important \nmessages.\n  First, it shows again that ordinary citizens, faith groups, insurance \nnavigators, and other private organizations have done an amazing job of \nfilling the outreach void that has been created by this effort by the \nadministration to cut back on letting people know about the website and \nhow to enroll. Those folks have spent countless hours getting out the \nword that the Affordable Care Act remains the law of the land and that \nthose who qualify for financial assistance can purchase high-quality, \naffordable coverage.\n  The second message that I think is important from this strong \nenrollment is a message that has been echoed in recent public opinion \npolls. It is one that we saw in the turnout in the Virginia elections \nlast night. It is that a clear majority of the American people support \nthe Affordable Care Act, that they reject efforts to sabotage it and \nthey want Members of Congress to work together to strengthen it, just \nas Senator Murray said.\n  I am very pleased that we have come together in the Senate to do just \nthat. We have come together in support of bipartisan efforts led by \nSenator Murray and Senator Lamar Alexander, the chair and ranking \nmember of the HELP Committee. They have come together to stabilize the \nAffordable Care Act and the marketplaces and bring down premiums. I am \nproud to be one of the 12 Democrats who were original cosponsors with \n12 Republicans of this legislation. This balanced agreement, which was \nnegotiated by Senators Alexander and Murray over many months, is our \nbest bet for restoring stability to the marketplaces in the short run \nand giving us the time we need to negotiate longer term to deal with \nother changes to the health law to make it work better.\n  I am especially pleased that the Alexander-Murray agreement provides \nfor the continuation of cost-sharing reduction payments, or CSRs, which \nare payments that are necessary to keep premiums, deductibles, and \ncopayments affordable for working families. They are extended for 2 \nyears in this bill. Without these payments, the cost of coverage will \nskyrocket, insurers will leave the marketplaces--as we have already \nseen, as the Trump administration has said they are going to \ndiscontinue those payments--and millions of people will lose their \nhealth coverage. This is an opportunity for us to keep that from \nhappening. Both Democrats and Republicans have recognized that these \ncost-sharing reduction payments, these CSRs, are an orderly, necessary \nsubsidy that keeps down the cost of health coverage for everyday \nAmericans.\n  In recent months, I have heard from hundreds of people across New \nHampshire about the enormous difference that healthcare reform has made \nin their lives. We are a small State--we have just over 1.3 million \npeople--but nearly 94,000 Granite Staters have gotten individual health \ncoverage through the Obama marketplace, and nearly 50,000 have gotten \ncoverage thanks to the Medicaid expansion, which had bipartisan support \nin New Hampshire. So that is about a tenth of New Hampshire that is \ncovered either through the Affordable Care Act or through the expansion \nof Medicaid. And for us in New Hampshire, it has been particularly \ncritical in responding and providing treatment to those people with \nsubstance use disorders.\n\n  Patricia Tucker has written to me. She is a substance use disorder \ncounselor in Northfield, NH, and she talks about how grateful she is \nfor the Medicaid expansion. She writes:\n\n       I am seeing people come for help that were not able to get \n     help in the past because they couldn't afford it. They are \n     getting help and remaining abstinent. If one mother gets \n     clean, this affects so many others.\n\n  She goes on to say:\n\n       [I treat] one mother who has two children. She now cares \n     for these children and has a full-time job. In the past, she \n     lived off the state and did not care for anyone, including \n     herself. Multiply this by thousands, just in New Hampshire, \n     and this makes such a big difference.\n\n  And think about how across the country we have affected people with \nsubstance use disorders because they can now get treatment.\n  I agree with Patricia Tucker and so many others who have contacted me \nabout the Affordable Care Act. We are grateful for the progress, and we \nrefuse to be taken backward. That is why the bipartisan agreement \nhammered out by Senator Alexander and Senator Murray is such an \nimportant breakthrough. This agreement stands on its merits as a good-\nfaith, win-win compromise. But just as important and maybe even more \nimportant, these two Senators have given us a template for bipartisan \nnegotiations on other critical matters that lie ahead, including tax \nreform, reauthorizing the community health centers and the Children's \nHealth Insurance Program, and reaching an agreement on the 2018 budget.\n  The Senate is at its best when we observe regular order, when we \nhonor the committee process, and when we work across the aisle and make \nprincipled compromises and get big things done for the American people.\n  In a Senate that is nearly evenly divided between Republicans and \nDemocrats, bipartisanship is the only productive way forward. This is \nhow the great majority of Americans want us to conduct the Senate's \nbusiness, and this is especially true on matters such as healthcare and \ntax reform that impact families in New Hampshire and all across \nAmerica.\n  I am grateful to people across our country who have gotten out the \nword about the health insurance open enrollment period that began on \nNovember 1 and continues through December 15. I am heartened by the \nsurge in enrollments. I am encouraged by bipartisan progress in the \nSenate to stabilize the health insurance marketplaces. I certainly hope \nthe leadership in the Senate allows this bill to come to the floor \nbecause we know we have the votes to pass it.\n  Instead of partisan efforts to undermine the law and take health \ninsurance away from people, let's embrace the spirit of the Alexander-\nMurray agreement. Let's work together in a good-faith, bipartisan \nfashion to build a healthcare system that leaves no American behind.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I yield the floor.", "turn": 59, "speaker": "Mrs. SHAHEEN", "itemno": 66}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to talk about the importance \nof bipartisan action on healthcare, as the Senator from New Hampshire \njust did.\n  Over the past year, I have traveled all around Minnesota to talk with \nindividuals and families and community leaders about healthcare. I have \nheard from mothers and fathers who have been worried about losing the \nhealthcare their children need to access lifesaving services. I have \nheard from daughters who have been panicked about how to pay for their \nparents' long-term care and prescription drug costs. I have heard from \nhospital executives in rural areas, much like the rural areas in \nArkansas, who have been concerned about how they are going to keep \ntheir doors open.\n  What is abundantly clear from all of these conversations is that \nMinnesotans want Congress to work together to build on the Affordable \nCare Act, lower healthcare costs, and support policies that work. That \nis why I believe, first, that Congress must act immediately to\n\n\npass bipartisan legislation to stabilize the individual market. Second, \nwe must do all we can to support strong enrollment in our health \ninsurance exchanges so that all consumers, regardless of their health \nneeds, can find high-quality, affordable health insurance coverage. \nThird, it is time to reauthorize the Children's Health Insurance \nProgram. Let me take each of those in turn.\n  When Republican efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act failed, the \nSenate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee got to work and \ndeveloped a bipartisan plan to stabilize the individual market. As a \nmember of that committee, I participated in numerous hearings with \nwitnesses who spanned the ideological spectrum, solicited input from \nState and national leaders, and worked in good faith with all of my \ncolleagues to develop legislation that is truly a compromise bill.\n  This legislation, referred to as the Alexander-Murray deal, will \ncontain healthcare costs for consumers, provide certainty to insurers \nparticipating in these markets, and provide States with the flexibility \nthey need to develop innovative, local solutions. I am proud of what we \nwere able to accomplish.\n  What I am most proud of is that this bill includes a provision that \nwill reverse a decision by the Trump administration that would \neffectively punish Minnesota for pushing forward a bipartisan plan to \nstabilize the individual market--a bipartisan plan in our State \nlegislature.\n  Last year, after our State experienced dramatic premium rate hikes in \nthe individual markets, State leaders worked together in a bipartisan \nway to pass a reinsurance program to contain these costs, but the \nprogram's enactment was contingent upon approval from the Federal \nGovernment.\n  After months of foot-dragging, the Federal Government finally \napproved the State's reinsurance plan as part of the 1332 waiver \nproposal, but the Federal Government simultaneously cut Federal funding \nfor MinnesotaCare, which is another program in the State that provides \naffordable health coverage to working families. Thus, our State had to \nchoose whether to support a bipartisan proposal to stabilize the \nindividual market and lower premiums for consumers or swallow hundreds \nof millions of dollars in lost Federal funding. It was an impossible \nchoice that was completely unnecessary. That is why I set to work to \nfix it.\n  After weeks of productive negotiations, I am pleased to report that \nthe Alexander-Murray deal will prevent the Trump administration from \nimposing these cuts on Minnesota. But my State wasn't the only one \nthreatened by potential funding cuts. The Alexander-Murray bill would \nprevent such problems from occurring in any other State as well, and it \nwould do much more.\n  According to the Congressional Budget Office, this agreement would \nreduce the deficit by billions of dollars, lower premiums in 2019, and \npreserve coverage options for individuals and families. In short, it is \nnot only good for Minnesota, it is good for the entire country. This \nbill is a bipartisan win-win-win.\n  Now our job is to pass this legislation into law. At the same time, \nwe must do everything we can to drive up enrollment in the health \ninsurance exchanges. Regardless of party, if we want to ensure that \nconsumers have access to affordable, high-quality health insurance \ncoverage, we have to get people to sign up for the coverage. More \npeople equals better risk pools, which equals lower premiums. It is \nreally that simple.\n  Look, the Trump administration has done everything in its power to \nundermine ObamaCare. It has halved the amount of time that people have \nto enroll in coverage, it slashed funding for outreach and enrollment \nefforts, and it deliberately misled consumers about the benefits of the \nACA and individual requirements for coverage. But we have the power to \ncombat these efforts.\n  Let's get people enrolled. Open enrollment started on November 1 and \nwill end for most people on December 15. Minnesotans are lucky in that \nthey have until January 14 to sign up for coverage. But everyone who \ndoesn't receive coverage from their employer or through Medicare needs \nto sign up now, so I urge my colleagues to get their constituents to \nvisit healthcare.gov and shop around and then enroll in coverage.\n  Lastly, it is time to reauthorize the Children's Health Insurance \nProgram, community health centers, and the National Health Service \nCorps. These have always been bipartisan programs. There is no reason \nthis should be any different today.\n  The anxiety that people in Minnesota and across the country feel \nabout their access to healthcare is not inevitable; it is the result of \npolitical decisions made here in Washington, DC. Let's prove to the \ncountry that we are not here to fight with each other, we are here to \nfight for them. Let's show them that we can get something done. Let's \ntake action to protect healthcare and give our constituents, at long \nlast, some peace of mind.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.", "turn": 61, "speaker": "Mr. FRANKEN", "itemno": 68}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to call for bipartisan \naction on healthcare.\n  I think it was interesting to learn that the citizens of Virginia who \nvoted yesterday listed as their top issue healthcare. There was \nobviously an issue there where there had been no Medicaid expansion, \nand they were unhappy with the way it had been handled by the \nlegislature there as well as Republicans who were in charge of the \nlegislature, and they appeared to be pushing for a change.\n  We have an opportunity here to make a bipartisan change. I think it \nis exactly the kind of message that we got yesterday. In my State, we \nhave a Republican legislature and a Democratic Governor. They came \ntogether to do something about some of the rates, particularly in our \nrural areas. They focused on reinsurance, cost sharing--some of the \nthings in the bipartisan agreement reached between Senator Alexander \nand Senator Murray. We have 12 Democrats and 12 Republicans \ncosponsoring that bill. Support includes the American Cancer Society, \nthe American Diabetes Society, the March of Dimes, and the Arthritis \nFoundation--and those are just the A's.\n  The American people want us to work together to make fixes to the \nAffordable Care Act. The day it passed, I said that it was a beginning \nand not an end. Unfortunately, we have been stymied in trying to make \nthose kind of changes, and this is one bipartisan big opportunity to do \nit. I think it is a sensible bipartisan approach.\n  As we all know, both Senator Alexander and Senator Murray held a \nseries of hearings and discussions on commonsense solutions to bring \ndown insurance costs with Senators on both sides of the aisle. There \nwere Governors and insurance experts, and we worked hard to make sure \nthere was some agreement on this bill. I fought for provisions that \nwould help States apply for and receive waivers to give them some \nflexibility to construct their healthcare system and to bring down the \ncosts without losing Federal funding. That is something my State did. \nAs I mentioned, my State, with a Republican-led legislature and a \nDemocratic Governor, came together to apply for a waiver and a \nreinsurance provision.\n  The bill would also expedite the review of waiver applications for \nproposals that have already been approved for other States that are \nexperiencing certain circumstances--emergency circumstances--where they \nneed to make changes.\n  The legislation also shortens the overall time period that States \nwould have to wait for the Federal Government to decide whether to \napprove their waivers.\n  All of these are good fundamental concepts--this idea that States \nshould have some flexibility, that they should be able to apply for \nwaivers, and that they should be able to get their answers as soon as \npossible from the Federal Government. That is what this bill is about. \nNot only does the bill improve the process for waivers and flexibility \nfor the States, like we have seen in Minnesota, where already the \nprojected\n\n\nnumbers brought the rates down something like 20 percent, but the \nnonpartisan Congressional Budget Office says the Murray-Alexander bill \nwould actually cut the deficit by $3.8 billion over the next 10 years. \nThat is hard to argue with.\n  It is clear that this legislation could get support from both sides \nof the aisle to make healthcare better for Americans. We have a \nmajority of Senators supporting this bill. So we need to get it done \nbecause the longer we wait, the more the markets don't know what is \ngoing on, the more confusion that is created, and the more the \nadministration is doing things that sabotages the Affordable Care Act.\n  We need this stability in the system. Passing the bill would be an \nimportant step forward, but we still must do more to bring down the \ncosts for middle-class families. A big part of that is addressing the \nskyrocketing costs of prescription drugs. I have heard from people \nacross Minnesota who are struggling to afford the medicine they need. \nThis is about the woman in Duluth who told me that she chose not to \nfill her last prescription because that one drug would cost a whole 25 \npercent of her income. It is about a woman in St. Paul who, even with \nMedicare, couldn't afford $663 a month for the medicine she needs. It \nis about someone from Crystal, MN, who told me: I am practically going \nwithout food to pay for the prescription. It is heartbreaking that this \nis happening in America.\n  Reducing the cost of prescription drugs has bipartisan support in \nCongress, and the President has said he wants to get something done. He \nhas said: The drug companies are ``getting away with murder.'' Those \nare his words. That is what he said.\n  So what can we do? Republicans and Democrats could come together and \nact right now. I have a bill that has 33 cosponsors that lifts the ban \nthat makes it illegal for Medicare to negotiate prices for prescription \ndrugs for 41 million seniors. I think 41 million seniors are pretty \ngood at getting bargains and deals, and they deserve to have someone \nnegotiating on their behalf; that is, the government negotiating for \nMedicare. Except, why don't we negotiate, like we do for the VA, and \nlike other countries do? We don't negotiate because there is a \nprovision in law that says that the government is not allowed to \nnegotiate on behalf of 41 million seniors with the drug companies. They \nare just set. Guess what that means. That is a big part of the reason \nwhy our drug prices are double the cost of those in Canada--because we \nare just taking it and we are not negotiating.\n  Another idea, bringing up Canada, is that Senator McCain and I have a \nbill that would allow less expensive drugs to be sold in the United \nStates. To me, that is a way of putting pressure on our own drug \ncompanies to put out better prices if they know there is going to be \ncompetition.\n  Senator Grassley of Iowa and I have a bill to stop something called \npay-for-delay. That is when big pharmaceutical companies actually pay \noff generic companies to keep less expensive products off the market. \nThis bill would save taxpayers $2.9 billion. Do you know why? Because \nright now there is no competition or very little competition, and they \nare actually paying their competitors to stay off the market. The \ncompetitors have decided: Well, I get more money to be paid to stay off \nthe market than if I actually competed.\n  Think about what a rip-off that is for the American people. We are \nallowing this to go on while the consumers are paying the price. How \nmuch? We know the government alone is going to save $2.9 billion if we \nstop this practice. Consumers would save most likely around that same \namount because they are paying all the copays. Both the government is \nripped off and the consumers are ripped off, and the only ones making \nmoney off of it are the drug companies.\n  Another idea is, Senator Lee and I have a bill that would allow \ntemporary importation of safe drugs that have been on the market in \nanother country for at least 10 years when there isn't healthy \ncompetition in our own country. Again, if your drug companies that are \nmessing around, charging high prices and not allowing competition in--\nif you know there might be foreign competition coming in, that is an \nincentive because you want to then make sure that doesn't happen \nbecause you know that if you keep your prices high and you do things to \ndisallow competition, you are going to have some major competition. I \ndon't know how else we bring the prices down without allowing more \ncompetition.\n  I also have a bipartisan bill with Senators Grassley, Lee, Feinstein, \nand Leahy, which is called the CREATES Act, to put a stop to other \npharmaceutical company tactics, such as refusing to provide samples to \ngeneric companies that are supposed to be allowed to compete with them. \nAccording to the Congressional Budget Office, this legislation would \nsave approximately $3.6 billion.\n  As we hear about tax reform and hear about the debt we might be \nseeing expand if something like this goes forward, then we ask \nyourselves: What is not in those bills? Why aren't we saving some money \nfor the American people and reducing the debt by allowing for this \ncompetition, by allowing for the samples, by allowing for more \ngenerics, by stopping this practice of companies paying each other to \nkeep their competitors off the market?\n  What this healthcare debate has been about for the last year, where \nrepeatedly there have been attempts to repeal the Affordable Care Act--\nit has been about that. The American people made it really clear, they \nwant to make it about something else. They want to make it about \nimprovements to the system we have now to make it easier for them. One \nway is the Alexander-Murray bill, which I strongly support. I am one of \nthe cosponsors. It is smart. It works with the States, both Democratic \nand Republican States--blue States, red States. We want to see that \nkind of flexibility. The other way is to take a stand, be willing to \ntake on the pharmaceutical industry, and take on some of the cost \nissues when it comes to prescription drugs.\n  Let's come together in the Senate, as an initial move, and pass the \nMurray-Alexander bill. We must do that, and we must do it by the end of \nthe year. Then we can go on from there to actually do something about \nthe cost of prescription drugs.\n  I yield the floor.", "turn": 65, "speaker": "Ms. KLOBUCHAR", "itemno": 72}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Our mothers, \nfathers, and others before us have worked hard to ensure that we have a \nfair shot at the American dream. Unfortunately, it feels like the \nfabric of the American dream has started to fray for far too many \nfamilies. Even more troubling, we are seeing nominees from this \nadministration who seem committed to actively unraveling the support \nand the protections that help workers get ahead.\n  Today we are considering the nomination of Peter Robb to be general \ncounsel of the National Labor Relations Board. Mr. Robb would be \nresponsible for ensuring safe working conditions and fair compensation \nfor American workers. He would be tasked with protecting the treasured \nright of workers to engage in good-faith negotiations with their \nemployers.\n  However, a brief look at Mr. Robb's career reveals a clear track \nrecord of working to undermine our Nation's workers and middle class on \nbehalf of corporate executives. To Mr. Robb's credit, he is not trying \nto hide his record or run away from his record. All you have to do is \nvisit his firm's website, and you will see the experiences he is proud \nto display. I believe it is a preview of how he will approach his \nposition at the National Labor Relations Board. His self-proclaimed \naccomplishments include: advising large corporations on mergers, \nacquisitions, and plant closings; securing labor injunctions; and \nbringing suits against labor organizations.\n\n\n  When someone tells you who they are, believe them. While I certainly \nbelieve that every American and corporation is entitled to vigorous \nrepresentation by their lawyers, I also believe Senators must evaluate \nevery nominee's full body of work. Let's be clear about how Mr. Robb \nhas chosen to spend his professional life: helping management close \nplants and cut jobs, suing unions, delaying workers' rights to \ncollectively bargain, and defending companies that violate workplace \nsafety and fair pay laws.\n  At a time when corporate profits and executive compensation have \nskyrocketed and worker wages are stagnant, I have no confidence in Mr. \nRobb's ability to be a neutral arbiter between labor and management, \nlet alone advocate for the safety and the well-being of America's \nworking men and women. Our Nation's workers deserve a nominee who will \nprotect their right to negotiate for fair pay and safe working \nconditions, not someone who has spent his entire career litigating \nagainst workers.

Mr. President, the Senate has, actually, already \nconsidered Bill Wehrum to be the Assistant Administrator for Air and \nRadiation at the Environmental Protection Agency, who is the person in \ncharge of the rules to administer the Clean Air Act at the EPA. This \nperson has already been considered, and the Senate decided that he was \nnot right for the job.\n  Over 10 years ago, President Bush nominated Mr. Wehrum to head the \nOffice of Air and Radiation at the EPA. He was rejected because his 6-\nyear record as an employee at the EPA told the Senators all that they \nneeded to know. As the ranking member, Jim Jeffords, put it at the \ntime: ``Mr. Wehrum's disdain for the Clean Air Act is alarming.'' If \nyou disagree with the foundational Federal law that we use to keep our \nair clean, then it is hard to believe that you can competently lead the \nEPA's efforts when it comes to protecting our right to clean air. A \ndecade later, nothing has changed. Mr. Wehrum has done nothing that \nshould change our minds about his ability to lead the EPA.\n  This, of course, is part of a pattern. This administration continues \nto nominate anti-science, pro-pollution, climate-denying people to lead \nthe U.S. agencies that are in charge of science and climate.\n  Scott Pruitt has denied a century's worth of established science and \nbasic facts that say that climate change is real, urgent, and caused by \nhumans. He now leads the No. 1 Federal Agency that is charged with \nworking on climate change.\n  Then there is Jim Bridenstine, who hopes to lead NASA, which is one \nof our Nation's top science agencies. He, too, is still on the fence \nabout climate change.\n  Meanwhile, 13 Federal agencies, including the EPA and NASA, just \npublished a dire report that reads that greenhouse gases released by \nhuman activity are to blame for rising temperatures and severe weather \nthroughout the world.\n  This is why Mr. Wehrum should not go any further. It is really very \nsimple. Our own government scientists say that climate change is real, \nurgent, and caused by humans.\n  If you do not want to take their word for it, here in the United \nStates in this year alone, a record number of category 4 hurricanes \nkilled dozens of people and destroyed or damaged entire communities in \nthe southern United States and Puerto Rico. Wildfires killed dozens of \npeople and burned more than 8.4 million acres in the Northwest. \nDroughts lasting for months wiped out farmers' crops and forced \nranchers to sell livestock in the Midwest. The city of Seattle had soot \non cars from the wildfires. For a period, the State of Montana, \ndepending on where you were, looked like it was literally on fire.\n  The U.S. Forest Service's budget is soon to be more than 50 percent \nfirefighting. This is supposed to be the Forest Service for the \nconservation and management of our forests, and now it is the Federal \nfirefighting of our forests. There have been 15 severe weather events \nthis year that have resulted in losses exceeding $1 billion. That is \nwhat insurance companies and reinsurance companies consider to be the \nthreshold. They consider a big event--a catastrophic event--from an \ninsurance standpoint to be a $1 billion event. We had 15 of them this \nyear in the United States. In the past 10 years, the U.S. Government \nhas spent more than $350 billion in helping communities recover from \nsevere weather, and that is before our getting through with the various \nand necessary disaster supplemental budget requests that are coming \ndown for Florida, Houston, and Puerto Rico.\n  Look, severe weather is a reality or whatever you want to call it. If \nyou feel uncomfortable politically calling it ``climate change,'' fine, \nbut severe weather is actually already happening. It is now a moral \nissue, and it is a fiscal issue. It has taken a huge toll on our \neconomy, on the American taxpayer, and on local communities. For the \nmost part, we do not budget for\n\n\nthese costs because we have decided that these are one-time events, but \nthey just happen to be one-time events that are occurring more and more \nfrequently and that are costing more and more.\n  Because of the leadership vacuum that Scott Pruitt and Donald Trump \nhave created, States and cities and the private sector have been \nstepping up so that the United States can stay on track to cut carbon \nemissions and fight climate change. Yet the Federal Government still \nhas a responsibility here, not just a moral responsibility but a legal \none, for the climate will keep changing, the costs will keep rising, \nand more and more people will feel the effects. Instead of stepping up \nso that our Federal debt does not balloon and our coastlines do not \nerode and our security is not threatened, this administration keeps \nnominating people like Mr. Wehrum to deny that climate is an issue and \nthat the government ought to act.\n  Throughout his career, Mr. Wehrum has demonstrated antipathy for the \nvery laws that he is now going to be tasked with upholding. When he \nheld this position in an acting capacity in the 2000s--in other words, \nhe was filling in until he was confirmed but was never confirmed--he \nwas sued dozens of times for not doing his job. Time and again, the \ncourts found that, in fact, he was putting special interests over \nscience and over the public good. This is not just a rhetorical \nstatement. These are 27 times that Mr. Wehrum lost in court for \nexceeding his authorities under the law.\n  Here is where he kept getting specifically into trouble. Mr. Wehrum \nis a former lawyer for the very industries that the EPA regulates--\nchemical companies, utility companies, the auto industry. This is the \nexperience that he relied on while he worked at the EPA, which is fair \nenough so far, but when the Agency started working on a rule that \nregulated pollution from powerplants, Mr. Wehrum took language from his \nformer law firm--again, which represented powerplants--and gave it to \nthe EPA to put into the rule. In other words, the EPA did not look to \nexperts and scientists to decide how best to regulate powerplants; it \nlooked to the powerplants' lawyers.\n  Mr. Wehrum's job was to protect clean air and public health, and he \nfailed at that job by siding with special interests over that mission. \nThe courts actually stepped in 27 times, and he lost 27 times. One case \nwent all the way to the Supreme Court under Mr. Wehrum. The EPA said \nthat it did not have the authority to regulate carbon dioxide from \nautomobiles, but under U.S. law, the EPA must regulate all emissions \nthat are damaging to human health and welfare, and the Supreme Court \nhas acknowledged that carbon pollution fits that description.\n  Just to be clear, under the EPA's responsibility to administer the \nClean Air Act, the EPA does not just have the authority to regulate \ncarbon emissions; it has the obligation to regulate carbon emissions. \nIn other words, anything that is airborne that causes harm to people, \nto public health, must be regulated. The EPA does not simply decide \nwhich of these airborne pollutants must be regulated; it has to \nregulate all of those pollutants that cause damage to public health. \nClearly, carbon fits that category on a commonsense level, but the \nSupreme Court also decided that. There have been more intense storms, \nas we have seen from Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, Maria, and others, that \nare certainly bad for human health and well-being, and the Supreme \nCourt has agreed. The EPA has the authority and the obligation to \nregulate these greenhouse gases.\n  We do not need to go through this again. Mr. Wehrum has already shown \nthat he is not the right leader for the EPA. He will not commit to \ntaking the necessary steps to address severe weather. He will not fight \nfor clean air. He will fight for his former clients. This is not an \naccusation. It is based on exactly what he did when he was in the same \nposition. It is the reason the Senate rejected him 10 years ago.\n  With this kind of information in front of us, there is no way we can \nput Mr. Wehrum back in charge of the office that is tasked with \nregulating carbon pollution, not when we are facing a planetary \nemergency, not when the fiscal and human costs of inaction are so \nclear. The EPA needs leadership that understands the crisis we are \nfacing and that understands and is willing to do everything in its \npower to address it. Mr. Wehrum has clearly demonstrated that he is not \nthe right person for this job.

Mr. President, I rise today to talk about a historic \nopportunity that will soon be before this body. It is an opportunity to \nbring real relief to the American people. It is an opportunity to jolt \nour economy into a higher gear and bring real, tangible benefits to \nAmerica's hard-working families.\n  It has been over 30 years since this country last reformed its Tax \nCode. Over those 30 years, we have seen a lot of change. We have seen \nthe country move from Ataris to smartphones and Wi-Fi. This photo shows \na Ford LTD station wagon, which rolled off the assembly line 30 years \nago. It is a car that any of us would have been excited to drive 30 \nyears ago. Today we have cars that drive themselves. Unfortunately, we \nstill have a tax code that is made for this LTD.\n  So while the world has changed around us and other countries have \nlearned to craft tax codes to entice businesses to grow, our code has \ngotten more and more out of date and more and more laden with special-\ninterest giveaways. Our Tax Code has turned Main Street into a dead end \nand our overseas growth into a one-way street.\n  Reforming the code is not only a way to give us an opportunity to end \nthose giveaways, but it can also boost our economy. I applaud our \ncolleagues in the House, who last week introduced and are working on a \nproposal to overhaul the tax system. In the coming days the Senate \nFinance Committee will introduce their own legislation.\n  While I will mostly focus my comments today on one aspect of tax \nreform, I will note that on Friday the Tax Foundation released its \nanalysis of the House tax proposal. This analysis concluded that the \nHouse proposal would create 975,000 full-time-equivalent jobs and push \nGDP 3.9 percent higher than it would otherwise be. Taking into account \nthe economic feedback from the proposed reforms, this means taxpayers \nwould end up with 4.4 percent higher income. In other words, they will \nmake greater, higher income as a result of the bill that the House is \nworking on today. Indeed, the Tax Foundation concluded that the total \nafter-tax gain in income for a middle-class family would be nearly \n$2,600.\n  Importantly, for my constituents in my home State of Colorado, the \ngain would be over $3,000. These are serious gains that will bring \nreal, meaningful benefits to hard-working Americans. This is just the \nstarting point for our reform. This number is over $3,000 of impact to \nthe people of Colorado of additional income and tax relief. When a \nsignificant segment of Americans don't even have access within 24 hours \nto just a few hundred dollars, a $3,000 a year gain is a significant \namount of money.\n  Today I would like to focus on one part of the tax reform package, \nand that is the lowering of taxes on America's job creators. Because we \nhave this clunky Atari-era Tax Code--this Ford LTD station wagon Tax \nCode, our tax rates are no longer competitive. They encourage companies \nto invest abroad rather than right here at home in the United States. \nBack in 1986, when this car rolled off the assembly line, our corporate \nrate was competitive. It didn't discourage companies from investing in \nthe United States.\n  Things have significantly changed since 1986. Foreign countries have \nfigured it out. They lowered their tax rates, and now the United States \nhas the highest corporate tax rate in the\n\n\ndeveloped world--indeed, one of the highest tax rates in the world, \nperiod. Consequently, businesses have moved abroad more and more. They \ninvested more abroad, and in the United States they have invested less \nand less.\n  It is not in the Republicans' view alone. I would draw your attention \nto this quote right here. President Obama noted this gradual \ndeterioration of the corporate tax code in his 2011 State of the Union \nAddress, saying:\n\n       [O]ver the years, a parade of lobbyists has rigged the tax \n     code to benefit particular companies and industries. Those \n     with accountants or lawyers to work the system can end up \n     paying no taxes at all. But all the rest are hit with one \n     of the highest corporate tax rates in the world. It makes \n     no sense, and it has to change.\n\n  Those are the words that President Barack Obama spoke to a joint \nsession of Congress in 2011 in his State of the Union Address.\n  The Council of Economic Advisers estimates that just moving the tax \nrates on corporations from the uncompetitive 35 percent to the middle-\nof-the-pack 20 percent and adding permanent full expensing of capital \ninvestments would increase GDP from 3 percent to 5 percent above what \nis currently forecasted. That increase would not just happen in a \ndecade or two, it would be front-loaded, meaning that we would see a \nfast response from this economy, with 2.4 percent to 3.2 percent higher \nGDP in the first 3 to 5 years under this proposal. That boost will not \njust be to the corporate bottom line. It will increase the average \nAmerican household income by $4,000.\n  Let me say that again. It will increase average household income in \nAmerica by $4,000.\n  Since these estimates were released, since those numbers, statistics, \nand analysis have been done, opponents of pro-growth tax reform have \nthrown everything they can at the proposals and estimates to see what \nwill stick to try to bring it down. They said these numbers are too \nrosy. They said that we can't possibly get a $4,000 increase in average \nhousehold income because that would mean more money would end up in \nbank accounts of American households than is raised in revenue by the \ncorporate income tax.\n  They said that corporations have been ``rolling in money'' for a long \ntime. So if they wanted to invest in America they already would have. \nSome opponents say we should tax corporations more--take the profit \nthat is sitting overseas and spend it as the government wishes. When \nopponents of tax relief see a company with money, their reaction is to \ntake it--to take it like it is the Government's money. But we know that \ndoesn't work. Even our European friends, whose residents tend to be far \nmore open to socialist experiments, have rejected this notion. They \nknow that tax reform is about creating the environment that will cause \ncompanies to invest in America, not attempting to seize profits from \ncompanies that can easily move elsewhere. That is why France, Germany, \nSpain, Italy, and Greece--not exactly bastions of open economic \ninnovation--have lower corporate tax rates than we do.\n  The chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, Kevin Hassett, told \nthe Joint Economic Committee recently:\n\n       This is not about right wing parties throwing money at rich \n     corporations. It is about economically literate governments \n     understanding that if we want wages to be higher, than we \n     have to give workers capital to work with.\n\n  Let me say that again. This effort for tax relief is about \n``economically literate governments understanding that if we want wages \nto be higher, then we have to give workers capital to work with.''\n  Let's go back to the first response we heard from opponents of tax \nrelief: It is ``absurd'' to think the average American household will \nget $4,000 more in income because that is more than the country raises \nin tax revenue.\n  In other words, if we took every dollar raised from corporate tax and \nhanded it over to American families, they wouldn't get $4,000. That is \nthe argument opponents of tax reform are saying, but this response \nsimply doesn't get it.\n  What is the economically literate perspective?\n  Recall that a lot has changed over the last 30 years, but one thing \nhasn't changed, and that is the U.S. corporate tax rate. As you can see \non this chart, the average OECD tax rates have dropped over time. You \nsee the blue OECD line, and the orange line on the chart is straight \nacross. The average OECD tax rates have dropped over time, but the U.S. \nrate stayed right where it is. The U.S. advantages that made it the \nplace to invest in 1986 have slowly faded away. Other countries have \nused their tax rates to become more competitive, and companies have \nresponded.\n  Business investment now is unfortunately low. Indeed, Chairman \nHassett warned that there is a crisis in our country because of the \nlack of what is called capital deepening, which is just an economist's \nterm for the impact of capital stock--things such as equipment, \nstructures, and intellectual property--on worker productivity.\n  Worker productivity is, in turn, what drives up wages. That is what \nmakes wages increase. The more productive a worker is, the more the \nemployer is willing to pay that worker to keep him or her in the job \nwith rising wages.\n  Going to another chart, we can see the effects of that. Prior to \n1990, when corporate profits were going up by 1 percent, workers' wages \nwent up by more than 1 percent. Since that time in the 1990s, we have \nseen change. From 2008 to 2016, a 1-percent increase in business \nprofits corresponded with only a 0.3 percent increase in workers' \nwages. One of the biggest culprits in this is the corporate tax rate. \nIt is what causes that disconnect between corporate profits and \nworkers' wages.\n  When a company decides whether and where to invest in new buildings, \nequipment, and research, they look at the tax rate to know what return \nis needed to make that investment profitable. The higher the tax, the \nhigher the needed return. So companies facing higher taxes either don't \ninvest at all or they invest in another country. That is why experts \nsay that workers bear 45 percent to 75 percent of the burden of \ncorporate taxes, because businesses invest in them less and less, the \nhigher the tax. It is as if the corporate tax rate casts a shadow on \nthe entire economy.\n  We can see that shadow here. This is the way economists model the \nmarket for capital--factories, equipment, buildings, IP. The higher the \nprice, the less the companies demand. The lower the price, the more the \ncompanies demand. This is a simple concept.\n  Suppliers of those things are the reverse. If they have to sell at a \nlow price, they don't make very much, but if they can sell at a high \nprice, they make more. These two should meet in the middle, but they \ndon't meet in the middle today because the government has come in and \nimposed a corporate tax. So each unit of capital costs more than it \nshould because of this tax system. That means businesses only want this \nmuch. The producers only get this much. The government takes the rest.\n  What is left? We can see right here what the government is taking. We \ncan see the effect that taxes have on the economy. What is left is this \ndark-shaded triangle. This is what economists call deadweight loss. \nThat is the stuff that doesn't happen because of the tax. This is the \ntax shadow--the deadweight loss. It is deadweight in our economy. In \nthat shadow, business activity just doesn't happen, and workers just \ndon't get the capital they need to be more productive.\n  Remember, businesses are deciding whether and where to invest that \nnext dollar. If the cost is too high--reflected here--they won't \ninvest, at least not here in the United States. They will decide not to \nexpand at all, or they will expand in a country that has a lower tax \nrate, or they will simply shut down entirely.\n  I don't think the American people would be surprised by this. This is \nnot news to them. They lived this for a long time. They know it well. \nThey know businesses are not expanding here. They have seen businesses \nclose. They have seen a slowdown in the startup of new businesses. They \nknow wages haven't gone up in many years.\n  They understand this shadow. Businesses don't expand. Workers are \nlaid off. Money moves abroad. It is because of this high tax that \ndoesn't leave us with decreases in costs, creating a deadweight loss on \nour economy. They understand it, and they know that corporations pass \nthat tax on to them in the form of lower wages.\n\n\n  But here is the good news. Help is on the way. Lowering the corporate \ntax rate lowers the rate of return needed to make investments work. It \nremoves the shadow that blocks the economic sunlight. Suddenly \nbusinesses are operating here in the green.\n  More investment in factories, buildings, equipment, and IP means more \nAmericans are more productive, and that makes total sense. You get more \ndone when you have a new computer than when you have an old clunky one. \nYou produce more when you have a new machine on the line. Workers \nbecome more productive, and the companies pay them more both because \nthey are bringing in more and because they want to keep those workers \nto do more. That is what happens when you lift that economic shadow \nthat we talked about that corporate taxes impose and cast on our \neconomy. You create more jobs, and wage competition grows income.\n  This isn't just economic theory. As you can see here on this chart, \nwage increases are significantly higher in countries with lower \ncorporate tax rates. We don't need just simple economic theory; we need \neconomic results, and that is what this chart shows us. High-tax \ncountries like the United States have weak wage growth. The United \nStates is down here on this chart representing the highest statutory \ncorporate rate countries. High-tax countries like the United States \nhave weak wage growth--less than 1 percent, even close to zero percent. \nYou can see that here. Low-tax countries--these are the lowest \nstatutory corporate rate countries. These are the bottom 10 lowest \nrates. Low-tax-rate countries see a wage growth of 1 percent, 1.5 \npercent, 3.5 percent, even 4 percent, and that is because they don't \nlive under that economic dead weight, that tax shadow, that deadweight \nloss zone of high corporate taxes.\n  It also matches my experience in talking with companies in Colorado. \nU.S. multinational corporations doing business in Colorado have told me \nthat they want to expand here, but they just can't justify it when they \nlook at the tax rates we have here versus around the world, especially \nin Europe. I have even heard from some foreign-based companies that do \nbusiness in Colorado that this sort of reform--I ask unanimous consent \nto complete my remarks.", "turn": 77, "speaker": "Mr. GARDNER", "itemno": 85}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, it would entice them to invest more in \nthe United States. This is real, and the American people need it.\n  It is good television to say that it is absurd to think that American \nfamilies will get more money from lowering the corporate rate than the \ntax raised in revenue, but it is wrong. It is tempting to look at a \nstash of corporate profits and think that corporations just must not \nwant to invest here or ``let's just take that money,'' but that is \nwrong too. The right move is to create the tax environment that tells \nbusinesses that they should invest here because they can make more \nmoney. That is why President Obama called for corporate tax reform. \nThat is why former Treasury Secretary--and one of President Obama's \neconomic advisers--Larry Summers said that reducing the corporate tax \nrate and lowering the competitive disadvantage faced by American \nmultinationals is ``about as close to a free lunch as tax reformers \nwill ever get.'' That is what we do by lowering the tax rate.

Mr. President, a few moments from now, we are going to \ncome to this Chamber to vote on the nomination of Peter Robb to serve \nas general counsel for the National Labor Relations Board.\n  Quite frankly, if we allow this individual to be confirmed, it will \nbe a severe slap in the face to American workers. This is an individual \nwho has made a career out of attacking the ability of American workers \nto get a fair share of the wealth they create. Yet here is a proposal \nto put him in a leadership position at an agency whose purpose is to \nfight to make sure workers get fair treatment. How does it make sense \nto take someone who has fought to undermine the ability of workers his \nentire life and put that person in charge of making sure American \nworkers are treated fairly? Certainly, it is exactly the opposite of \nthe argument Candidate Trump made when he said he was going to stand up \nfor American workers. When push comes to shove, the President wants to \nshove workers down into the ditch.\n  It boils down to this: The National Labor Relations Board was \nestablished 82 years ago in the middle of the Great Depression to \nprotect workers by encouraging and promoting their right to collective \nbargaining. Think of the power of association so that workers can have \nthe opportunity to have a fair share, to have a basic foundation for \ntheir families to thrive. That ability of workers to organize has been \nbehind every advancement we have made as a middle class in America. Be \nit the 40-hour workweek, safe working conditions, standard benefits, \neach and every advance was led by workers' ability to organize. Yet \nhere the President wants to put in place an individual who has done \neverything possible to take away that right, that ability to weigh in \nfor basic fundamental fairness for workers.\n  The responsibility of the National Labor Relations Board is more \nimportant today than ever. We have seen the impact of policies on \nbehalf of the privileged and the powerful--incomes stagnating while the \nwealthiest Americans see their riches grow right up to the skyline. We \nhave seen that anti-worker forces throughout our country have led an \nassault in State after State after State against the right of workers \nto organize and to secure safe working conditions and fair wages.\n  Here we are at a time when America's workers have seen four decades \nin which their wages have been flat or declining while the rich and \npowerful have stripped off the growing wealth of this Nation for \nthemselves. Income inequality has soared, wealth inequality is massive, \nand here is one more person being nominated to accentuate that \ninequality in wealth and in income.\n  Back in 1981, Mr. Robb was lead attorney on the case to decertify the \nProfessional Air Traffic Controllers Organization. The union was \nstriking, and Mr. Robb helped President Reagan break that strike, which \nresulted in the firing of 11,000 striking workers and, as a commentator \nat the time said, forever ``undermined the bargaining of American \nworkers and their labor unions.''\n  When he last worked on the team at NLRB, this nominee was present for \ndecisions that--and this is recounted in a book called ``Right Turn''--\n``[a]ltered long-standing policy . . . narrowing the scope of \nactivities subject to traditional National Labor Relations Board \nprotections; broadening the permissible range of employer conduct in \nunion representation campaigns; lowering the costs to employers of \nunlawful activity; and otherwise narrowing or excusing the employer to \nmake changes subject to bargaining without informing unions before the \nchange was made, or by permitting employers wider latitude to end the \nbargaining process by declaring impasse.''\n  More recently, Mr. Robb represented Dominion Energy and successfully \ndefeated a union organizing drive at the Millstone Power Station, \nbragging on his firm's website that he was able to delay the election \nfor ``more than two years after the day the petition was filed.''\n  As many of you know, he does not want workers to have a fair chance \nto vote on organizing a union or to work to press for a first contract \nor to seek fair wages. He has spent his career fighting against workers \nhaving that fair shot and defending companies against allegations from \nunion members regarding unfair labor practices--all kinds of unfair \nlabor practices, including age and sex discrimination. Never once in \nthis long career has he been on the side of the American worker--not \nonce; therefore, he has no place\n\n\nat the head of an organization intended to support the ability of \nworkers to organize and to press for a fair share.\n  It is unthinkable that this nominee would ever even come to this \nChamber. It is certainly part of an endless stream of attacks by the \nrich and powerful on working Americans that have kept their wages flat \nand declining for four decades. When are we going to see an end to this \nsort of oppression by the powerful class against the workers of the \nUnited States of America?\n  There is one act after another by this administration--President \nTrump and his team--undermining fair wages for workers in this Nation. \nIt is outrageous.

Mr. President, President Trump has been in office now \nfor more than 9 months. He has laid out his agenda to cut punishing \nregulations, to grow the economy, and to help hard-working Americans.\n  President Trump's administration has already taken important steps to \nroll back the regulatory rampage of the last 8 years. During the last \nadministration, the Environmental Protection Agency issued harmful and \npunishing, overreaching regulations that hurt workers in my home State \nof Wyoming.\n  According to the chamber of commerce, from 2008 to 2016, the EPA \nissued regulations that cost our economy over $60 billion each year--\nsignificantly more than any other Federal agency. These rules had real-\nlife impacts. The Obama administration's so-called Clean Power Plan \nwould have closed powerplants and cost America jobs. We can have both \nclean air and a growing economy. We have proven it.\n  My goal is to make American energy as clean as we can, as fast as we \ncan, without raising costs on American families. President Trump shares \nthat goal. That is why EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt has led the \ncharge in cutting redtape. The EPA has taken important steps to roll \nback the Clean Power Plan and other punishing EPA regulations.\n  It is interesting. The annual cost of high-impact rules by agencies \nfrom 2008 to 2016--there were 13 rules by the EPA--in the red right \nhere, billions and billions and billions--over $60 billion.\n  Administrator Pruitt needs his full leadership team in place at the \nAgency to complete the task, so today the Senate is going to vote on \ncloture so we can consider the nomination of Bill Wehrum. He has been \nnominated to serve as EPA's Assistant Administrator for the Office of \nAir and Radiation. Mr. Wehrum has more than three decades of experience \nin environmental policy. He has worked as an environmental engineer, a \npublic servant at the EPA, and is an environmental lawyer. His time at \nthe EPA includes 2 years of service as the Acting Administrator of the \nOffice of Air and Radiation--the same office he has now been nominated \nto lead.\n  EPA's Office of Air and Radiation is critically important in terms of \na division within the Agency. It develops national programs, policies, \nand regulations for limiting air pollution and radiation exposure. One \nof the responsibilities of this office is implementing the Clean Air \nAct, and it is a big job.\n  Here is a chart. Most EPA regulatory burdens come from EPA air \nregulations; 94.5 percent from the Office of Air and Radiation \nregulatory burden in 2014; only 5.5 percent from all other EPA offices' \nregulatory burden of that same year. So under the Obama administration, \nthe air office was one of the biggest regulatory abusers. According to \nthe Office of Management and Budget, the EPA's air regulations were \nresponsible for 95 percent of the cost of the Agency's regulations. Now \nMr. Wehrum is going to play a key role in undoing this redtape.\n  The American people need a qualified leader in the EPA air office. \nBill Wehrum is the right man for the job. Don't take my word for it; \nformer environmental Obama Justice official John Cruden said this of \nMr. Wehrum: ``I believe he is committed to achieving clean air for all \ncitizens and carefully following sound and current science.''
