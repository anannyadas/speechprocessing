{"content": [{"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "P000612", "text": "  Mr. PERDUE. Mr. President, I say to the Presiding Officer, like you, \nI am a relative newcomer to this body. It is an enormous privilege and \nresponsibility to be a Member. Like you, I come from the real world, \nspending a career where your word is your bond, and telling untruth is \nnot rewarded. Unfortunately, in this body, sometimes that is not the \ncase, and both sides are guilty. What Americans are demanding right now \nis a change in the status quo, not only in this body but in Washington \nand in its entirety.\n  Tonight I want to talk about some of the things that have happened in \nthis body. I know both sides are guilty, but these are a couple of \nexamples that I think rise above the norm and are so egregious that I \ncould not let them stand.\n  Right now, Members of the minority party and their friends in the \nmedia are doing everything they can to stop us from changing the Tax \nCode this year. Their complaint about healthcare was that we weren't \ndoing it in regular order. Now we are doing tax reform in regular \norder. The bill that we are working on in the Senate will go to \ncommittee as soon as next week. It will be marked up with amendments \nfrom both sides. At the right time, it will then go to this floor, and \nwe will have amendments--again, from both sides--and we will vote that \nbill, up or down, into law or not. But Members on the other side are \nactively spreading numbers in studies that are based on false \nassumptions and have been proven to be untrue. I want to highlight a \ncouple tonight, but there are many others.\n  On Monday, the Tax Policy Center released a study saying that the \nHouse plan, which was released last week, to change the Tax Code would \nraise taxes on 25 percent of American families. The minority leader \nsaid this on that day:\n\n       This analysis makes clear that over one quarter of \n     taxpayers will see a tax increase under the Republican plan, \n     all in the name of giveaways for the wealthiest Americans and \n     biggest corporations. Republicans want to take away middle \n     class deductions for people with student loan interest and \n     medical expenses so that the rich can exploit bigger \n     loopholes and corporations can pay lower taxes.\n\n  That study by the Tax Policy Center didn't even survive a full day. \nIt was retracted later that afternoon. It is not even publicly \navailable online today to review any longer. Do you know what is, \nthough? The statements that came out of that report that day--false \nstatements, just like the one I just gave, and many others highlighting \nthat this study was reality. Maybe even worse is that these are false \nstories that are still running through the\n\n\nmedia, as if they were true, as if they were facts.\n  The website Vox posted a story about this study titled, ``The numbers \nare in, and House Republican tax bill raises taxes on nearly a third of \nAmericans.'' Surely, they posted an update saying that the study has \nbeen retracted. They say that they will update the story once new \nnumbers are released. In the meantime, this headline and this story are \nstill in existence as if they were still true. Why wouldn't they take \ndown the story? Why wouldn't they change the headline until new numbers \nare available?\n  I wish this were a single, discredited study we are talking about and \nthat this were the only time something like this has happened since we \nstarted to have this debate about changing the Tax Code and making \nAmerica competitive again. Unfortunately, it is not.\n  Multiple Members of the minority party said that the tax framework \nsupported by President Trump would raise taxes on families earning less \nthan $86,000 per year. One of my colleagues said: ``On average, middle \nclass families earning less than $86,000 will see a tax increase under \nthe Republican `tax reform' plan.''\n  Another colleague said: ``The average tax increase on families \nnationwide earning up to $86,100 would be $794.00 per year.''\n  Here is another one: ``The average tax increase on families \nnationwide earning up to $86,100 would be $794.''\n  You begin to think that there is a common thread among many Members \nin this body about this same story. This talking point is so wrong that \neven the Washington Post later that day came out and said so. It gave \nthis claim four Pinocchios, which we all know is their highest number \nagainst a falsity. That is the worst rating you can get on their fact \nchecking.\n  The Washington Post's full ruling said:\n\n       Democrats have spread far and wide the false claim that \n     families making less than $86,100 on average will face a \n     hefty tax hike. Actually, it's the opposite. Most families in \n     that income range would get a tax cut. Any Democrat who \n     spread this claim should delete their tweets and make clear \n     they were in error.\n\n  That is from the Washington Post. At least one statement making this \nclaim is still up, and I haven't seen a single statement admitting \nerror. These are but a couple of examples. There are many more.\n  As one last example, House Minority Leader Pelosi has called changing \nthe Tax Code ``a Ponzi scheme.'' Virtually every Democrat has called it \na ``betrayal of the middle class.'' Clearly, the facts do not back up \nthese claims.\n  The minority party is doing all it can to stop us from getting this \ndone this year because it makes good politics somehow. That is the only \nexplanation I can think of.\n  Answer this for me; it doesn't make any sense: Why would someone \noppose giving the middle class a tax break? Why would someone oppose \nmaking America competitive again? Why would someone oppose bringing \nbillions of dollars of U.S. profits back to the United States so that \nthey can be reinvested in the economy and create jobs? I don't \nunderstand it.\n  It is time for people in Washington, and even in this body, to stop \ndoing what is best for their own political self-interest on both sides, \nfrankly, and start doing what is right for the national interest. That \nright now--in the next few days--is clearly one thing, and that is \nfixing this archaic Tax Code.\n  Every person in this body is responsible to some degree for the \narchaic nature of this Tax Code. Both parties are responsible. If they \nwere acting in our national interest, we would be hearing about the \nstudy showing that, on average, Americans are projected to get a pay \nincrease of somewhere between $4,000 and $9,000 under this plan. We \nwould be hearing about how families making less than $86,000 a year are \nactually getting a tax cut. Again, that is a point even the Washington \nPost has acknowledged.\n  We would be hearing about how lowering the corporate tax rate, ending \nthe tax on repatriated earnings will make us more competitive with the \nrest of the world. We would be hearing about the economic growth that \ncould result from these potential changes.\n  We have a historic opportunity before us to deliver results and make \na difference in the lives of all Americans. There are Members of the \nminority party, however, who have supported these changes in the Tax \nCode right up until the point when President Trump took office. But \nthat is no excuse for this nonsense that is going on right now.\n  I think it is our role, on both sides, to call out these untruths. It \nis also our responsibility to stop this nonsense. What the American \npeople want are facts. They don't want fake news. They want to know \nthat we are here doing their work for them, to make sure that we make \nAmerica competitive again.\n  I say to the Presiding Officer, like you, I live in the real world. I \nhave dealt with the nonsense that came out of these bodies that \naffected our Tax Code in a way that kept us from being competitive. It \nis time we change that. We have to get it done this year so that we can \nignite economic growth next year and give relief to the middle class, \nwho have suffered so much over the last 8 years.\n  I yield the floor.", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. PERDUE", "itemno": 0}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
