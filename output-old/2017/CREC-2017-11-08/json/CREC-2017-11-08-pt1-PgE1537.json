Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the longstanding career \nof Ronald Johnson, a fearless leader for more than three decades in the \nfight against HIV/AIDS. His leadership spans numerous esteemed \norganizations and agencies including the Gay Men's Health Crisis, \nMinority Task Force on AIDS, City of New York, Presidential Advisory \nCouncil, AIDS Action, and United AIDS from which he is now retiring.\n  Following the Stonewall Uprising in 1969, the gay community of New \nYork City witnessed the rising swell of the HIV/AIDS epidemic. \nThroughout the 1980's, the number of AIDS-related deaths climbed higher \neach year. In 1981, amidst widespread fear and uncertainty, Dr. \nLawrence Mass and Larry Kramer founded the first New York City \nnonprofit devoted to HIV and AIDS awareness, testing, education, \nadvocacy, and prevention. They called it the Gay Men's Health Crisis \n(GMHC).\n  Mr. Johnson began volunteering with GMHC in 1984, while continuing \nhis service as the Assistant Executive Director of the University \nSettlement, a nonprofit social service program that assisted immigrants \nand low-income families with fulfilling their health, education, and \nhousing needs. After volunteering for a few years, Mr. Johnson was \ninvited to join the GMHC's Board of Directors.\n  Mr. Johnson served as Executive Director of the Minority Task Force \non AIDS and in 1992 was appointed the Citywide Coordinator for AIDS \nPolicy for the City of New York. Known for being both forceful and \npersuasive yet guided by facts, Mr. Johnson helped the city develop a \ncomprehensive strategy for stemming the HIV/AIDS epidemic through \nproactive education, prevention, and treatment. He strengthened the \ncity's AIDS hotline and testing programs, needle-exchange program, and \nhousing and medical care services for AIDS patients.\n  By 1996, Mr. Johnson was rewarded for his efforts as he witnessed a \nsharp decline in New York City's HIV and AIDS-related deaths. His \nprograms were working and he had the data to prove it. He later joined \nthe Presidential Advisory Council on HIV/AIDS, where he helped design \nthe policy thinking and best practices for the President's Emergency \nPlans for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR).\n  Today, on behalf of California's 13th Congressional District, I am \nhonored to commend Ronald Johnson for his long career advocating for \nthe prevention and treatment of HIV and AIDS. His service and devotion \nhas saved lives, inspired hope, and made this world a remarkably safer \nand better place.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Ms. LEE", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 3}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "182", "extension": true, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "E1537", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "8", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "HONORING RONALD JOHNSON", "id": "CREC-2017-11-08-pt1-PgE1537", "title": "HONORING RONALD JOHNSON"}
