Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and \ncongratulate Jennie Baranczyk, head coach of Drake University's women's \nbasketball team, for being named a 2017 Women of Influence honoree by \nthe award-winning central Iowa publication, Business Record.\n  For 18 years, the Business Record has undertaken an exhaustive annual \nreview to identify a standout group of women who have made a \nsignificant difference in business, civic and philanthropic endeavours \nthroughout the Greater Des Moines Area.\n  Jennie is no stranger to success. During her time as a member of the \nwomen's basketball team at the University of Iowa she was named First \nTeam All-Big Ten in 2003. Her outstanding athletics accomplishments \nearly on in her career have translated into her new role as the head \ncoach of Drake University's women's basketball team. In her first year \nas head coach, Jennie was given a team that finished with a record of \n11-20 the prior year. Her unyielding commitment to excellence and hard \nwork have turned the fortunes of the basketball program around, \nfinishing last season 28-5, champions of the Missouri Valley \nConference, and making an appearance in the NCAA Basketball Tournament.\n  Mr. Speaker, it is an honor to represent leaders like Jennie in the \nUnited States Congress and it is with great pride that I recognize and \napplaud her for utilizing her talents to better both her team, her \ncommunity and the great state of Iowa. I ask that my colleagues in the \nUnited States House of Representatives join me in congratulating Jennie \non receiving this esteemed designation, thanking those at Business \nRecord for their great work, and wishing Jennie a long and successful \ncareer.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. YOUNG of Iowa", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 3}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "182", "extension": true, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "E1534", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "8", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "TRIBUTE TO JENNIE BARANCZYK", "id": "CREC-2017-11-08-pt1-PgE1534", "title": "TRIBUTE TO JENNIE BARANCZYK"}
