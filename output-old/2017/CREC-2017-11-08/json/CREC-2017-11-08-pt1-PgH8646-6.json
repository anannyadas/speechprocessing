Mr. Speaker, on November 11 in this year of 2017, the \nnation of Poland will celebrate its 99th anniversary of independence.\n  To commemorate this historic event as well as to recognize the values \nthe United States and Poland have shared since the 1700s, I rise along \nwith my fellow co-chairs of the House Poland Caucus to introduce this \nbipartisan resolution.\n  As early as 1791, Poland adopted the first constitution in Europe \nbased on America's Democratic principle of liberty. Poland became the \nfirst nation in Europe to outlaw serfdom. As a result, Poland was \ntragically removed from the map of Europe for over a century-and-a-\nquarter, divided and split between three imperial powers: Russia, \nPrussia, and the Austro-Hungarian Empire.\n  Nevertheless, valiant Poles did not give up their values, but they \nkept\n\n\nalive the free spirit of Poland during foreign occupation and tyranny \nfor a century-and-a-quarter. Then, in 1918, with the help of President \nWoodrow Wilson following World War I, they triumphed in bringing their \nnation back onto the map of Europe in the form of a republic.\n  Today, American and Polish military cooperation through NATO is \ncritical to defending the spirit of liberty. Let this resolution serve \nto reaffirm the close bonds between our two great nations.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Ms. KAPTUR", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "182", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H8646-H8647", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "8", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "POLAND CELEBRATES 99TH ANNIVERSARY OF INDEPENDENCE", "id": "CREC-2017-11-08-pt1-PgH8646-6", "title": "POLAND CELEBRATES 99TH ANNIVERSARY OF INDEPENDENCE"}
