Mr. Speaker, it is my absolute privilege and \nhonor to welcome Pastor Jeff Williams, who just led us in the opening \nprayer. He is the head pastor at Faith Community Church in Janesville, \nWisconsin.\n\n\n  Jeff is the son of a Swedish immigrant. Pastor Jeff began in the \nministry at his home church in Rockford, Illinois, where he was born \nand raised.\n  In 1989, he and his wife, Brenda, moved about 30 minutes north up I-\n90 to begin Faith Community Church in Janesville. ``We had nothing but \na vision,'' he said. ``No people, no equipment, and no place to meet. \nJust a vision and the Lord. And that was enough.''\n  Over the years, Pastor Jeff has turned that vision into a beautiful \nhouse of worship and fellowship at the heart of our community. I have \nbeen there many times. It is really an impressive place.\n  Pastor Jeff has been a very good friend to me and to our family for \nmany years. I will note, however, that he is a Bears fan, and we can \nforgive him for that one.\n  But it is an absolute honor and privilege of mine to honor and to \nwelcome Pastor Jeff here, and I want to thank him for offering today's \nprayer.\n", "turn": 1, "speaker": "Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 3}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "182", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H8605-H8606", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "8", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "WELCOMING PASTOR JEFF WILLIAMS", "id": "CREC-2017-11-08-pt1-PgH8605-7", "title": "WELCOMING PASTOR JEFF WILLIAMS"}
