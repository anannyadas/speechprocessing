Mr. Speaker, I rise today, during National STEM Day, to \nrecognize the importance of encouraging our youth to pursue their \ninterests in science, technology, engineering, and math fields.\n  As technology continues to advance, STEM occupations continue to grow \nand become more valuable to the development of our society. Over the \npast decade, employment in STEM occupations has outgrown non-STEM \noccupations by nearly 20 percent.\n  I commend the House's work in implementing the annual Congressional \nSTEM App Challenge for students across our Nation. This competition \nallows students to compete by creating an idea for an app on a platform \nof their choice and is designed to engage student creativity and \nencourage their participation in STEM fields.\n  As a member of the Congressional STEM Education Caucus and the father \nof a STEM student in college, I will continue to support the growth of \nSTEM education throughout Arkansas and our country.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. HILL", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "182", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H8607", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "8", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "NATIONAL STEM DAY", "id": "CREC-2017-11-08-pt1-PgH8607-3", "title": "NATIONAL STEM DAY"}
