Mr. Speaker, I rise because I love my country. \nMr. Speaker, because I love my country, I rise to thank those who voted \nto reject bigotry, racism, xenophobia, ethnocentrism, sexism, and \nhatred in all of its forms, Mr. Speaker. I rise to thank them for what \nthey did when they voted to reject these things.\n  Mr. Speaker, because I love my country and because I cannot accept \nthese things, I refuse to accept hatred. I refuse to acquiesce to any \nforms of bigotry. Mr. Speaker, because I rise to reject these things, I \nnow announce that before Christmas there will be a vote on the chief \ninciter of racism, bigotry, hatred, xenophobia, sexism, ethnocentrism; \nthere will be a vote in the U.S. House of Representatives, Mr. Speaker, \non the impeachment of the President.\n  Mr. Speaker, this vote will take place before Christmas because there \nstill is a need for the public to weigh in. I announced earlier this \nyear, I called for the impeachment of the President right here on the \nfloor of the House. Since that time, I have read Articles of \nImpeachment. These Articles of Impeachment have been circulated, and we \nare giving people an opportunity to respond.\n  Momentum is building, Mr. Speaker. The momentum is building. More \npeople favor impeachment than not. Momentum is building. People should \nweigh in. They should let others know how they feel about impeachment. \nThey should let others know how they feel about the chief inciter of \nall of these ugly actions by way of persons responding to the chief \ninciter.\n  Mr. Speaker, today, I am proud to say this vote will take place, but \nI am also proud to say something else. I am proud to say that I am an \nAmerican, and while I have been told that there are political \nconsequences for what I will do, I accept the consequences. I accept \nthe consequences because I was not born in Congress. I wasn't born to \nbe a Congressman. I am a child of God.\n  Mr. Speaker, I refuse to come to Congress and acquiesce to bigotry \nand hatred. I am proud to announce that this vote will take place and \npeople will be able to vote to table the Articles of Impeachment. They \nwill be able to vote to reject them, or support them, or they will be \nable to vote to send them to a committee.\n  Whatever others will do is their choice. My conscience dictates that \nI will vote to impeach. Let others do what they may. History will judge \nus all. I pray, Mr. Speaker, that this country will continue to reject \nwhat the inciter in chief, Donald J. Trump, has been causing this \ncountry to have to endure.", "turn": 1, "speaker": "Mr. AL GREEN of Texas", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "  The SPEAKER pro tempore.
