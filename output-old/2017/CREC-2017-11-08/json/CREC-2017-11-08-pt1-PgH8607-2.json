Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to the \nRepublicans' tax scam. The middle class receives virtually no benefit \nfrom this bill.\n  This bill hits middle class Minnesotans especially hard by \ndismantling the State and local tax deduction. It increases costs for \ncollege students and their families. It abandons adoptive parents, and \nit punishes people with high medical bills.\n  So why does this bill hurt hardworking families? So President Trump \nand the Republicans can pay for giveaways to the wealthiest Americans?\n  Big corporations and billionaires will see their taxes slashed. \nWealthy heirs and heiresses will be allowed to dodge taxes entirely. \nWhile the top 1 percent of Americans receive nearly half the tax cuts, \n99 percent of us will be stuck with a Federal debt that will explode by \ntrillions of dollars.\n  Mr. Speaker, this Republican bill is not tax reform. It is not a good \ndeal for the middle class. It is a scam, plain and simple. I oppose it, \nand we must defeat it.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Ms. McCOLLUM", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "182", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H8607", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "8", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "THE REPUBLICANS' TAX SCAM", "id": "CREC-2017-11-08-pt1-PgH8607-2", "title": "THE REPUBLICANS' TAX SCAM"}
