Mr. Speaker, it is my honor to recognize the Keweenaw \nNational Historical Park upon the occasion of its 25th Anniversary. \nThrough committed preservation and community engagement, the Keweenaw \nNational Historical Park has become an indispensable part of Northern \nMichigan.\n  For over 7,000 years, the Keweenaw area has been a source of natural \nresources and cultural enrichment. Native peoples first utilized its \neasily accessible and workable copper to create tools and items for \ntrade. Later, copper became the center of growing industries and \ncosmopolitan communities in the Keweenaw. This rich history is \npreserved through the hard work of the rangers and volunteers at the \nKeweenaw National Historical Park.\n  The celebration of the park's anniversary is the perfect recognition \nof efforts to preserve our history, culture, and beautiful landscapes. \nToday, the park continues to raise the bar of innovation through \nprograms and partnerships with state and local governments, private \nbusinesses, and nonprofit organizations. Its steadfast work has helped \ngive the people of the Keweenaw Peninsula and all of the Upper \nPeninsula a sense of unity and common heritage.\n  Mr. Speaker, I congratulate the Keweenaw National Historical Park for \nits 25 years of success and community investment. Michiganders can take \nimmense pride in knowing that the First District is home to such an \nimportant institution of historical, cultural, and environmental \npreservation. On behalf of my constituents, I wish the Keweenaw \nNational Historical Park all the best in its future endeavors.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. BERGMAN", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 3}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "182", "extension": true, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "E1535", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "8", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "CELEBRATING THE 25TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE KEWEENAW NATIONAL HISTORICAL PARK", "id": "CREC-2017-11-08-pt1-PgE1535-4", "title": "CELEBRATING THE 25TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE KEWEENAW NATIONAL HISTORICAL  PARK"}
