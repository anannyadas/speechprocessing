Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Colonel Ben \nMargolius and Mr. Al Eaton, founders of the Southern Tier Veterans \nSupport Group.\n  Ben is a veteran of the Army, serving as the chief of joint \noperations for the U.S. Transportation Command and holding leadership \npositions at USCENTCOM, USEUCOM, and USTRANSCOM.\n  Al is a veteran of the Navy and, like my son, a graduate of the U.S. \nNaval Academy, having served as a naval flight officer on P-3 Orions, \nperforming antisubmarine warfare and surface surveillance missions.\n  After their military service, Ben and Al saw a great need to provide \nhelp to veterans where other agencies could not. This started \ninformally, with Ben and Al getting donations and support where they \ncould, until the Southern Tier Veterans Support Group was formed \nofficially in August of 2011.\n  Today, Ben and Al's work has brought over 70 community partners \ntogether to assist veterans and their families, with 425 veterans \nreceiving $65,000 in assistance since 2016.\n  Thank you, Ben and Al, for your service and for all that your \norganization has done to help our veterans.\n  Go Navy.\n\n\n  Go Army.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Ms. TENNEY", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "182", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H8644-H8645", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "8", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "RECOGNIZING COLONEL BEN MARGOLIUS AND MR.
