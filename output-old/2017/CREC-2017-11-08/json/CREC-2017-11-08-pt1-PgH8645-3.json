Mr. Speaker, here we are again, mourning the senseless \nloss of life from yet another terrible mass shooting.\n  Last Sunday, at their church in Texas, 26 more Americans were cut \ndown by a gunman. The oldest was 77 years old. The youngest was 17 \nmonths old.\n  This is just a few weeks after Las Vegas endured the deadliest \nshooting in our country's history and in the backdrop of ongoing \nviolence in cities, towns, and homes across the country that claims an \naverage of 93 lives each and every day.\n  The response from this Chamber is deafening silence.\n  Mr. Speaker, how can we face this epidemic without even a debate?\n  I am open to any commonsense idea to make progress on this issue, \nfrom universal background checks to limiting access to high-capacity \nmagazines and military-style assault weapons.\n  I have introduced legislation to help prevent theft from the Federal \nFirearm Licensees, expand background checks, and close purchase \nmonitoring loopholes.\n  I know there is no one single solution, but we cannot allow this \nepidemic to continue without even a discussion on what we can do. \nTogether, we have the opportunity to save lives.\n  I urge my colleagues to act.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. SCHNEIDER", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "182", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H8645", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "8", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "GUN VIOLENCE", "id": "CREC-2017-11-08-pt1-PgH8645-3", "title": "GUN VIOLENCE"}
