Mr. Speaker, all gave some, and some made the ultimate \nsacrifice. This Saturday is Veterans Day, a day we pause to honor the \nbrave men and women from our communities who have served our country. \nVeterans represent the best in America. Veterans embody loyalty and \nhonor by always putting their fellow soldiers and country before \nthemselves.\n  Veterans prove this determination in getting the mission done. This \ncountry has made a promise to every person who puts on that uniform. \nYou stand for us, and we will stand for you. Their mission was \nprotecting us. Our mission in Congress is to protect them.\n  To all of our vets, thank you for your service. Thank you for serving \nour country.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. CORREA", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "182", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H8646", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "8", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "THANKING ALL VETERANS", "id": "CREC-2017-11-08-pt1-PgH8646-3", "title": "THANKING ALL VETERANS"}
