Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to Paul \nOreffice, the former Chairman of the Board of The Dow Chemical Company, \nupon his 90th birthday.\n  Paul was born in Venice, Italy and came to the United States with his \nfamily when he was 17 years old. He went on to attend Purdue University \nand graduated with a Bachelor's Degree in Chemical Engineering in 1949. \nAfter serving in the U.S. Army during the Korean conflict, Paul began \nhis career at Dow Chemical in Midland, Michigan.\n  Following international assignments in Switzerland, Italy, Brazil and \nSpain, Paul became the first president of Dow Chemical Latin America in \nCoral Gables, Florida, in 1970. In 1971, he was elected as a member of \nthe Board of Directors, and later as president of Dow Chemical U.S.A. \nin August 1975. Paul was named president and CEO of The Dow Chemical \nCompany in May 1978 and chairman in May 1986.\n  As a humanitarian, Paul received the Encomienda del Merito Civil \n(Order of Civil Merit) in 1966 from the government of Spain and in 1978 \nhe was honored with the title ``Grand Ufficiale'' by the Italian \ngovernment. Paul is the first person to receive both the Societe de \nChimie Industrielle's Palladium medal and SCI America's Chemical \nIndustry medal, which he received in 1981 and 1983, respectively.\n  Paul has been especially helpful in giving back to Michigan's Fourth \nCongressional District through his intentional engagement of the \ncommunity. His involvement in bringing the Midland Soccer Club and the \nGreater Midland Tennis Center to life has not only provided \nopportunities for the local youth to come together to be active within \nthe community, but also brings tourism to the area through tournaments \nand other events. Paul's involvement in philanthropy touches not only \nthe Midland community, but reaches across the country as he is a \nTrustee of the Rollin M. Gerstacker Foundation, served as a Senior \nMember of the MD Anderson Cancer Center Visitors Board, and he served \nas Chairman of the Board of the Parkinson's Foundation from 2003 to \n2007. His strategic thinking and continued contributions have greatly \nimpacted families across the district and the country.\n  On behalf of the Fourth Congressional District of Michigan, I am \nhonored today to recognize Paul Oreffice for his lifetime of work in \nchemical engineering and for his commitment to the Midland Community.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. MOOLENAAR", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 3}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "182", "extension": true, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "E1531", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "8", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "TRIBUTE TO PAUL OREFFICE, FORMER CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD OF THE DOW CHEMICAL COMPANY", "id": "CREC-2017-11-08-pt1-PgE1531-4", "title": "TRIBUTE TO PAUL OREFFICE, FORMER CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD OF THE DOW  CHEMICAL COMPANY"}
