Mr. Speaker, this morning I rise to celebrate a truly \ngreat American and one of the finest men North Carolina has ever \nproduced, the Reverend Billy Graham, who, yesterday, celebrated his \n99th birthday.\n  Born November 7, 1918, in Charlotte, North Carolina, Reverend Graham \nhas devoted his life to spreading the Gospel of our Lord and Savior, \nJesus Christ.\n  While Reverend Graham was ordained as a minister in 1939, it was not \nuntil 1949 that he gained the international recognition he is known for \ntoday. It was that year that he hosted the Los Angeles Crusade. The \nCrusade was originally scheduled to last only 3 weeks, but it ended up \ngoing on for over 2 months as huge crowds came to hear Reverend Graham \nspread the Gospel.\n  In the years since the Los Angeles Crusade, Reverend Graham has \ntraveled across the United States and around the world to spread the \nGospel. According to the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association, in his \nlife, Reverend Graham has preached to nearly 215 million people in over \n185 countries and territories around the world.\n  Reverend Graham has served as a spiritual adviser to political and \nfaith leaders here in the United States and throughout the world. In \nthe 1950s and 1960s, he joined Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., for \nintegrated crusades. In later years, he delivered invocations at the \ninaugurations of four American Presidents. In 1983, President Ronald \nReagan awarded Reverend Graham the Presidential Medal of Freedom, which \nis our Nation's highest civilian honor.\n  Reverend Graham now resides where he has resided most of his life, in \nMontreat, North Carolina, where I have the honor of serving as his \nRepresentative here in Congress. While, physically, he has slowed in \nrecent years, the power of his work over eight decades is still felt by \nus all. Through the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association, his life's \nmission continues around the world. In fact, his family's mission has \ncontinued around the world.\n  Perhaps the greatest testament to Reverend Graham's dedication to the \nGospel is how he has chosen to spend his centennial year. Rather than \ncelebrate his work, Reverend Graham is devoting this year to \ncelebrating the work God has done through him.\n  Mr. Speaker, on behalf of everyone in western North Carolina, all \nAmericans, and so many people around the world, I would like to wish \nReverend Graham a happy first day to his 100th year.\n  I thank Reverend Graham for serving as a role model and spiritual \nguide for generations of Americans. I thank Reverend Graham for all he \nhas done to help those in times of need, and, most importantly, I thank \nhim personally for what he has done for me.\n", "turn": 1, "speaker": "Mr. McHENRY", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "182", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H8604", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "8", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "CELEBRATING REVEREND BILLY GRAHAM'S 99TH BIRTHDAY", "id": "CREC-2017-11-08-pt1-PgH8604-2", "title": "CELEBRATING REVEREND BILLY GRAHAM'S 99TH BIRTHDAY"}
