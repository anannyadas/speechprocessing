{"content": [{"text": "  Pastor Jeff Williams, Faith Community Church, Janesville, Wisconsin, \noffered the following prayer:\n  Our Father in Heaven, Your Word declares that You have been our \ndwelling place throughout all generations and that, from everlasting to \neverlasting, You are God.\n  Your sovereignty when juxtaposed with our humanity humbles us and \ncauses us to seek Your face on behalf of our Nation and those who \ngovern us.\n  When beginning his rule, King Solomon prayed for You to grant him a \ndiscerning heart to govern Your people and to distinguish between right \nand wrong. Grant that same discernment in this Chamber today.\n  I pray for these who have been entrusted with the responsibility to \ngovern this great people that they may adhere to the principles and \nconvictions our country was founded upon.\n  Bless them and their families, I pray. Your prophet Moses prayed \nsaying: ``May the favor of the Lord our God rest on us and establish \nthe work of our hands for us.'' May that same favor rest upon this, the \npeople's House, today.\n  In Jesus' name, I pray.\n  Amen.\n", "kind": "Unknown", "speaker": "Unknown", "itemno": 0, "turn": -1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 1}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "182", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H8605", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "8", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "PRAYER", "id": "CREC-2017-11-08-pt1-PgH8605-4", "title": "PRAYER"}
