Mr. Speaker, it is with sincere admiration that I \nrecognize the Asian American Medical Association, which hosts its 41st \nAnnual Gala on Saturday, November 11, 2017, at Avalon Manor in \nMerrillville, Indiana. Each year, the Asian American Medical \nAssociation pays tribute to prominent, outstanding citizens and \norganizations for their contributions to the community. In recognition \nof their efforts, these honorees are awarded the prestigious Crystal \nGlobe Award.\n   The Asian American Medical Association has been a tremendous asset \nto Northwest Indiana. Its members have dedicated themselves to \nproviding quality medical services to the residents of Northwest \nIndiana and have served their communities through many cultural, \nscholastic, and charitable endeavors.\n   At this year's Annual Gala, the Asian American Medical Association \nwill present the Crystal Globe Award to one of Northwest Indiana's \nfinest citizens, Mr. Joseph Costanza. Mr. Costanza began practicing law \nafter graduating from the Northwestern University School of Law in \n1961. Throughout his illustrious career, Mr. Costanza has served as \ncounsel for many organizations including the East Chicago Economic \nDevelopment and Redevelopment Commissions, East Chicago Parks \nDepartment, Ogden Dunes Parks Department, and the former American Trust \nand Savings Bank of Whiting, Indiana.
