Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. \n1066, the VA Management Alignment Act.\n  The men and women who have bravely served our country in uniform \ndeserve the peace of mind that the VA will work for them--not against \nthem.\n  Over the past few years, our nation's veterans have too often \nexperienced outrageous wait times, long lines, and mismanagement at VA \nfacilities across the country. In the wake of these scandals, the \nmembers of this body have passed multiple bills aimed to right these \nwrongs and improve VA functions. Unfortunately, we hear far too often \nof problems continuing to plague the halls of VA medical facilities.\n  The VA Management Alignment Act directs the Secretary of the VA to \nreport to Congress the steps the Department will take to ensure that \nthe organizational structure of the VA is both efficient and effective.\n  Supported by groups including the American Legion and the American \nFederation of Government Employees, this bill seeks to chart a \nmeaningful path forward to better serve those who put their lives on \nthe line to serve us. It is integral that the VA make clear the steps \nit will take to ensure that our nation's veterans have access to the \nquality, timely care that they deserve.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and I thank \nveterans across the country for their service.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. COLLINS of Georgia", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 3}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "182", "extension": true, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "E1533", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "8", "month": "November"}, "related_bills": [{"type": "HR", "context": "OTHER", "congress": "115", "number": "1066"}], "doc_title": "VA MANAGEMENT ALIGNMENT ACT OF 2017", "id": "CREC-2017-11-08-pt1-PgE1533-2"}
