Mr. Speaker, reforming our Tax Code isn't an easy thing to \ndo. If it was, we would have done it at some point in the last 30 \nyears. But here is the reality: because of high-powered lobbyists and \nspecial interests within a 5-mile radius of this body, we have failed, \ntime and time again, to do what is right for the hardworking American \ntaxpayer.\n  But in the coming weeks, however, we have a rare opportunity to \nfinally deliver a tax bill that puts working families first by passing \nthe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act into law.\n  First, let me address the fact that there are certain provisions \nwithin this bill that some of my colleagues and I might differ on. That \nwill always be the case. But instead of bickering, I urge my colleagues \nnot to look at things in a vacuum and, instead, evaluate it by asking \nourselves three important questions.\n  The first question we should ask is: Does this bill cut taxes for the \nvast majority of hardworking American families? The answer to this \nquestion is yes. Studies already show that if this bill passes, a \ntypical family of four making around $60,000 will see nearly a $2,000 \ntax cut.\n  Let's think for a second what this money could be used for. Instead \nof giving it to the Federal Government, families could spend it on \ntheir children, they could put it in savings, or they could even pay \noff their debts. President Trump promised working families around the \ncountry a tax cut. And if this was put on his desk tomorrow, that \npromise would be delivered.\n  This leads us to the second question we should ask ourselves: Would \nthis bill bring back jobs from overseas? The answer to this question, \nlike the first one, is also yes. By cutting the corporate tax rate to \nbelow the global average and making other necessary reforms on the \nbusiness side, this bill would make us competitive with our foreign \ncompetitors and encourage business to be done here instead of abroad.\n  Job creators, both large and small, have been coming out in support \nof this bill. Companies as big as UPS and AT&T, to small businesses \nright in North Carolina, have said that reforming our Tax Code will \nmake it easier for them to create more good-paying jobs, and we should \nlisten to them.\n  This takes us to my last question that we should all ask: Would this \nbill simplify the tax filing process for working families next year and \nin years to come? The answer to this, as well, is yes.\n\n  Mr. Speaker, one of the most striking statistics that I have seen \nwith my constituents and people all around the country is that they \nspend more than 10 hours a year doing their taxes. Because of the many \ndifferent forms they\n\n\nhave to fill out, recordkeeping, and tax planning that they have to do, \nAmericans are rightfully demanding a much simpler process. By doubling \nthe standard deduction, collapsing the rates, and closing special \ninterest loopholes, Americans will experience a much simpler process \nwhen filling out their taxes.\n  I know how stressful this process can be for many back home, and I am \na firm believer that the last thing you should do is worry about \nnavigating our broken Tax Code.\n  Mr. Speaker, I posed three questions, and the answer to all three was \nyes. So instead of bickering about preserving a deduction here, or a \ntax credit there, I urge my colleagues to unite behind a tax reform \nbill that would cut taxes for working families, bring jobs back home, \nand make the filing process simpler for millions of people.\n", "turn": 1, "speaker": "Mr. BUDD", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "182", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H8603-H8604", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "8", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "REFORMING OUR TAX CODE", "id": "CREC-2017-11-08-pt1-PgH8603-2", "title": "REFORMING OUR TAX CODE"}
