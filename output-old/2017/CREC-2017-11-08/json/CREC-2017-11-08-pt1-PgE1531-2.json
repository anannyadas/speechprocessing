Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and \ncongratulate Alex Thomsen of Underwood High School for winning the \nClass 1A, 126 pound bracket at the Iowa High School State Wrestling \ntournament earlier this year.\n  Iowa has a long and proud history of strong wrestling programs, \nproducing college and Olympic champions for years. Winning two state \nchampionships in a row is the culmination of years of hard work and \ncommitment, not only on the part of Alex, but also his parents, his \nfamily and coaches.\n  Mr. Speaker, the example set by Alex demonstrates the rewards of hard \nwork, dedication, and perseverance. I am honored to represent him and \nhis family in the United States Congress. I ask that my colleagues in \nthe United States House of Representatives join me in congratulating \nAlex on competing in this rigorous competition and in wishing him \nnothing but continued success.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. YOUNG of Iowa", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 3}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "182", "extension": true, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "E1531", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "8", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "TRIBUTE TO ALEX THOMSEN", "id": "CREC-2017-11-08-pt1-PgE1531-2", "title": "TRIBUTE TO ALEX THOMSEN"}
