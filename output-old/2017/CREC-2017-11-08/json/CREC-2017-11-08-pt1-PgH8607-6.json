Mr. Speaker, here is the Republican tax scam: first, \ncut taxes for the wealthiest corporations and for the superrich. Number \ntwo, cut Americans' healthcare.\n  Don't take my word for it. Just look at the Republican budget. After \nclearing the way for a $1.5 trillion tax cut, it proposes cutting \nMedicare and Medicaid--coincidentally, I don't think so--by $1.5 \ntrillion.\n  It gets worse. Under the Republican tax bill, American families would \nno longer get to deduct major medical expenses from their taxes. Seven \nin 10 households using the medical expense deduction make under $75,000 \na year, and over half of the Americans who depend on that medical \ndeduction are over 65 years old.\n  Families struggling to afford cancer treatment or long-term care \nshould not have to pay a health tax so that billionaires can get a huge \ntax cut.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to reject this scam. Americans \ndeserve a better deal.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Ms. SCHAKOWSKY", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "182", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H8607", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "8", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "REJECT REPUBLICAN TAX PLAN", "id": "CREC-2017-11-08-pt1-PgH8607-6", "title": "REJECT REPUBLICAN TAX PLAN"}
