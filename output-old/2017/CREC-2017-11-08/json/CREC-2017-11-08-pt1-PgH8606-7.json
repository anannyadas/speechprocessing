Mr. Speaker, today I rise to remember the life of Carrie \nBarnette, a woman who was known for her love of pickles, hummingbirds, \nand willingness to help others.\n  Carrie loved country music, and she grew up listening to it at her \ngrandparents' house. She frequently went to country music concerts and \nhad traveled to the Route 91 Harvest music festival with her childhood \nfriend, Jenn.\n\n\n  Carrie was a lifelong Californian who had just celebrated her 10th \nanniversary as a culinary team member at Disney California Adventure in \nAnaheim.\n  Carrie loved the children of her relatives and friends like her own, \nand friends say that she would have made a great mother. She also had \nthe nickname of Aunt Carrie because all the children loved her.\n  I would also like to extend my condolences to Carrie's family and \nfriends. Please know that the city of Las Vegas, the State of Nevada, \nand the whole country grieve with you.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. KIHUEN", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "182", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H8606-H8607", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "8", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "HONORING THE LIFE OF CARRIE BARNETTE", "id": "CREC-2017-11-08-pt1-PgH8606-7", "title": "HONORING THE LIFE OF CARRIE BARNETTE"}
