Mr. Speaker, I would like to commend President Trump \nfor nominating Michael D. Griffin to be Principal Deputy Under \nSecretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics (USD/\nATL).\n  There is a saying that a person was made for a certain job. In the \ncase of Dr. Griffin, this is true.\n  We currently have a convergence of space and national security \nfactors which are matched only by a handful of circumstances in the \npast.\n  I am thinking of Russia placing Sputnik in space, and President \nKennedy refusing to accept missiles in Cuba, and of President Reagan's \nplacement of Pershing missiles in Europe and starting the SDI, or \nStrategic Defense Initiative Office.\n  With the nomination of Mike Griffin, we have a person with the \nexperience of working in SDI yet also being the initiator of new ideas, \nsuch as the commercial cargo resupply program for NASA's ISS \n(International Space Station).\n  For this particular job at the Pentagon, that is what we need--a \nperson who knows how to utilize best practices of the past, combined \nwith the openness and boldness to recommend to the Secretary of Defense \nthe decisive actions which will keep America pre-eminent in technology, \nand give America the edge, when and if we must engage in armed \nconflict.\n  Dr. Griffin holds degrees from six separate universities, his \nmanagement experience in business and as former Administrator at NASA, \nas well as his work serving as a professor and as a consultant on \nDepartment of Defense review panels such as the Mitchell Commission \n(rocket launch engines), all prepare him well for this assignment and \nfor the rising challenges facing our military around the world.\n  After his confirmation, I look forward to working with him and the \nrest of our Department of Defense to help provide what is necessary for \nour national security.\n\n\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. ADERHOLT", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 3}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "182", "extension": true, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "E1535-E1536", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "8", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "COMMENDING THE PRESIDENT ON GRIFFIN NOMINATION", "id": "CREC-2017-11-08-pt1-PgE1535-5", "title": "COMMENDING THE PRESIDENT ON GRIFFIN NOMINATION"}
