Mr. Speaker, Saturday is Veterans Day. That is the day we \nset aside to revere those who served in our Armed Forces, especially \ntoday, because all who serve are volunteers.\n  Only one group of taxpaying volunteers who serve in our Armed Forces \nserve without a vote, and they are the veterans who reside in the \nNation's Capital. They have no final vote on this House floor, though, \nof course, I vote in committee. They are not fully recognized as \nAmerican citizens, although the District of Columbia is one of the \noldest jurisdictions in the United States.\n  D.C. veterans, therefore, are at the front of the line, demanding the \nvote in Congress and other rights granted only to residents of States.\n  I thank the Members of this body who have cosponsored my bill to make \nthe District of Columbia the 51st State. Each year we have beat last \nyear's record in cosponsors. Today I have introduced a statehood \nresolution in tribute to the District of Columbia's 30,000 veterans as \nVeterans Day approaches on Saturday.\n  The residents of your Capital City have never hesitated to serve or \ngive up their lives in war for their country. They have died for their \ncountry without a vote in disproportionate numbers.\n  World War I, more casualties than three States; World War II, more \ncasualties than four States; Korean war, more casualties than eight \nStates; the Vietnam war, more casualties than ten States of the Union.\n  There have been three votes to go to war since I have been a Member \nof Congress: the Gulf war, the Iraq war, the Afghanistan war.\n  I have gone to Arlington National Cemetery to comfort bereaved \nfamilies from the District of Columbia who died in those wars. The \ntragedy of their sacrifice is deepened because these men died securing \nthe vote for others in those nations, while they did not have the vote \nfor themselves in their own nation.\n  The only remedy to make our veterans whole is to give statehood to \ntheir city. The special urgency of our demand for statehood this \nVeterans Day is particularly pointed up by the fact that, for years \nnow, District of Columbia residents have been number one, per capita, \nin taxes paid to support the Government of the United States. \nUnderstand that, number one above all the other States in taxes paid, \nall without a vote. That outsize contribution, yet no vote on this \nHouse floor, no Senators in the other body.\n  That is not even a vote on D.C. matters. D.C. matters, some of them, \nhave to come to this floor. The D.C. appropriation, even though D.C. \nresidents raise more than $7 billion, not $1 of it is Federal money, \nyet the city's appropriation comes to this floor.\n  D.C. laws, sometimes on abortion or guns, are rather controversial \nmatters, but we don't bother the States when they do the same thing, \nand we certainly should have nothing to say when the residents of the \nDistrict pass laws of their own.\n  We almost got the vote on the House floor when we were paired with \nUtah, a Republican State. And the only reason we don't have that vote \non the House floor now is that there was an attachment to the bill that \ntried to eliminate all the gun laws of the District of Columbia. \nAbsurd. But we had to leave the bill on the table.\n  The Founders faced a unique situation when they created the District \nof Columbia as their Capital, but they tried an 18th century remedy \nthat the country has long outgrown. The Nation's Capital must not be \nunder the thumb of the national government, with citizens left without \ntheir equal rights.\n\n  We must erase the slander that the Framers of our country who went to \nwar on the slogan of ``No Taxation Without Representation;'' that they \nwould want to leave any Americans who paid taxes without equal \nrepresentation in the United States, and especially on this floor and \nin the Senate.\n  We will bring our statehood bill to the floor as soon as it is \nallowed. On this Veterans Day, I ask that we bring our D.C. statehood \nbill to the floor. Do it for District residents. But on this Veterans \nDay, I ask that you do it for the 30,000 veterans who have served you, \nwho have served their country, and who deserve equal rights in each and \nevery respect.\n", "turn": 1, "speaker": "Ms. NORTON", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "182", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H8601", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "8", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "STATEHOOD FOR WASHINGTON, D.C.", "id": "CREC-2017-11-08-pt1-PgH8601-2", "title": "STATEHOOD FOR WASHINGTON, D.C."}
