Mr. Speaker, I rise today to \ncongratulate Michael Firestine as he receives the prestigious Bruning \nAward from the American Bankers Association Center for Agricultural and \nRural Banking.\n  Mike Firestine's leadership and outstanding dedication to providing \ncredit and financial guidance to farmers, ranchers, and rural \nbusinesses is well known in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. He has \nbeen an agricultural banker with the same bank for more than 35 years.\n  Mike began his ag banking career in 1978, with the Lebanon National \nValley Bank, which later merged with Fulton Bank, where Mr. Firestine \nis currently a senior vice president.\n  Over the course of his career, Mike has helped scores of young \nfarmers establish themselves in the industry. His counsel and advice \npropelled many to success.\n  In many ways, Mike has stayed true to his roots.
