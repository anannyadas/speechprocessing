Mr. Speaker, I had planned to come down to the floor \nhere to manage some bills here in a couple of minutes, but I decided I \nneeded to take this opportunity to address some of the things that the \nAmerican people might have been hearing from the other side of the \naisle just now.\n  This is absolutely just political demagoguery what is going on. \nFrankly, it is political malfeasance. This is about simplification. \nThis is about fairness. This is about making sure that hardworking \nAmerican men and women and their families have the opportunity to live \nthe American Dream.\n  Right now, we have a Tax Code that is massive, first of all. Second, \nit is filled with loopholes and exceptions that lobbyists and the well \nconnected have put in there over the last number of decades. It is time \nto change that. The American people deserve this.\n  There is real tax relief for real working families, and that is why I \nthink you are seeing such enthusiasm out of the American people for \nthis tax plan.\n\n\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. HUIZENGA", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "182", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H8608-H8609", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "8", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "TAX PLAN PROVIDES TAX RELIEF", "id": "CREC-2017-11-08-pt1-PgH8608-5", "title": "TAX PLAN PROVIDES TAX RELIEF"}
