Mr. Speaker, I rise today to acknowledge and celebrate \nthe 50th anniversary of the India Association of Indianapolis (IAI). \nThe IAI is a non-profit organization that unites Indian-Americans \nlocated in the central Indiana area. It has become a vital cultural \nbridge between Indian-Hoosiers and the community.\n  The IAI was founded in 1968 by fifteen families living in the \nIndianapolis area. Today, the IAI has a membership that exceeds 2,000 \nfamilies and continues to climb. There are over 30,000 Indian-Americans \nliving in the Indiana. The IAI has been a valuable voice for all \nIndian-Hoosiers and has increased understanding of India, Indian \npeople, and Indian culture in central Indiana.\n  The mission of the IAI is to promote the cultural activities of \nIndia, to foster cultural exchange between people of India and the USA, \nand to carry out educational and charitable activities. Over the course \nof the last 50 years, the IAI has performed its mission admirably and \nhas enriched the community immeasurably. It has played a crucial role \nto protecting, preserving, and promoting Indian traditions and has \nshowcased the beauty of India to the Indianapolis community.\n  Whether it's the annual Diwali celebration, the Holi Festival, the \nyearly marking of India's independence, or a cricket game meant to \nfoster friendship between the Indian and Pakistani-American community, \nthe IAI has been a constant force of goodwill in Central Indiana. The \nIAI has grown exponentially since it was founded and is destined to do \nbigger and better things in the future. Indiana is lucky to have such \nan organization in its midst and I acknowledge the IAI, its leadership, \nand all its members.\n  Mr. Speaker, on the occasion of its 50th anniversary, I would like to \nsalute the India Association of Indianapolis.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. ROKITA", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 3}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "182", "extension": true, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "E1536", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "8", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "TRIBUTE TO DIWALI", "id": "CREC-2017-11-08-pt1-PgE1536-4", "title": "TRIBUTE TO DIWALI"}
