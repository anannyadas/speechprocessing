Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a remarkable \nstudent in my district with a heart for helping veterans, our military, \nand their families. Morgan Scarbro is a 14-year-old from Eaton Rapids \nwho created a nonprofit called Morgan's HUGS.\n  Since the age of five, Morgan has been giving back to veterans. If \nthere is a veteran in need, Morgan springs into action. She organizes \ndonation drives and collects items like hygiene products, food, \nclothing, and more. When Morgan competes in beauty pageants, she \nencourages her fellow contestants to donate as well.\n  Morgan helps in so many other ways, too, including visiting veterans \nin nursing homes and putting her own Christmas on hold to give presents \nto military families.\n  Morgan's dad is a disabled veteran, and she has seen, firsthand, the \nsacrifices made by the men and women who serve our country. We owe them \nan immeasurable debt.\n  As Veterans Day approaches, may we follow Morgan's example and do \neverything we can to take care of our Nation's heroes.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. WALBERG", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "182", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H8606", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "8", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "HONORING MORGAN SCARBRO FOR HER WORK WITH VETERANS AND MILITARY FAMILIES", "id": "CREC-2017-11-08-pt1-PgH8606-2", "title": "HONORING MORGAN SCARBRO FOR HER WORK WITH VETERANS AND MILITARY  FAMILIES"}
