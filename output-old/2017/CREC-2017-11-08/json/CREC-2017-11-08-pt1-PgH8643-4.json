Mr. Speaker, this Saturday is Veterans Day, a day to \nreflect on the bravery and the commitment of our servicemembers and to\n\n\nthank them for their dedication to our Nation.\n  From the Greatest Generation who served in World War II to the \nveterans who traversed the harsh jungles of Vietnam, to the young \npeople who took up the banner and persisted in the fight against \nterrorism in Afghanistan and in Iraq, we owe our veterans an endless \ndebt of gratitude.\n  It is our responsibility to provide for our servicemembers when they \nheed the call to serve, as well as to care for them when they return \nhome.\n  Mr. Speaker, we must fulfill our promises to our veterans and deliver \non the promises, the benefits that they have earned. We need to make \nsure that we end veterans' homelessness. Whether it be ensuring timely \naccess to quality healthcare, enabling the pursuit of educational \nopportunities, or providing the tools to start their own business, let \nus reaffirm to our veterans that they will have the support and the \nservices that they need following their service.\n  To all our veterans, thank you for your service. May God bless you, \nand may God continue to bless the United States of America.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. LANGEVIN", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "182", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H8643-H8644", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "8", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "VETERANS DAY", "id": "CREC-2017-11-08-pt1-PgH8643-4", "title": "VETERANS DAY"}
