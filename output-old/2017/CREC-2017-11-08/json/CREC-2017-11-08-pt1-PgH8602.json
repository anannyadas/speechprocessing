Mr. Speaker, I rise today, marking the 48th day since \nHurricane Maria made direct landfall on the island of Puerto Rico.\n  Wreaking havoc for over 3.4 million American citizens living on the \nisland, this administration's response has been beyond atrocious. I \nwitnessed it myself a couple of weeks ago, and so did a group of 50 \nregistered nurses from across the country who volunteered for a two-\nweek disaster relief fund and mission.\n  What these courageous women described upon returning was not at all \nreassuring. The lack of efficient action has led to deadly conditions \nand consequences: lack of food, water, medicine, proper healthcare \nservices, houses with roofs blown off or infested with black mold, and \nleptospirosis outbreaks across the island.\n  Laura Maceri, a registered nurse, said: ``It's hell there. The people \nhave nothing, yet they are the first to offer you the shirt off their \nback.''\n  Another nurse, Hau Yau, expressed: ``We couldn't believe this is part \nof the United States. We did home visits in low-income communities with \nthe public health liaisons there who identified those in need, and \nhelped them do basic blood pressure checks, blood sugar checks, to \nrefill their medicine, et cetera. They have already had chronic \ndiseases going on, and now their environment is full of hazardous \nmaterials, and the sanitation is very, very poor.''\n\n  From another nurse, Erin Carrera: ``Spent the day in Rio Grande, a \nhard-hit area right outside of San Juan. No power or water here since \nMaria. We set up a clinic at the FEMA site for the first time here. \nPeople lined up blocks since 10 p.m. last night. But FEMA was only \nhanding out papers--papers, which need to be filled out in order that \nthey may receive some reimbursement eventually. Each person received a \nsmall bottle of water, a mini bag of Cheez-It and a little pack of \nvanilla cookies. Outrageous. We were able to provide care to some, not \nnearly enough, but one small contribution to this tragedy today.''\n  Another nurse said: ``Today we went to a town called Barranquitas. \nThey had almost no water or food there. They were desperate. They are \nrelying on rainwater. One million chickens died during the storm and \nare now decomposed and causing people to get sick. Overwhelming is the \nonly thing I can say to describe it.''\n  Mr. Speaker, I stand with these nurses in their demands to address \nthe humanitarian crisis on the island of Puerto Rico. This \nadministration must respond immediately.\n  We need to waive FEMA's cost-sharing requirements in Puerto Rico. \nYesterday, Representative Gutierrez and I introduced the WEPA \nlegislation--the Waiver of Emergency Payments Act--that chooses and \naims to do exactly that.\n", "turn": 1, "speaker": "Mr. ESPAILLAT", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "182", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H8602", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "8", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "ADDRESSING THE HUMANITARIAN CRISIS IN PUERTO RICO", "id": "CREC-2017-11-08-pt1-PgH8602", "title": "ADDRESSING THE HUMANITARIAN CRISIS IN PUERTO RICO"}
