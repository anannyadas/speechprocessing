Mr. President, healthcare is on the minds of the \nAmerican people. According to the Washington Post, in the elections in \nVirginia yesterday, it was by far the biggest issue in voters' minds. \nMaine expanded Medicaid.\n  In my home State of Tennessee, because of the Affordable Care Act's \nstructure, premiums have gone up 176 percent over the last 4 years and \nanother 58 percent, on average, for 2018 is predicted.\n  Tennesseans, like millions of Americans, are going through open \nenrollment and have sticker shock when they see the prices of the \nhealth insurance they might buy, and the 178 million people who are \ngetting their insurance on the job--that is 60 percent of us--know they \nmight lose their job, they might change their job, and they might be in \nthe individual market themselves and might find themselves exposed to \nthese skyrocketing premiums and the chaos that results from them.\n  This is especially difficult for Americans who have no government \nsubsidy to help them buy insurance. In 2016, according to the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services, there were about 9 million of \nthose Americans.\n  There are 350,000 people in Tennessee who buy insurance on the \nindividual market. That means they don't get it on the job. They don't \nget it from the government. They go out and buy it themselves, and \n150,000 of those pay the whole brunt. So if insurance costs go up 176 \npercent over 4 years, another 58 percent this year, that means the \nsongwriter, the farmer, the self-employed person has a very difficult \ntime buying insurance. It is a terrifying prospect. That is why \nhealthcare is on the minds of the American people.\n  One would think the American people might turn around and look at \nWashington and ask: Why doesn't the President of the United States and \nwhy don't Members of Congress--Republicans as well as Democrats--get \ntogether and do something about the skyrocketing premiums?\n  Well, what would you think if I told you that last month the \nPresident of the United States, President Trump, called me and asked me \nto do just that?\n  He said: I don't want people to be hurt over the next couple of years \nwhile we are continuing to debate the long-term structure of healthcare \non the individual market. So why don't you get with Senator Murray from \nWashington--she is the ranking Democrat on the Senate HELP Committee--\nand why don't you try to work something out so people will not be hurt \nduring these 2 years.\n  He said: I have to cut off the cost-sharing payments because the \ncourt has said they are not legal, but we can put them back. Go \nnegotiate. See what you can do. Try to get some flexibility for the \nStates.\n  Fortunately, Senator Murray and I were already working on that and to \nhave the President's call was encouraging to me. He called me three \nmore times over the next 2 weeks, and the long and short of it is we \nproduced a result.\n  Here is what the result looks like--and I am going to talk about it \nfrom the point of view of why Republicans are supporting it. Senator \nMurray and Democratic Senators were here earlier saying why they were \nsupporting it. Senator Rounds from South Dakota, a former Governor of \nthat State, a man who understands insurance very well and helped \ndevelop this proposal--we are here today to say this happens to be one \nof those bills where there are\n\n\ngood reasons for Democrats to support it, there are good reasons for \nRepublicans to support it, and the President has asked for it.\n  Here is what it does, from my point of view. The so-called Alexander-\nMurray legislation, which was recommended to the Senate by Senator \nMurray and me--there were 12 Republicans and 12 Democrats who were \noriginal cosponsors, including Senator Rounds and myself. That doesn't \nhappen very often here. That is one-quarter of the Senate offering a \nbipartisan bill on a contentious subject to the Senate.\n  Here is what it does. One, it lowers premiums. In 2018, where the \nrates are already set, it requires the States to work with the \ninsurance companies and give rebates for the high premiums that have \nalready been set. In 2019, it will lower premiums. That is the first \nthing it does and the first reason why I and many Republicans support \nit.\n  Because the premiums are lower, it also means fewer tax dollars are \ngoing to pay for ObamaCare subsidies. That is another reason \nRepublicans and conservatives like the idea of the Alexander-Murray \nbill.\n  Another reason we like it is, because there are lower subsidies, \nthere is less Federal debt. The Congressional Budget Office has \nexamined our bill and has said that it saves money over 10 years, \nnearly $4 billion.\n  There are other reasons we like it. It gives States flexibility in \nincreasing the variety and choices of the insurance policies they can \nrecommend. That is the biggest difference of opinion we have between \nthat side of the aisle and this side of the aisle. They want Washington \nto write the rules; we want the States to write the rules.\n  We agreed to make some changes so that States can write more rules. \nFor example, the Iowa Senators, Mr. Grassley and Mrs. Ernst, are \ncosponsors of the bill because the language in the Alexander-Murray \namendment would permit the Federal Government to approve the Iowa \nwaiver. Iowa has a way that it wants to use the Federal dollars to \nenroll more people and to give them lower costs. It would allow New \nHampshire to use Medicaid savings to help pay for its Obama waiver. \nBoth the Democratic Senators and the Republican Governor of New \nHampshire have asked for that. It allows Minnesota to use a stream of \nFederal funding so that it can have its own waiver. It would allow \nOklahoma, which has been waiting, to get its waiver approved.\n  What do we mean by ``waivers''? What this means is that States can \nlook at the people in their State and make their own decisions or more \nof their own decisions about a variety of choices. Alaska did that \nearlier. They are the only State that has been able to use the section \n1332 innovation waiver, as we call it, and they were able to create a \nspecial fund for very sick people and then to lower rates for everyone \nelse by 20 percent and to do 85 percent of that with Federal dollars--\nno new Federal dollars, 15 percent by the States.\n  The reasons Republicans like the Alexander-Murray bill, the reasons \nwe have 12 of us on this side of the aisle cosponsoring it, along with \n12 Democrats, are lower premiums, fewer tax dollars for ObamaCare \nsubsidies, less Federal debt, more flexibility for States, a new so-\ncalled catastrophic insurance policy so you can buy a policy with a \nlower premium and a higher deductible so that a medical catastrophe \ndoesn't turn into a financial catastrophe. Those are all reasons to \nsupport it.\n  Here is the long and short of it. The American people have healthcare \non their minds. It is certainly true in Tennessee, where the rates are \nup 58 percent. It was certainly true in Virginia yesterday. It is \ncertainly true in Maine. I see the Senator from Maine is here, and he \nhas been an important part of this discussion.\n  The people of America say: Why don't the President, the Republicans, \nand the Democrats in both bodies get together and do something about \nit? I am happy to report we have. We have a bipartisan proposal. It \ndoesn't solve every problem, but it limits the damage. It lowers \npremiums. It avoids chaos. It saves Federal tax dollars. It has the \nsupport of a significant number of Republicans and Democrats, and it is \ndone at the request of the President.\n  I hope that when the President returns from Asia, he will go to his \ndesk and find a nice package there with a bow on it, presented by \nSenator Murray and me, 24 of us in the U.S. Senate--Republicans and \nDemocrats--which does exactly what the American people, I think, want \nus to do: Lower premiums, avoid chaos, work together, take a step in \nthe right direction, and let's see if we can help the American people \nin that way.\n  I know the Senator from South Dakota is here, and I thank him for his \nleadership on this. He, along with the Senator from Maine who is here, \nMr. King, spent a good deal of time working on this piece of \nlegislation, which has a lot that Democrats like and a lot that \nRepublicans like--so much so that we are able to recommend it in a \nbipartisan way. I know he may have things that he may want to say about \nthe bill.\n  I yield the floor.", "turn": 1, "speaker": "Mr. ALEXANDER", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I don't wish to take much of the Senate's \ntime, but I want to emphasize and echo the comments made by the Senator \nfrom Tennessee. He and his ranking member, Patty Murray of Washington, \nhave done a magnificent job. What I want to emphasize is not \nnecessarily the content of the bill, which he has outlined expertly, \nbut the process by which this bill has come to the U.S. Senate. To me, \nit is an example of how this place can and should work.\n  There were a series of essentially four all-day hearings. There were \nworkshops to which all Senators were invited, and I think at least half \nof the Senate attended several of those workshops. We had a bipartisan \nwitness list. We had Governors. We had insurance commissioners. We had \nexperts on the health services industry from around the country. The \nresult was a piece of negotiated, compromised but thoroughly worked \nthrough, and important legislation that can do exactly what the Senator \nfrom Tennessee outlined: Lower premiums, end the chaos in the \nindividual market, save the Federal Government money over the period of \nthe next 10 or 20 years, and really make a difference for the people of \nMaine.\n  I particularly want to compliment and express my appreciation to \nSenator Alexander and Senator Rounds for the work they have done to \nbring the issue to this point. I deeply hope, as the Senator from \nTennessee, Mr. Alexander, just said, that when the President returns \nfrom his trip, he will see this bipartisan agreement--or in my case, a \nnonpartisan agreement--that has come forward to solve some serious \nproblems. It doesn't solve all the problems, but it is a step forward. \nIt also is exactly what the American people want us to do--to talk to \neach other, listen to each other, gather the data and the information, \nand come up with legislative proposals that make common sense and will \nmake a better place, a better healthcare system, and serve our citizens \nand our people across the country in a better way than the current \narrangement.\n  Again, I want to compliment my colleague from Tennessee and also my \ncolleague from South Dakota, Senator Rounds, for the work they have \ndone on this. We are at a place where we can really do something good, \nnot only substantively but also by showing the Nation how this body can \nand should work.\n  I yield the floor.", "turn": 4, "speaker": "Mr. KING", "itemno": 5}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.", "turn": 5, "speaker": "The PRESIDING OFFICER", "itemno": 6}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "R000605", "text": "  Mr. ROUNDS. Mr. President, let me begin by acknowledging the \nleadership that Chairman Alexander and Ranking Member Murray have \noffered and also by saying how much I have appreciated the hard work \nthat Senator King from Maine has participated in, as well, in this \nprocess. They have worked together, side by side, to try to find some \ncommon ground while still retaining and protecting the principles they \nall hold with regard to how health insurance, long term, should be \napproached.\n  Coming to a bipartisan agreement on this very important piece of \nlegislation\n\n\nis only the first step. As you know, a deal was announced last month to \ngive States permanent flexibility to avoid some of ObamaCare's most \ncrushing mandates, while also temporarily authorizing the cost sharing \nreduction, or CSR, payments for 2 years. That is what the piece of \nlegislation we are referring to in this particular case, the Alexander-\nMurray legislation, would do.\n  This agreement is a win for conservatives who have spent the past 7 \nyears promising to relieve the American people of ObamaCare's \nskyrocketing premiums, limited choices, and Federal chokehold. For the \nfirst time since ObamaCare was forced onto the American public, the \nAlexander-Murray legislation is an opportunity to provide permanent, \nmeaningful opportunities for States to opt out of some of ObamaCare's \nmost egregious mandates under the 1332 waiver program, while making \nhealthcare more affordable for their constituents.\n  As a former Governor, like my colleagues Mr. Alexander and Mr. King, \nI understand that the best decisions are made at the State and local \nlevels, not by Federal bureaucrats. Empowering States with new \nopportunities to innovate and strengthen their individual health \ninsurance markets in a way that meets their citizens' unique needs is a \nfirst step toward repealing ObamaCare and allowing the marketplace to \nonce again be competitive and innovative.\n  In exchange for the permanent 1332 waiver changes, we have agreed to \ntemporarily authorize the administration to make CSR payments for 2 \nyears, similar to the provisions of the Better Care Reconciliation Act, \nwhich 49 Republican Members of the U.S. Senate supported earlier this \nyear.\n  Recall that President Trump announced recently that he would stop the \nCSR payments after a Federal court found them to be illegal because \nthey had not been appropriated by Congress. Not surprisingly, the \nprevious administration had continued making these payments, a practice \nthat President Trump rightfully and correctly stopped after months of \nwarning that he would do so. We applaud the President for returning \nthis appropriations decision to its constitutional place--with \nCongress.\n  We also recognize that there are millions of Americans who will face \nsteep premium increases come January as a result of this challenging \ndecision. This is in addition to the already skyrocketing premium \nincreases that Americans are facing because of ObamaCare, because of \nthe concept on which it was built. The American people did not ask for \nObamaCare, and they shouldn't be unfairly punished.\n  By extending these payments for only 2 years, our legislation will \nstabilize the market and help provide a smooth transition as we \ncontinue to work on a full repeal and replacement. Providing a smooth \ntransition away from ObamaCare has been included in every serious \nRepublican healthcare plan to date. We have to have a transition in \norder to move away from the existing healthcare plans. In fact, I \ncannot think of a single GOP colleague who doesn't support a smooth \ntransition so that we don't hurt families as we move away from our \ncurrent, unworkable system.\n  It is also important to point out that Alexander-Murray is merely a \nstep one in the total repeal and replacement of ObamaCare. Because of \nHouse and Senate rules, the 1332 waiver changes outlined in our bill \nare not eligible to be included in budget reconciliation legislation, \nwhich is the vehicle being used to repeal and replace ObamaCare by \ncongressional Republicans and which we continue to work on. We need \nboth bills. This is a two-step process.\n  We fully expect there to be an opportunity for us to finish the full \nrepeal and replace of ObamaCare next year and are united in our desire \nto get it across the finish line. But 1332 waiver changes found in this \nbill require bipartisan support in the Senate, period. It requires 60 \nvotes. That is not available to us or is not part of the remaining part \nof the challenge of the total repeal and replacement. We need both \nbills in order to get this done.\n  We have also included additional assurances within this bill to make \ncertain our bill does not bail out insurance companies, as Senator \nAlexander stated earlier. CBO, or the Congressional Budget Office, \nconfirmed this in the October report, noting that it benefits taxpayers \nand low-income policyholders, not insurance companies.\n  I also want to point out that there is also a fiscal case to be made \nfor continuing the CSR payments in the short term. The nonpartisan \nCongressional Budget Office--once again, the CBO--found that the \nFederal Government will be on the hook to subsidize care of the \nindividuals who otherwise would receive premium assistance via the CSR \npayments.\n  The CSR payments have ended. Insurers who stay in the individual \nmarketplace will be forced to raise their prices to compensate. Instead \nof costing $7 billion, as it did this year under the use of CSRs, the \nCBO estimates that the disruption caused by abruptly ending the CSRs \nwill cost the Federal Government an average of $25 billion annually, \nmore than four times the current rate.\n  The fact that ObamaCare is failing is not a partisan issue. Members \nof both parties have acknowledged that it is rapidly sinking. Our \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle believe it is fixable. \nRepublicans believe we have to go in a different direction. Democrats \nhave refused to admit the failure. They recognize it is sinking--they \nthink it is fixable--but, until now, have been unwilling to make any \nconcessions to the law they were solely responsible for creating.\n\n  We must seize the opportunity to provide States with much needed \nrelief from ObamaCare and show that States are far better at coming up \nwith health insurance rules which are tailored to their individual \nneeds. The only tradeoff is in fulfilling our promise to stabilize the \nindividual market temporarily while we continue our work to repeal \nObamaCare and replace it with a truly competitive market-based system. \nIn the meantime, States will already be given that option under our \nplan.\n  Let me just share this. Sometimes when you look at a bipartisan piece \nof legislation, our colleagues on the other side of the aisle will \npoint to the fact that they want to stabilize the market now. \nRepublicans will point to the fact that we need to stabilize the market \nand provide the opportunity for the full repeal and replacement to \nbecome effective. ObamaCare started in 2009. It was passed in 2009. Yet \nit took until 2014 for all of the impacts to actually begin to \naccumulate--5 years. To undo it, it will take time for the States to \ncreate their fixes.\n  We have to pass the legislation, and the HHS has to create the rules. \nThen, at the local level, at the State level, the State legislatures \nhave to create the laws once again that were torn apart by ObamaCare in \nthe first place. Then their divisions of insurance and their \ndepartments of health have to actually create the rules. The insurance \ncompanies that are out there that want to compete once again have to be \nable to contract with doctors and hospitals. They have to go on out and \nnot only write the contracts that will comply with the law and the \nregulations, but then they also have to go on out and market that \nproduct to individuals.\n  The exchange from one contract under ObamaCare to a contract with a \ncompetitor, which is when insurance carriers can actually offer \ndifferent types of products to group plans or to individuals, will take \ntime. That transition can hardly be done in less than 2 years, thus the \nneed and the offer in all of the Republican proposals to take this 2-\nyear time period and actually help the American people get through this \nvery difficult time without hurting them more than the pain they will \nhave already felt with the continuation of ObamaCare. It simply takes 2 \nyears to make any reasonable transition happen.\n  Once again, I would like to acknowledge the hard work of the Senator \nfrom Tennessee, Mr. Alexander, and the way in which he has created a \nteam effect, a team plan, on getting this through. I also acknowledge \nthe hard work of Senator Murray and her working side by side with \nSenator Alexander in trying to find common ground so her colleagues see \nthe importance, from their perspectives, while, at the same time, those \nof us on this side of the aisle reflect on the first step in a long-\nterm goal of the repeal and replacement of ObamaCare.\n  For the first time, we have a chance. For the first time, we have an \nopportunity to take a step statutorily, with\n\n\na 60-count vote, in actually making changes to the substance of \nObamaCare. It is high time. It is time to get started. It is time to \nmove forward.\n  I thank all of our colleagues for working side by side in at least \nslowing down the damage which has been occurring and which will \ncontinue to occur until we get the full replacement of ObamaCare behind \nus.\n  I yield the floor.", "turn": 6, "speaker": "Mr. ROUNDS", "itemno": 7}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, while Senators Alexander and Rounds are on \nthe floor--Senator King has just left--I find it ironic that the four \nof us who are gathered here are former Governors and are interested in \ngetting things done and are interested in working across the aisle. We \nwant to be able to achieve better results for less money. I applaud \nSenators Alexander and Murray for their efforts in trying to ensure \nthat we begin to do that.\n  I think my friend from South Dakota gives much credit to President \nObama in his attacking what was originally bipartisan legislation that \nhad been introduced here in 1993 by Senator Orrin Hatch, with 22 \nRepublican cosponsors, and that later became RomneyCare.\n  The idea behind their proposal was that there ought to be exchanges \nin every State and that the people could join if they did not have \nhealthcare coverage; No. 2, that there would be a sliding scale tax \ncredit to help buy down the cost of coverage for people who got their \ncare in the exchanges; No. 3, that there would be an individual mandate \nthat said you don't have to get coverage but that, if you don't, you \nhave to pay a fine; No. 4, that there would be an employer mandate that \nsaid employers of a certain size would have to cover their people; No. \n5, that insurance companies could not refuse to cover people with \npreexisting conditions.\n  Barack Obama had nothing to do with that. We continue to hear folks \nderide the idea of the exchanges and the five points I just mentioned \nas ObamaCare. He had nothing to do with it. When we marked up the \nAffordable Care Act, we took, really, those ideas from the 1993 \nlegislation here, with 23 Republican cosponsors--RomneyCare--and \nproposed and implemented it, I think, in 2006. It worked. When we were \nmarking up the Affordable Care Act, we were actually looking for \nsomething that worked in order to give coverage to people in a cost-\neffective way.\n  In 1993, the Republicans used, I think, what was originally a \nHeritage idea--Romney in 2006. They had a good idea, and it used market \nforces. What we have never done since the Affordable Care Act went into \nplace is actually enable a good Republican idea to work. I think what \nSenator Alexander has put together with Senator Murray can help move us \ncloser to that step.\n  Some other things that I think we ought to do include a reinsurance \nplan along the lines that Senator Kaine and I have introduced, and \nthat, I think, has a fair amount of support in a lot of corners. If we \nare not going to have an individual mandate--and I think we ought to, \nbut if we are going to take it away--the other thing is to make sure \nthat we put in its place the exchanges having young, healthy people so \nyou have a group of folks in each State in the exchanges who are \ninsurable without the insurance companies losing their shirts.\n  I think one of the great things about what Senator Alexander and \nSenator Murray are trying to do here is to take the small step of \nensuring that the cost-sharing reductions really help lower income \npeople with their copays and help them with their deductible costs. If \nwe can do that, along with the 1332 waiver, which I support, this can \nbe a confidence builder. Maybe we can do some other things like the \nreinsurance ideas we have and others have. If there is a better idea \nthan the individual mandate, by golly, let's do that, but we need \nhealthy, young people in the exchanges.\n  My hope is, we can find common ground and make it on a little broader \nrange of ideas to bring us good healthcare coverage at an affordable \nprice and then turn--kind of pivot--to the Affordable Care Act itself. \nAs for the stuff in the Affordable Care Act that ought to be changed or \ndropped, let's do that. As for the portions of it that ought to be \npreserved, let's do that as well.\n  Again, I commend my friends for coming up with this very good step. \nMy hope is that we can get a vote for it.\n  I met with a lot of insurance company folks earlier today. We do not \nagree on everything, but one of the things I heard from them is, if we \nwere to do what Senator Alexander and Senator Murray have called for \nwith respect to cost-sharing reductions and if we were to do some kind \nof reinsurance plan along the lines of what Tim Kaine and I have \nsuggested--but not necessarily that--and if we were to do something to \nmake it clear that the individual mandate or some other mechanism were \ngoing to be in place and stay in place so we could get young people \ninto the exchanges, if we were to do those three things, they told us, \nwe could bring down premiums anywhere from 30 to 35 percent in the \nexchanges.\n  Who benefits the most? As it turns out, it is not just the people who \nare getting their coverage in the exchanges. Who else benefits the most \nis Uncle Sam because, if we reduce premiums by 30 to 35 percent, Uncle \nSam, which pays all of these tax credits to help buy down the cost of \ncoverage in the exchanges, reaps a big benefit as well, and that helps \nto bring down the size of the deficit, which is good.\n  I was just inspired by your words, of both of you, and wanted to say \nthat and to applaud your efforts. It is a pleasure and an honor to work \nwith you, and I look forward to doing more of that.\n  Thank you.", "turn": 10, "speaker": "Mr. CARPER", "itemno": 11}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I want to briefly thank the Senator \nfrom Delaware.\n  As the Senator from South Dakota said, this has been a very \ncontentious issue, but we thought that if we listened enough, we might \nfind a few things we could agree on. Senator Murray and I not only \ninvolved our committee, which is a committee of 22 or 23 Senators, but \nwe invited anyone not on the committee to come and meet with the \nwitnesses--the Governors and the State insurance commissioners--for an \nhour before the hearings.

For the next couple of years, we have \na plan that will avoid chaos and begin to limit the growth of premiums \nand, in 2019, reduce premiums.

He served as chief counsel \nto Jeff Holmstead, then the Acting Assistant Administrator for Air and \nRadiation, from 2001 through 2005. While serving at the EPA during this \ntime, Mr. Wehrum had a concerning track record of suppressing \nscientific information and the work of the EPA's career staff, \ndeferring to industry on issues of public health, and not responding to \nmy colleagues and to me when we were then serving on the Environment \nand Public Works Committee.\n  President Bush eventually nominated Mr. Wehrum to fill Jeff \nHolmstead's seat and to serve in an acting capacity as Assistant \nAdministrator for Air and Radiation at the EPA, something Mr. Wehrum \nwould not be able to lawfully do today.\n  Behind me, to my left, is an excerpt from an editorial from April \n2006. The New York Times published an editorial opposing Mr. Wehrum's \nnomination that mirrored my concerns at the time:\n\n       [The Holmstead era at EPA] will be remembered chiefly for \n     its efforts to weaken the Clean Air Act (particularly with \n     respect to rules governing mercury emissions and older power \n     plants), to manipulate science and to elevate corporate \n     interests above those of the public. Mr. Wehrum, who served \n     as Mr. Holmstead's deputy and doctrinal hit man, could make \n     things worse.\n\n  That is a direct quote from this editorial. This is the New York \nTimes editorial from 2006 opposing Mr. Wehrum's nomination for the very \nsame position he seeks today.\n  During the Environment and Public Works Committee's consideration of \nMr. Wehrum's nomination in 2005, I voted against him because I feared \nhe would continue to fail to clean our air and protect public health. \nDespite the fact that Mr. Wehrum was not confirmed due to his inability \nto secure the 60 votes needed for cloture on his nomination, he was \nable to serve as Acting Assistant Administrator for EPA's air office \nfor 2 years.\n  Since leaving the EPA, Mr. Wehrum has returned to industry and served \nas an industry lawyer in litigation against the EPA.\n  Since returning to the private sector, Mr. Wehrum has reflected on \nhis time spent at EPA. In doing so, he didn't point to the good work he \ndid at the Agency to advance its public health mission or the lasting \nprotections he put in place that made a difference in the lives of \nordinary citizens; instead, he noted that his tenure at EPA was really \ngood for business, saying:\n\n       I'm a much better lawyer now than when I first joined the \n     agency. To really get to know how the agency works and how it \n     ticks, I think that is very valuable. I have expanded my \n     capabilities which will hopefully allow me to be effective in \n     generating business and clients.\n\n  In generating business and clients. Sadly, my fears of 2005 were \nwell-founded, and only one thing has changed--the Senate rule with \nrespect to the number of votes we need to consider and confirm a \nnominee. If Mr. Wehrum is confirmed this week, it will be because he is \nthe beneficiary of the Senate's elimination of the requirement with \nrespect to needing 60 votes to consider nominees. It will not be \nbecause he is better suited for this important job.\n  I will walk through some telling numbers for my colleagues this \nevening. The first number is 31. That is the number of times Mr. Wehrum \nhas represented industry against the EPA in Federal court since 2009.\n  Let me be clear on this. After serving in an unconfirmed capacity at \nthe EPA because he was too far outside the mainstream to be confirmed \nby this body, Mr. Wehrum then left the Agency and has spent the years \nsince suing that very same Agency and attempting to weaken \nenvironmental and public health protections on behalf of his industry \nclients. Many of these lawsuits are still ongoing and, in the majority \nof the pending lawsuits, Mr. Wehrum has represented the interests of \nBig Oil.\n  Look at another poster. The number 27. What does 27 refer to? It \nrefers to the number of times public health groups prevailed in court \nwhen challenging Bush-era clean air regulations that Mr. Wehrum helped \nto craft because they did not follow the law or sufficiently protect \npublic health. Failing to follow the Clean Air Act meant delays in \npublic health protections and uncertainty for businesses across \nAmerica.\n  I don't doubt that Mr. Wehrum is a fine lawyer--so why were so many \nof the rules he helped to write found to be unlawful? The confirmation \nprocess is essentially a job interview. It is not a job interview with \nEPA, in a sense, and it is not really a job interview with us, but it \nis a job interview with the American people. In this case, Mr. Wehrum \nis essentially applying for the job he already had at EPA, and you \nwould think that would be easy, but Mr. Wehrum's resume shows that a \ngreat deal of the work he did in his last job as Acting Assistant \nAdministrator for Air and Radiation was not up to par. In this job, \nsubpar work impacts millions of Americans, especially children and the \nmost vulnerable among us.\n  The next number is 10. Ten is the number of additional years that \nchildren were exposed to toxic air emissions from powerplants because \nof delays Mr. Wehrum helped put into place while at the EPA.\n  The next number is eight. The number eight refers to the number of \ndays before Mr. Wehrum's latest confirmation hearing when he was in a \ncourtroom arguing against rules that would protect 2.3 million miners, \nconstruction workers, and bricklayers. According to Mr. Wehrum, \n``People are designed to deal with dust. . . . People are in dusty \nenvironments all the time and it doesn't kill them.''\n  The next number is two, which is the number of times the DC Circuit \nCourt cited ``Alice In Wonderland'' in its decisions to reject EPA \nrules that Mr. Wehrum helped craft because, in the court's view, the \nregulations were based on fantasy rather than following ``the rule of \nlaw.''\n  The next number is one. One is the number of times that language from \na law firm that represented industry--and also happened to be Mr. \nWehrum's former employer--made it verbatim into a clean air regulation \nthat Mr. Wehrum stated he was ``extensively involved'' in preparing.\n  Think about that.\n  Zero. Zero is the number of times Mr. Wehrum advocated in court for \nstronger clean air regulations since leaving the EPA. It is an \nespecially troubling number for those of us living in downwind States \nlike Delaware. We live at the end of America's tailpipe, along with our \nneighbors in Maryland, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, New York, and folks \nall the way up to Maine. Zero is also the number of times Mr. Wehrum \nexpressed a desire to protect public health when I met with him prior \nto his confirmation hearing.\n  Mr. Wehrum sits before us again today nominated for the very same \nposition he was nominated for 12 years ago. After reviewing Mr. \nWehrum's record, talking to him in person, and listening and reading \nhis answers during the hearing process, my position has not changed \nsince 2005, primarily because his views do not appear to have changed.\n  Like other EPA nominees, Mr. Wehrum was evasive on many of the \nquestions asked of him, even convincingly forgetting a case that he \nworked on against the renewable fuel standard in National Chicken \nCouncil, et al v.\n\n\nEPA. However, what was clear in the answer that he did give, and in his \nconversation with me, is that public health simply is not Mr. Wehrum's \nmain concern.\n  In fact, when asked what Clean Air Act regulation he does support, he \nanswered as follows:\n\n       I represent clients in private practice. It is my legal \n     ethical duty to zealously represent their interests.\n\n  Well, in this job interview with the American people to be Assistant \nAdministrator for the Office of Air and Radiation, the American people \nare his clients, and the fact that he cannot--or has refused to name--a \nsingle regulation that helps to ensure that they and their families \nhave clean air to breathe is almost disqualifying in and of itself. \nWhether it is carbon, mercury, silica, or other toxic air pollution, \nMr. Wehrum continues to show that he sides with polluters over science \nand doctors every time.\n  Mr. Wehrum's extreme views will not be good for public health, and \nquite frankly the legal uncertainty that has resulted from his past \nwork will not be good for American businesses. Businesses need \ncertainty and predictability, and they don't get it with the kind of \nwork he has done.\n  Let me close by reminding our colleagues that next week we celebrate \nthe 27th anniversary of the signing of the Clean Air Act Amendments of \n1990. Twenty-seven years ago, we weren't debating how to weaken or \ndelay our clean air laws. Instead, we passed bipartisan legislation \nthat would improve and strengthen our clean air laws based on the very \nbest science. In the process, we strengthened our economy too. Back \nthen, 89 Senators, including some who still serve in this Chamber, \nvoted to approve the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990. As a Congressman \nover at the other body at that time, I voted along with them. A \nRepublican President, George Herbert Walker Bush, signed the bill into \nlaw 27 years ago today. It was commonsense legislation, it was \nbipartisan, and we are all better for it.\n  When the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 passed Congress, I was a \nCongressman in the House, and I voted in favor of that bill. I was \nproud of helping to pass that monumental law because I believed then, \nand I still believe today, that we can protect our environment and grow \nour economy at the same time--and we have the job numbers to prove it.\n  We have had some delays in implementation, but, by and large, the law \nhas been a huge success and has benefited just about every American. \nFor every dollar we spend in installing new pollution controls in \ncleaning up our air, we have seen $30 returned in reduced healthcare \ncosts, better workplace productivity, and saved lives. We have a return \nof $30 for every dollar we spend installing new pollution control.\n  The bottom line is, fewer people are getting sick and missing work \nbecause of the Clean Air Act and the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990.\n  When it comes to the rhetoric surrounding air regulations, there is a \nlot of fake news that people like to peddle, but as the saying goes: \nEveryone is entitled to his or her own opinions but not to his or her \nown facts.\n  Here are the facts. Our economy did not take a slide because of clean \nair protection. Quite the opposite is true. The Obama administration \nimplemented the Clean Air Act based on the best science to date. Now \nour air is cleaner. We have seen 8 years of economic growth.\n  I will say that again. We have seen 8 years of economic growth, the \nlongest stretch in our history. Energy prices at the pump and the meter \nare lower than when President Obama took office--lower, not higher. The \nbeauty of our clean air laws is that they are not static. Our clean air \nprotections keep up with the latest oversight science and the latest \ntechnology.\n  As we learn more about what makes us sick, about what is impacting \nour environment, and about what can be done to clean it up, the EPA has \nthe authority, under the Clean Air Act, to make adjustments to make it \nbetter, to ensure that it protects more people, not fewer. That has \nbeen the trajectory to date. As technology and science develop, so do \nour clean air regulations.\n  That is also the story of our country. Through innovative and \ncreative solutions, we strive for progress in order to have a better \nlife here at home and to lead the world in tackling the environmental \nchallenges of our time. Mr. Wehrum's policies have been tried and have \nbeen proven not only unsuccessful but even dangerous. We don't need to \ncontinue to move backward. We need to move forward.\n  Mr. President, I will leave you and our colleagues with this. I am \nsorry to say that Mr. Wehrum has worked deliberately to halt that \nprogress, to delay that progress and to roll back clean air laws that \nhave been protecting America and Americans for decades. Unlike many of \nthe nominees who have come before us this year, unfortunately, we don't \nhave to speculate about how Mr. Wehrum would do in this position. We \nhave already seen it. We have already seen it, and the results were not \ngood for the rest of us.\n  As his clients at this time, we deserve better representation. Today \nAmericans deserve leaders at EPA who will be impartial and will look \nout for the interests of all Americans, not just Big Oil and the kind \nof clients who can afford Mr. Wehrum's legal bills.\n  We have seen this movie before, and there is no need for a sequel. I \nregret having to say that, but I do believe Mr. Wehrum is not the right \nfit for this position today, any more than he was a dozen years ago.\n  I encourage my colleagues to vote no on his nomination to serve as \nEPA's Assistant Administrator for air.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.", "turn": 14, "speaker": "Mr. CARPER", "itemno": 15}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, this Saturday is Veterans Day, a day when \nwe honor the brave women and brave men who have served in the defense \nof this great Nation. We need to take a moment to reflect on the \nfreedoms that we enjoy every day--and sometimes take for granted--as \nAmerican citizens, and we need to take that moment to thank those who \nhave devoted their lives to serve and protect the greatest Nation in \nhuman history, the United States of America.\n  Mr. President, as you know, our country is home to over 20 million \nveterans, and I have the privilege of representing more than 250,000 \nveterans in my State of Louisiana. Today, I would like to talk about \ntwo of those veterans from my State who are illustrative of the \nextraordinary service that all of the veterans in Louisiana have \noffered their country.\n  The two gentlemen I would like to talk about, the two brave \nAmericans, are Ira Schilling and Earl Louis Messmer.\n  Ira Schilling is from Shreveport. He enlisted in the U.S. Marines \nCorps in October of 1941, at the age of 16. He was 16 years old. After \ncompleting his training, Ira was assigned as a rifleman to L Company, \n3rd Battalion, 6th Marines, 2nd Marine Division, and he took part in \ncombat operations on Guadalcanal during the final weeks of that bloody \ncampaign.\n  Ira was discharged from Active Duty in October 1945. In 1948, Mr. \nSchilling tried to reenlist in the U.S. Marines Corps. He was married \nat the time. The Marines Corps turned down his request. Undaunted, Mr. \nSchilling just went over and enlisted in the U.S. Navy, and he spent \nanother 2 years on Active Duty in defense of this country. Ira is now \n92 years young, and he lives in Haughton, LA, and he is a Civil Air \nPatrol wing chaplain.\n  Mr. Earl Louis Messmer was born in New Orleans, in the southern part \nof my State, in 1923. He is very proud--and we are all proud of him--\nfor serving in the Battle of Peleliu from September 15 to November 15, \n1944.\n  That battle was a fight to capture an airstrip in the Western Pacific \nOcean. The United States won. We prevailed due to the bravery of the \nArmy's 81st Infantry Division, of which Earl was a member.\n  Upon his return from World War II, in 1945, Mr. Messmer went to \nTulane University.\n  Earl has 2 daughters, 5 grandchildren, and 10 great grandchildren,\n\n\nall of whom are enjoying the freedom of this country for which he \nfought so gallantly.\n  Earl has resided in Metairie, LA, since 1942.\n  It is imperative, in my judgment, that this Veterans Day--and every \nday--we honor the service and sacrifices made by our women and our men \nin uniform. That is why I have introduced a bill. It is the 75th \nAnniversary of the End of World War II Commemorative Coin Act. I say to \nthe Presiding Officer, I hope you will vote for it. This bill would \nauthorize a commemorative coin to mark the milestone anniversary and \nthe historic sacrifices of what has been aptly termed ``the Greatest \nGeneration,'' and this bill will cost the American taxpayer zero \ndollars.\n  Thanks to the selflessness and bravery of 16 million American \nmilitary personnel--brave men and women, brave men like Ira and Earl, \nof whom I just spoke, many of whom have lost their lives in this global \nconflict in World War II--liberty and democracy ultimately prevailed \nagainst the rawest, ugliest form of tyranny. The least we can do, it \nseems to me, for those who fought for our freedom, is to ensure that \ninstitutions like the National World War II Museum in New Orleans are \nable to continue their mission to educate future generations about our \ncountry's role in World War II and to support the families of our \nveterans.\n  I would like to urge all of my colleagues to please join with me, as \nI know they will, in thanking the millions of veterans who have fought \nand served our country, and I hope we can all pray together for the \nsafety of our brave women and men in uniform who are still serving \ntoday.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum", "turn": 18, "speaker": "Mr. KENNEDY", "itemno": 20}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, as we all know, President Trump is now \nin China on an important trip, where his top priority is obtaining \nChina's cooperation in confronting North Korea's nuclear weapons \nprogram.\n  While we should continue to seek China's cooperation in applying \neconomic and other pressures on North Korea, we also need to send a \nvery clear and strong message to banks in China and throughout the \nworld that there will be a price to pay for lack of cooperation.\n  That is why I am pleased that yesterday, before President Trump \narrived in China, the Senate Banking Committee, on a unanimous basis, \npassed a bill to impose and enforce mandatory sanctions against banks \nand financial firms in China or anywhere else in the world that help to \nprop up the regime of Kim Jong Un. The bill is named the Otto Warmbier \nBanking Restrictions Involving North Korea Act, or the BRINK Act, for \nshort. I introduced this bill with Senator Toomey earlier this year, \nafter North Korea engaged in its threatening and provocative missile \nlaunches.\n  I want to thank Senator Toomey for his partnership in developing the \nBRINK Act. I want to thank Mr. Crapo, chairman of the Banking \nCommittee, and Ranking Member Brown for their leadership in addressing \nthe North Korean threat and working to pass this bill out of the \nBanking Committee with unanimous support. I want to thank all of the \nmembers of the Banking Committee for their bipartisan effort on this \nmatter.\n  I also want to thank the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, \nSenator Corker, and the Ranking Member, Senator Cardin, for their \nbipartisan leadership in confronting the threat of North Korea, and \nalso the leadership of the East Asia Subcommittee of the Senate Foreign \nRelations Committee, headed by Senators Gardner and Markey. They have \nbeen consistent in their efforts to address the North Korean threat and \nto seek a peaceful resolution of this crisis.\n  Back in August, I had the opportunity to visit South Korea, Japan, \nand China, as part of a bipartisan delegation that was led by Senator \nMarkey. We had the opportunity to travel not only to the DMZ zone \nbetween South and North Korea but also to visit the city of Dandong, \nwhich is a Chinese city on the border between China and North Korea, \nalong the Yalu River. That is where a lot of the cross-border trade and \ntransactions between North Korea and China take place.\n  The threat posed by North Korea to the United States and our allies \nis very real. The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General \nDunford, testified in September that North Korea has the capability to \nstrike the United States' mainland with an intercontinental ballistic \nmissile. North Korea has ramped up the pace of its ballistic missile \ntests, firing two ballistic missiles over Japan in recent months. In \nSeptember North Korea conducted its sixth test of a nuclear weapon--the \nlargest yet.\n  The question is this: How do we deal with this threat?\n  Way back when it came to foreign policy and national security issues, \nPresident Teddy Roosevelt counseled that we should ``speak softly and \ncarry a big stick.'' President Trump and all of us would be wise to \nheed that advice. Bluster and overheated rhetoric not only will not \nwork, but they raise the risk of miscalculation and war with North \nKorea.\n  It is much better to steadily and dramatically ratchet up the \npressure on North Korea to come to the negotiating table with the goal \nof denuclearizing the Korean Peninsula. That strategy has to include \nlots of elements, but an indispensable tool is putting much greater \npressure on Pyongyang.\n  Despite what many people think, North Korea is not sanctioned out. It \nis not as if we already applied and enforced maximum economic pressure \non North Korea. In fact, our existing sanctions regime against North \nKorea is much weaker than the sanctions regime we had in place against \nIran in the lead-up to the Iran nuclear deal. That is because the \nUnited States and others have not seriously gone after the foreign \nbanks and firms that support the North Korean leadership and its \ncronies.\n  The reality is that North Korea's economy is not as weak or isolated \nas many believe. Its annual GDP is estimated to be $40 billion, and \nChina accounts for almost 90 percent of North Korea's trade. The United \nNations has repeatedly found that North Korea evades the existing \ninternational sanctions effort and maintains access to the \ninternational financial system, primarily through a comprehensive \nnetwork of Chinese-based front companies. North Korea relies heavily on \nthis network to directly support its weapons of mass destruction and \nballistic missile programs.\n  We have no time to waste. We must sever Kim Jong Un's economic \nlifeline. That is why Senator Toomey and I have introduced the BRINK \nAct and why it received such strong support. The BRINK Act targets this \nillicit financial network by imposing mandatory sanctions on those \ndoing business with North Korea.\n  It sends a clear and unequivocal message to foreign banks and foreign \nfirms: You can do business with North Korea or you can do business with \nthe United States, but you cannot do business with both. That is the \nchoice we placed before other countries with respect to Iran, and it \nhelped to generate the pressure to bring Iran to the negotiating table.\n  If you trade with North Korea, you will not have any access to the \nU.S. markets. This, as I indicated, is the choice that we ultimately \ngave to Iran back in 2010, and the BRINK Act is modeled after the \nsanctions laws that we applied in the case of Iran that brought them \nultimately to the negotiating table. Our goal is to cut off North \nKorea's remaining access to the international financial system, deprive \nKim Jong Un of the resources needed for his regime's survival, and \ncreate the leverage necessary for serious negotiations.\n\n  Some critics of this approach argue that China may lash out at the \nUnited States or respond in kind. The gravity of the situation compels \nus to act regardless of Beijing's reaction in these circumstances. \nSimply asking China for its cooperation is not enough. It has to be \nbacked up by a clear message and law from the United States that there \nare severe penalties for those who do not cooperate and do not abide\n\n\nby the sanctions. That is what this bill is all about.\n  It is also important to note that when secondary sanctions on Iran \nwere put into place, the Chinese Government issued a tepid public \nprotest, and then privately directed its sanctioned banks to stop \nworking with Iran. In other words, after some quiet protest, they \ncomplied with that secondary sanctions regime on Iran.\n  Moreover, Beijing claimed just this September that it is directing \nits banks to freeze any North Korean accounts--a directive which, if \ntrue, is long overdue. But it will be hard for China to say that we \nshouldn't take this action if it is an action they already said they \ndirected their banks to take. This makes it clear that it will be in \nChina's economic interests to fully enforce the sanctions on North \nKorea.\n  I am clear-eyed about the challenges we face in bringing North Korea \nto the negotiating table. Previous Democratic and Republican \nadministrations have failed to end North Korea's nuclear and missile \nprograms, and because of this, some argue that Kim Jong Un will never \ngive up his nuclear program.\n  To those critics, my response is simply that we have not exhausted \nall of our options on North Korea. There is incredible leakage right \nnow in the sanctions regime, and that leakage is what the BRINK Act is \ndesigned to address and to close the loopholes and put teeth into the \nsanctions.\n  The choice between accepting a nuclear North Korea or launching some \nkind of preventive war is a false one. I strongly believe that this \naggressive secondary sanctions regime, as part of an overall coherent \nstrategy backed by our allies and the threat of force, is our best \nremaining chance of achieving a nuclear-free Korean Peninsula.\n  Right now, we face no more urgent task than achieving a peaceful \nresolution on the North Korean nuclear crisis. We need clear thinking. \nWe need courage. We need common sense on the choices before us. At \nstake is not just the security of those in the region but, ultimately, \nof the United States. It is incumbent on all of us to ensure that the \npursuit of peace prevails in this effort.\n  I ask my colleagues in the Senate to follow the lead of the Banking \nCommittee in giving this a unanimous bipartisan vote in the Senate so \nwe can get this to the House as soon as possible and have it signed \ninto law, so that when we ask other nations for cooperation, they know \nthat failing to cooperate with us is not an option, or if they do take \nthat course, they will face severe economic consequences.\n  So I hope the Senate will take this up without delay and that we can \npass it and get it to the President's desk.", "turn": 22, "speaker": "Mr. VAN HOLLEN", "itemno": 25}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Maryland for \nhis thoughtful words on North Korea.\n  I come to the floor today to urge my colleagues to oppose the \nnomination of William Wehrum to lead the Office of Air and Radiation at \nthe EPA.\n  If confirmed, Mr. Wehrum would be responsible for implementing \ncritical programs like the Renewable Fuel Standard Program and other \nkey public health standards under the Clean Air Act.\n  Mr. Wehrum is part of a larger trend within President Trump's \nadministration. Many of the nominees who are being sworn in are \nunqualified, incompetent, and have actually built their careers on \ndismantling the agencies they are now leading.\n  To be clear, Mr. Wehrum's nomination represents yet another broken \npromise by President Trump--this time, to our Nation's farmers. As a \ncandidate, Mr. Trump pledged to champion the RFS, a policy with broad \nbipartisan support that reduces our greenhouse gas emissions, helps us \nrevive rural economies, and makes our Nation less dependent on foreign \noil.\n  Yet the President continues to surround himself with advisers intent \non sabotaging the RFS, like Scott Pruitt, Carl Icahn, and, now, Mr. \nWehrum. Mr. Wehrum has proven, time and again, that he is not a friend \nof the Renewable Fuel Standard Program.\n  He sued the biofuels industries--not once, not twice, not three \ntimes, but at least four times--representing groups like the American \nPetroleum Institute which are strong opponents of the RFS. During his \nnomination hearings, Mr. Wehrum refused to commit to supporting the \nRFS, claiming he was ``unfamiliar'' with the program. He wouldn't even \nacknowledge the unprecedented attacks launched on the biofuel \nindustries by this administration.\n\n  If you support the RFS, as Illinois farmers and I do, it should be \nobvious that the right thing to do is to oppose Mr. Wehrum. This is not \nabout having blanket opposition to President Trump's nominees; this is \nabout our national security, our rural communities, and our \nenvironment.\n  I have already fought a war over oil, and I would rather run my car \non American-grown corn and soybeans than oil from the Middle East. Our \nfarmers deserve better than a President who makes campaign promises to \nprotect the RFS in Iowa but will not honor them when he gets to the \nWhite House.\n  I understand that Administrator Pruitt has written a letter to my \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle regarding a pending petition \nrequesting to move the ``point of obligation'' and a rulemaking on \nrenewable volumetric obligations. Both of these decisions, as \nAdministrator Pruitt's letter states, will be final in the coming days. \nThat is why I am calling on my colleagues to simply hold Mr. Wehrum's \nnomination until after EPA finalizes these decisions.\n  There is no rush to confirm Mr. Wehrum this week. Better yet, let's \noppose his nomination altogether.\n  I am also concerned that he will gut key public health protections \nthat we all rely on to protect our families and the air we breathe. One \nof the most serious responsibilities I have, as both a U.S. Senator and \na mother, is to protect children and families from harmful pollutants \nand to make sure the air they breathe is safe from toxic chemicals.\n  After reviewing Bill Wehrum's previous work in the Office of Air and \nRadiation, it is clear that he made dismantling the Clean Air Act--and \nall of the air pollution safeguards and public health protections \nguaranteed by it--one of his top priorities. In that office, he \nactively fought to roll back commonsense safeguards against lead, fine \nparticulate pollution, and ozone smog. But he didn't stop there. He \neven led efforts to weaken standards designed to reduce emissions of \nmercury--one of the most deadly, toxic pollutants in the world--from \ncoal-fired powerplants. Bill Wehrum wasn't looking out for us; he was \nlooking out for the fossil fuel industry.\n  When Mr. Wehrum was originally nominated for this position under the \nBush administration, the Senate had the good sense to reject his \nnomination. He was never confirmed, and I hope we do not confirm him \nnow.\n  Again, I urge all my colleagues to oppose Mr. Wehrum's nomination \nand, instead, support our farmers, our children, and our families.\n  Thank you.", "turn": 24, "speaker": "Ms. DUCKWORTH", "itemno": 27}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Like the Senator from Illinois, I rise to voice my opposition to the \nnomination of Bill Wehrum to serve as the Assistant Administrator for \nAir and Radiation at the Environmental Protection Agency.\n  The Office of Air and Radiation oversees matters that are critical to \nhuman and environmental health, specifically, air and radiation but \nalso climate change, air quality, and vehicle emissions.\n  If confirmed, Mr. Wehrum would be responsible for these immensely \nimportant issues, which require putting the health of our citizens \nabove industry interests. Given this, I don't know why the Senate would \nconfirm him for this position.\n  Mr. Wehrum has already served in this role in an acting capacity \nduring the Bush administration. His confirmation was blocked by the \nSenate in 2006. His prior tenure shows that he will not fulfill the \nmission of the EPA to protect human health and the environment. In \nfact, he has a record of putting corporate profits before the well-\nbeing of citizens.\n  During his tenure in the Bush administration, Mr. Wehrum rolled back \nclean air safeguards that protect public\n\n\nhealth on 27 occasions. His actions were challenged in court for not \nfulfilling the requirements of the Clean Air Act, and 27 times the \ncourt ruled against Mr. Wehrum.\n  One particular issue that he was involved in was mercury pollution. \nUnder the Clean Air Act, the EPA has to reduce hazardous air pollutants \nlike mercury, which is particularly harmful to children. Instead of \nprotecting this population from mercury pollution, a neurotoxin, Mr. \nWehrum decided to advance the interests of polluters.\n  During his tenure, Mr. Wehrum also led efforts to prevent EPA from \naddressing climate pollution. Fortunately, the Supreme Court eventually \nruled in favor of regulating greenhouse gases, forcing the Agency to \ntake action.\n  After the Senate blocked his nomination in 2006, Mr. Wehrum decided \nhe would undermine the mission of the Agency on behalf of polluters. In \nhis current role as a corporate attorney, he has sued the EPA multiple \ntimes on behalf of clients in the oil, gas, coal, and chemical \nindustries to undermine protections that safeguard public health and \nthe environment. He has used his current position to attack the \nrenewable fuel standard, which requires biofuels to be blended with \ngasoline--something the big oil companies hate because it means serious \ncompetition for dirty oil. So as an attorney for the American Petroleum \nInstitute--the trade association that represents ExxonMobil, BP, and a \nnumber of other oil and gas giants--Mr. Wehrum sued the EPA at least \nfour times in an effort to weaken the RFS, the renewable fuel standard. \nThis is deeply troubling, considering that if he gets this job, he will \nbe in charge of administering the RFS, which will allow him to \nimplement his clear agenda. He has done nothing to lead us to believe \nhe would do anything but side with the giant oil companies.\n  The facts are clear. The RFS boosts energy security, it creates rural \njobs, and it is better for the environment than oil. You are never \ngoing to see an ethanol spill in the Gulf of Mexico.\n  Colleagues on both sides of the aisle agree that despite this \nbipartisan support, EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt has reduced advanced \nbiofuel blending targets for 2018. Now, with Mr. Wehrum's nomination, I \nhave even less confidence in this administration upholding Congress's \nintent on the RFS.\n  He also has a history of willful ignorance of science. When asked \nwhether he believes that greenhouse gas emissions from human activities \nare the main drivers of climate change, Mr. Wehrum stated that he \nbelieves it is an open question--an answer that runs contrary to the \nconclusion of 97 percent of climate scientists and runs counter to the \n``National Climate Assessment'' that was released by this \nadministration just last week.\n  Emissions from fossil fuel-fired powerplants are some of the main \ncontributors to climate change. We know this. At the Office of Air and \nRadiation, Mr. Wehrum would oversee the repeal of standards that reduce \ngreenhouse gas emissions from the power sector, the Clean Power Plan. \nHe would also be in charge of crafting a weaker replacement, if any.\n  Let me be clear. A weak standard is an affront to the public health \nand safety of future generations.\n  To overcome the challenge of climate change, we must transform our \neconomy to dramatically reduce greenhouse gas emissions. If we don't, \nAmericans and future generations will pay an unacceptable price. But \nrather than driving innovation and pushing us to overcome this \nchallenge, the administration has ordered a retreat. You can see that \nretreat everywhere, in a budget that would gut funding for science and \ninnovation, in an EPA that values industry profits over the welfare of \nthe public.\n  The 23rd annual United Nations climate change conference is taking \nplace right now in Bonn, Germany. Two years ago, 195 nations came \ntogether to sign the Paris climate agreement in a historic display of \nthe power of collective human will, and they did it because of U.S. \nleadership.\n  Now contrast that to earlier this year, when President Trump ordered \nthe United States to retreat. He announced that he was pulling us out \nof the Paris climate agreement.\n  Yesterday, Syria announced that it would ratify the agreement. They \nwere the last remaining nation to not be a part of this agreement. We \nnow stand alone as the only country in the world choosing not to be \npart of the global effort to combat climate change.\n  Let's be clear. The President has not only ceded leadership, but he \nhas isolated the United States from the global community. He has put us \nin this dangerous situation simply to protect short-term profits of the \nfossil fuel industry.\n  Mr. Wehrum would exacerbate this administration's wrong-headed \napproach. He is anti-science, anti-public health, anti-environment. \nThat is why the Senate blocked his nomination in 2006. The Senate \nrecognized then that he wasn't fit for the job. He is even less fit \ntoday.\n  I oppose his nomination, and I urge my colleagues to do the same.\n  Thank you.\n  I yield the floor.", "turn": 26, "speaker": "Mr. FRANKEN", "itemno": 29}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
