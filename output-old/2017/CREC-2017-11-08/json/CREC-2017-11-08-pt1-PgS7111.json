Mr. President, for the last month, in the wake of the \ntragedy in Las Vegas, I have been asking my colleagues to show some \ncourage, stand up to the gun lobby, and take weapons of war off of our \nstreets.\n  Now, we have all had to bear witness to another tragedy. Three days \nago, in Sutherland Springs, Texas, a single person armed with an \nassault rifle murdered 26 people and left another 20 injured. This \ngunman walked into a church and opened fire on peaceful churchgoers, \nincluding children as young as 18-months old. A helpless toddler who \nbarely learned to walk. Eight members of a single family were also \nlost. Eight.\n  The shooter had 15 magazine clips of ammunition--almost 450 rounds--\nand used all of them. Ask yourself: how would you feel in those \nmoments, with hundreds of bullets flying around and not knowing whether \nyou will live or die, or whether you will be able to protect your \nchild? Think about those children--terrified, witnessing their families \nbeing shot while in a place of worship. It is time that we ask what \nthis says about us as a country. And what does this say about us to the \nrest of the world.\n  In 1996, after a mass shooting where a gunman opened fire on tourists \nat the sea side in Port Arthur, killing 35 people, Australia acted \nswiftly. Twelve days later, Australia's government enacted sweeping gun \ncontrol measures. Since then, there has not been a single mass shooting \nin that country since. Mass shootings in America, however, have become \ncommon place. It is no longer a matter of if, but when, another one \nwill happen.\n  If there are now mass shootings in churches, where are we safe \nanymore? Not concerts, not schools, not holiday parties. Just a month \nago, we experienced the worst mass shooting in our nation's history in \nLas Vegas. A gunman opened fire with multiple semi-automatic assault \nrifles that he had legally transformed into automatic weapons, killing \nmore than fifty people and leaving more than 500 wounded. Among the \nvictims were mothers, fathers, brothers, and sisters.\n  There was Kelsey Meadows, 28 years old, who after graduating from the \nUniversity of California, Fresno, returned to her hometown of Taft, \nCalifornia to be a substitute teacher at her alma mater, Taft Union \nHigh School. She was described by the high school principal as ``smart, \ncompassionate, and kind'' with a ``sweet spirit and a love for \nchildren.'' Her entire family and community was completely devastated. \nKelsey could have been any of us attending that concert. My own \ndaughter told me after the Las Vegas shooting that she was supposed to \nbe in the city that evening, but her plans had to change. It was only a \nlittle more than a year before the Las Vegas shooting that we \nexperienced what had then been the worst mass shooting in our nation's \nhistory.\n  That was when 49 people who were enjoying an evening of dancing with \nfriends and loved ones were massacred in Orlando. Victims in Orlando \nincluded 22-year old Luis Velma who was working at Universal Studios on \na Harry Potter ride. There was also Eddie Justice, a 30-year old \naccountant who texted his mother from the shooting, telling her: \n``Mommy I love you.'' ``In club they shooting.'' ``He has us.''\n  I encourage every member of this chamber to imagine receiving those \ntext messages from their son or daughter.\n  And just six months before that, 14 people were killed and more than \n20 injured in San Bernardino, California at a work holiday party.\n  Among the victims was a father of six. A mother of three. A woman who \nwas eight when she and her mother left Vietnam for a better life in \nAmerica. The youngest victim was 26, and the oldest was 60.\n  The list goes on and on. Eight murdered at the Umpqua Community \nCollege in Roseburg, Oregon. A police officer and two innocent citizens \nbrutally murdered by a man with an AK-47 style weapon in Colorado \nSprings. In 2013, 12 people fatally shot at the Navy Yard, less than \ntwo miles from where I stand today. And on December 14, 2012, 20 \nchildren had their lives taken at Sandy Hook Elementary School. \nChildren.\n  Once again, I encourage every member of this body to imagine dropping \ntheir young child off at elementary school this morning, only to learn \na few hours later that a gunman walked into that school and tried to \nkill as many people as possible. That is something we could have \nprevented. But we did not. Instead, we have made it easier for those \nwith mental health issues to get guns. I often remember Sandy Hook and \nthink about how we let these families down. We failed them. And sadly, \nthe mass shootings have continued to get worse in terms of frequency \nand lives lost. And I will not sit by while these killings continue.\n  That is why today I am joining with my colleagues to reintroduce \nlegislation to prohibit the sale, transfer, manufacture, and \nimportation of assault weapons and large capacity ammunition feeding \ndevices that can accept more than ten rounds. I will keep doing this. \nThis legislation must constantly be before this body until it is \nenacted. Every member must make a decision whether to stand up or let \nthe National Rifle Association win again.\n  This legislation is not perfect. But it is part of the solution. We \nmust start with reducing the supply of the weapons of war that are used \nto take the lives of our loved ones.\n  The deadly assault weapons used by the attackers in each of the \ndevastating shootings I have mentioned would have been banned under the \nAssault Weapons Ban bill that I am introducing today. The new \nlegislation is based off of legislation we previously introduced \nfollowing the horrific attack committed against young school\n\n\nchildren in Newtown, Connecticut. It will provide much needed fixes to \nthe law to keep our communities safer, while also protecting the rights \nof lawful gun owners.\n  Back when we enacted the 1994 legislation, that law prohibited \nsemiautomatic weapons with a detachable magazine and at least two \nmilitary characteristics. The bill we are introducing today tightens \nthis test to prohibit semiautomatic rifles, handguns, and shotguns that \ncan accept a detachable magazine and have one military characteristic. \nThis is the standard employed in my home state of California--and it \nworks.\n  Based on the 10 years of experience from the 1994 law, we learned \nthat the ``two-characteristic'' test was too easy to ``work around'': a \nmanufacturer could simply remove one of the characteristics, and the \nfirearm was legal. The bill we are introducing today will close that \nloophole. The bill also prohibits ``bullet buttons'', a feature that \ncertain manufacturers developed to evade restrictions on detachable \nammunition magazines. In San Bernardino, the assault rifles originally \ncontained ``bullet buttons'' for their magazine clips--which enabled \nthem to avoid California's assault weapons ban. Our bill contains \nlanguage to close this loophole.\n  This bill also prohibits ``bump-fire stocks'', which, as we saw in \nLas Vegas, allows individuals to convert semi-automatic rifles to \nfunction like a machine gun.\n  Other changes to the 1994 bill include updating the list of \nspecifically-named military-style firearms that are prohibited, to \naccount for new models developed since 1994; prohibiting semiautomatic \nrifles and handguns with a fixed magazine that can accept more than 10 \nrounds; adding a ban on the importation of assault weapons and large-\ncapacity magazines; and eliminating the 10-year sunset that allowed the \noriginal law to expire. Importantly, our legislation also prohibits \nlarge-capacity ammunition feeding devices capable of accepting more \nthan 10 rounds.\n  Now, let me tell you what the bill will not do.\n  It will not affect hunting or sporting firearms. Instead, the bill \nprotects hunters and sportsmen by exempting 2,258 firearms used for \nhunting or sporting purposes and exempting antique, manually-operated, \nand permanently disabled weapons. The bill protects the rights of \nexisting gun owners by grandfathering weapons legally possessed on the \ndate of enactment. The bill also imposes a safe storage requirement for \ngrandfathered firearms to ensure they don't get into the hands of \npeople who would be prohibited from possessing them.\n  While the bill permits the continued possession of high-capacity \nammunition magazines that are legally possessed on the date of \nenactment, it would ban the future transfer of these magazines.\n  Finally, the bill allows local jurisdictions to use existing federal \nByrne JAG grant money to support voluntary buy-back programs for \ngrandfathered assault weapons and large-capacity ammunition feeding \ndevices.\n  Opponents charge that this legislation impinges upon rights protected \nby the Second Amendment. I disagree.\n  The Supreme Court expressly held in District of Columbia v. Heller \nthat ``the right secured by the Second Amendment is not unlimited.'' \nThe Court made it clear that reasonable regulations are allowable under \nthe Constitution.\n  This bill is simply establishing reasonable regulations for what \ntypes of weapons may be sold and used--individuals should not own a \nnuclear weapon, they should not own a rocket launcher, and they should \nnot own a military-style assault weapon.\n  In fact, a number of courts have considered challenges to assault \nweapons bans. To date, every court that has considered a ban on assault \nweapons or large capacity magazines has upheld the law as reasonable.\n  In fact, the D.C. Circuit, the Second Circuit, the Fourth Circuit, \nthe Seventh Circuit, the Ninth Circuit, as well as a number of federal \ndistrict courts have all upheld laws like the one we are proposing.\n  Importantly, the Supreme Court let stand the ruling out of the \nSeventh Circuit upholding a local ban on assault weapons and high \ncapacity magazines from the City of Highland Park, Illinois.\n  Mr. President, I believe very strongly that the most important duty \nthat government has to its citizens is to protect the nation and the \nsafety of its people.\n  When 26 churchgoers are killed in cold blood with their loved ones in \na Baptist Church on a Sunday morning, we fail them by not making sure \nthat they can worship in peace.\n  When 58 people attending a concert in Las Vegas lose their lives \nbecause a madman was able to use laws on the books to make his semi-\nautomatic rifle into a machinegun, all of those who sit in this chamber \nhave failed them.\n  When 14 people are gunned down during a holiday party by those with \nassault rifles that let off 65-75 rounds within minutes, our government \nhas failed them.\n  When 20 elementary school children are slaughtered by an assault \nweapon, America has failed them.\n  The firearms used in these massacres are weapons of war. Let me say \nit as plainly as I can: weapons of war do not belong on our streets, in \nour churches, in our schools, in our malls, in our theaters, or in our \nworkplaces.\n  Now, I am under no illusions--I know that the gun lobby has a \nstranglehold on this building. I know we got 40 votes in 2013, and I \nknow Republicans control the Senate today. But I also know this was \nhard-fought in 1994, and we prevailed--with Republican support--and it \nwas a bipartisan vote. I still believe that, at some point, Americans \nwill come together and realize that we can be a nation that protects \nits people from the savagery of these weapons.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bill. I thank the chair, and I \nyield the floor.\n", "turn": 1, "speaker": "Mrs. FEINSTEIN", "itemno": 41}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 42}], "header": {"chamber": "Senate", "num": "182", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "S7111-S7119", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "8", "month": "November"}, "related_bills": [{"type": "S", "context": "OTHER", "congress": "115", "number": "2095"}, {"type": "S", "context": "HEADERLINE", "congress": "115", "number": "2098"}, {"type": "S", "context": "FIRSTPARAGRAPH", "congress": "115", "number": "2098"}, {"type": "S", "context": "OTHER", "congress": "115", "number": "2098"}], "doc_title": "STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS", "id": "CREC-2017-11-08-pt1-PgS7111"}
