Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. \n918, the Veteran Urgent Access to Mental Healthcare Act.\n  As Veterans Day approaches, we remember the debt of gratitude we owe \nour nation's veterans, who have sacrificed greatly to protect our \nfreedoms.\n  Tragically, about 11 to 20 out of every 100 veterans who served in \nOperations Iraqi Freedom or Enduring Freedom have PTSD in a given year. \nAs researchers work diligently to understand the increase in veteran \nsuicides--now at a troubling 22 veterans per day--it is important to \nunderstand that service-related mental stress is not limited to \nveterans who receive honorable discharges.\n  The Army has released at least 22,000 combat veterans diagnosed with \nmental health conditions or traumatic brain injuries since 2009 for \nalleged misconduct--meaning that many who have served in uniform may \nfall through the VA's cracks as they attempt to access mental health \nservices.\n  The Veteran Urgent Access to Mental Healthcare Act recognizes this \nissue and expands the boundaries of mental health care covered by the \nVA to better serve those who serve us--including those with PTSD that \naffects their service.\n  The lack of access to mental health care remains an unfortunate \nreality for too many veterans. This bill would extend a helping hand to \ncombat veterans struggling with the effects that their service has on \ntheir mental health. It would ensure that a population at a high-risk \nfor suicide receives the care and support its men and women deserve.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and I thank \nveterans across the country for their service.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. COLLINS of Georgia", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 3}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "182", "extension": true, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "E1535", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "8", "month": "November"}, "related_bills": [{"type": "HR", "context": "OTHER", "congress": "115", "number": "918"}], "doc_title": "VETERAN URGENT ACCESS TO MENTAL HEALTHCARE ACT", "id": "CREC-2017-11-08-pt1-PgE1535-3"}
