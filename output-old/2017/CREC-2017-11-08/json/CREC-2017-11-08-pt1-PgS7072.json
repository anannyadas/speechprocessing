Now on another matter, Mr. President, Members of the \nSenate are continuing to work hard to deliver much needed tax reform \nfor families and small businesses. Yesterday, Senators, members of the \nadministration, and tax reform advocates met here in the Capitol to \ndiscuss a mutual vision for relief. They shared the goals of \nsimplicity, fairness, and economic growth. These are the same goals I \nhave, they are the same goals the House wrote into its legislation, \nthey are the same goals the President asked us to consider, and most \nimportantly, they are the goals shared by many Americans across the \npolitical spectrum. So we are working together to get this done.\n  This is a once-in-a-generation opportunity, and it will help us \ncreate jobs and boost the economy, while closing special interest \nloopholes at the same time. We can do all of this through tax reform.\n  Today, the House Ways and Means Committee will continue to mark up \nits legislative proposal. I would like to once again commend Chairman \nBrady for his good work on the House plan. The hearings this week are \nbuilding momentum to accomplish our goals for the American people.\n  Soon, the Senate Finance Committee, under the leadership of Senator \nHatch, will release its own plan for tax reform. Working through an \nopen committee process, the committee will ultimately bring tax reform \nlegislation to the floor. I am exceedingly grateful to Chairman Hatch \nfor his continued leadership of the Finance Committee.\n  As we continue to advance tax reform, I would urge our Democratic \ncolleagues to join us. In recent years, many prominent Democrats have \nexpressed support for tax reform. Since then, the need for tax reform \nhasn't changed at all. The American people haven't stopped hurting \neither. The only thing that changed was the President. So I hope our \ncolleagues will put partisanship aside and work with us in a serious \nway to help us deliver real relief to families. I hope they will help \nus take more money out of Washington's pockets and put more money in \nthe pockets of the middle class. That is the aim of this tax reform \neffort, and we are going to keep working until we accomplish it.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. McCONNELL", "itemno": 0}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 1}], "header": {"chamber": "Senate", "num": "182", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "S7072", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "8", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "TAX REFORM", "id": "CREC-2017-11-08-pt1-PgS7072", "title": "TAX REFORM"}
