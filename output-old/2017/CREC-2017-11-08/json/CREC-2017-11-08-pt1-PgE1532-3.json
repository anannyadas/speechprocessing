Mr. Speaker, today I rise to recognize the service of \nMr. Richard Voutour. Rick is a United States Marine Corps veteran, and \nhe has served for over a decade as a friend and advocate of the \nveterans of Massachusetts as a distinguished Veterans' Service Officer.\n  Rick was born on January 7, 1963, in Webster, Massachusetts. He \nentered the Marine Corps at age 18 and completed training at Parris \nIsland, South Carolina and Camp Pendleton, California.\n  Throughout his distinguished career, Rick has consistently received \nrecognition for his exemplary service to our nation, including: the \nMeritorious Service Medal, the Navy and Marine Corps Commendation \nMedal, Navy and Marine Corps Achievement Medal with one star, the Navy \nUnit Commendation, and the Meritorious Unit Commendation.\n  Mr. Speaker, this alone would be an impressive list of achievements \nthat deserves our respect and gratitude. But after 23 years of service \nin the Marine Corps, in places as far away as Djibouti, Valetta, and \nAmman, Rick decided to return home to Massachusetts and serve his \nnation in a new way as the Director of Veteran Services for Leominster, \nMassachusetts.\n  In his 13 years as a Veterans Service Officer, Rick has helped \ncountless veterans and their families throughout Central Massachusetts \nobtain the benefits and services that they deserve. From obtaining \nmilitary record and medals--to assisting with medical care and \nbenefits, every veteran that walks into Rick's office is treated with \nthe dignity and respect he or she deserves. There are thousands of \nveterans in Massachusetts right now whose lives have been changed for \nthe better by Rick. His dedication to improving the lives of veterans \nserves as an inspiration to me and an example for our community.\n  But don't just take my word for it, Mr. Speaker. Many others have \nseen Rick's steadfast advocacy for veterans and his dogged \ndetermination to assist those who have sacrificed so much to proudly \nserve this country. Just this year, Rick was named Veterans Service \nOfficer of the Year by Massachusetts Secretary of Veterans Services, \nFrancisco Urena.\n  Mr. Speaker, on behalf of the United States Congress and of the \npeople of Massachusetts, I would like to thank and recognize Mr. \nRichard Voutour for his service to our country, and for his work every \nday to improve the lives of veterans in Massachusetts.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. McGOVERN", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "182", "extension": true, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "E1532", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "8", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "RECOGNIZING THE SERVICE OF MR.
