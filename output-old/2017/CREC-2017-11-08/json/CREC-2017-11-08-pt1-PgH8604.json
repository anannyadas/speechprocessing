Mr. Speaker, no one likes to pay taxes, but when our \nFounders dreamt of a nation, they knew that our success would rest on \nevery shoulder. So it is not to make us just citizens of this great \ncountry, but stakeholders where everyone chips in, where everyone \ncontributes, where everyone has skin in the game.\n  It is the only way that a gutsy American experiment could work: if \neach of us is so committed to what this country stands for that we are \nwilling to give a piece of what we earn to help it succeed. Of course, \nthat willingness hinges on a system that would deliver for all of our \npeople.\n  We pay into a common good because we also reap from a common \ninvestment. We send our kids to public schools. We sleep safe at night \nunder the protection of American defense. We wear down roads and \nbridges with commutes, with after-school pickups, with delivery runs, \nand family trips. So we do our part, however begrudgingly, however it \nmight strap us or sting us, and all that we ask for in return is that \nwhat we give gets put to good use.\n  The tax reform bill being offered by my Republican colleagues does \nnot put that money to good use--not the money it takes from hardworking \nAmerican families.\n\n\n  It does not ask families that are living paycheck to paycheck to fork \nover money that--make no mistake--they do not have so they can invest \nin affordable housing, so that we can help exhausted parents pay for \nquality childcare, and so that we can stop middle class kids from being \npriced out of higher education and ensure that families that are hit by \ncatastrophic medical events don't lose their livelihood--not this bill.\n  Instead, this bill asks Americans to scrape their bank accounts so \nthat the Trump administration can turn around and use that money to \ngive to the wealthiest among us and make them even wealthier; so that \nthey can make tax cuts for corporations permanent but abandon American \nworkers after a few years; so that they can multiply dividends enjoyed \nby the 10 percent of Americans who own the vast majority of our \nNation's stocks while everyone else gets left behind; so that they can \nblow a hole in our Federal deficit that again--make no mistake--working \nand middle class families will be forced to fill with their bare hands \nfor generations to come, for we all know that the moment that this bill \npasses, you are going to hear those calls for cuts to Medicaid, \nMedicare, and Social Security come roaring back from my Republican \ncolleagues.\n  So for these families, the money that they send to the American \nGovernment every year isn't just some meaningless check. It represents \nthe late nights; the double shifts; the school plays and the teacher \nconferences missed; the bedtimes when you didn't make it home; the \nvacations you could not take; those endless, countless, thankless \nsacrifices that you make every single day so that you can take care of \nthe people whom you love.\n  You deserve a country that will make your contribution count and that \nwill make that investment in your family, too. This bill doesn't even \ncome close.\n", "turn": 1, "speaker": "Mr. KENNEDY", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "182", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H8604", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "8", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "PUT TAXES TO GOOD USE", "id": "CREC-2017-11-08-pt1-PgH8604", "title": "PUT TAXES TO GOOD USE"}
