Mr. Speaker, the Ohio Veterans Hall of Fame will hold a \nceremony in Dublin on November 9 to mark the induction of its 2017 \nclass. I am honored to commend to the House one of these inductees: \nDonald E. Rospert of Bellevue.\n   A graduate of Norwalk's St. Paul High School and of Bowling Green \nState University, Mr. Rospert is a Marine Corps veteran of the Vietnam \nWar. He speaks regularly at area schools to share his experiences in \nVietnam and instruct students on proper flag etiquette and display. He \nalso participates in the color guard during Bellevue High School's home \nfootball games.\n   He and his brother, Kenn, cofounded the Wounded Soldiers Fund in \n2005 to help local families with loved ones injured in Iraq or \nAfghanistan. The fund has aided more than a dozen area families.\n   Donn and Kenn also designed, created, and secured funding for \nBellevue's Fallen Soldiers Memorial, and were instrumental in bringing \nThe Wall That Heals (a traveling replica of the Vietnam Veterans \nMemorial) to Bellevue for display this year.\n   Mr. Rospert takes great pride in the work of the local branch of Big \nBrothers and Big Sisters of America, with which he was affiliated for \nnearly two decades. He personally mentored several local youths and \nremains in contact with one to this day.\n   Mr. Speaker, selection for the Hall of Fame is a high honor accorded \nto no more than 20 Ohioans each year. To be considered for induction, \nindividuals must not only serve the nation honorably in the military \nbut also reflect the high value of service to others in their post-\nmilitary careers.\n   I am pleased to join in the accolades for Mr. Donald E. Rospert and \nhis outstanding record of service as he is inducted into the Ohio \nVeterans Hall of Fame.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. JORDAN", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 3}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "182", "extension": true, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "E1529", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "8", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "HONORING DONALD E.
