Mr. Speaker, today, I rise against H.R. 1, the so-\ncalled Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, and its effects on our veterans.\n  H.R. 1 would cut the successful work opportunity tax credit, a \nFederal credit available for employers to incentivize them to hire \nveterans.\n  In 2016, there were 453,000 veterans that were unemployed \nnationwide--16,000, alone, in Virginia.\n  Mr. Speaker, today, on their behalf, I call on my Republican \ncolleagues to find solutions that do not sacrifice those who have \nsacrificed enough.\n  House Republicans have suggested that the work opportunity tax \ncredit, at a cost of $1 billion, is simply too expensive to keep in \nplace. However, I cannot help but wonder why the same is not said about \nrepealing the estate tax, a $269 billion tax cut for the wealthy.\n  My Democratic colleagues and I are taking a different approach by \nfounding the Reinvesting in Our Returning Heroes Task Force. Instead of \nhurting, we are helping veteran businessowners and veterans who need \njobs.\n  Mr. Speaker, my father is buried in Arlington. He was a Korean war \nveteran. He said that the American GI only asked of his country what he \nwas prepared to give, and that is his best.\n  Mr. Speaker, this tax cut is not our best.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. McEACHIN", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "182", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H8645", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "8", "month": "November"}, "related_bills": [{"type": "HR", "context": "FIRSTPARAGRAPH", "congress": "115", "number": "1"}, {"type": "HR", "context": "OTHER", "congress": "115", "number": "1"}], "doc_title": "TAX REFORM AND CUTS TO THE WORK OPPORTUNITY TAX CREDIT", "id": "CREC-2017-11-08-pt1-PgH8645"}
