Mr. Speaker, I rise today to call on the Department of \nJustice to impose a moratorium on its practice of using the False \nClaims Act to demand settlements from America's mortgage brokers for \nperceived violations in the loans these lenders made under the Federal \nHousing Authority's mortgage insurance program.\n  Simply put, intentional efforts to defraud the Federal Government \nshould be prosecuted and pursued to the fullest extent of the law. \nHowever, as the FHA has worked to provide further clarification on the \nlaw, the Department of Justice has, unfortunately, focused their \nefforts on attacking honest mortgage brokers, lenders, and first-time \nhome buyers for infractions as small as a clerical error or a small \ntechnical mistake.\n  The FHA, in conjunction with HUD, is close to finalizing a taxonomy \nthat would allow for a specific and transparent penalty to be imposed \nfor a specific violation of the FHA application loan process. But as \nBrian Montgomery, the nominee to be Assistant Secretary for Housing, \ntold the Senate Banking Committee last week, the Department of Justice \nhas stepped in front of the FHA. We should correct this circumstance.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. SESSIONS", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "182", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H8646", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "8", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "DOJ FALSE CLAIMS ACT ISSUE", "id": "CREC-2017-11-08-pt1-PgH8646-4", "title": "DOJ FALSE CLAIMS ACT ISSUE"}
