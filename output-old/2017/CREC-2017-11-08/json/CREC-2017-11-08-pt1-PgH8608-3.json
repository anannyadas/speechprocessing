Mr. Speaker, in a time of national strife that we see \nour Nation in every now and then, it is good to remember history.\n  Mr. Speaker, 180 years ago yesterday, a man named Elijah Parish \nLovejoy was run out of St. Louis city for writing and publishing an \nabolitionist newspaper called the St. Louis Observer. He then moved \nacross to Alton, Illinois, where he continued to advocate the end of \nslavery.\n  On the 7th of November, 1837, Lovejoy received a new press. Many of \nhis printing presses were thrown into the river. When he got the new \npress from the Ohio Anti-Slavery Society, the local slave owners heard \nabout the arrival of the new machine and they decided to destroy it.\n  A group of his friends attempted to protect it, but during the \nattack, Lovejoy was shot in the head and died. Elijah Parish Lovejoy \nwas America's first martyr to freedom of the press. Of course, we \ndebate the press, but the press is still an important institution in \nour society.\n  In 1952, the Elijah Parish Lovejoy Award was established and it is \ngiven to a member of the newspaper profession who continues the Lovejoy \nheritage of fearlessly defending freedom.\n  Mr. Speaker, I think it is important to come back and remember a \ngreat moment in our history.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. SHIMKUS", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 3}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "182", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H8608", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "8", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "REMEMBERING ELIJAH PARISH LOVEJOY, AMERICA'S FIRST MARTYR TO FREEDOM OF THE PRESS", "id": "CREC-2017-11-08-pt1-PgH8608-3", "title": null}
