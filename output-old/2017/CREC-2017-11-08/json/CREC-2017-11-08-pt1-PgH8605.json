Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a great American \nwhom I had the privilege of meeting at the Library of Congress, Mr. \nJoseph Douek.\n  Mr. Douek hails from a great family. His father came penniless to \nAmerica some 70 years ago. He did what is now becoming a lost art in \nthis country--he went to work.\n  He went to work as a laborer and, eventually, worked his way up to \nwhere he owned a successful photography shop. He bought real estate, \nand he has now retired to a great retirement life, which he has earned.\n  Joseph, his son, has dedicated himself to public service. He has been \non the New York City Planning Commission for 5 years, and he was just \nreelected. He is an example of somebody who has given his time, his \ntithe, and his talent to serve in the great State of New York and our \ngreat country.\n  Mr. Speaker, please join me in celebrating what he has done and \nreally encouraging other people to do what he has done in that he has \ngone to work. He has done what Americans do.\n", "turn": 1, "speaker": "Mr. NORMAN", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "182", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H8605", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "8", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "RECOGNIZING JOSEPH DOUEK", "id": "CREC-2017-11-08-pt1-PgH8605", "title": "RECOGNIZING JOSEPH DOUEK"}
