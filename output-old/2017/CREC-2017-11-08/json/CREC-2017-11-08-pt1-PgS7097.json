Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the nomination of \nWilliam Wehrum to be EPA's Assistant Administrator for Air and \nRadiation.\n\n\n  President George W. Bush nominated Mr. Wehrum for the very same job \nin 2005. He was not confirmed then but was able to serve in that role \non an acting basis--something he could not lawfully do today. At the \ntime, I voted against Mr. Wehrum's nomination because I feared he would \nimpede efforts to clean our air and protect the health of Americans. \nSadly, my fears have been proved well-founded. Twenty times, the courts \nfound that clean air regulations that Mr. Wehrum helped craft did not \nfollow the law or protect public health.\n  Since leaving EPA in 2007, Mr. Wehrum has spent his time suing the \nAgency.\n  Mr. Wehrum was elusive in answering our questions. When asked which \nclean air regulations he supports, he could not name a single one--not \none.\n  Mr. Wehrum's extreme views are not good for public health and, quite \nfrankly, the legal uncertainty that stems from his judgment would not \nbe good for American businesses. That is why I call on all of my \ncolleagues to join me in opposition to this nomination.\n  Thank you.", "turn": 1, "speaker": "Mr. CARPER", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
