She dreamed of being a television anchor but found herself going \ndown a different path as a broadcast reporter and producer. Later, she \nused the skills and experience she gained in the news business to have \na successful career in marketing and consulting. Her success allowed \nher to also dedicate her time and talents to the Des Moines community, \nserving nine years on the board of Mercy Medical Center, and nine years \non the Mercy College of Health Sciences board.\n  Mr. Speaker, it is a profound honor to represent leaders like Diana \nin the United States Congress and it is with great pride that I \nrecognize and applaud her for utilizing her talents to better both her \ncommunity, and the great state of Iowa.
