Mr. Speaker, there is a heartbreaking photo \nin today's Washington Post showing two small boys, toddler-size, in a \nhospital in Yemen being treated for cholera. The story says the \nInternational Red Cross is now being prohibited by the Government of \nSaudi Arabia from shipping chlorine tablets into Yemen to treat this \ndisease that has now affected more than 900,000 people there.\n  This is a humanitarian crisis of the first magnitude and it should \nnot be tolerated. Many people are dying. Most of the victims of this \ndisease are women, children, and senior citizens.\n  In yesterday's American Conservative magazine, Daniel Larison wrote: \n``The Saudi-led blockade of Yemen has been starving the population of \nessential goods for years, but the complete shutdown of all ports \nthreatens to cause massive loss of life if it is not reversed \nimmediately.''\n  The head of the U.N. World Food Programme is warning that hundreds of \nthousands of children in Yemen will be ``on the brink of starvation if \nthe Saudi-led coalition's blockade of air, sea, and land access lasts \nfor even 2 weeks.''\n  David Beasley, of the U.N., told the Associated Press, if access \nremains shut down, ``I can't imagine this will not be one of the most \ndevastating humanitarian catastrophes we have seen in decades.''\n  Mr. Speaker, Saudi Arabia is supposed to be an ally of ours. Those of \nus in Congress should demand, urge, or at least plead with officials in \nSaudi Arabia to end this very cruel, inhumane blockade, and allow the \nRed Cross to get crucial food, medicine, and other supplies in to these \npeople before many more die needlessly.\n", "turn": 1, "speaker": "Mr. DUNCAN of Tennessee", "itemno": 3}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 4}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "182", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H8601", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "8", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "HUMANITARIAN CRISIS IN YEMEN", "id": "CREC-2017-11-08-pt1-PgH8601", "title": null}
