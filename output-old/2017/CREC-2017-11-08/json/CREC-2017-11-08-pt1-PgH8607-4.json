Mr. Speaker, Democrats agree that we need to simplify our \nTax Code and provide tax relief to middle-income families. \nUnfortunately, this Republican tax plan gives big tax cuts to the rich, \nhuge tax cuts to corporations, and raises taxes--yes, the details \nmatter--on tens of millions of American families, middle-income \nfamilies making $100,000 or less.\n  It takes away for some the ability to deduct interest on their home \nmortgage; takes away the ability to deduct interest on student loans, \nfor goodness' sake; and takes away the ability to deduct interest on \nmedical expenses.\n  But for the loopholes that apply to the people at the very top, for \nthe loopholes that apply to corporations, they leave them alone. They \nbring down their rates and let them keep their loopholes, and force us \nto borrow money from our children and our grandchildren to give great \nbig tax breaks to people at the very top.\n  This is wrong. This is not what the American people elected us to do. \nWe need to shut this down now. We need tax relief for middle-income \nAmericans, not tax giveaways to the people at the very top. We ought to \nreject this plan, and we ought to do it now.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. KILDEE", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 3}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "182", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H8607", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "8", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "REJECT REPUBLICAN TAX PLAN", "id": "CREC-2017-11-08-pt1-PgH8607-4", "title": null}
