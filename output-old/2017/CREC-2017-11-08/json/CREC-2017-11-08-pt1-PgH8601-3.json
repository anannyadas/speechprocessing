Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize the men and women of the \nNebraska National Guard. Whether it is a natural disaster in Nebraska \nor elsewhere in the United States, or doing combat operations in the \nMiddle East, the Nebraska National Guard is willing and ready to assist \nthose in need and are poised to fight our Nation's wars.\n  The Army National Guard has approximately 3,500 soldiers stationed \nthroughout Nebraska, and the Air National Guard has approximately 950 \nairmen. Joining us today in Washington are 60 of those soldiers and \nairmen.\n  The Nebraska National Guard is made up of selfless and courageous men \nand women who continue to make Nebraska and the Nation proud through \ntheir rescue and assist efforts and during times of crisis.\n  The Army National Guard has over 80 units throughout Nebraska. These \nguardsmen are also called citizen soldiers and they respond to national \ndisasters in the State and around the Nation.\n  There are two Air National Guard units in Nebraska: the 155th Air \nRefueling Wing in Lincoln and the 170th Group located at Offutt Air \nForce Base. The 155th Wing is responsible for refueling aircraft \nworldwide, while the\n\n\n170th Group provides support to the 55th Wing by training airmen \nconducting worldwide missions for our Nation.\n  In addition, they have become a premier example of total force \nintegration between the Active Duty Air Force and the Air National \nGuard. In my 30 years in the Air Force, this is the best Active Duty \nand National Guard relationship that I have seen. I think it is the \nbest in the Nation.\n  Since September 11, the Nebraska National Guard has deployed over \n10,000 soldiers and airmen. The guardsmen not only provide assistance \nto the United States, but throughout the world. There are dozens of \nNebraska soldiers deployed to Guantanamo Bay supporting detainee \noperations. Next year, the Nebraska Air National Guard will deploy to \nkey locations in the Pacific and Middle East.\n  Most recently, members of the Nebraska National Guard deployed to \nTexas, Florida, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands to assist with \nthe hurricane relief efforts.\n  The Nebraska National Guard rescued 461 people and 22 pets, and they \nserved 6,000 pounds of bottled water, 3,000 pounds of food, and 1,000 \npounds of medical supplies to the people of Texas.\n  In response to Hurricane Irma, 102 Guard members were in Florida \nproviding an aviation task force for support operations. Currently, \nthere are 58 soldiers and airmen providing support to the Virgin \nIslands and Puerto Rico. These efforts range from rescuing people to \ncleaning up St. Croix's Ricardo Richards Elementary School.\n  The Nebraska National Guard's value to Nebraskans and Americans \nacross the Nation cannot be understated. Our soldiers and airmen risk \ntheir lives to save our neighbors in need.\n  I thank the Nebraska National Guard for their service to the Nation \nand Nebraska. All Nebraskans are proud of their service.\n", "turn": 1, "speaker": "Mr. BACON", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "182", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H8601-H8602", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "8", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "RECOGNIZING THE MEN AND WOMEN OF THE NEBRASKA NATIONAL GUARD", "id": "CREC-2017-11-08-pt1-PgH8601-3", "title": "RECOGNIZING THE MEN AND WOMEN OF THE NEBRASKA NATIONAL GUARD"}
