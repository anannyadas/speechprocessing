{"title": "PETITIONS AND MEMORIALS", "content": [{"text": "  The following petitions and memorials were laid before the Senate and \nwere referred or ordered to lie on the table as indicated:\n\n       POM-134. A concurrent resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the State of Michigan urging the United \n     States Congress to properly fund the Department of Veterans \n     Affairs Board of Veterans' Appeals and to urge the Board to \n     streamline its process so that appeals are decided in a more \n     timely manner; to the Committee on Appropriations.\n\n                   House Concurrent Resolution No. 3\n\n       Whereas, Military veterans have a number of benefits \n     available to them when honorably discharged from service. \n     However, to receive disability benefits, veterans must apply \n     and be approved by agents at local veterans affairs offices. \n     If denied, the veteran has a right to appeal to the federal \n     Board of Veterans' Appeals; and\n       Whereas, As of July 2016, more than 81,000 cases were \n     pending before the Board of Veterans' Appeals, and veterans \n     are waiting an average of five years for cases to be \n     determined. The wait time for a case to be resolved is \n     unacceptable to the men and women who have served our \n     country, and action must be taken to ensure that they are \n     able to access the benefits they have earned; and\n       Whereas, Additional funding and staff are necessary to \n     properly address the backlog, as well as the estimated 57,000 \n     new complaints received in 2016. Streamlining the complex \n     appeals process is also required. Increased funding for the \n     board was included in H.R.\n\n\n     2577 of 2015. However, the bill did not pass the U.S. Senate \n     before the congressional session ended. Legislation is \n     pending in the 115th Congress (H.R. 457) to require changes \n     to the appeals process to address the backlog of appeals; \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives (The Senate \n     Concurring), That we urge the Congress of the United States \n     to properly fund the Department of Veterans Affairs Board of \n     Veterans' Appeals and to urge the Board to streamline its \n     process so that appeals are decided in a more timely manner, \n     and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, the members of the \n     Michigan congressional delegation, and the chairman of the \n     Board of Veterans' Appeals.", "kind": "Unknown", "speaker": "Unknown", "itemno": 0, "turn": -1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                                  ____\n\n       POM-135. A concurrent resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the State of Michigan memorializing the \n     United States Congress to award a posthumous Medal of Honor \n     to Sergeant Thomas Henry Sheppard for his actions during the \n     Civil War; to the Committee on Armed Services.\n\n                   House Concurrent Resolution No. 14\n\n       Whereas, A most remarkable--and long overlooked--sustained \n     act of patriotism and honor in U.S. military history is \n     credited to Sgt. Thomas Henry Sheppard of Michigan's Almont, \n     Marlette, and Imlay City area, during his service as flag \n     bearer for Company E, First Michigan Cavalry, in the Civil \n     War; and\n       Whereas, These actions include riding with his oversize \n     personal flag in multiple engagements with Confederate troops \n     in Stonewall Jackson's Shenandoah Valley Campaign of 1862 and \n     in the Battle of Gettysburg of 1863; and\n       Whereas, These actions also include secreting his flag on \n     his person after being wounded in the Battle of Gettysburg, \n     subsequently keeping his flag safely hidden by wrapping it \n     around his body during 505 days as a prisoner of war in \n     Andersonville and other Confederate camps, all the while \n     risking severe punishment or even execution; and\n       Whereas, Sgt. Sheppard and his flag received wide \n     recognition at multiple Civil War reunions and other events, \n     as reported in newspaper accounts in the late 19th century; \n     and\n       Whereas, The Sheppard flag, punctured by 72 bullet holes, \n     has been authenticated as genuine after having been restored \n     and preserved for permanent display at the Dearborn \n     Historical Museum; and\n       Whereas, Sgt Sheppard never received official recognition \n     for his sustained act of patriotism and honor; Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate \n     Concurring), That we memorialize the Congress of the United \n     States to award a posthumous Medal of Honor to Sergeant \n     Thomas Henry Sheppard for his actions during the Civil War; \n     and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, and the members of \n     the Michigan congressional delegation.", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                                  ____\n\n       POM-136.
