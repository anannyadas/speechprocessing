Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and salute Blue \nStar Mothers in honor of Military Family Appreciation Month. Blue Star \nMothers are mothers, stepmothers, grandmothers, foster mothers and \nfemale legal guardians who have children serving in the military, Guard \nor Reserve, or who are veterans. These women provide support for the \nservice members that make up our military, the veterans on the \nhomefront, and the families of our service members and veterans.\n  The Blue Star Mothers started in the United States 75 years ago \nduring World War II in Flint, Michigan. On January 22, 1942, the Flint \nNews Advertiser printed a coupon asking mothers of servicemen to return \nthe coupon after filling it out. The following February, 300 mothers \ncame together for their first meeting and decided to form a permanent \norganization. They started working in hospitals and train stations, \npacked care packages for soldiers, and became a working part of \nhomeland security during times of war.\n  Today, Blue Star Mothers have a presence in 40 states consisting of \nalmost 300 chapters nationwide. In the State of Indiana, we have seven \nchapters that I would like to recognize directly. These chapters are \nthe Blue Star Mothers of Indiana out of Monticello, the Blue Star \nHoosier Mothers out of Crawfordsville, the North Central Indiana Blue \nStar Mothers out of Kokomo, the St. Joe Valley Blue Star Mothers out of \nSouth Bend, the Fort Wayne Area Blue Star Mothers out of Fort Wayne, \nthe Hoosier Heartland Blue Star Mothers out of Kokomo, and the Indy \nBlue Star Mothers out of Indianapolis. Each of these groups has had an \nincredible impact on our community and on the Hoosier service members \nand their families.\n  These women know what it means to serve our country. They live it \neach and every day. It is with their help and strength that we are able \nto have the greatest military the world has ever seen. Behind each of \nour heroes, both at home and abroad, you will likely find a Blue Star \nMother providing them the support, encouragement, and courage they need \nto fight our foes. Mr. Speaker, we need more Americans like the Blue \nStar Mothers.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. ROKITA", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 3}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "182", "extension": true, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "E1539", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "8", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "TRIBUTE TO BLUE STAR MOTHERS", "id": "CREC-2017-11-08-pt1-PgE1539-2", "title": "TRIBUTE TO BLUE STAR MOTHERS"}
