Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the \n80th anniversary of the Edmundite Missions at Our Lady Queen of Peace \nCatholic Church in Selma, Alabama.\n  For 80 years, the Edmundite Missions has faithfully served poor and \nunderprivileged communities throughout the Deep South. The Edmundite \nMissions is rooted in the Gospel of Jesus Christ and focuses on \nproviding food, clothing, and shelter to poor and marginalized children \nand families, young adults, and seniors of all faith traditions.\n  While the Edmundite Missions in Alabama is headquartered in Selma, \ntheir outreach area includes the Alabama counties of Butler, Dallas, \nLowndes, Monroe, Perry, and Wilcox, as well as New Orleans, Louisiana.\n  The inspiring story of the Edmundite Missions began with a call to \naction when, in 1936, Pope Pius XI appealed to the Society of St. \nEdmund to go minister to the African Americans of the Deep South.\n  The Edmundites responded by selecting two young priests, Father Casey \nand Father Paro, to take on the assignment. They wrote to the bishop, \nThomas Toolen of Mobile, who invited them to set up a ``colored \nmission'' in Selma.\n  When Fathers Casey and Paro arrived in Selma on July 6, 1937, they \ndiscovered thousands of people living in extreme poverty, similar to \nthat of a Third World country. In response, they began their outreach \nby conducting door-to-door evangelism in the Black community and \nbuilding a small chapel, St. Elizabeth's Mission. Initially, they were \nmet with skepticism by both the Black and White communities in Selma, \nbut their services to the poor gradually won them the respect of both \nraces.\n  The work of the Edmundite Missions helped to transform the \ncommunities of Alabama's rural Black Belt during some of the most \nturbulent times of race relations in American history.\n  In the 1940s, the mission welcomed the Sisters of Saint Joseph from \nRochester, New York, who came to Selma to provide education and social \nministry. The Sisters of Saint Joseph started St. Elizabeth's School in \n1941 and the Holy Infant Inn, a nursing home, in 1943.\n  In 1944, the Edmundites purchased the Selma Good Samaritan Hospital, \na rundown infirmary for African Americans, and the sisters set out to \ntransform that facility into a modern-day one. They established the \nGood Samaritan School of Nursing, the first medical training program \nfor African-American women in the area.\n\n  Then, in 1947, Father Nelson Ziter launched the Don Bosco Boys Club, \nnamed after the patron saint of youth work. For the next 19 years, \nuntil 1966, the Don Bosco Boys Club helped hundreds of young Black \nyouth prepare and win financial assistance needed to attend college. \nFather Ziter devoted countless hours and days to ensuring the success \nof every youth who came into the program.\n  On a personal note, I can attest to the transformative power of the \nDon Bosco Boys Club. My dad, Andrew A. Sewell, and many of his close \nfriends credit the support, love, and guidance of Father Ziter for \nchanging the trajectory of their lives. My dad and many of his \nteammates received athletic scholarships to Historically Black \nColleges, becoming the first generation of college graduates in that \narea.\n  The club and its ministry helped to break the cycle of poverty for \nthese African-American boys such that they became teachers, doctors, \nlawyers, and even priests.\n  The Sewell family is forever indebted for the generous support and \nassistance the Edmundite Mission has given the communities of Selma and \nthroughout the Black Belt for over 80 years.\n  The Edmundites found themselves the center of controversy during the \n1960s when they were the only Whites in Selma who openly supported the \nvoting rights movement. During the 1950s and 1960s, the mission and its \npriests and sisters worked with Selma's Black and White leaders, its \nbusiness community, and its White ministers to open the lines of \ncommunication between the races.\n  During the march from Selma to Montgomery, the Edmundites, led by \nFather Ouellet, played a very critical role. On March 7, 1965, the \nbrutal confrontation at the Edmund Pettus Bridge caught the attention \nof the Nation. Scores of wounded marchers poured into the emergency \nroom at Good Samaritan Hospital, where doctors, nurses, and sisters \nworked around the clock to address their medical needs.\n  Good Samaritan Hospital won national praise for its treatment of the \nvictims of the infamous Bloody Sunday confrontation, including \nproviding medical treatment, Mr. Speaker, to our beloved colleague, \nCongressman John Lewis.\n  Father Ouellet left Selma in June of 1965 on the orders of the \nArchbishop of\n\n\nMobile. When he left, he was given a standing ovation by his \nparishioners.\n  The citizens of Selma and the surrounding Black Belt counties have \ncome a long way since 1937, and I ask my colleagues to join me in \ncelebrating the 80th anniversary of the Edmundite Mission and in \nrecognizing its many contributions.\n  May the glory of the Edmundites Mission continue to grow and prosper \nfor years to come.\n", "turn": 1, "speaker": "Ms. SEWELL of Alabama", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "182", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H8600-H8601", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "8", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "HONORING 80TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE EDMUNDITE MISSIONS", "id": "CREC-2017-11-08-pt1-PgH8600-2", "title": "HONORING 80TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE EDMUNDITE MISSIONS"}
