JAMIE RASKIN\n\n                              of maryland\n\n                    in the house of representatives\n\n                      Wednesday, November 8, 2017\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "R000606", "text": "  Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the important work \nof the Rachel Carson Council (RCC). Based in Bethesda, Maryland, the \nRCC seeks to honor and promote the environmental ethic of former Silver \nSpring resident Rachel Carson by linking environmental, health, and \nsocial policy solutions ``with the goal of building a more just, \nsustainable, and peaceful future.''\n   The RCC has documented the political and economic forces propelling \nthe Atlantic Coast Pipeline, while suggesting safer alternative \nsolutions to build a clean and reliable energy portfolio. The Atlantic \nCoast Pipeline is a proposed $5.5 billion, 600-mile project to move the \nsupply of natural gas fractured from the Marcellus and Utica Shale \nBasins in Ohio, West Virginia, and Pennsylvania to meet growing energy \ndemand in Virginia and North Carolina.\n   The RCC recently released a comprehensive report entitled, ``Blast \nZone: Natural Gas and the Atlantic Coast Pipeline.'' This report \nhighlights the dangers of transporting natural gas and the underlying \nproblems with existing natural gas fracturing methods, and it also \nquestions the demand impetus for the project itself. Moreover, the \nreport outlines serious attendant environmental and health risks, which \nthey allege disproportionately affect minority communities and people \nliving below the poverty line. For example, the RCC notes that in North \nCarolina, 30 out of 42 census tracts within one mile of the pipeline \nroute have higher minority levels, and 27 out of 42 tracts have higher \npoverty levels than the state average.\n   Natural gas has been touted as a bridge fuel, but RCC argues that \nmethane leakage rates range from 3.8 percent to 12 percent, with \nmethane nearly 100 times more effective at trapping heat in Earth's \natmosphere over a 20-year lifecycle. With the methane leakage factored \ninto an environmental analysis, RCC concludes that natural gas is even \nworse for the climate than coal, with a leakage rate of above 3.2 \npercent.\n   The dangers of natural gas extraction and transportation were \nvividly illustrated by California's Aliso Canyon disaster, which spewed \n100,000 tons of methane into the atmosphere over a four-month period \nfrom 2015 into 2016. Unexpected earthquakes in Oklahoma have been \nattributed to fracking wastewater disposal practices, a bizarre \ndevelopment which calls the lifecycle of the process' ecological \nbenefits into greater question.\n   Mr. Speaker, it is becoming impossible to ignore the imminent peril \nposed by natural gas extraction and transportation. I urge my \ncolleagues to review the well-researched ``Blast Zone'' report produced \nby the RCC, and to come together across party lines to develop energy \nefficient policies that will protect our environment, our economy, and \nour collective future.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. RASKIN", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 3}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "182", "extension": true, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "E1530", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "8", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "RECOGNIZING THE RACHEL CARSON COUNCIL'S ``BLAST ZONE'' REPORT", "id": "CREC-2017-11-08-pt1-PgE1530", "title": "RECOGNIZING THE RACHEL CARSON COUNCIL'S ``BLAST ZONE'' REPORT"}
