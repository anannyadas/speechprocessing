Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and \ncongratulate Zach Barnes of Southeast Polk High School for winning the \nClass 3A, 145 pound bracket at the Iowa High School State Wrestling \ntournament earlier this year.\n  Iowa has a long and proud history of strong wrestling programs, \nproducing college and Olympic champions for years. Winning state \nchampionships is the culmination of years of hard work and commitment, \nnot only on the part of Zach, but also his parents, his family, coaches \nand fellow teammates.\n  Mr. Speaker, the example set by Zach demonstrates the rewards of \ndedication, and perseverance. I am proud to represent him and his \nfamily in the United States Congress. I ask that my colleagues in the \nUnited States House of Representatives join me in congratulating Zach \non competing in this rigorous competition and in wishing him nothing \nbut continued success.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. YOUNG of Iowa", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 3}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "182", "extension": true, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "E1535", "wkday": "Wednesday", "day": "8", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "TRIBUTE TO ZACH BARNES", "id": "CREC-2017-11-08-pt1-PgE1535", "title": "TRIBUTE TO ZACH BARNES"}
