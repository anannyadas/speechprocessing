                       CONGRATULATING WAYNE FARMS

                                 ______
                                 

                           HON. DOUG COLLINS

                               of georgia

                    in the house of representatives

                       Friday, November 10, 2017

  Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of 
Wayne Farms, a poultry company based in my home of Hall County. While 
attending this year's National Safety Conference for the Poultry 
Industry, Wayne Farms received 10 distinct awards for success in 
employee safety.
  More than a year ago, Wayne Farms began carrying out an initiative 
called ``Zero Accident Culture'' to further prioritize the safety of 
its 10,000 employees. Through organized efforts, the company was able 
to set and meet goals that paved the way for an even more secure 
atmosphere for its team members.
  Since its inception, the Zero Accident Culture initiative has brought 
down the number of injuries within the company, leaving employees with 
a safer environment to work in each day.
  Wayne Farms' leadership in workplace safety signifies the commitment 
that poultry producers have made not only to improving the quality of 
their food, but also to improving the work environment that they 
welcome their teams into each day.
  I congratulate Wayne Farms on the strides they've made in workplace 
safety. I wish them the best as they continue to contribute to our 
community in northeast Georgia
