                       HONORING THE MULAS FAMILY

                                 ______

                             of california

                    in the house of representatives

                       Friday, November 10, 2017

  Mr. THOMPSON of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the 
Mulas Family for being recognized by the Golden Gate Salmon Association 
for their achievements in sustainability.
  The Mulas Family has been using reclaimed water for their pastures, 
crops and dairy since the 1960's and in their vineyards since the 
1980's. Excessive water diversions are a major threat to salmon in 
California's rivers. Recycling water allows families to meet their 
needs without threatening the salmon. The Mulas Dairy is a leader in 
water recycling, which is one of California's major potential sources 
of new water.
  Vickie, Ray and Mike Mulas run the daily operations of the Dairy and 
Vineyards with their mother, Nilda. Their father, Mitch, was a very 
active member of our community before his passing in 2011.
  In addition to running their dairy and vineyard, the Mulas Family 
members are consistent leaders on community fire issues, resource 
management and agricultural issues. Vickie is the Director of the 
Sonoma County Wine Grape Commission, a member of the Sonoma Resource 
Conservation District Board, and has coached cheerleading at Sonoma 
Valley High for the past 26 years. Ray is the Chief of the Schell Vista 
Fire Department, and Mike is the Assistant Chief. Ray is a member of 
the Sonoma County Fire Chiefs Association, the Elks Club and the past 
president and current board member of the Sonoma County Farm Bureau. 
Mike is the Director of the North Bay Water District, past President of 
North Bay Dairy Herd Information Association, and has coached the 
Sonoma Valley High School Dragons for the past 35 years.
  Mr. Speaker, the Mulas family works hard on their dairy and in their 
vineyard. They are leaders in sustainable farming and contribute 
honorably to our community. I am proud to have such a hardworking 
family living in our District. It is fitting and proper that we honor 
them here today.
