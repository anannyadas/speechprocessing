                       Friday, November 10, 2017

  Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to extend my sincerest 
birthday wishes to Coach Herman ``Big Man'' Pittman, who will be 
celebrating his 90th on Sunday, November 19, 2017.
  As a young man, Herman was a gifted athlete. He displayed great 
ability to play the game of basketball, and throughout his high school 
career at Tampa Middleton High School, he played as the team's point 
guard. Because of his success, he would go on to earn an athletic 
scholarship to attend Florida Agriculture & Mechanical University 
(FAMU), where he lettered on the football team, as well as played 
starting guard on the FAMU Rattler Basketball Team.
  During his time at FAMU, Herman led his team to two Southern 
Intercollegiate Athletic Conference (SIAC) Championships. He would go 
on to make First Team All-SIAC Conference and All-SIAC Tournament Team 
for two years. After graduating from FAMU with his Bachelor of Science 
in Physical Education, Herman joined the U.S. Army, where he was co-
captain of the Fort Meade Generals in Maryland. Herman would go on to 
earn a Master's of Science in Health and Physical Education from 
Indiana University.
  Herman began his career as a teacher and coach for the Dillard High 
School Panthers in 1955. He taught physical education and driver's 
education, and also coached basketball, football, and track during his 
tenure of 37 years. He also coached at Deerfield Beach High School, 
making a total of 18 years of coaching. His career as a basketball 
coach, record of conference participation shows seven Conference 
Championships, as well as being voted Outstanding Coach of the 
Conference five times. His teams won six District Championships and 
were runners-up two times. His teams also qualified for the state 
tournament seven times, having won four state titles, they qualified 
for participation in the National High School Tournament held at 
Tennessee State University in 1959, 1963, 1965, and 1967. His coaching 
records and contributions earned him the title of ``One of the 
Winningest and Most Outstanding Coaches in the Nation.''
  For Herman's outstanding contributions and commitment to youth and 
other service involvements in Broward County, he has been awarded 
numerous honors. The Community and School Board have likewise renamed 
the Dillard High School Gymnasium as the ``Herman Pittman Gymnasium.''
  As an educator, Herman once stated, ``I feel I'm out here trying to 
educate a child for life. I try to teach them to be able to make 
adjustments in a changing society. I do the same thing in the classroom 
that I do on the basketball court--you have to teach young people how 
to live.'' This is something that Herman has been committed to his 
entire life.
  Outside of teaching and coaching, Herman has continued to dedicate 
his time to serving in a wide array of organizations that include: 
Kappa Alpha Psi, Inc. Fraternity, First Baptist Piney Grove Church, 
``Meals on Wheels,'' The Kiwanis Club of Central Broward, FAMU Alumni 
Association, F Club, and the Dillard Task Force.
  On Friday, November 3rd, Herman was honored at the 23rd Annual Mount 
Olive Development Corporation (MODCO) Community Service Awards Gala, 
entitled ``A Celebration of Savvy Senior Citizens & Committed Military 
Servants.'' Among the things that he said was ``the world is always 
evolving,'' in his 90 years he has evolved with the world. And, he has 
stood the test of time.
  Mr. Speaker, it is my distinct honor to wish a very happy 90th 
birthday to my very good friend, Coach Herman ``Big Man'' Pittman, 
whose service and dedication to the State of Florida and our nation is 
truly admirable. Herman will celebrate his birthday with his lovely 
wife Nielza, their three daughters Linda, Lisa, and Lavette, and their 
four grandchildren Chelsey, Colin, Mika, and Cody, as well as so many 
in our community, who love and respect all that he has contributed. I 
wish him many more years of happiness and success.
