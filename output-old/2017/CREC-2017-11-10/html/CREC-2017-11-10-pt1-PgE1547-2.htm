   HONORING APPOINTEES TO THE GEORGIA MILITARY VETERANS HALL OF FAME

                                 ______
                                 

                           HON. DOUG COLLINS

                               of georgia

                    in the house of representatives

                       Friday, November 10, 2017

  Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor two 
veterans with ties to my home of Gainesville: Lt. Alexander Ramsey 
Nininger Jr., and Lt. Col. Rembert Gary Rollison. On November 4, these 
two veterans will be inducted into the Georgia Military Veterans Hall 
of Fame, joining a distinguished group of 66 fellow Georgia veterans.
  In order to receive this honor, veterans must exhibit valor for 
heroic action in combat, demonstrate outstanding achievement while in 
service, or have made significant contributions to their community 
after leaving active duty. Lt. Nininger and Lt. Col. Rollison clearly 
met these criteria.
  Lt. Nininger graduated from West Point and was dispatched to the 
Philippines during World War II. When a military unit, separate from 
his own, faced superior firepower, he made the brave choice to assist 
his fellow soldiers and gave his life while giving them aid.
  Lt. Col. Rollison was commissioned as a second lieutenant in 1966. He 
was eventually dispatched to Vietnam, where his courage inspired others 
during Operation Junction City.
  Other notable veterans in the Georgia Veterans Hall of Fame include 
former Governor Zell Miller and former Senator Sam Nunn. Soon, photos 
of Lt. Nininger and Lt. Col. Rollison will flank those of these public 
servants on the Heroes' Wall in the Floyd Veterans Memorial Building, 
honoring their legacy and commitment to our nation's security.
  With Veterans Day around the corner, let's fulfill the duty that we 
have to our veterans by showing them our admiration and gratitude. 
Heroes like Lt. Nininger and Lt. Col. Rollison have defended our nation 
and preserved our freedoms. We are indebted to them.
  I thank these two veterans, and many others, for their service.
