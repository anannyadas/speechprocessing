                                 ______
                                 

                           HON. MIKE THOMPSON

                             of california

                    in the house of representatives

                       Friday, November 10, 2017

  Mr. THOMPSON of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise with my colleagues 
today to commemorate the Honorable Anna G. Eshoo for 25 years of 
incredible service in the United States House of Representatives. She 
has represented constituents in San Mateo, Santa Clara and Santa Cruz 
Counties in California since she was first elected to Congress in 1992.
  Representative Eshoo has authored and championed significant 
legislation on healthcare, technology, intelligence and the environment 
to improve the lives of her constituents and the American people. 
Presidents Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Barack Obama together 
signed 39 of her bills into law. She recognizes the goodness of the 
American people, the tremendous value of diversity that immigrants 
bring into our country and the power of technology to transform and 
improve our communities.
  She has a remarkable legacy in her healthcare legislative history. 
Her work enables states to provide care to women diagnosed with breast 
or cervical cancer. Her reforms made the Food and Drug Administration 
more effective and responsive. She introduced legislation to eliminate 
lifetime caps on health insurance 14 years before it was included in 
the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.
  Many of Representative Eshoo's accomplishments in Congress involve 
modernizing technology to solve problems. Firstnet, a nationwide public 
safety network of next generation 9-1-1 services, connected public 
service agencies across the nation, shortening emergency response times 
and making everyone safer.
  As a member of the House Intelligence Committee, Representative Eshoo 
played a key role following the September 11th Terrorist Attacks. She 
chaired the Subcommittee on Intelligence Community Management, where 
she focused on policy and management challenges affecting all 16 
agencies that comprise the U.S. Intelligence Community. She worked to 
ensure that U.S. intelligence efforts were consistent with our nation's 
values, which are embodied in our Constitution. She also worked to 
modernize our intelligence gathering capabilities and to improve 
Congress' ability to construct meaningful oversight of these programs.
  Because of legislation introduced by Representative Eshoo, thousands 
of acres of California's public lands are protected, including 
preservation of Sand Hill Bluff and significant areas of the California 
Coastal National Monument, the expansion of the Moffett Field Bay 
Trail, renovation of the Pigeon Point Lighthouse and the purchase of 
Bair Island to include in the Don Edwards San Francisco Bay National 
Wildlife Refuge. These priceless lands are protected for future 
generations because of her leadership.
  Representative Eshoo has received many well-deserved commendations, 
including the Dean's Medal Award from the Stanford School of Medicine 
and the President's Medal from Menlo College. She received the Angel 
Award from the Child Abuse Council of Santa Clara County and the Thomas 
Jefferson International Religious Freedom Champion Award for her work 
to protect religious minorities in the Middle East. She received the 
Statesmanship Award from the U.S. Association of Former Members of 
Congress for her work to empower tomorrow's technology leaders.
  Mr. Speaker, the Honorable Anna G. Eshoo is an important and valued 
Member of this body. She serves her constituents with great integrity, 
strength and compassion. It is therefore fitting and proper that we 
commemorate her for 25 years of service and send her our best wishes as 
she celebrates this impressive milestone.
