Mr. Speaker, I rise with my colleagues \ntoday to commemorate the Honorable Anna G. Eshoo for 25 years of \nincredible service in the United States House of Representatives. She \nhas represented constituents in San Mateo, Santa Clara and Santa Cruz \nCounties in California since she was first elected to Congress in 1992.\n  Representative Eshoo has authored and championed significant \nlegislation on healthcare, technology, intelligence and the environment \nto improve the lives of her constituents and the American people. \nPresidents Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Barack Obama together \nsigned 39 of her bills into law. She recognizes the goodness of the \nAmerican people, the tremendous value of diversity that immigrants \nbring into our country and the power of technology to transform and \nimprove our communities.\n  She has a remarkable legacy in her healthcare legislative history. \nHer work enables states to provide care to women diagnosed with breast \nor cervical cancer. Her reforms made the Food and Drug Administration \nmore effective and responsive. She introduced legislation to eliminate \nlifetime caps on health insurance 14 years before it was included in \nthe Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.\n  Many of Representative Eshoo's accomplishments in Congress involve \nmodernizing technology to solve problems. Firstnet, a nationwide public \nsafety network of next generation 9-1-1 services, connected public \nservice agencies across the nation, shortening emergency response times \nand making everyone safer.\n  As a member of the House Intelligence Committee, Representative Eshoo \nplayed a key role following the September 11th Terrorist Attacks. She \nchaired the Subcommittee on Intelligence Community Management, where \nshe focused on policy and management challenges affecting all 16 \nagencies that comprise the U.S. Intelligence Community. She worked to \nensure that U.S. intelligence efforts were consistent with our nation's \nvalues, which are embodied in our Constitution. She also worked to \nmodernize our intelligence gathering capabilities and to improve \nCongress' ability to construct meaningful oversight of these programs.\n  Because of legislation introduced by Representative Eshoo, thousands \nof acres of California's public lands are protected, including \npreservation of Sand Hill Bluff and significant areas of the California \nCoastal National Monument, the expansion of the Moffett Field Bay \nTrail, renovation of the Pigeon Point Lighthouse and the purchase of \nBair Island to include in the Don Edwards San Francisco Bay National \nWildlife Refuge. These priceless lands are protected for future \ngenerations because of her leadership.\n  Representative Eshoo has received many well-deserved commendations, \nincluding the Dean's Medal Award from the Stanford School of Medicine \nand the President's Medal from Menlo College. She received the Angel \nAward from the Child Abuse Council of Santa Clara County and the Thomas \nJefferson International Religious Freedom Champion Award for her work \nto protect religious minorities in the Middle East. She received the \nStatesmanship Award from the U.S. Association of Former Members of \nCongress for her work to empower tomorrow's technology leaders.\n  Mr. Speaker, the Honorable Anna G. Eshoo is an important and valued \nMember of this body. She serves her constituents with great integrity, \nstrength and compassion. It is therefore fitting and proper that we \ncommemorate her for 25 years of service and send her our best wishes as \nshe celebrates this impressive milestone.\n\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. THOMPSON of California", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "184", "extension": true, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "E1548", "wkday": "Friday", "day": "10", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "TO COMMEMORATE THE HONORABLE ANNA G.
