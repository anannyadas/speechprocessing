Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor two \nveterans with ties to my home of Gainesville: Lt. Alexander Ramsey \nNininger Jr., and Lt. Col. Rembert Gary Rollison. On November 4, these \ntwo veterans will be inducted into the Georgia Military Veterans Hall \nof Fame, joining a distinguished group of 66 fellow Georgia veterans.\n  In order to receive this honor, veterans must exhibit valor for \nheroic action in combat, demonstrate outstanding achievement while in \nservice, or have made significant contributions to their community \nafter leaving active duty. Lt. Nininger and Lt. Col. Rollison clearly \nmet these criteria.\n  Lt. Nininger graduated from West Point and was dispatched to the \nPhilippines during World War II. When a military unit, separate from \nhis own, faced superior firepower, he made the brave choice to assist \nhis fellow soldiers and gave his life while giving them aid.\n  Lt. Col. Rollison was commissioned as a second lieutenant in 1966. He \nwas eventually dispatched to Vietnam, where his courage inspired others \nduring Operation Junction City.\n  Other notable veterans in the Georgia Veterans Hall of Fame include \nformer Governor Zell Miller and former Senator Sam Nunn. Soon, photos \nof Lt. Nininger and Lt. Col. Rollison will flank those of these public \nservants on the Heroes' Wall in the Floyd Veterans Memorial Building, \nhonoring their legacy and commitment to our nation's security.\n  With Veterans Day around the corner, let's fulfill the duty that we \nhave to our veterans by showing them our admiration and gratitude. \nHeroes like Lt. Nininger and Lt. Col. Rollison have defended our nation \nand preserved our freedoms. We are indebted to them.\n  I thank these two veterans, and many others, for their service.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. COLLINS of Georgia", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 3}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "184", "extension": true, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "E1547", "wkday": "Friday", "day": "10", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "HONORING APPOINTEES TO THE GEORGIA MILITARY VETERANS HALL OF FAME", "id": "CREC-2017-11-10-pt1-PgE1547-2", "title": "HONORING APPOINTEES TO THE GEORGIA MILITARY VETERANS HALL OF FAME"}
