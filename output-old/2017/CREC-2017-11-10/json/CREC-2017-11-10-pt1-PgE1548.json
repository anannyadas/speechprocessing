Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of \nWayne Farms, a poultry company based in my home of Hall County. While \nattending this year's National Safety Conference for the Poultry \nIndustry, Wayne Farms received 10 distinct awards for success in \nemployee safety.\n  More than a year ago, Wayne Farms began carrying out an initiative \ncalled ``Zero Accident Culture'' to further prioritize the safety of \nits 10,000 employees. Through organized efforts, the company was able \nto set and meet goals that paved the way for an even more secure \natmosphere for its team members.\n  Since its inception, the Zero Accident Culture initiative has brought \ndown the number of injuries within the company, leaving employees with \na safer environment to work in each day.\n  Wayne Farms' leadership in workplace safety signifies the commitment \nthat poultry producers have made not only to improving the quality of \ntheir food, but also to improving the work environment that they \nwelcome their teams into each day.\n  I congratulate Wayne Farms on the strides they've made in workplace \nsafety. I wish them the best as they continue to contribute to our \ncommunity in northeast Georgia\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. COLLINS of Georgia", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 3}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "184", "extension": true, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "E1548", "wkday": "Friday", "day": "10", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "CONGRATULATING WAYNE FARMS", "id": "CREC-2017-11-10-pt1-PgE1548", "title": "CONGRATULATING WAYNE FARMS"}
