Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the \nMulas Family for being recognized by the Golden Gate Salmon Association \nfor their achievements in sustainability.\n  The Mulas Family has been using reclaimed water for their pastures, \ncrops and dairy since the 1960's and in their vineyards since the \n1980's. Excessive water diversions are a major threat to salmon in \nCalifornia's rivers. Recycling water allows families to meet their \nneeds without threatening the salmon. The Mulas Dairy is a leader in \nwater recycling, which is one of California's major potential sources \nof new water.\n  Vickie, Ray and Mike Mulas run the daily operations of the Dairy and \nVineyards with their mother, Nilda. Their father, Mitch, was a very \nactive member of our community before his passing in 2011.\n  In addition to running their dairy and vineyard, the Mulas Family \nmembers are consistent leaders on community fire issues, resource \nmanagement and agricultural issues. Vickie is the Director of the \nSonoma County Wine Grape Commission, a member of the Sonoma Resource \nConservation District Board, and has coached cheerleading at Sonoma \nValley High for the past 26 years. Ray is the Chief of the Schell Vista \nFire Department, and Mike is the Assistant Chief. Ray is a member of \nthe Sonoma County Fire Chiefs Association, the Elks Club and the past \npresident and current board member of the Sonoma County Farm Bureau. \nMike is the Director of the North Bay Water District, past President of \nNorth Bay Dairy Herd Information Association, and has coached the \nSonoma Valley High School Dragons for the past 35 years.\n  Mr. Speaker, the Mulas family works hard on their dairy and in their \nvineyard. They are leaders in sustainable farming and contribute \nhonorably to our community. I am proud to have such a hardworking \nfamily living in our District. It is fitting and proper that we honor \nthem here today.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. THOMPSON of California", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 3}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "184", "extension": true, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "E1547", "wkday": "Friday", "day": "10", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "HONORING THE MULAS FAMILY", "id": "CREC-2017-11-10-pt1-PgE1547-3", "title": "HONORING THE MULAS FAMILY"}
