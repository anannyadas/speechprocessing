Mr. Speaker, I rise today to extend my sincerest \nbirthday wishes to Coach Herman ``Big Man'' Pittman, who will be \ncelebrating his 90th on Sunday, November 19, 2017.\n  As a young man, Herman was a gifted athlete. He displayed great \nability to play the game of basketball, and throughout his high school \ncareer at Tampa Middleton High School, he played as the team's point \nguard. Because of his success, he would go on to earn an athletic \nscholarship to attend Florida Agriculture & Mechanical University \n(FAMU), where he lettered on the football team, as well as played \nstarting guard on the FAMU Rattler Basketball Team.\n  During his time at FAMU, Herman led his team to two Southern \nIntercollegiate Athletic Conference (SIAC) Championships. He would go \non to make First Team All-SIAC Conference and All-SIAC Tournament Team \nfor two years. After graduating from FAMU with his Bachelor of Science \nin Physical Education, Herman joined the U.S. Army, where he was co-\ncaptain of the Fort Meade Generals in Maryland. Herman would go on to \nearn a Master's of Science in Health and Physical Education from \nIndiana University.\n  Herman began his career as a teacher and coach for the Dillard High \nSchool Panthers in 1955. He taught physical education and driver's \neducation, and also coached basketball, football, and track during his \ntenure of 37 years. He also coached at Deerfield Beach High School, \nmaking a total of 18 years of coaching.

His coaching \nrecords and contributions earned him the title of ``One of the \nWinningest and Most Outstanding Coaches in the Nation.''\n  For Herman's outstanding contributions and commitment to youth and \nother service involvements in Broward County, he has been awarded \nnumerous honors. The Community and School Board have likewise renamed \nthe Dillard High School Gymnasium as the ``Herman Pittman Gymnasium.''\n  As an educator, Herman once stated, ``I feel I'm out here trying to \neducate a child for life. I try to teach them to be able to make \nadjustments in a changing society. I do the same thing in the classroom \nthat I do on the basketball court--you have to teach young people how \nto live.'' This is something that Herman has been committed to his \nentire life.\n  Outside of teaching and coaching, Herman has continued to dedicate \nhis time to serving in a wide array of organizations that include: \nKappa Alpha Psi, Inc. Fraternity, First Baptist Piney Grove Church, \n``Meals on Wheels,'' The Kiwanis Club of Central Broward, FAMU Alumni \nAssociation, F Club, and the Dillard Task Force.\n  On Friday, November 3rd, Herman was honored at the 23rd Annual Mount \nOlive Development Corporation (MODCO) Community Service Awards Gala, \nentitled ``A Celebration of Savvy Senior Citizens & Committed Military \nServants.'' Among the things that he said was ``the world is always \nevolving,'' in his 90 years he has evolved with the world. And, he has \nstood the test of time.\n  Mr. Speaker, it is my distinct honor to wish a very happy 90th \nbirthday to my very good friend, Coach Herman ``Big Man'' Pittman, \nwhose service and dedication to the State of Florida and our nation is \ntruly admirable.
