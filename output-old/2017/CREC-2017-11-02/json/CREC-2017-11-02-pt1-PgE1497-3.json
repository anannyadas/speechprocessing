Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor St. Matthew Original \nFree Will Baptist\n\n\nChurch in my hometown of Farmville, North Carolina. This congregation \nrecently celebrated 61 years of serving our Lord and Savior, Jesus \nChrist. The passion and commitment from this church has helped to \nspread the Word and Humility of Christ throughout the town of Farmville \nand surrounding communities for many years.\n  The ministry and community outreach performed by the people of St. \nMatthew have helped meet the needs of so many. I am proud and honored \nto call these people my neighbors.\n  I want to thank the church family of St. Matthew and Pastor Jesse F. \nWarren III as they continue to improve the quality of life for so many \npeople and commend them on this milestone in their ministry. I pray \nthat they will be blessed with many more years of service to our Lord \nand Savior, Jesus Christ.\n  As it is written in the book of Hebrews 6:10, ``God is not unjust, He \nwill not forget your work and the love you have shown Him as you helped \nHis people and continue to help them.''\n  Congratulations on your 61 years of service.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. JONES", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 3}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "178", "extension": true, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "E1497-E1498", "wkday": "Thursday", "day": "2", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "HONORING ST.
