Madam Speaker, earlier this week a driver whom law \nenforcement has identified as Sayfullo Saipov, violently rammed his \npickup truck into a crowd in Manhattan, killing 8 people and injuring \n11. Local officials called it the deadliest attack since September 11, \n2001, in that city.\n  My heart breaks for those who have lost their lives--for their \nfamilies, for their friends, and for their colleagues--due to this \nviolent act. Two Americans and six of whom were tourists visiting our \nNation and New York City to experience the wonders of America's largest \nmetropolis met the crass act, the murderous act of a terrorist.\n  Our Nation's deep gratitude goes out to the first responders. Imagine \nthese heroic Americans who intervened under very chaotic circumstances \nto bring down this criminal. Imagine yourself in that position.\n  This attack raises many questions about how this individual came to \nAmerica and how he was allowed to stay. The President's tweets \nobliquely blame this person or that person, some in Congress, some not \nin Congress, but he misses the larger point: our Federal Government, \nthe legislative branch--the first defined in our Constitution--the \nexecutive branch, and the judicial branch, need to work together to \ntackle our flawed immigration system.\n\n\n  How can we make it more secure while upholding our values as a nation \nof immigrants? The Bible reminds us: At one point, you and your \npredecessors and your family were aliens, too.\n  These are the questions to which we should be dedicating ourselves. \nWe have security systems we must perfect, but it requires working \ntogether. We are supposed to be the adults in the Republic. A true \nleader would convene a working group of both parties, along with other \nexperts, to tackle these security challenges brought to light again by \nthis tragedy. Wouldn't that be constructive? Instead, there is more \ndivision. That is not a recipe for success.\n  Let's not forget a comprehensive bill passed in the Senate in 2013, \non a vote of 68-32 and a bipartisan House companion bill that had 201 \ncosponsors, but the Republican-controlled House here refused to bring \nthat bill to the floor for a vote. That bipartisan reform bill on \nimmigration eliminated the diversity visa lottery by which the murderer \ngot into this country. Imagine if that bill had been passed. We would \nbe in a different position.\n  We can work together, but we must move past the fear-mongering, the \ntalking points, the cheap political stunts to appeal to a media that \nruns 24/7 and just looks for more fodder. Our job in Congress is to \ndefend our Constitution and, in so doing, defend liberty. This includes \nour primary responsibility to work together to assure that our people \nfeel safe and secure. We defend the Constitution by defending and \nprotecting them.\n  The goal must not be division. The goal cannot be shallow attention \nand tweets on social media and cable news. Our people have a higher \ncalling that our Constitution defines. The recent terrible tragedy in \nNew York City reminds us that unity is always powerful, and it \nsurmounts division.\n  It is time for that unity in this Capitol, and I look for the \nleadership in the Presidency, in this Chamber, and in the judicial \nbranch to achieve it.\n", "turn": 1, "speaker": "Ms. KAPTUR", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "178", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H8392", "wkday": "Thursday", "day": "2", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "NEW YORK CITY TERRORIST ATTACK", "id": "CREC-2017-11-02-pt1-PgH8392", "title": "NEW YORK CITY TERRORIST ATTACK"}
