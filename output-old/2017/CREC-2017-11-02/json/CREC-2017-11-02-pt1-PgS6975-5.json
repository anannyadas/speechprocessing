{"content": [{"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "M000355", "text": "  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, the Senate continues to press forward \nconfirming President Trump's outstanding nominations to the Federal \ncourts. Already this week, we have confirmed two strong, smart, and \ntalented women to serve on our Nation's circuit courts. Today we will \nconsider two more well-qualified nominees: Allison Eid and Stephanos \nBibas.\n  First, we will confirm Allison Eid, whom the President has nominated \nto serve on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit. Justice \nEid has big shoes to fill in taking that seat--it became vacant when \nNeil Gorsuch ascended to the Supreme Court. It is a hard act to follow. \nYet I have every confidence she will excel in the role. You see, \nnominees such as Justice Eid and Professor Bibas are more than just the \nsum of their credentials--although theirs are indeed impressive, and I \nwill expand on those credentials in just a moment--nominees such as \nthese also believe, like Justice Gorsuch, that the role of a judge is \nto apply the law equally to everyone and to do so as the law is \nactually written, not as they wish it might be.\n  As Judge Gorsuch said, ``A judge who likes every outcome he reaches \nis very likely a bad judge--stretching for results he prefers rather \nthan those the law demands,'' or, put a different way, ``I don't think \nthere are red judges, and I don't think there are blue judges. All \njudges wear black.'' That is the view of Neil Gorsuch. That is the view \nof Allison Eid and Stephanos Bibas. That is just the kind of fair-\nminded judge we want serving on the bench and just the kind of fair-\nminded judge we are confirming this week, including the exceptional \nnominees before us.\n  Justice Allison Eid graduated from the University of Chicago Law \nSchool with high honors. She earned the opportunity to clerk for Fifth \nCircuit Judge Jerry E. Smith and then for Justice Clarence Thomas \nbefore joining the faculty of the University of Colorado School of Law, \nwhere she served as a professor for our colleague Senator Gardner. When \nhe introduced his former professor before the Judiciary Committee, \nSenator Gardner noted how much she cared about ``robust debates and \nhearing the views of others.''\n  ``Justice Eid,'' he said, ``was open to their views, engaging with \nthem, and [was] never biased against different perspectives.''\n  Later, Justice Eid was appointed to serve as Colorado's solicitor \ngeneral and, in 2006, to the Colorado Supreme Court. Two years later, \n75 percent of Coloradans voted to retain her. Her time on the State's \nhigh court has been marked by clear and precise writing and judicial \nindependence.\n  One of Justice Eid's former clerks wrote a column in the Denver Post \nin support of her nomination. As a jurist, this clerk wrote, ``Eid \ncommits her full mental energy and attention to each case, carefully \nmastering every legal and factual detail in order to conduct a rigorous \nanalysis dictated ultimately by the law.'' In addition, this former \nclerk added a personal touch to Justice Eid's incredible resume:\n\n       For women striving to achieve that elusive balance between \n     family life and a successful career, it can be hard to find \n     strong role models. But Colorado's Allison Eid is a shining \n     example.\n\n  Justice Eid is clearly well qualified for the position to which she \nhas been nominated. She is just the kind of fair-minded judge people \nwould want hearing their case. I look forward to supporting her \nnomination today, and I ask each of my colleagues to join me in \nconfirming the nomination of this extremely well qualified jurist.\n  I would ask them to join me in supporting Professor Bibas too. \nProfessor Bibas has served as assistant U.S. attorney. He has \nexperience in private practice. He has clerked for a circuit court \njudge and for Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy. Today he is a \nprofessor at the University of Pennsylvania Law School, where, \naccording to the former dean of students, he ``enjoys\n\n\nthe give and take of discussion'' and is ``very fair, considerate, and \nencouraging.''\n  Moreover, as a bipartisan group of more than 100 law professors put \nit in a letter to the Judiciary Committee, Professor Bibas's ``fair-\nmindedness, conscientiousness, and personal integrity are beyond \nquestion,'' and in their view, ``his judicial temperament will reflect \nthese qualities and . . . he will faithfully discharge his duty to \napply the law fairly and evenhandedly in all matters before him.''\n  Professor Bibas also reminded us that he, like Justice Gorsuch and \nJustice Eid, believes in a fair-minded approach to the law. In his \nwords, ``People need to know and believe that judges will apply the law \nimpartially and evenhandedly to all litigants, regardless of their \nwealth or power.'' He is right. Let's join together in supporting him \ntoday.\n  I would like to once again thank Judiciary Committee Chairman \nGrassley for all his work to bring these impressive nominees to the \nfloor. Together with the President, we will continue working hard to \nput judges on the Federal courts who will uphold the law as it is \nwritten, not as they wish it were.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. McCONNELL", "itemno": 0}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 1}], "header": {"chamber": "Senate", "num": "178", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "S6975-S6976", "wkday": "Thursday", "day": "2", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "NOMINATIONS OF ALLISON EID AND STEPHANOS BIBAS", "id": "CREC-2017-11-02-pt1-PgS6975-5", "title": "NOMINATIONS OF ALLISON EID AND STEPHANOS BIBAS"}
