Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and \ncongratulate Andy and Amy Walsh of Waukee, Iowa for being named the \n2016 Waukee Citizens of the Year.\n  Andy and Amy own and operate Mickey's Irish Pub in Waukee, Iowa. The \nestablishment is known as a place for an after work getaway and a place \nto get a good bite to eat. But what makes the Walsh's stick out is how \nmuch they give back to the community. Several organizations, including \nWaukee Crime Stoppers, Waukee Police Citizens' Academy, the Raccoon \nRiver Valley Trail Bike Association and the annual BACooN Ride, have \nseen countless hours of their involvement outside of work. They have \nhelped many charities and organizations through discounted and donated \nfood and drinks from their business, and every year they host a free \nThanksgiving dinner for city residents. It is because of people like \nAndy and Amy, and their kindness and generosity, that Iowa communities \nare some of the strongest in the country.\n  Mr. Speaker, I am honored to represent community leaders like Andy \nand Amy and it is with great pride that I recognize them today. I ask \nthat my colleagues in the United States House of Representatives join \nme in congratulating Andy and Amy for this outstanding recognition and \nin wishing them nothing but continued success.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. YOUNG of Iowa", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 3}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "178", "extension": true, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "E1494", "wkday": "Thursday", "day": "2", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "TRIBUTE TO ANDY AND AMY WALSH", "id": "CREC-2017-11-02-pt1-PgE1494", "title": "TRIBUTE TO ANDY AND AMY WALSH"}
