Mr. Speaker, the Tax Policy Center, the \nWharton School, and virtually every rational economist have reviewed \nthe House Republican tax cut plan and the results are clear: no new \ngood economic growth, big debt and deficit, and big tax cuts for \ncorporations and very rich Americans.\n  Three million wealthy Americans will get a tax cut next year of \n$220,000; 250 million not-so-rich Americans will get a tax cut of $221. \nIf you make $730,000, your income next year will increase by 8.5 \npercent. If you make $150,000, it will increase by 1 percent.\n  Where are all of the deficit hawks? Where are any of the deficit \nhawks?\n  This tax plan is nothing more than fraud being perpetrated against \nmiddle America.\n  I ask my colleagues to reject this plan.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. HIGGINS of New York", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "178", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H8393", "wkday": "Thursday", "day": "2", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "TAX PLAN", "id": "CREC-2017-11-02-pt1-PgH8393-6", "title": "TAX PLAN"}
