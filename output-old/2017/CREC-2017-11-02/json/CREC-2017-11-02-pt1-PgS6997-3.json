The estimated cost \n     is $1.1 billion.\n       This proposed sale supports the foreign policy and national \n     security objectives of the United States. Qatar is an \n     important force for political stability and economic progress \n     in the Persian Gulf region. Our mutual defense interests \n     anchor our relationship and the Qatar Emiri Air Force (QEAF) \n     plays a predominant role in Qatar's defense.\n       The proposed sale improves Qatar's capability to operate \n     and sustain its F-15QA aircraft. A robust construction, \n     cybersecurity, and force protection infrastructure is vital \n     to ensuring the QEAF partners can utilize the F-15QA aircraft \n     to its full potential. Qatar will have no difficulty \n     absorbing this support into its armed forces.\n       The proposed sale of this construction, cybersecurity, and \n     force protection infrastructure will not alter the basic \n     military balance in the region.\n       The prime contractor for construction, cybersecurity, and \n     force protection infrastructure will be determined through \n     competition. The purchaser typically requests offsets. Any \n     offset agreement will be defined in negotiations between the \n     purchaser and the contractor.\n       Implementation of the construction, cybersecurity, and \n     force protection aspects of this notification include the \n     establishment of a construction office in Doha with as many \n     as ten (10) U.S. Government civilians which will adjust in \n     size as case workload varies. Anticipated contractor \n     footprint for this effort is approximately fifteen (15) to \n     fifty (50) personnel, which may vary based on phases of \n     construction and establishment of required services.\n       There will be no adverse impact to U.S. defense readiness \n     as a result of this proposed sale.\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 3}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 4}], "header": {"chamber": "Senate", "num": "178", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "S6997", "wkday": "Thursday", "day": "2", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "ARMS SALES NOTIFICATION", "id": "CREC-2017-11-02-pt1-PgS6997-3", "title": "ARMS SALES NOTIFICATION"}
