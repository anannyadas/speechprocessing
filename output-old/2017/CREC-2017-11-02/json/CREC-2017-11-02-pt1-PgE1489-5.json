Mr. Speaker, I would like to recognize the passing of a \nvery special individual and true patriot: Mr. Edward Earl Gidcumb. Mr. \nGidcumb was 92 at the time of his passing on October 25, 2017. He was \nborn in Harrisburg, KY, and raised by his maternal grandparents, \nBroughton Temple and Nancy Ann Cummins.\n  Mr. Gidcumb attended Harrisburg Township High School, graduating in \n1943. And in 1965, he received his business degree from Paducah Junior \nCollege. During World War II, he served our nation honorably as a \nmember of the U.S. Navy, holding rank of storekeeper second class. He \nwas assigned to two different ships, the USS Indianapolis and USS \nBottineau. He received an honorable discharge from the Navy in February \n1946.\n  Mr. Gidcumb served in the Illinois National Guard for two years as a \nsergeant and squad Leader, was a member of the American Legion, and \nreceived several honors throughout his life, including being named Duke \nof Paducah, Honorary Patriot Guard Rider, and Honorary Mustang. In his \nmilitary endeavors, he was also awarded six battle stars, an honor one \nshould be immensely proud of. Mr. Gidcumb was truly an outstanding \nleader and contributor in both his military and civilian life.\n  After his time in the military, Mr. Gidcumb retired as a purchasing \nmanager at Westvaco. He also served as president of the National \nAssociation of Purchasing Managers. A participant and supporter of the \nKentucky Veteran and Patriot Museum, many people from across the \ncountry had the opportunity to learn about his service to the U.S. But \nbeyond his military and career accomplishments, many will remember Mr. \nGidcumb as an avid golfer and also a professional trumpeter. He \ndirected his own Big Band dance band, ``The Townsmen,'' for 30 years. \nThe band played at numerous community events and regularly at First \nBaptist Church of Wickliffe. He enjoyed sharing his joy of golf with \nhis friends, especially at Ballard County Country Club.\n  I am honored to recognize the memory of an individual whose life \nrepresented such patriotism, civic engagement, joy and compassion. Mr. \nGidcumb will not soon be forgotten, as his remarkable life of \naccomplishments, skills and experiences will live on.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. COMER", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 3}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "178", "extension": true, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "E1489", "wkday": "Thursday", "day": "2", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "REMEMBERING MR.
