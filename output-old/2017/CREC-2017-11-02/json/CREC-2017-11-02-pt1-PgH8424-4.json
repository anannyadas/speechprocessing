Mr. Speaker, we need a hearing on burn pits immediately.\n  Burn pits are used by our military at bases in Iraq and Afghanistan \nto eliminate tons of waste, including chemicals and plastics. They \ncause giant clouds of black smoke containing carcinogens.\n  Thousands of our men and women in our military are exposed to these \ncancer-causing hazards. I know because my constituent and friend, \nJennifer Kepner, a 39-year-old wife, mother, and Air Force veteran, \ndied from pancreatic cancer 2 weeks ago. Her oncologist made the most \nprobable link between her exposure to burn pits while serving in Iraq \nand her pancreatic cancer.\n  Congress must act. Too many questions remain. Are burn pits still \nbeing used? What are the DOD and VA doing to help veterans who have \nbeen exposed?\n  On behalf of Jenn and all concerned veterans, I, along with \nRepublicans and Democrats, demand hearings in the Armed Services and VA \nCommittees immediately to get answers.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. RUIZ", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "178", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H8424", "wkday": "Thursday", "day": "2", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "BURN PITS", "id": "CREC-2017-11-02-pt1-PgH8424-4", "title": "BURN PITS"}
