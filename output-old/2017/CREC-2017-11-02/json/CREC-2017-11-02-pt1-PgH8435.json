Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to be \nhere this evening on the floor of the United States House of \nRepresentatives and talk about a timely issue that is an issue that is \nmost important to most of the American people, and that is the issue of \nthe economy, globalization, automation, and all of the issues that are \ncoming down on many communities across the United States.\n  I want to take this opportunity to spend the next 30 minutes walking \nthrough for the American people a little bit about what has happened \nand talk very clearly about the differences in approach on how we deal \nwith these issues, how the Republican Party is trying to deal with \nthese issues, and how those of us on the Democratic side want to deal \nwith these issues.\n  I don't want to get into a discussion at all, Mr. Speaker, about who \nhates whom, and who is bad and who is good,\n\n\nand who is this and who is that. I want to talk about the facts, I want \nto talk about the historical facts, and I want to talk about what is \nhappening to average families across these United States.\n  Clearly, given the volatility of the elections over the past 15 years \nor so, I would argue that most of those elections have been about the \neconomy, and that most of those elections have been about wages, \npensions, security, and stability for families.\n  My district is from Akron, Ohio, over to Youngstown and points in \nbetween, right up against the Pennsylvania border. And what we have \nseen over the last 20 or 30 years--for a while you think that all of \nthis is just happening to your community, and then you realize as you \nread and travel, you begin to see that, unfortunately, most communities \nare facing very similar circumstances as the ones that I represent.\n  So here on this chart we have an outline of what has happened in \ncommunities with regard to foreign trade and automation. The red are \nthe States that have been hardest hit. As it moves from red to brown to \npurple to blue, and then a lighter blue, red is the most down to the \nleast affected by globalization and automation.\n  You will see on this chart the industrial Midwest, you will see up in \nNew England, you will see down South, you will see as you move more to \nthe central part of the country and then up into the Northwest, the \nhardest hit are manufacturing States, and the hardest hit by \nglobalization and automation are the Deep South.\n  So the big question facing the United States of America today in 2017 \nis: How do we fix this problem?\n  These are States that have had significantly lower growth, and they \nhave been hit hard with wages that have been stagnant for close to 30 \nyears. We have seen an erosion of their pensions.\n  So what are we going to do about this?\n  The topic today in Washington, D.C., is the issue of tax reform. So \nwe talk about tax reform in the context of the last time we had tax \nreform, 31 years ago. Mr. Speaker, since then, we have seen that 96 \npercent of income growth has gone to the wealthiest 10 percent of \nfamilies in the United States. So in 30 years, 96 percent of income \ngrowth in the country--almost all of it--has gone to the top 10 \npercent. So the average family is getting squeezed.\n  When you look back at the elections going back to, I think, 2006--I \nthought 2004--2002 and 2004 were going to be elections about the \neconomy, too, but after 9/11, that had an impact on what the national \nconversation was about with regard to our elections. But I would \nargue--and I have been here since 2003. I would argue that, in 2006, \nthat election putting Democrats in was about the economy.\n  I would say that 2008, during the Presidential election and, again, \nfor Congress, was about the economy. We had a complete collapse. The \nAmerican people didn't think the Democrats fixed things fast enough, so \nin 2010 they put the Republicans in Congress. In 2012 things were \ngetting better, and the election went for President Barack Obama, \nthinking that he was moving things slightly in the right direction. But \nthey thought he would probably be better than Mitt Romney, who would \nhave let the auto industry collapse and who was perceived as being more \nin line with the financial institutions in the United States. So they \nvoted for President Obama.\n  Then in 2014, President Obama wasn't doing things fast enough, still \nthe squeeze, and then obviously in 2016, America voted for President \nTrump, thinking that he was promising expansion of healthcare, opening \nup the coal mines and opening up the steel mills. He was going to get \nthe economy back, he was going to do it. It was going to be beautiful, \nand he was going to do it with the waving of a magic wand. It was going \nto be easy. So all of those elections were about the economy.\n  So we still have this squeeze happening in the United States. We \nstill have 63 percent of American families who could not withstand a \n$500 catastrophe in their family with their car, with their health \ninsurance, with someone's health in their family, or with an accident. \n$500 in an emergency would send 63 percent of the families in the \nUnited States spinning out of control.\n\n  We see with pensions, for example, that the average person 65 years-\nplus only has $60,000 in a 401(k), which means they can drop out $3,000 \na year--not a month, a year--out of their 401(k) for 20 years. Their \naverage Social Security is a little over $1,000. Their pension isn't \nmuch. And all of this averages to about $25,000 a year. So you are \nsqueezed with your pension. You have had stagnant wages. You don't have \nmuch of a savings. And most families can't withstand even a $500 \nemergency.\n  This constant squeeze over the last 30 years from globalization and \nautomation has put many of the communities on the last chart behind the \neight ball, unable to get and keep their nose above water for them and \ntheir families.\n  So our job is to figure out what the heck are we going to do about \nthat. So the Republicans today proposed a new program of tax cuts. Here \nis what their tax cuts look like. Remember, I said 96 percent of income \ngrowth over the last 31 years went to the top 10 percent. So the \nRepublican plan--again, we are not mad at them. This is just what they \nthink is going to work.\n  Their idea is: Why don't we give a tax cut to people making more than \n$1 million a year? They will see a good chunk of the tax cut. The next \ngroup, people making between $500,000 and $1 million a year, will see \nthe next part--the biggest chunk of the tax cut.\n  So the people who are making all of the income gains over the last 30 \nyears, that huge concentration of wealth in the last 30 years, the \nRepublicans think if we give them a tax cut, then they are going to \ntake that tax cut, and it is going to trickle down to those red States \nthat I had up here earlier in the industrial Midwest, in the South, \nmoving into the central part of the country, and in the New England \nStates that aren't really surrounded and based on finance. Let's give \nthem a tax cut and hope it makes its way and trickles its way down to \nYoungstown, Ohio. That is their solution. That is what they think is \ngoing to work.\n  So let's ask ourselves: Have we tried this before?\n  We have. When I was early in my career, we tried this approach of \nsupply-side economics. We are going to cut taxes for the wealthy. They \nare going to take that money. It is going to make its way back into the \neconomy, and it is going to get wages up, secure pensions, and all the \nrest.\n  So with the Republican plan, they have done things to do that. Not \njust cut taxes for the wealthy, they get rid of the alternative minimum \ntax, which means no matter how many loopholes you are able to take \nadvantage of, there is a minimum you are going to have to pay. And if \nthey get rid of that minimum tax, and if that minimum tax wasn't in \nplace a few years back, President Trump would have reduced his tax \nburden by $30 million--just so we can wrap our heads around this stuff.\n  Under the plan that they have now, the top 175,000 richest families \nin the country will see a $700 tax cut. That is their plan. We really \ncan't afford it because we have got to borrow $1\\1/2\\ trillion to pay \nfor all this stuff.\n  So that is where we are. That is their solution. Huge challenges with \nthe middle class, huge challenges with pensions, huge challenges with \nwages and retirement and cost of healthcare and education, and their \nplan is to cut the taxes for the wealthy and hope it helps everyone \nelse. That is their plan.\n  We have tried this before. When President Bush got in, there were two \nrounds of tax cuts that he passed in the early part of the first decade \nof this century. He gave most of the taxes, in the same way, to the top \n1 percent of earners. They got a huge chunk of what we called the Bush \ntax cuts.\n\n\n  That was their strategy back then.\n  What happened in that decade following the Bush tax cuts?\n  Well, we see that, after the Bush tax cuts, we had the slowest \neconomic growth in the United States post-World War II, the slowest \ngrowth across the board in the United States. They cut taxes for the \nwealthiest in the hopes that it would somehow help the economy. They \nalso deregulated the financial markets because that was going to help, \ntoo.\n  So what happened was that we had very low growth: employment only \nincreased by 0.3 percent, and the real\n\n\nGDP only grew by 2.6 percent; wages were stagnant.\n  As we all remember, in 2007 and 2008, things started to unravel in \nthe economy, and we had a huge collapse in the housing market that was \nderegulated. We didn't have any cops on the beat watching what was \ngoing on.\n  Stagnant growth ends in the collapse, and then Democrats came in and, \nquite frankly, fixed the problem, stemmed the tide, and did what we \ndid. That is a whole other story.\n  The whole idea that cutting taxes for the wealthy is really going to \nbump employment and really bump GDP growth is shown in recent economic \nhistory to not be true.\n  Now, what do we have to compare this with?\n  If we go back another decade to 1993, when President Bill Clinton got \ninto office, he had a different strategy and the Democrats had a \ndifferent strategy. We started to run up the deficits coming out of the \neighties. We had to get our financial house in order.\n  President Clinton came in and raised some taxes on the wealthiest \npeople in the country, not because we don't like them, but the country \nneeded revenue. We reinvested that money, balanced the budget, and what \nhappened? A totally different strategy than our friends on the other \nside--right?--totally different. What we saw in the 1990s was \nemployment at 2.4 percent, and we saw real GDP growth at 3.7 percent.\n  The red is the Bush tax cut that we have already tried in the \nhistorical analysis of that, ending in a financial collapse and \nstagnant wages. What we saw with President Clinton's economic plan is \nreal growth, and we saw an improvement in employment. Wages went up in \nevery single bracket, from the poorest to the wealthiest. Everybody \nmade more money. We had a balanced plan on how to do it.\n  When we look at what happened with the Bill Clinton plan--oh, by the \nway, it ended the decade with a $5.6 trillion surplus. That is a $5.6 \ntrillion surplus that we had here in the United States that, when \nPresident Bush got in, he gave it all away in tax cuts. I just told you \nthat story.\n  What the Democrats are saying is kind of what President Trump was \nsaying during the campaign. There has been this huge concentration of \nwealth at the top, and they have seen all the income gain.\n  We have got debt and deficits to pay for. We have got to rebuild the \nUnited States. We have got to lay broadband in every corner of the \ncountry. We need a new energy grid. We need a resilient economy to \nprepare ourselves for the storms and the hurricanes and the ups and \ndowns from climate change. We have got to reinvest back into our \nneighborhoods. We have thousands of blighted homes in communities all \nacross the United States that need to come down.\n  What we are saying is: Don't borrow $1.5 trillion from China and then \ntake the money that you are borrowing from China, pay interest on it, \nand give it to primarily the top 1 percent of the wealthiest people in \nthe United States. That doesn't make any sense.\n  In good times, I don't know if that makes any sense, but certainly \nnot when we are already running huge deficits, not when we have the \nbaby boomers moving into our healthcare programs for the elderly, not \nwhen we have an opioid epidemic where we lost more people in 1 year, \nlast year, than we lost in the entire Vietnam war. That doesn't make \nany sense.\n  We have got to rebuild the country. We are competing with China. We \nhave to make sure that our military is equipped, our students are \neducated, and that we are investing in research and development to \ndevelop wind and solar, the next generation of renewable energy, the \nnext generation of jobs.\n  And we are borrowing money from China to the tune of $1.5 trillion to \ngive to the wealthiest people in the country? Does that make any sense?\n  Mr. Speaker, it does not.\n  This is the most irresponsible tax proposal I have seen. I will even \nsay it is more irresponsible than the Bush tax credits. At least with \nthe Bush tax credits, we had a $5.6 trillion surplus. Many of us were \nsaying to put that into Medicare, put it into Social Security. In the \nAl Gore campaign, it became a joke: Put it in a lock box; don't touch \nit; save it for a rainy day.\n  A few months later, 9/11 happened, and we could have used some of \nthat for the next decade. We could have rebuilt the economy, moved the \neconomy forward, reinvested it back into the United States. At least we \nhad it coming.\n  The economy was growing and President Bush said: Well, we will give \nit back in tax cuts primarily to the rich.\n  Now we don't even have it. Now we are going to go out and borrow it \nand bring it in from China and say: Okay, China, we will owe you \nanother $1.5 trillion because we don't owe you enough already. We are \nnot going to give it to the middle class, who has not seen a pay raise \nfor 30 years. We are going to give it to the top end.\n  I just think this is very irresponsible for us as we are trying to \nget the economy to work for everybody and we have all of these \nchallenges that we are trying get our arms around here in the United \nStates that will take some public investment.\n  I am not here to say that the government can solve all of our \nproblems, because it can't. I am not saying that every solution is \nabout writing a check from Uncle Sam and putting it into a program, \nbecause it is not. But what we do have to do is make some investments \non the public side that are going to allow for growth.\n\n  When you talk about things like broadband penetration to make sure \nthat rural America or small towns or certain parts of our cities have \naccess to high-speed broadband, high-speed internet access, you will \nsee that, for every 10 percent penetration, you see, I think it is, 1, \n1.3, 1.4 percent growth in the GDP. It sounds like a pretty good \ninvestment.\n  So let's figure out how we can do a public-private partnership with \nthe telecommunications companies and the public to make sure that we \nhave high-speed internet access all over the United States. Let's sit \ndown with the power companies, the energy companies, and figure out how \nwe redo our energy grid so that we can have a 21st century, efficient, \nsecure energy grid.\n  And, oh, by the way, ask all of these people who are underemployed \ntoday to help us build out this new America. Whether it is broadband or \nthe energy grid, it is in the ground. These jobs can't be outsourced. \nThe same with renewable energy. Many of the jobs related to renewable \nenergy cannot be outsourced. These are the investments we need to make.\n  Again, we are competing with China. This, my friends, is a very \nimportant point. When you look at what China is doing militarily with \nNorth Korea, not helping as much as we want them to, moving out, \nactually building islands in the South China Sea, further projecting \ntheir force, moving into Africa, already in Africa, establishing bases \nin Africa, building relationships, getting minerals and other resources \nout of Africa, moving ahead with battery-powered cars in China and \nhere, moving and spending $360 billion on renewable energy initiatives \nby 2020, creating 13 million jobs, China is on the move.\n  What are we doing? What does the Republican Party want to do? What \ndoes the Trump administration want to do, Mr. Speaker, while China is \ninvesting billions of dollars in renewable energy, creating 13 million \nnew jobs? This genius idea is to go and borrow $1.5 trillion from them \nand take it and give it to the wealthiest people in the United States \nin the form of a tax cut that they don't need.\n  We are going to further position ourselves behind them in the race \nfor the green economy. This could mean jobs in places like Youngstown, \nOhio, investments in places like Youngstown, Ohio, driving up wages in \nYoungstown, Ohio, increasing and securing pensions in these industrial \nStates and in the South. That, to me, makes sense. That, to me, is a \nsmart plan.\n  So, Mr. Speaker, I am deeply frustrated with this tax cut. I think it \nis irresponsible. I don't think it makes economic sense. As we start to \npeel through it, other than the big picture of $1.5 trillion that we \nare going to borrow from the Chinese to pay for it, they are going to \nget rid of people's ability to deduct student loans. Medical \nemergencies will no longer be deductible.\n  They are providing instability in the wind sector with the wind tax \ncredit, which has about $50 billion in investments. About 50,000 jobs \nare at stake and 500 factories participating in this new economy.\n\n\n  There is a way to do this. There is a way to be smart. We can't let \nour ideology determine our public policy if it doesn't make any sense. \nIf we can have a balanced approach, we pay for the spending; and \nbecause of the situation we are in, we ask the wealthiest in the United \nStates to help us pay for this because they have seen 96 percent of the \nincome growth over the last 30 years.\n  If we do it right and we do it smart, we will position the next \ngeneration of Americans to be in an economy that they can thrive in, \nthat provides stability for them, security for them and their families, \nand it will also help us deal with the great challenge of our time: \nglobal climate change.\n  Mr. Speaker, I hope that, as this process moves forward, we recognize \nthat this tax cut bill is not the solution to the economic problems. It \nhas gone against what the President of the United States campaigned on, \nand I believe it is the very betrayal of his campaign, a betrayal of \nwhat that campaign meant to so many people, and a betrayal of those \nvery people whom he said he was going to help.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n", "turn": 1, "speaker": "Mr. RYAN of Ohio", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "178", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H8435-H8438", "wkday": "Thursday", "day": "2", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "TAX REFORM", "id": "CREC-2017-11-02-pt1-PgH8435", "title": "TAX REFORM"}
