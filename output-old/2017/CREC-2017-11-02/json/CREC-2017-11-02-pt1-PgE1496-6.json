DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize the \n100th anniversary of the Navy Pier and commemorate the beginning of the \nPier's second century as a public community resource and treasured \nChicago landmark. After 100 years of significant impact, Navy Pier has \nbeen reimagined and adopted the new mission: Navy Pier is the\n\n\nPeople's Pier, Chicago's lakefront treasure, welcoming all and offering \ndynamic and eclectic experiences through partnerships and programs that \ninspire discovery and wonder; Navy Pier opened to the public in 1916 \nand originally named ``Municipal Pier No. 2; Navy Pier was built under \nnationally-known architect Charles Sumner Frost, based on Daniel \nBurham's ``Master Plan of Chicago.'' Municipal Pier was the first of \nits kind to accommodate both the commercial shipping industry and \nrecreation and entertainment for the public drawing over 3 million \nvisitors annually.\n  In 1917 it was adapted to house several regiments of soldiers, Red \nCross, and ``Home Defense'' units and served as a barracks during World \nWar I. It was officially renamed Navy Pier in 1927 as a tribute to the \nNavy personnel who were housed at the Pier during the conflict. From \n1941 to 1947, the Pier was leased to the U.S. Navy as a naval training \ncenter for 60,000 recruits. One of those pilots who qualified for \nmilitary service was President George H. W. Bush.\n  Navy Pier was the original home to the University of Illinois at \nChicago from 1946 to 1965, and more than 100,000 students attended \nclasses during that time. Dubbed `Harvard on the Rocks,' the University \nshared the space with the Chicago Police Department's Traffic Division, \nthe North Pier Terminal Company, and several military detachments. The \nPier was designated a Chicago historic landmark in 1977; between the \nyears of 1978 through 1982, Navy Pier was host to ChicagoFest, a summer \nmusic festival full of food, fun, and festivities. ChicagoFest \neventually grew to become the Taste of Chicago, drawing millions of \nguests to the Pier and spurring millions of dollars in economic impact.\n  The Pier re-opened in 1995 following a $150 million redevelopment \nhaving improvements made to nearly every aspect of the three-quarter \nmile long public Pier. Since that renovation, year-round entertainment, \nshopping, dining, attractions and exhibitions have positioned the Pier \nas one of the most unique settings in the world; in July of 2011, Navy \nPier, Inc., the newly formed nonprofit entity entrusted with the \noperation and redevelopment of Navy Pier put forth The Centennial \nVision, a framework for reimagining Navy Pier as a unique public space \nand cultural mecca. The Centennial Vision's purpose is not only to \nexpand the Pier's audience, but to enrich the experience of its guests. \nThe Vision, divided into two phases, establishes a framework befitting \nChicago, a world-class city, with a vibrant architectural, cultural, \nand recreational landscape and includes a 30-year Sustainable Master \nPlan to address the Pier's long-term environmental impact.\n  With the completion of the Centennial Vision's ``Phase 1'' in 2016, a \nrecord 9.26 million guests enjoyed new amenities such as the state of \nthe art Centennial Ferris Wheel, Chicago-centric food experience, \nredesigned south dock promenade with increased access to the waterfront \nand recreational boat experiences, and over 245 free public arts and \ncultural programs.\n  As the Pier now enters ``Phase 2'' of the redevelopment with \nextensive plans to upgrade the built environment and Pier structures \nsuch as the Family Pavilion and Crystal Garden. In 2017, with the \ncompletion of 13-acre Polk Bros Park, the new Chicago Shakespeare \nTheater and expanded Chicago, Children's Museum, the Pier projects to \nsee attendance increase by as much as 26 percent as guests enjoy \ninnovative, free public programming, participatory arts, cultural \nshowcases, and the Pier's sustainable, recreational footprint; and the \nPier currently employees over 3,000 individuals, is home to 77 \nbusinesses and 5 nonprofit organizations. The redevelopment is expected \nto generate 1,565 permanent and 1,659 temporary jobs across the city.\n  I am honored to represent Navy Pier and congratulate Marilynn \nGardner, President & CEO; Patrick Sheehan, Chief Development and \nStrategy Officer, the Board of Directors and the multitude of \nindividuals working that make the Pier a fascinating and enjoyable \ndestination. Enjoy this landmark celebration and always remember, ``To \naccomplish great things we must not only act, but also dream; not only \nplan, but also believe.''\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. DANNY K.
