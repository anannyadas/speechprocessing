Mr. Speaker, today House Republicans introduced H.R. 1, \nthe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.\n  This day has been a long time coming. Since Republicans gained the \nmajority in 2011, there have been numerous congressional hearings and \nbriefings, feedback from constituents on\n\n\nwhat tax reform might look like, and even the introduction of a \ncomprehensive reform bill introduced in the last Congress. Republicans \ncampaigned on a better way to tax reform in specified areas for reform, \nand we followed that up earlier this year with a framework document \nsetting forth our principles.\n  Today is the culmination of more than 6 years of work, but our work \nis not done. Now Members of Congress and the public will have the \nopportunity to study the legislation in detail. When all the dust \nsettles, two questions will remain:\n  Will this put more money in the average American's pocket?\n  Will this put America in a much better position in the global economy \nand allow us to finally break through years of stagnation with much \nhealthier growth, more jobs, and higher incomes?\n  That should be our focus. I encourage everyone to visit \nfairandsimple.gop, and I look forward to a real debate on how tax \nreform and tax cuts will relight opportunities for all Americans.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. ROTHFUS", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "178", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H8423-H8424", "wkday": "Thursday", "day": "2", "month": "November"}, "related_bills": [{"type": "HR", "context": "FIRSTPARAGRAPH", "congress": "115", "number": "1"}, {"type": "HR", "context": "OTHER", "congress": "115", "number": "1"}], "doc_title": "TAX REFORM", "id": "CREC-2017-11-02-pt1-PgH8423-6"}
