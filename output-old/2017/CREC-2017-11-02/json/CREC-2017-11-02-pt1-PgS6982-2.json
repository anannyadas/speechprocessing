Madam President, I rise to speak about the nomination of \nProfessor Stephanos Bibas, on whom we have just invoked cloture, but \nbefore I do that, I want to take a quick moment to observe that we had \na big development today--a big development in that the House of \nRepresentatives, the majority Ways and Means Committee members, led by \nKevin Brady and Speaker of the House Paul Ryan, have unveiled a tax \nreform plan that is a very exciting step forward in our ambition to \nbring tax relief and is a direct pay raise to hard-working Americans \nwhom we represent, creating an environment where we could have much \nstronger economic growth and much more opportunity and rising wages for \nthe American people.\n  So I congratulate Chairman Brady and all the members of the Ways and \nMeans Committee. I know this process has a long way to go, but they are \noff to a great start with a very solid bill. I look forward to \ncontinuing to work with my colleagues on the Finance Committee as we \nfinalize our version of the pro-middle-class, pro-growth tax reform, \nand I am excited to see that step forward.\n  Madam President, let me get back to the issue of the candidacy of \nProfessor Stephanos Bibas and say how enthusiastically I support his \ncandidacy to serve as a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the \nThird Circuit.\n  I thank the President for nominating Professor Bibas, I thank \nChairman Grassley for moving Professor Bibas through the nomination \nprocess of his committee, and I thank Leader McConnell for bringing \nProfessor Bibas's nomination to the floor. I also thank my colleagues \nwho just voted to invoke cloture so that later today we can vote to \nconfirm this terrifically well-qualified man to a really important \ncourt.\n  Let me touch on some of his qualities. Professor Bibas has a \ntremendous wealth of experience in the law as a legal scholar and a \npracticing attorney, so much so that the American Bar Association voted \nto give him a unanimous rating of ``well-qualified,'' and let me tell \nyou why. No. 1, he starts with outstanding academic credentials. \nProfessor Bibas graduated summa cum laude and Phi Beta Kappa from \nColumbia University, and he did so at the age of 19. After Columbia, he \nstudied at Oxford University in England and earned his law degree from \nYale University.\n  He has clerked at the highest levels of our Federal court system. He \nclerked for U.S. Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy and Judge \nPatrick Higginbotham on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth \nCircuit.\n  The fact is, Professor Bibas is an accomplished legal scholar. For 16 \nyears, he has served as law professor at two outstanding universities--\nthe University of Iowa College of Law and the University of \nPennsylvania School of Law. Professor Bibas has been a prolific author \nwhose academic writings are frequently cited by the U.S. Supreme Court, \ncourts of appeals, and other law professors. He has written two books \nand more than 60 articles, many of which have focused on criminal law \nand procedures. In fact, in his writings, he has expressed views \nregarding criminal justice reform that I suspect many of my Democratic \ncolleagues would share. For instance, Professor Bibas has criticized \nwhat he sees as the overuse of plea bargains in our courts as being \nunfair to criminal defendants who then never get their day in court.\n  So there is no question that Professor Bibas has very extensive \nacademic credentials, but he is also an experienced attorney. He has \nserved on both sides of our criminal justice system. He has been a \nprosecutor, and he\n\n\nhas been a defense attorney. He has a balanced perspective from both \nsides of this part of our judicial system. He served as a Federal \nprosecutor in New York City, where he prosecuted over 100 criminal \ncases.\n  Currently, he is the director of the Supreme Court Clinic at the \nUniversity of Pennsylvania. Professor Bibas also argued six cases \nbefore the U.S. Supreme Court. He won a landmark U.S. Supreme Court \ndecision for a criminal defendant in the Padilla v. Kentucky case, a \ncase that held criminal defense attorneys must advise their noncitizen \nclients about the deportation risk associated with a guilty plea. That \nwas a Professor Bibas case. He has represented dozens of other clients \nbefore the Supreme Court, and most of those cases were pro bono \nclients--clients he did not charge any fees because they couldn't \nafford experienced counsel. He voluntarily provided that service for \nthem.\n  Over the course of the work he has done, as a result of the work he \nhas done for the Supreme Court, he has been praised by both Justices \nKagan and Ginsberg. Justice Ginsberg praised him as ``among the very \nbest of lawyers presenting cases to the Supreme Court.''\n  I hope all of my colleagues will support Professor Bibas's \nnomination. He has outstanding credentials, he has a wealth of \nexperience, and I hope everyone will see that in his background.\n  I must state I am disappointed that Senator Durbin, our colleague \nfrom Illinois, has stated that he opposes Professor Bibas's nomination. \nSenator Durbin has stated that his opposition is because of an \nunpublished academic paper that Professor Bibas drafted in 2009. In \nthat paper, he proposed the consideration of the use of corporal \npunishment as an alternative to imprisonment for certain criminal \noffenses, but Professor Bibas has stated unequivocally that he decided \nnot to publish the paper because he realized that idea was wrong, was \ndeeply offensive, and he does not support corporal punishment for \ncriminals.\n  Professor Bibas also testified at his confirmation hearing that he \nfully understands and respects the difference between the role of a \nprofessor who considers theoretical questions and writes about them, on \nthe one hand, versus, on the other hand, a judge who is deciding cases \nthat impact the lives of real people.\n  One of the most important reasons I am an enthusiastic supporter of \nProfessor Bibas is his clear understanding of the role of a judge in \nthe American constitutional system. From my review of his record and \nfrom my conversation with him, it is clear he understands the proper \nrole of a judge is to apply the law, including the Constitution, as \nwritten and not to make policy himself and that his obligation is to \ntreat everyone absolutely equally, regardless of race, sex, wealth, \npolitical affiliation, political connections, or anything else.\n  Unfortunately, many liberals and progressives have a very different \nview of a judge. Many of my colleagues and others believe the \nConstitution is a living document, by which they mean that it really \nmeans whatever a judge decides it means. Under this view, changes to \nthe law and Constitution can be made by unelected, unaccountable judges \nwho then substitute their policy preference for the preference of the \nAmerican people as reflected in their elected representatives. Some who \nhold this view even think judges should take into account such factors \nas a person's race, sex, wealth, or political affiliation in deciding \ncases. In my view, that is a deeply flawed view of the law and is \nfundamentally inconsistent with the principles of the separation of \npowers that is essential to our democracy, the sovereignty of the \nAmerican people, and the fair and equal application of the law to all \npeople. Contrary to this view, Professor Bibas understands the proper \nrole of a judge is to apply the law as written and to treat everyone \nwho comes before him equally, not to impose his policy preferences or \nimpose the law differently for different people.\n  Finally, let me say a word about Professor Bibas's temperament and \nsuitability for the bench. I think it is very clear that not only does \nhe understand the role a judge is supposed to play, but he is a man of \ncharacter and of a temperament that makes him very fit to be a judge. I \nwill give you an example. In one letter of support for his nomination, \na bipartisan group of 121 law professors from across the ideological \nspectrum stated that ``his fair-mindedness, conscientiousness, and \npersonal integrity are beyond question.''\n  In another quote, ``We have no doubt that his judicial temperament \nwill reflect these qualities and that he will faithfully discharge his \nduty to apply the law fairly and evenhandedly in all matters before \nhim.''\n  I am very pleased and proud to support Professor Bibas's nomination \nto the Third Circuit. I am completely confident he has the intellect, \nexperience, temperament, and respect for the limited role of a judge in \nour system, those attributes that are necessary for him to excel as a \nFederal appellate judge, and I am pleased to speak on behalf of this \nhighly qualified nominee. I urge all of my colleagues to support his \nconfirmation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that notwithstanding rule \nXXII, all postcloture time on the Bibas nomination expire at 1:45 p.m. \ntoday.", "turn": 2, "speaker": "Mr. TOOMEY", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sasse).

Mr. President, I see my friend and colleague from \nPennsylvania on the floor. We have worked together on a number of \nthings over the years, including now, working together to impose and \nreally enforce sanctions against North Korea, putting together a bill \nmodeled after the Iran sanctions bill so we are serious about working \nto get China and others to come to the table. I thank my colleague for \nhis work on that.\n  Where we disagree strongly is on the bill that has emerged from the \nHouse of Representatives, the so-called tax reform bill. The Senator \nfrom Pennsylvania said people should be excited to see it. I can assure \nyou, if you are a millionaire or billionaire, you are going to be \nreally excited about the bill that is coming out of the House and \nsupported by President Trump.\n  I want to talk a little bit about tax reform because we need tax \nreform in America. We need to simplify our Tax Code. It has been gummed \nup over many years with special tax breaks that are there not because \nthey make good sense for the American people but because somebody was \nable to hire a high-priced lobbyist to give them a break the rest of \nthe country does not enjoy. We need to simplify our Tax Code, and we \nneed to reform our Tax Code.\n  Unfortunately, what we are seeing come from Republicans today, \nsupported by the Trump administration, doesn't do that. In fact, what \nit will do is provide full-time employment for tax accountants around \nthe country because it creates all sorts of special provisions for \npowerful, special interests. It will dramatically cut taxes for big \nmultinational corporations and for millionaires and billionaires, and \neverybody else is going to be left to pick up the bill in one way or \nanother.\n  Now we know why this has been cooked up behind closed doors for so \nlong. People knew it would have a lot of turbulence when it emerged. \nSecondly, we know why there is such a desperate effort to ram this huge \ntax proposal through the House and the Senate--because people don't \nwant the American people to figure out exactly what is in it because \nwhen they do, they are going to see it is bad for everybody but the \nfolks who are at the very top or who are very powerful.\n  The good news is that people have scrambled to begin to look at this. \nIn fact, certain groups like Realtors--we all have Realtors in all our \nneighborhoods. They are often very connected to our community. They \nknow exactly what is going on. So they have been monitoring this \nRepublican tax plan and raising concerns about it. In fact, they said \njust a few days ago that because there was this effort ``to speed tax \nlegislation through the House by Thanksgiving and get it to Mr. Trump \nby the end of the year, `we didn't feel like we could wait,''' said the \nrepresentatives from the National Association of Realtors.\n  So they began to do an analysis of the impact, and here is what they \nhad to say today when they caught a glimpse of what was actually in the \nRepublican Trump bill. They said that\n\n\nthey are reviewing the details, but at first glance it appears to \n``confirm many of our biggest concerns'' about the plan. ``Eliminating \nor nullifying the tax incentives for homeownership puts home values and \nmiddle class homeowners at risk.''\n  We will be hearing more from them, but they commissioned a study that \nwas done by PricewaterhouseCoopers, which concluded that if you have \nadjusted gross income between $50,000 and $200,000 and you are a \nhomeowner, on average, you are going to see your taxes go up. They also \nconcluded that home values around the country would fall by 10 \npercent--not sure when they would begin to recover, but they would fall \nby 10 percent. Home values would go down, and taxes for middle-class \nhomeowners would go up.\n  Homebuilders, who are a really important part of our economy, are \nalready against this strongly. They have made it clear that this would \nhurt new homebuilding around the country, which, as we know, is an \nimportant driver in our economy.\n  Even NFIB, the National Federation of Independent Business, took a \nlook at the bill and said: ``[It] leaves too many small businesses \nbehind.''\n  I will tell you exactly who this helps. This helps big, multinational \ncorporations. When you drop the tax rate to 20 percent, they get a $2 \ntrillion tax windfall. I would be happy to talk to my colleagues about \ncorporate tax reform that doesn't blow up the deficit, but this \nproposal is a $2 trillion giveaway to big, multinational corporations \nunder the theory that somehow, when you give a big tax break to a \nmultinational corporation, it is actually going to increase the wages \nof their workers. Well, we know that just isn't so. We know it from \nindependent analysts.\n  The nonpartisan, professional Congressional Research Service has \nlooked at the claims of the proponents of this bill and said: No, this \nisn't going to be a big boost to workers; it is going to be a big boost \nto the owners of the corporations.\n  If you don't like nonpartisan analysis--and you know we have a new \nwhole machinery of fake news around here and around this country--why \ndon't we listen to the CEOs themselves? Here is what Reuters reported \nin a headline: ``CEOs suggest Trump tax cut may lift investors more \nthan jobs.'' That is what the CEOs say. Do you know what? We know from \nour own experience and our own observations that is absolutely true.\n  Let's look at the real world. We have seen record increases in \ncorporate profits over the last many years--record increases. Did that \nextra money, did those bigger profits go to higher wages for American \nworkers? They did not. They have been flat. They have been stagnant. We \nhave had a growing gap between rising corporate profits and the wages \nof people who work for those corporations. So now we are going to give \nthose same multinational corporations another $2 trillion windfall and \nthink it is going to somehow trickle down to the workers? It just is \nnot the case. That is not how they are using their profits.\n  The owners of those corporations will pocket the overwhelming lion's \nshare for themselves. We know that because that is what they have been \ndoing already, and giving them another $2 trillion isn't going to \nchange that pattern.\n  To add insult to injury, not only is this going to be a tax windfall \nfor big corporations that have record profits right now, but because of \nthe way this is designed with respect to the international Tax Code, it \nis going to create incentives for American corporations to move from \nBaltimore, MD, overseas or from any other place in the United States \noverseas. I am not just talking about moving their profits to tax \nshelters, which you see happen today. You know they park their profits \nin the Cayman Islands, and they park their intellectual property in \nlow-tax havens. Because of the way they have designed this--a 10 \npercent average international rate--they are actually encouraging \nAmerican businesses and corporations to move their operations and their \njobs overseas.\n  Let's look at another part of the plan. We keep hearing from our \ncolleagues that this is going to help folks in the middle class. Let's \nlook at the estate tax. If you are an American couple today and your \nestate is less than $11 million, you don't pay one penny in Federal \nestate tax--not one. Somehow it became an imperative of the \nRepublicans, who put together this plan, to give a tax break to people \nwith estates of over $11 million. So, first, they lift that cap from \n$11 million to somewhere like $20, $22 million, and then they get rid \nof it altogether. That doesn't help a single American household with an \nestate that is less than $11 million. We are talking about 2 out of \nevery 1,000 American households that will benefit. That apparently was \na big priority of the Trump administration and the Republicans, who put \ntogether this plan.\n  So who is going to pay for it? Who is going to pay for the $2 \ntrillion tax cut for big multinational corporations? Who is going to \npay for the windfall tax break for big, big estates? Everybody else. \nThat is why the Realtors are against it. That is why the homebuilders \nare against it. That is why others are already against it, along with \nlots of other groups. Middle-class taxpayers are going to have to pick \nup the tab.\n  Do you know what they do in this bill, this Republican bill? They \neliminate the ability of Americans to deduct their State and local \ntaxes. Except for property taxes, all of those State and local taxes \nare now going to be paid on twice. You are going to pay your State and \nlocal government, and then out of that same dollar, you are going to \npay your Federal tax. That is double taxation.\n  Here is the irony. If you are a corporation in one of those States, \nyou get to deduct your State and local taxes in whatever State it may \nbe. If you are a corporation, you get to take that deduction. If you \nare workers, if you are homeowners, no, you don't get to take that \ndeduction. You are going to pay more.\n  Here is the really ironic thing. After they provide these big tax \nbreaks to multinational corporations and millionaires and billionaires \nand raise taxes on millions of middle-class families, they are still \nleaving this country with a $1.5 trillion debt. It is written right \ninto the budget.\n  I served as the senior Democrat on the House Budget Committee for a \nlong time. Speaker Ryan used to be the chairman of that committee. He \ntalked at length about the dangers of rising national debt. Do you know \nwhat? This is a serious issue. I used to think my Republican colleagues \nwere serious about it, but now we discover they were only using that as \na lever to justify their cause for cutting Medicare, cutting Medicaid, \ncutting Social Security, cutting education: Oh, the debt is really \nhigh; we have to cut all these things. But tax cuts for big \ncorporations and millionaires and billionaires, let's add that to the \nnational credit card. That is $1.5 trillion to be paid for by everybody \nelse--our kids and grandkids.\n  Do you know what will happen? We will pass this tax cut for the \nspecial interests and powerful Americans, and then all of a sudden, I \nassure you, our Republican friends will rediscover their concern about \nthe national debt. They will rediscover it once they get through with \nthis windfall tax cut, and then they will want to come around and cut \nMedicare and Medicaid and education.\n  Do you know how we know that? They have already told us. In the \nbudget that passed this Senate and the House, they called for cutting \nMedicare by almost $500 billion--$473 billion to be exact--cutting \nMedicaid by a trillion dollars, cutting education investments very \ndeeply, cutting our investments in national infrastructure. So we know \nthat once they blow up the debt by another $1.5 trillion, they are \ngoing to come right back and say to seniors on Medicare or Americans \nwho rely on Medicaid or our kids whose education we want to invest in: \nSorry, now we have that national debt we just created. Let's come back \nand cut everything else.\n  I really hope that everyone will take a step back. We should not rush \nthrough something that will do great damage to the country and great \ndamage to the middle class just because of someone's political \nimperative to get something--anything--done. The reality is that while \nwe do need tax reform, we don't want to mess things up even worse than \nthey are today.\n  I would welcome the opportunity to work on a bipartisan basis for \ngenuine\n\n\ntax reform and simplification of the Tax Code, but I will not support \nany effort that hikes our national debt by $1.5 trillion in order to \ngive big tax breaks to multinational corporations and millionaires and \nbillionaires. We can do a whole lot better. We should do better.\n  Thank you.", "turn": 4, "speaker": "Mr. VAN HOLLEN", "itemno": 4}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "F000062", "text": "  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, last Thursday, Leader McConnell filed \ncloture on four circuit court nominees, including two nominees who had \nbeen voted out of the Judiciary Committee that very morning.\n  Voting on four controversial circuit court nominees in 1 week is \nhighly unusual, as is voting on nominees just days after they have \nmoved out of committee.\n  Senators who aren't on the Judiciary Committee deserve time to \nconsider nominees, review their backgrounds, and make an informed \ndecision for their vote.\n  But that is not what is happening in the Senate this week. Instead, \nRepublican Senate leadership is pushing President Trump's judges \nthrough as quickly as possible.\n  Jamming through as many controversial judges as possible in as short \na time as possible--to lifetime appointments, no less--is \nirresponsible. I cannot remember a time when we had cloture votes on \nfour circuit nominees in 1 week.\n  It is important to understand the context in which we find ourselves.\n  After failing to repeal the Affordable Care Act and with the \nRepublican tax reform plan facing opposition within his own party, \nPresident Trump has turned more and more to Executive orders to \ninfluence policy.\n  As we have seen, move after move has run into opposition in Federal \ncourts. So it is really no surprise that Republicans are trying to \nstack those courts with ideological judges whom they hope and expect \nwill uphold the President's harmful policies.\n  Consider how many Trump actions have or will see time in the \ncourtroom, and you begin to understand why Republicans are rushing to \nfill these vacancies--after allowing countless vacancies to remain \nunfilled at the end of the last administration.\n  In each of the following cases, the President and Senate Republicans \nseem to hope that the outcome will be different with a transformed \njudiciary.\n  The President's Muslim travel ban has been struck down by multiple \ncourts who ruled that the ban is based on religion and suspending the \nrefugee program is discriminatory, with no basis in fact. The President \nwent so far as to personally insult some of the judges who heard \narguments on the travel ban.\n  The President's decision to end the DACA program is also likely to \nfind its way into the courtroom. Beginning on March 5, 2018, it is \nestimated that around 1,000 DACA recipients per day will lose their \nprotection from deportation. By ending the program and thrusting \n690,000 young people into legal limbo, the President ensured that \nlawsuits would be filed, and he certainly is hopeful that conservative \njudges are on the stand to hear the cases.\n  We have also seen the Trump administration make moves to restrict \nwomen's access to healthcare. One woman had to go to Federal court \ntwice to challenge the government's efforts to restrict her access to \nreproductive care. The full D.C. Circuit chided the attempt to \n``bulldoze over constitutional lines'' and deny this 17-year-old young \nwoman court-approved reproductive care. Republicans tried to block \nthree of President Obama's nominees to this same court and now are \nrushing to fill its one vacancy as quickly as is possible. That is not \na coincidence.\n  President Trump's voter fraud commission will also certainly end up \nin legal battles. At least eight lawsuits have been filed against the \nPresident's Presidential Commission on Election Integrity, created to \ninvestigate false claims that 3 million people voted illegally last \nyear. It is possible the commission has already violated Federal laws \nwith regard to how it handled sensitive information. This is already \nthe subject of ongoing litigation.\n  These are just a handful of Trump actions that will see time in \ncourt. They highlight not only what is at state, but also why the \nPresident is so anxious to hurry judges that he has selected on the \nbench.\n  I would add that Republicans are now rushing to fill judicial \nvacancies for this President after spending years blocking President \nObama from filling many of these same vacancies. It actually is the \nmost egregious effort I have ever seen.\n  This record of obstruction dates back to 2001 during the Clinton \nadministration. Senate Republicans used secret holds on nominees to \nprevent judicial nominees from receiving committee hearings or floor \nvotes. This resulted in Republicans ``pocket filibustering'' nearly 70 \nof President Clinton's circuit and district court nominees, preventing \ntheir confirmation. As discussed by Senator Leahy when he served as \nchair and ranking member of the committee, Republicans would block \nnominees through pocket filibustering, which meant they would deny \nnominees hearings or up-or-down votes in committee. This is a chart \nthat lists those nominees.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have the chart printed in \nthe Record following my remarks.\n  In the first 5 years of the Obama administration, Republicans forced \nObama's district court nominees to wait nearly three times as long and \ncircuit court nominees nearly twice as long as Bush nominees for \nconfirmation votes. During the final 2 years of his Presidency, Senate \nRepublicans engaged in a historic blockade of judicial nominees.\n  It wasn't just the unprecedented decision to block Chief Judge \nMerrick Garland for the Supreme Court.\n  During the final 2 years of President Obama's administration, only 22 \njudicial nominees were confirmed--and just nine in the final year.\n  That is the lowest number of judges confirmed in a 2-year Congress \nsince President Truman was in office. Contrast this with the last 2 \nyears of the Bush administration when Democrats were in the Senate \nmajority and still confirmed 68 of his nominees.\n  In the last 2 years under President Obama, there were 53 article III \njudicial nominees pending in the Senate at the end of 2016. That is 53 \nnominees who Republicans either refused to hold hearings on or refused \nto confirm once they were on the floor.\n  In fact, of those 53 nominees, 25 had been voted out of committee and \nwere waiting for confirmation on the Senate floor. All they needed was \nfor the Republican leadership to bring them up for a floor vote.\n  Twenty-three of those 25 nominees had been unanimously voice-voted \nout of committee with overwhelming bipartisan support. Still, \nRepublicans refused to confirm them.\n  Since my colleagues have spent some time noting that three of the \ncircuit court nominees we are considering this week are women, I would \nlike to note that half of the nominees Republicans blocked from \nbecoming circuit and district court judges last year were women.\n  Here is the point: Republican leadership wanted those seats, \nincluding the Supreme Court, left open in the hopes that a Republican \nwould be elected President and pick new judges. They ignored the needs \nof country and the judiciary for their own political wants.\n  Two of the nominees we are considering this week--Amy Coney Barrett \nand Stephanos Bibas--are filling seats that President Obama had \nnominated African-American women to. Neither were confirmed because \nRepublican home-State senators didn't return blue slips. That is a \nfact.\n  Judge John Bush, who now sits on the Court of Appeals for the Sixth \nCircuit, was likewise confirmed only because Leader McConnell refused \nto return a blue slip on a well-qualified woman, Kentucky Supreme Court \nJustice Lisabeth Tabor Hughes, whom President Obama had nominated last \nyear.\n  Republicans exploited the blue slip process during the Obama \nPresidency, but today we hear constant rumors that Republicans want to \ndo away with the process--another tool allowing them to ram through \nmore judges.\n  It is worth noting that, even though Democrats had sincere, \nlegitimate concerns about the writings of John Bush--which included him \nequating slavery and abortion--his nomination was rushed through by \nLeader McConnell.\n  John Bush was confirmed just 73 days after he was nominated. In fact, \nPresident Trump's first four circuit court\n\n\nnominees waited just 84 days, on average, from nomination until \nconfirmation. By contrast President Obama's first four circuit court \nnominees waited an average of 213 days. That is nearly three times \nlonger.\n  The hypocrisy we are seeing on display is stunning. With that in \nmind, I want to say a few words about the nominees themselves.\n  Our Nation's appellate courts are the final deciders of the vast \nmajority of cases, so a nominees experience matters a great deal to me. \nHowever, the first nominee we voted on, Professor Amy Barrett, who has \nnow been confirmed to the Seventh Circuit, had very limited experience.\n  She did not have any experience as a judge, and she only worked on \none trial before becoming a professor.\n  Practically speaking, this meant the only record on which we could \njudge her was her academic writings. In those writings, I was \nespecially troubled by her position that Supreme Court precedents can \nsimply be set aside when a Justice disagrees with them.\n  The National Women's Law Center wrote that these writings ``raise \nserious concerns'' about how Professor Barrett, if confirmed, ``would \ninterpret, apply, and follow precedent, including Supreme Court \nprecedent.'' In fact, they point out that Professor Barrett's ``prior \nwritings consistently suggest that she believes precedents like Roe and \nCasey should be considered weaker and are susceptible to challenge. . . \n.''\n  That is why I was unable to support Professor Barrett's nomination.\n  The second nominee we voted on was Justice Joan Larsen for the Sixth \nCircuit. Justice Larsen, who currently serves on the Michigan Supreme \nCourt, has deeply troubling views on Presidential powers.\n  In fact, she advocated for the Bush administration's view that the \nPresident had the authority to disregard a law that Congress had just \npassed, which prohibited the U.S. Government from using torture.\n  It is no surprise that President Trump, who has shown contempt for \nthe other coequal branches of government, nominated Justice Larsen. Her \nviews are undoubtedly part of why the President included Justice Larsen \non his short list of Supreme Court nominees last year.\n  President Trump repeatedly made clear that he was only considering \nnominees for the Supreme Court who passed his litmus tests, including \nto overturn Roe v. Wade. Recall President Trump's interview with ``60 \nMinutes'' immediately after he won the election. He said, ``I'm pro-\nlife. And the judges are going to be pro-life.''\n  He added that his judges were going to be ``very pro-Second \nAmendment.''\n  We heard from 30 groups who were concerned about Justice Larsen's \nnomination, and several highlighted the danger of this litmus test.\n  As Lambda Legal wrote, ``A decision by this Committee to advance her \nnomination will be rightfully understood as not only a threat to Roe \nbut also to the LGBT cases that were built upon Roe's foundation.''\n  I opposed Justice Larsen's nomination.\n  The third nominee we are considering is Justice Allison Eid for the \nTenth Circuit. She was also included on President Trump's short list of \nSupreme Court nominees last year.\n  Since 2006, Justice Eid has served on the Colorado Supreme Court. A \nreview of her opinions shows why the Denver Post wrote in September \nbefore her hearing: ``On the state's high court, Eid has earned a \nreputation as one of its most conservative members.'' Here are just a \ncouple of examples.\n  In 2014, the Colorado Supreme Court held that a worker who fell down \na flight of stairs at her workplace and suffered multiple aneurysms as \na result deserved to be compensated under the State's workplace \ncompensation law. Justice Eid dissented, arguing that the employee did \nnot deserve any compensation for her injuries, in City of Brighton v. \nRodriguez.\n  In 2012, Justice Eid was the lone dissenting vote when the Colorado \nSupreme Court upheld a new redistricting map that was drawn to protect \nresidents' constitutional right under the ``one person, one vote'' \nstandard. The old map had unequal populations and was redone with the \nextensive work of a trial court.\n  On appeal, Justice Eid was the only dissenting judge, and she argued \nto throw out the trial court's work because she believed it had not \ngiven ``adequate weight'' to one entirely optional factor.\n  Justice Eid's record has also led a number of organizations to oppose \nher nomination, including the AFL-CIO, the Leadership Conference on \nCivil and Human Rights--LCCR--and Planned Parenthood.\n  I opposed Justice Eid's nomination.\n  The final nominee we will vote on is Professor Stephanos Bibas for \nthe Third Circuit. Like Professor Barrett, much of his legal career has \nbeen spent in academia, so our job in reviewing his record is to \ncarefully consider his writings.\n  Professor Bibas's writings have focused on criminal law, and he has \npushed forward controversial ideas about punishment. His most troubling \nproposals were set out in a paper he wrote in 2009.\n  In it, he argued that, for a wide variety of crimes, ``the default \npunishment should be non-disfiguring corporal punishment, such as \nelectric shocks.''\n  Bibas also suggested ``putting offenders in the stocks or pillory, \nwhere they would sit or stand for hours bent in uncomfortable \npositions. Bystanders and victims could jeer and pelt them with rotten \neggs and tomatoes (but not rocks).''\n  For more severe crimes, he advocated ``multiple calibrated \nelectroshocks or taser shots,'' with medical personnel on hand to \nensure ``that the offender's health could bear it.''\n  These views are shocking and outside of the mainstream. A few years \nbefore Professor Bibas wrote his article, this body had already debated \nand passed the Detainee Treatment Act in 2005, which prohibited \n``cruel'' and ``degrading'' punishment of prisoners.\n  I appreciate that Professor Bibas testified to the Judiciary \nCommittee that he now understands that his views on use of corporal \npunishment for prisoners are, in his words, ``wrong and deeply \noffensive.''\n  He came to this conclusion only after he repeatedly made public \npresentations on his paper, including one to a Federalist Society \nChapter entitled, ``Corporal Punishment, Not Imprisonment: The Shocking \nCase for Hurting Criminals.''\n  I cannot support Professor Bibas's nomination and will vote no.\n  In closing, as my colleagues consider how they will vote on these and \nother nominees, I would urge them to consider the broader context in \nwhich we are considering this President's judicial nominees.\n  We have a President who has demonstrated contempt for the rule of law \nand for the independence of the federal judiciary. I am deeply \nconcerned that this President expects the courts to just rubberstamp \nhis policy preferences.\n  For every judicial nomination, we have to consider carefully the \nnominee's record and reflect on whether they can truly be fair, \nindependent, and impartial--whether they will respect the rule of law. \nFor these reasons and the records of the four nominees I have just \ndiscussed, I cannot support them.", "turn": 5, "speaker": "Mrs. FEINSTEIN", "itemno": 5}, {"kind": "recorder", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in ", "turn": -1, "speaker": "The RECORDER", "itemno": 6}, {"kind": "recorder", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "the Record, as follows:\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "The RECORDER", "itemno": 7}, {"kind": "title", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          CLINTON ADMINISTRATION: SENATE REPUBLICANS BLOCKED FROM CONFIRMATION VOTES OVER 60 JUDICIAL NOMINEES\n                                                        [Source: Congressional Research Service]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                                                  Hearing Date(s)                       Markup Date (if\n                                             Name            Circuit/Court      First Nom Date        (if any)      Final Action Date         any)\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                      Circuit Court\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n1.................................

Mr. President, we are about to vote on our fourth \ncircuit court nominee this week, and I am glad to speak in support of \nthe nomination of Professor Bibas to serve on the Third Circuit Court \nof Appeals. That court sits in Philadelphia. Professor Bibas is a \nhighly qualified nominee. His background as a well-regarded legal \nscholar and Supreme Court advocate will serve him well as a judge on \nthat circuit.\n  Additionally, Professor Bibas received a rare, unanimously ``well \nqualified'' rating from the American Bar Association. My Democratic \ncolleagues on the Judiciary Committee have expressed to me that the \nABA's ratings are very important to their evaluation of nominees. Yet \nall of the Democratic members of the committee voted against Professor \nBibas in the committee, despite his having received the highest rating \npossible. This is consistent with their votes against Professor Amy \nBarrett, Justice Joan Larsen and Justice Allison Eid, all of whom \nreceived ``well qualified'' ratings. It appears that my Democratic \ncolleagues don't actually treat the ABA's ratings as particularly \nimportant when it comes right down to practice.\n  Professor Bibas is the son of a Greek immigrant who came to this \ncountry after surviving the Nazi occupation of Greece. He boasts \nimpressive academic credentials. He graduated from Columbia University \nat the age of 19. He then received degrees from the University of \nOxford and Yale Law School. After law school, Professor Bibas clerked \nfor Judge Patrick Higginbotham of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the \nFifth Circuit and then for Justice Anthony Kennedy of the U.S. Supreme \nCourt.\n  Following these prestigious clerkships, Professor Bibas became an \nassistant U.S. attorney in the Southern District of New York. His \nexperience as a prosecutor gave him a firsthand view of the problems \nand injustices in the American criminal justice system. He decided to \npursue a career as an academic, focusing then on improving the criminal \njustice system for all involved.\n\n  Professor Bibas's first stint as a professor was in my home State of \nIowa at the University of Iowa College of Law. He taught criminal law \nand procedure there for 5 years. We were certainly lucky to have a \nprofessor of his caliber. Professor Bibas then took a position on the \nfaculty of the University of Pennsylvania Law School, where he has been \nteaching since.\n\n\n  Professor Bibas has been prolific in his academic writings, \npublishing numerous articles on all aspects of criminal law. His \nacademic work culminated in the publication of his book entitled ``The \nMachinery of Criminal Justice.'' That book was published in 2012. In \nthis book and in many of his articles, Professor Bibas criticized the \ncurrent model of bureaucratic ``assembly line'' justice and America's \nhigh incarceration rate. Much of his work is devoted to finding \nsolutions to these problems. His academic work has certainly had an \nimpact on the law. In fact, Professor Bibas is one of the most cited \nlaw professors in judicial opinions. One study shows that he is the \n15th most cited legal scholar by total judicial opinions, and he is the \nfifth most cited in the area of criminal law--not bad for a relatively \nyoung professor.\n  Professor Bibas has also had a positive impact on colleagues and \nstudents. The Judiciary Committee received a letter from 121 law \nprofessors throughout our country representing a diverse range of \nviewpoints. These professors support Professor Bibas's nomination, \npointing to his--and this quote comes from the letter--``influential \ncontributions to criminal law and procedure scholarship,'' as well as \nhis ``fair-mindedness, conscientiousness, and personal integrity.''\n  Professor Bibas also received a letter in support of his nomination \nfrom many colleagues at the University of Pennsylvania. They stated \nthat he has been ``an outstanding scholar, teacher, and colleague'' at \nPenn.\n  Professor Bibas also has extensive litigation experience. He is \ncurrently the director of the University of Pennsylvania Law School's \nSupreme Court Clinic. In this role, he and his students have \nrepresented numerous litigants who could not otherwise afford top-\nflight counsel. He has argued numerous cases before the Supreme Court, \nand he obtained a significant victory in the landmark case of Padilla \nv. Kentucky, which established a defendant's Sixth Amendment right to \naccurate information about deportation before pleading guilty.\n  One of our Supreme Court Justices, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, in a personal \nletter to Professor Bibas that the Judiciary Committee received, called \nhim one of the ``very best lawyers presenting cases to the Court.'' It \nis kind of nice, if you are considered kind of a strict \nconstructionist, that you get a letter like that from one of the more \nactivist members of the Supreme Court.\n  Some of my Democratic colleagues criticize Professor Bibas during his \nconfirmation hearing for two really isolated events in the long and \nillustrious career he has had.\n  First, Democrats criticized Professor Bibas for prosecuting a minor \ntheft of only $7 when he was an assistant U.S. attorney. This case took \nplace nearly 20 years ago. But it was Professor Bibas's supervisor who \nmade the decision to charge the defendant and, of course, required an \nunderling by the name of Bibas to pursue the case even after it started \nto fall apart.\n  In his hearing, Professor Bibas readily acknowledged that the \ndefendant should not have been prosecuted, and the professor stated \nthis to our committee:\n\n       I learned from that mistake, and as a scholar, I have \n     dedicated my career to trying to diagnose and prevent the \n     causes of such errors in the future--inadequate Brady \n     disclosure, new prosecutor syndrome, tunnel vision, jumping \n     to conclusions, partisan mindsets. And I have testified \n     before this committee on those very issues. And so I made a \n     mistake. I apologized. I learned from it, and I have tried to \n     improve the justice system going forward.''\n\n  Some of my colleagues have also criticized Professor Bibas for a \nsingle article that he wrote but never published. This article endorsed \nlimited forms of corporal punishment as an alternative to lengthy \nprison sentences. But Professor Bibas reconsidered this idea soon after \ncompleting the article. He concluded that it was a bad idea and did not \npublish it. He completely disavowed the position in his book published \nshortly thereafter.\n  When asked about corporal punishment at his hearing, Professor Bibas \nstated:\n\n       It is wrong. It is not American. It is not something I \n     advocate. I categorically reject it.\n\n  Additionally, Professor Bibas's position on corporal punishment was \nwell-intended. He was motivated to address overly harsh and \nunproductively long prison sentences. As he said at his hearing, he \nwanted to offer an answer to the question, ``Is there some way, any \nway, we can avoid the hugely destructive effect [of imprisonment] both \non prisoners' own lives and on the families, the friends, the \ncommunities?''\n  In the time since Professor Bibas wrote the article, he has offered \nmore creative solutions to the disruptions caused by lengthy prison \nsentences. As an example, instead of suffering through forced \nindolence, prisoners could work and develop work-related skills in \nanticipation of their release from prison.\n  Professor Bibas's scholarship, as I have stated and quoted from, is a \ntestimony to his devotion to the rule of law and the notion of equal \njustice before the law. It is very clear that he cares very deeply \nabout how the criminal justice system impacts defendants, victims, \nfamilies, and entire communities. As you can tell, I am very confident \nthat Professor Bibas will make an excellent judge on the Third Circuit \nCourt of Appeals.\n  I yield the floor.", "turn": 7, "speaker": "Mr. GRASSLEY", "itemno": 12}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n\n\n                              North Korea\n", "turn": 8, "speaker": "The PRESIDING OFFICER", "itemno": 13}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "C000141", "text": "  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, President Trump will be leaving on a \nlengthy trip to Asia. He will be visiting Japan, the Republic of Korea, \nChina, the Philippines, and Vietnam. In each of those countries, we \nexpect that the No. 1 national security issue that will be talked about \nis North Korea.\n  North Korea's dangerous activities are certainly putting not only the \nregion but the global community at risk. They have a nuclear weapons \ncapability. They currently have the ability to explode a nuclear \ndevice. They are working on delivery systems that could very well reach \nnot just the region but the United States. They are violating \ninternational commitments. They have done dozens of tests this year \nalone, all in violation of those international commitments.\n  We have had a strong policy to try to isolate North Korea. The United \nStates has led in the imposition of sanctions. We introduced this year \nand passed the Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act. \nIt passed this body by a 98-to-2 vote. I notice the chairman of the \nSenate Foreign Relations Committee is on the floor, and he was one of \nthe strong architects of that legislation. The United Nations Security \nCouncil passed Resolutions Nos. 2270, 2321, and 2375. The President has \nissued Executive Order No. 13810.\n  We have been asking for rigorous enforcement of sanctions. We could \ndo more. One of the points I hope the President will be talking about \nduring his trip is robust and rigorous enforcement of the sanctions \nthat are out there. And I see there is activity taking place in the \nBanking Committee. We have legislation in the Senate Foreign Relations \nCommittee. If additional sanction authority is needed, let's do that. \nThat is important.\n  But what additional things can we do, and what should the President \nbe promoting as he visits Asia? First, let me give you a few \nunacceptable alternatives.\n  We cannot lead with military intervention. The casualties could be \nastronomical. The technology to develop nuclear weapons would still \nremain. Our allies are certainly not in agreement with that policy. \nThere is no congressional authority for the use of force.\n  A second alternative that is not acceptable is to just continue the \ncurrent course. North Korea is developing a delivery system that will \nthreaten not just Japan and the Republic of Korea but also Guam and the \nUnited States. We will see an arms race if we do not effectively stop \nNorth Korea's nuclear program.\n  President Trump's statement, in my view, made the challenges even \nmore dramatic. His ``America first'' statements isolate America and \nmake it more difficult for us to get the type of support we need. I \nthink his reckless statements make it more likely rather than less \nlikely that we will use a military option.\n  What we need is a surge in diplomacy. A surge in diplomacy can very \nwell start with the meeting between President Xi of China and President \nTrump of the United States. We have a\n\n\ncommon agenda. Neither China nor the United States want to see a \nnuclear North Korea. Both China and the United States recognize that \nthe Kim Jong Un regime in North Korea is unreliable. We are both \nlooking for an off-ramp so we don't need to use a military option.\n  China has the capacity to turn the pressure on North Korea through \nsanctions that could change the equation in North Korea. China and \nNorth Korea have a common agenda. Both want to preserve the regime of \nKim Jong Un--Kim Jong Un for obvious reasons; China, because they do \nnot want to see a unified Korean Peninsula under Western influence.\n  Our objective is for North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons. \nChina needs to be convinced that our objective is the same as theirs. \nWith that, they could instill greater pressure on North Korea, and \ndiplomacy could work.\n  What should be our objective? We have to be realistic. In the short \nterm, it should be containment. Freeze the current program. Stop the \ntesting. Make it clear that we cannot allow these programs to continue. \nUltimately, we want to see a nonnuclear Korean Peninsula.\n  We know that in the past--the 1994 framework agreement with North \nKorea lasted for 8 years. So there is an ability to make progress, but \nwe have to develop confidence between the parties.\n  In conjunction with this, let me urge us not to lose sight of the \nNorth Korean people. Let's continue our focus on the human rights \nproblems in the country. Let's work with our allies, particularly Japan \nand the Republic of Korea, and let's rigorously enforce the sanctions \nuntil progress is made.\n  We can achieve an alternative outcome in North Korea, but it requires \nU.S. leadership, and President Trump needs to engage on that issue. We \nneed confidence building, and we need to make sure that we make \nprogress. Time is not on our side, but there is still time to make \nprogress. Without a diplomatic surge, there are only unacceptable \noptions. Our goal should be a more peaceful, stable, and prosperous \nnortheast Asia community.\n  I yield the floor.", "turn": 9, "speaker": "Mr. CARDIN", "itemno": 14}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
