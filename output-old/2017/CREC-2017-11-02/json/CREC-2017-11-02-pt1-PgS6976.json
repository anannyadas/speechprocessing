{"content": [{"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "M000355", "text": "  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, on another matter, the Obama years were \nnot easy for America's middle class. For many, steady work became \nharder to find, paychecks stagnated, and opportunities faded. America's \nmiddle class deserves better after a decade of drift, and we are \nworking hard to deliver for them.\n  Tax reform is the single most important thing we can do today to get \nthe economy reaching for its true potential again. That is why the \nSenate recently passed the legislative tools to advance it. That is why \nthe House recently did the same. And because we did, later today, after \nmonths of hard work, the House's tax-writing committee will unveil its \nversion of tax reform legislation.\n  I commend Chairman Brady and the members of the Ways and Means \nCommittee for their hard work in unveiling this critical legislation \ntoday. This announcement is more positive momentum from our colleagues \nover in the House, and I look forward to continued work with them as we \nmove forward. Here in the Senate, the Finance Committee will continue \nits work on tax reform legislation as well.\n  Both Chambers are working on this at full steam because we are \ncommitted to achieving our mutual tax reform goals for the middle \nclass, working families, and small businesses. Our main goal is this: \nWe want to take more money out of Washington's pockets and put more in \nyours. This goal is shared by the American people, it is shared by the \nPresident and his team, and it is shared by Republicans in the House \nand in the Senate.\n  The goals of tax reform used to be shared by our Democratic \ncolleagues as well. Over many years, multiple Senate Democrats, \nincluding the Democratic leader himself, have called on Congress to \npass reform. But then something changed. It was the President who \nchanged, it seems.\n  Now we are reading reports that our friends across the aisle plan to \noppose any tax reform bill at all, regardless of what is in it. It \nseems that Democratic leadership is praying that this chance to put \nmore money in the pockets of the middle class will not succeed. But \nwhy? To protect incentives and encourage companies to ship jobs \noverseas? I thought they were against those. To prevent working \nfamilies from keeping more of what they earn? I assumed we were all for \nthat. According to recent news reporting, Democrats apparently want to \ntank tax cuts for the middle class because it might give them a \npolitical leg up. In other words, it seems that this is some kind of \ngame to them.\n  I certainly hope what we read is not true. I certainly hope Democrats \nwill take note of the fact that their latest false talking point about \ntax reform just got debunked today as well. This effort is way too \nimportant for any of that. I hope our friends will decide to work with \nour colleagues in a serious way instead. That is what their \nconstituents sent them here to do, and that is what their constituents \ndeserve after the last decade of economic disappointment. There is no \nreason for our Democratic friends not to work across the aisle in a \nserious way to help shape this critically important effort.\n  I thank Chairman Hatch and Chairman Brady for their commitment to tax \nreform and regular order. Through the committee process, Members on \nboth sides of the aisle will have the opportunity to offer input as the \ntax reform effort advances. Today's announcement is an important step \nforward for that process, as well as for our once-in-a-generation \nopportunity to fundamentally rethink our Tax Code and deliver real \nrelief. It has been 30 years since we did that. It is time to do it \nagain.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. McCONNELL", "itemno": 0}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
