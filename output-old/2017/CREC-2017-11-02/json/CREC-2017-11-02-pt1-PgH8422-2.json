Mr. Speaker, I rise today to discuss the importance of \nlife.\n  Thomas Jefferson famously wrote that every man has the right to \n``life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.'' I hold this quote near \nand dear because we must defend these rights. That is certainly true \nwith the right to life for a baby.\n  Last week, I met with Rachelle Heidelbaugh with Faith2Action. \nRachelle told me her story about when she chose life and how she has \ncontinued fighting for life through Faith2Action. Her story was truly \nmoving and pulled at the heartstrings. I couldn't help but give her a \nhug because her story is so meaningful and her efforts are truly saving \nlives.\n  While Rachelle visited, we talked about the Heartbeat bill. The \nHeartbeat bill would ensure that every unborn child with a heartbeat is \nprotected. We need to do whatever we can to protect life, and this bill \nwill allow us to keep on protecting unborn boys and girls.\n  Rachelle gave me the Heartbeat Bill Hero Award like many in this \nHouse have gotten. The award is this small token that I am proud to \ncarry because it represents thousands of lives that are being saved.\n  I will always stand up for a baby's right to life, and I hope my \ncolleagues will join me in supporting H.R. 490, the Heartbeat bill \nlegislation.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. ROKITA", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 3}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "178", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H8422", "wkday": "Thursday", "day": "2", "month": "November"}, "related_bills": [{"type": "HR", "context": "FIRSTPARAGRAPH", "congress": "115", "number": "490"}, {"type": "HR", "context": "OTHER", "congress": "115", "number": "490"}], "doc_title": "SUPPORTING THE HEARTBEAT BILL", "id": "CREC-2017-11-02-pt1-PgH8422-2"}
