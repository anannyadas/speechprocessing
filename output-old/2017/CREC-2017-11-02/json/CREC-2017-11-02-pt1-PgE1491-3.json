Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the \nretirement of Moises Loza.\n  Moises Loza grew up in South Texas in a migrant farmworker family. \nDuring his childhood, he traveled with his family throughout the South, \nMidwest and West coast in search of farm-work. His first-hand \nexperience of how hard families work to survive in this country is the \nperfect example of the families residing in Mississippi's Second \nCongressional District.\n  In fact, while Loza served as Executive Director of the Housing \nAssistance Council--a national nonprofit corporation that works to \nincrease the availability of decent housing for rural low-income \npeople--he ensured the organization provided technical assistance, \ntraining and research to assist with housing development for low-income \nand hard-working families residing in the lower Mississippi Delta. Loza \nalso serves in leadership roles on many housing related organizations.\n  Currently, he serves as chairman of the Rural Development Leadership \nNetwork and treasurer of the National Low Income Housing Coalition. He \nalso serves on the board of directors for the National Community \nReinvestment Coalition, the National Housing Conference, the National \nRural Housing Coalition, and the Morgan Stanley Advisory Committee.\n  His selfless work to provide housing opportunities for families in \nneed is something that we all should celebrate.\n  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing a great \npublic servant, Moises Loza, for his work to provide equal and fair \nhousing.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 3}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "178", "extension": true, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "E1491", "wkday": "Thursday", "day": "2", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "HONORING MOISES LOZA", "id": "CREC-2017-11-02-pt1-PgE1491-3", "title": "HONORING MOISES LOZA"}
