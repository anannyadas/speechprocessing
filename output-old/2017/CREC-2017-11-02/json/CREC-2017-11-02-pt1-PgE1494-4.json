Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Sergeant \nLarry Bush, United States Marine Corps. SGT Bush's extraordinary \ncommitment to his country, his community of Jarrell, Texas, and his \nservice in the Marine Corps reflects the best values of Central Texas. \nHe is a fitting recipient of a Congressional Veteran Commendation.\n  SGT Bush began his career in the Marine Corps by serving in the \nVietnam War in 1969. His deep commitment to serving his country can be \nseen through his extensive list of medals and awards, including the \nNational Defense Service Medal, Vietnam Campaign Medal, Vietnam Service \nMedal, and the Rifle Expert Badge.\n  After leaving the Marines in 1975, SGT Bush lived his life for the \nbetterment of Jarrell and its citizens. He served his community in the \nCity Council for six years, the Economic Development Board for two \nyears, and as Mayor of the City of Jarrell since 2014. His commitment \nto community doesn't stop with elected office. SGT Bush is a devoted \nmember of several advisory boards including water, roads and finances, \nas well as the Williamson County Road Bond Program. Committed public \nservants like him have made Jarrell a great place to live and work.\n  SGT Bush deserves to be celebrated, as he is a man of intelligence, \ncompassion, and integrity. With admiration and deep respect, I pay \ntribute to SGT Bush for his service to our country and the lasting \nimpact he has had on his community and beyond.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. CARTER of Texas", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 3}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "178", "extension": true, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "E1494", "wkday": "Thursday", "day": "2", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "HONORING SERGEANT LARRY BUSH, U.S. MARINE CORPS", "id": "CREC-2017-11-02-pt1-PgE1494-4", "title": "HONORING SERGEANT LARRY BUSH, U.S. MARINE CORPS"}
