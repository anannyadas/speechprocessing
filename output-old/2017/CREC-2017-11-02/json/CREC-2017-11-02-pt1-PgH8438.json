Mr. Speaker, our American way of life and our Judeo-\nChristian values are under attack as never before. People understand \nthat there is the threat out there, but perhaps the magnitude keeps \ncoming home of how bad and what a great threat it really is.\n  Radical Islamic terrorists with a backward, evil, 7th century view of \nthe world are out to destroy and kill us. They seek to terrorize \nWestern countries and Americans, in particular, into retreat.\n  Well, instead, we must stand tall. We must have the courage to do \nwhat is necessary because it does depend on us, as it always has been. \nAs when Nazism and Japanese militarism threatened the world, it was the \nUnited States that carried the day for the decent people of the world.\n  When communism threatened to establish atheistic dictatorships \nthroughout the world and was on the march, yes, it was the American \npeople who stood strong and had those policies necessary to hold off \nthe communist menace until it collapsed, basically, of its own \ninconsistencies and its own evil nature.\n  Well, we had great leadership at those other battles, and I say, \nthank goodness that today we now have a President who actually can \nspeak the words against and condemn this horrible force that threatens \nour country and the people of the world.\n  Yes, we have a President who can actually say those words, ``radical \nIslamic terrorism.'' For 8 years, we had a President who couldn't use \nthose words, much less do those things that were necessary to defeat \nthis threat and to make sure our people were secure.\n  Some, if not many, of our leaders have been afraid to confront the \nbasic nature of those who have made repeated terrorist attacks and \nassaults. Anyone who is not signing on to their fanatical religious \nagenda becomes a terrorist target, not only Christians, but Jews and \nother Muslims.\n  President Trump is, at long last, providing the courageous leadership \nin this historic battle. Congress needs to support our President. We \nneed to stand with him and to stand united against this evil, and yes, \ndefend ourselves. We must not be afraid, and we must not only defend \nourselves but also do what is necessary to defeat and extinguish this \nghoulish adversary and end his bloody assault on Western civilization, \nand yes, on moderate Islam.\n  Words are not enough. Our homeland is under attack; people are in \ndanger; our families, our country, and our way of life are under \nattack. These attackers come from many countries, both men and women. \nBut in common--these people who have been murdering people and the \nmayhem they have been creating throughout the Western world, whether it \nis in France or in the United States or elsewhere, these men and women \nwho participate in these evil acts of terrorism have something that \nthey have in common. They all pledge allegiance to radical Islam.\n  That is our enemy, not Islam, not Islam itself, but the radical \nfanaticism that terrorists and the Islamic psychopaths that are out \nthere murdering in the worst possible and ghoulish ways, people, in \norder to--yes, in order to have--to shock us and in order to intimidate \nthe West into retreat.\n  This week, a 29-year-old Uzbek immigrant plowed a truck into people \nwalking and cycling in a New York City pathway. He killed 8 people, and \nhe proclaimed that he was inspired by Islam. In fact, he said he was \nproud of what he had done and even requested the display of his Islamic \nstate flag in his hospital room.\n  We need to ask ourselves: Why are we allowing Islamic terrorists like \nthis into our country in the first place? How much longer will we close \nour eyes and bury our heads in the sand?\n  We have even witnessed horrendous terrorist attacks even in my home \nState. We know that. We have seen it. On December 2, 2015, in San \nBernardino, 14 innocent and wonderful people were brutally slaughtered \nand 22 seriously injured by an immigrant from Pakistan--a hotbed of \nradicalism. And yes, his motive was his fanatic belief in what he \nconsiders to be Islam. It was truly one of the most evil attacks in our \nState's history.\n  In Orlando, on June 12, 2016, 49 nightclubbers out having a good \ntime, enjoying themselves as Americans--life, liberty, and the pursuit \nof happiness--they were having a good time, and 49 of these \nnightclubbers were brutally murdered and mowed down.\n  All of these innocent lives were slaughtered. Americans who were \nblown apart at the Boston marathon is no different.\n  We have American victims staring us in the face saying: What are you \ngoing to do to bring justice and to protect the Americans that we left \nbehind, our families? These horrific crimes of cowards mirrors what has \nhappened to innocent people throughout the world.\n  Yes, we Americans are suffering. And as I say, we have seen it in \nFrance, we have seen it in Europe, we have seen it in Muslim countries \nwhere these fanatics take Christians out and behead them. But they \nalso, of course, attack moderate Muslims. They are out to try to topple \nthe government of el-Sisi and Egypt and all the other governments there \nthat are not committed to the fanatic view of Islam that they hold.\n  The most recent attacks in New York should, at least, open our eyes \nto things that we can do here. Maybe we can't stop it all over the \nworld, but the least we can do is to take steps to protect our own \ncitizens from this type of fanatical threat that hangs over us.\n  Well, we need to take specific steps that can and should be done to \nhelp deal with this danger. I have, in fact, discussed a plan with the \nPresident--and this is a few months ago--and we have had a lot of work \nand a lot of things under the bridge since then, but his commitment to \nborder security includes placing a wall on the Southern border.\n  Yes, making sure that we have border security, and yes, if it takes a \nwall on our Southern border, the President is right on target. A wall \nand beefing up our border will, of course, be expensive. That is why I \nlaid out a plan to the President and have since offered legislation \nthat would pay for President Trump's proposed border wall.\n\n  The car attack in New York has altered many Americans and alerted \nmany Americans to something they didn't know about before, and that is \nthat we have an immigration system, an immigration law that permits \n50,000 people to immigrate into our country every year--50,000 people \nwho are chosen by lottery, not by some really looking at them, some \nexamination of their credentials, seeing what they could contribute, \nno. A lottery.\n  And, of course, Senator Schumer in the Senate, I guess, was the man \nwho actually insisted on this. Well, I am sure he was well-intended, \nbut what we have now are people--instead of bringing in the people who \ncan most contribute to our country, he has insisted we leave 50,000 of \nthem up to a lottery system.\n\n\n  This is insanity. It is forced onto us and has been forced into \npolicy by liberal left politicians who would flood our country with \nillegals, which is something they are doing besides just this threat \nthat we are talking about, because these people who win the lottery, of \ncourse, are not coming here illegally.\n  At the same time, the same people who are pushing that type of system \nare pushing for policies that would flood our country with illegals and \nhas flooded our country with illegals, that has brought down our \nhealthcare system, our education system. We brought criminals into our \ncountry, and we have had an uncontrolled border.\n  Yes, the people who are responsible for that have also been \nresponsible for policy that just permitted 50,000 people legally to \ncome here; and those 50,000 people are people not selected by a \nrational process but instead by a lottery.\n  The terrorist murderers in New York, of course, were here. That \nterrorist murderer, and maybe murderers, they were here on the lottery \nvisa. They weren't here because they had been selected. In fact, the \nlottery selected this Uzbeki fanatic Muslim, and he didn't have the \nskills and the education necessary to live a decent life, and he ended \nup killing a lot of people in New York. Surprise, surprise.\n  We should know about these people who are coming into our country, \nperiod, whether those people are coming illegally. We have had millions \nof people pouring into our country illegally, and then what do our \nliberal left politicians on the other side say? ``Oh, we need sanctuary \ncities to protect them, the ones who are here illegally and have come \nhere illegally,'' which, of course, does nothing but encourage more \npeople to come here illegally. And the more who are here illegally are \npeople who we don't know what they are all about.\n  Do you think the fanatic Islamic terrorists that I am referring to \ntoday didn't notice that our border was porous and that people were \npouring across our border from our Southern border?\n  Well, we should know about everybody who is coming into the country, \nand we should choose the very best people who can contribute to our \ncountry. I have no problem with a very robust legal immigration into \nour country, no problem at all, and neither do the Republicans that I \nknow.\n  What we have a problem with is a flood of illegals coming in, bidding \ndown the wages of our own citizens, some of them criminals attacking \nand killing the citizens like we saw in San Francisco--a young lady who \nwas killed by an illegal who had been sent home. But also, even within \nthe system that is legal immigrants, we need to know who those people \nare and select the very best people to come here.\n  The plan that I offered the President, which will make it easier for \nhim to accomplish this mission, is a plan that would take that slot in \nour lottery, 50,000 people who now come in under a lottery like the guy \nwho just killed those people in New York, instead, let's use that slot, \nthose 50,000 places in our legal immigration system and offer it to \nforeigners who are very wealthy, who can be given the privilege of \npaying $1 million each to come here and eventually become a citizen.\n  If we can do that, that $1 million and those 50,000 slots will give \nus all the money we need to build that wall, and it is fitting that we \nbuild that wall and we secure our borders and beef up our system of \nimmigration to protect our citizens, and that we actually have people \nwho want to come here and immigrate here pay for that reform.\n  We need to implement immigration policies that serve the American \npeople. That is what should be first and foremost, not some crazy \nnotion that we are going to, oh, build--get some kind of better spirit \nby opening up the immigration into our country to anybody who can get \nhere, and let's let a lottery decide, let's not do it rationally. No.\n  We need to make sure everybody who comes here is going to contribute, \nand they are good people. Unless we can all stand together--and the \nmost important thing is they are coming here because they want to be \nAmericans, like almost all the legal immigrants who come here, people \nwho want to be Americans, and we will open our arms, as we have, and as \nRepublicans who are opposed to illegal immigration have said over and \nover again.\n  Well, I have proposed H.R. 2724, and I call on President Trump to pay \nattention to this. I call all of my colleagues to pay attention to \nthis. I urge my colleagues to take a look at that legislation. That \nwill offer us the financial resources we need to bolster our borders, \nto make sure that there is a wall, but, also, to make sure that we are \nnot bringing into this country people who are associated with radical \nIslamic fanaticism that would do us harm.\n  I am asking my colleagues to look at that legislation. I am asking \nanyone who is reading the Congressional Record or listening to this, \nperhaps, to talk to their Congressman on this issue.\n  Now, in the past 2 weeks, we have been provided information on \nanother issue that I would like to bring up.

Mr. Speaker, I will try to bring up something that \nwe have heard, and we need to discuss this as Americans, because it \nalso is about a very major flaw in our system that is apparent, things \nthat have been not right for the last 2 years.\n  In the past 2 weeks, however, information has been provided to the \nAmerican people that has exposed the hypocrisy and misinformation, \nforced down our throats, for months concerning the allegation that \nPresident Trump colluded with the Russians in order to steal the last \nelection. Over and over again, fake news filled the airwaves and, of \ncourse, the newspapers, suggesting that there was a sinister plot that \nkept Hillary from becoming President of the United States.\n  The core accusation was the Russians had hacked into the Democratic \nNational Committee computers. Emails between the Democratic leaders \nwere taken and handed over to Julian Assange, who is the head of \nWikiLeaks, and that they were released to the public by WikiLeaks.\n  The skulduggery of the Democrat leadership and the Clinton campaign \nwas, thus, exposed by these emails. Yes, that exposure to this \nskulduggery and this unconscionable activity between the Clinton \nleadership, and also the Democratic Party leadership, these emails, \nyes, did have an impact on the election, as many Democrats who \nsupported Bernie Sanders felt that they had been cheated by their own \nparty because the proof was being offered to them by these WikiLeaks \nemails that had been taken from the Democratic National Committee.\n  Now, we heard over and over again that Trump stole the election \nbecause he was in collusion with the Russians. The lib-left media, \nwhich is most of them, found every which way, any little thing that any \nmember of the Trump team did, as sinister proof that there was \ncollusion with the Russians, thus, they stole the election. Well, it \nwas pounded into our heads month after month, even after the election \nwas over.\n  But Hillary didn't lose that. That is what we are being told. Hillary \nlost the election. She didn't want us to believe that it was because \nshe was a rotten candidate running on a miserable track record and a \nplatform that undermined her own candidacy, but, instead, she lost \nbecause the GOP had subterfuge and treachery in which they were working \nwith Russians, who helped them out to accomplish this horrible crime of \nstealing the election.\n  Well, this negative media barrage and this continued attack on \nPresident Trump did not stop when the election was over. It went on for \nmonths and months. Everybody should remember that. Month after month \nafter the election, in what appeared to be, in my point of view, an \neffort to disrupt our new President's authority and to exercise powers \ngranted to him by the American voters, that was going to be disrupted, \nso he could not become a regular President of the United States, as our \nelection process had determined. Talk about not being loyal to the \nAmerican way of life.\n  After months of these obstructionist tactics, the American people are \nnow learning the whole truth. They are learning that the attack on \nTrump was\n\n\na total fraud, a power grab by those who lost the election, and an \nattempt to distract the American people from this wrongdoing.\n  First and foremost, let's make it clear: the Russians did not hack \ninto and steal the Democratic National Committee's emails. In terms of \nthe collusion with the Russians, it is now coming to light there are \nfar worse things. But the stealing of those emails and then making them \npublic--and, by the way, they were just making public honest emails. We \nare not talking about giving the public false information. We are \ntalking about giving them information the Democrats didn't want them to \nhave.\n  But in terms of collusion with the Russians, what is coming to light \nis that the Clinton Foundation--so these other charges that we have \nheard about President Trump may be something to distract us about \nsomething that was being done that was wrong and, of a similar light, \nthat was wrong and being done by Hillary Clinton and her family.\n  In terms of collusion with the Russians, it has come to light that \nthe Clinton Foundation collected more than or around $150 million from \nRussian oligarchs that Clinton felt was deposited right into the \nClinton Foundation coffers. These oligarchs then deposited $500,000 \nright into the Clinton family's pockets for a speech. Yeah, they are \ngoing to give them a speaker's fee of $500,000 for one speech. All of \nthis was happening when Hillary was Secretary of State. It was also \nhappening when our government was making a decision as to whether they \nshould sell 20 percent of America's uranium reserves to Russia. Why we \nwould never seriously consider that, I don't know.\n  But in my research, I have found evidence that, because that did not \nseem right, the FBI had an informant watching all of this go down, \nclose up, right there in Russia--an informant. Instead of charging \nHillary with a crime, which was not done by the FBI, a gag order was \nplaced on this witness who was working as an informer for the FBI.\n  That gag order at the time, who put it on this witness?\n  Well, it was the head of the FBI.\n  Who was the head of the FBI?\n  Robert Mueller. That gag order was kept on by Mueller, the gag order \non the informant that had this information about the negotiations for \ncontributions to the Clinton fund of $150 million. This guy was kept, \nand a gag order, all of this time, even while Mueller was head of the \nFBI. This is the same Mueller who is now the special prosecutor trying \nto find anything to charge Trump with collusion with the Russians.\n  That gag order over the witness implicating Hillary was not lifted \nuntil last week, when some of us stepped up and said: We have to have a \npublic hearing on this and we need to make sure--not a public hearing \non any type of negative or, let's say, illegal collusion with the \nRussian Government by any American politician, which would have \nincluded Hillary, of course, and will include Hillary and anybody else \nwho colluded with them.\n\n  Yes, I know, that I have advanced the idea of cooperating with the \nRussians, so this may seem out of place. But I have always felt \nwhatever we do with the Russians needs to be what is in the interest of \nthe people of the United States. Certainly giving away 20 percent of \nAmerica's uranium reserves, and then gagging one of the witnesses to \nthe discussions that were taking place at the time when, at the same \ntime, oligarchs in Russia were providing the Clintons with $150 million \ndonation to their foundation, and a $500,000 donation right into the \npersonal pockets of Bill Clinton.\n  Now, we need to move forward on this. As we know, the special \nprosecutor, Mr. Mueller, who kept the gag order on this witness, who \ndidn't charge Hillary in the beginning, now has found someone to \nindict. Paul Manafort has been indicted.\n  Isn't this interesting?\n  Our special prosecutor was tasked with trying to see if there was \nRussian collusion in the last election between the Trump people and the \nRussians in order to steal the election. And what did he come up with?\n  Basically, tax evasion by Paul Manafort, who is a longtime politico \nin this city.\n  And guess what. The tax evasion he is being charged with happened \nlong before Paul Manafort had anything to do with Donald Trump. That is \nwrong. That is wrong. There is something really wrong there. We need to \nget a new special prosecutor or whatever. We need to have these \nhearings. Our Republicans need to get tough and we need to make sure \nthat we are seeking out this information and documenting it.\n  For example, putting the people under oath. There were a group of \npeople--policymakers--who made the decision of whether or not to sell \nthat uranium to the Russians. They need to be put under oath and asked \nwhether or not anyone representing the Clintons ever talked to them \nduring that process and encouraged them for this deal of selling the \nRussians this uranium.\n  There are all kinds of avenues that we need to follow through on. \nInstead, Mr. Mueller ends up with some kind of a tax violation by one \nof the players that happened long before he was even associated with \nDonald Trump.\n  Something has gone haywire here. The American people need to see it. \nEspecially when we understand now there is also evidence that during \nthat election, the Clinton campaign paid Russian sources--it went \nthrough an intermediary. He was an English intelligence officer--paid \nmillions of dollars to the Russians to get a scurrilous false report \nand video, or tape, or whatever it was, of President Trump in some type \nof compromising situation.\n  But we know now that was false and that Hillary Clinton's campaign \nand these people talking about collusion with the Russians were paying, \nessentially, the Russians to give them this information.\n  Now, I would hope that this comes out and this becomes something that \nis explained and the American people understand. When they see this \nattack on our President by people who have a totally different view of \nhow we should be in the world--remember, our last President could not \nsay the words ``radical Islamic terrorist.'' He had a different \napproach than Hillary, the Secretary of State. We know what happened in \nBenghazi and elsewhere. We have a totally different approach to these \nchallenges America faces overseas. It is all right.\n  President Obama was elected. Hillary was not elected. President Trump \nwas elected. These efforts to undermine his authority are the worst \nkind of repudiation of the American way of life and the American system \nof government. We Americans must stand firm against radical Islam. We \nmust stand firm and offer an alternative of strength and courage, as \ncompared to the cowardice and nonsense that we have seen in the \npolicies of the last 8 years.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n", "turn": 3, "speaker": "Mr. ROHRABACHER", "itemno": 5}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 6}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "178", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H8438-H8440", "wkday": "Thursday", "day": "2", "month": "November"}, "related_bills": [{"type": "HR", "context": "OTHER", "congress": "115", "number": "2724"}], "doc_title": "ISSUES OF CONCERN", "id": "CREC-2017-11-02-pt1-PgH8438"}
