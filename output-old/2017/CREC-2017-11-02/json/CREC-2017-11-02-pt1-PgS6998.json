Mr. President, today I wish to honor Susie McMurry.\n  On November 10, 2017, the Greater Wyoming Council of the Boy Scouts \nof America will hold their annual ``Strength of America Banquet'' and \ncelebrate Susie McMurry, a remarkable Wyoming philanthropist. Every \nyear at this event, the council honors an individual who made \ninvaluable contributions to the community and demonstrates the values \nof the Scout oath and law.\n  Susie McMurry is a perfect choice to receive this special \nrecognition. She is a role model in our community and truly represents \na spirit of citizenship, leadership, and service. Throughout her life, \nSusie has always demonstrated an enduring devotion to God, her family, \nand Wyoming. She loves her family. She loves her home State of Wyoming. \nShe loves her country.\n  She truly exemplifies the Scout promise ``to help other people at all \ntimes.'' Should an opportunity arise to improve the life of a child, \nSusie is the first to offer her assistance, time, and resources. Susie \nstrongly supports programs for children that focus on mentoring, \ndeveloping leadership skills, encouraging community service, and \nbuilding self-esteem. She believes ``Children are the sunshine in our \nlives. If we don't take care of our children, our world will be without \nsunshine.''\n  Her parents raised her with a deep understanding of the importance of \ngiving back. While growing up, her parents always lent a helping hand \nand opened their homes to individuals in need. Throughout her life, she \nhas tried to follow their example. For nearly 30 years, she and her \nhusband, Mick McMurry, were foster parents. They provided a safe and \ncaring home for hundreds of children in Wyoming.\n  Susie is a strong, compassionate, and caring woman. In 1946, she was \nborn in Casper at Memorial Hospital of Natrona County. She called both \nElk Mountain and Hanna home before eventually moving to Casper. Susie \ndiscovered her calling to help children early in life. She studied \nelementary education at Casper College and the University of Wyoming. \nAfter graduation, she returned to Casper and taught first grade at \nCrest Hill Elementary School.\n  She met her husband of 41 years, Mick McMurry, in Casper. On December \n21, 1973, Susie and Mick McMurry were married in Glenrock, WY. A few \nyears later, they adopted their daughter, Trudi, and Susie retired from \nteaching. In 1979, Susie and Mick became foster parents. Their second \ndaughter, Jillian, was adopted from the foster program. Susie has eight \ngrandchildren: Lou Davis, Tayla Davis, Tillie Holthouse, Ellie \nHolthouse, Evie Kaschmitter, Lily Kaschmitter, Max Kaschmitter, and \nAndrew Kaschmitter. She also has one great-grandchild, Neil Campbell. \nIn 2015, Susie, the McMurry family, Casper, and the State of Wyoming \nmourned the loss of her husband, Mick. Susie's compassion and strength \ncontinues to guide her family and our community.\n  The McMurry family has a remarkable history of helping people across \nthe State of Wyoming. Susie explained, ``One of our goals is to teach \nthe younger generation how to give back, how to participate, and love \nmaking a difference.'' Mick and Susie established the McMurry \nFoundation in 1998 with a mission to make a significant and beneficial \nimpact on the lives of others. Guided by the values of excellence and \ncompassion, the foundation has awarded more than $50 million since it \nwas established. It focuses on education, religion, children and \nadvocacy for children, health and human resources, the arts and \nhumanities, and favorable business environments.\n  Buildings across the State bear the McMurry name as a mark of \ngratitude for their wonderful support. The number of places in Wyoming \nthat have benefited from the contributions of the McMurry family is \nincredible, but one organization especially dear to Susie is the \nWyoming Medical Center. Susie has spent a tremendous number of\n\n\nhours volunteering her time and talents to the benefit of everyone who \ncomes through the doors. She feels that the health of a community is \ndirectly tied to the health of its people.\n  The values that Susie and the McMurry Foundation promote go hand in \nhand with the mission of the Boy Scouts of America. They both work to \nensure youth have the knowledge and skills needed to become future \nleaders of Wyoming. Their continued focus on education, leadership, and \ncommunity service will serve these young people and our State for \ngenerations.\n  Susie's kindness, generosity, and grace are true reflections of her \ncharacter. She believes that fulfillment in life comes from making a \ndifference in the lives of others. Whether it is volunteering at the \nWyoming Medical Center to support patients and families or raising \nfunds for the Boys and Girls Club of Central Wyoming, she has made a \nhuge difference in the lives of so many people. Susie continues to have \na positive and lasting mark on our community.\n  It is with great honor that I recognize this exceptional member of \nour Wyoming community. My wife, Bobbi, joins me in extending our \ncongratulations to Susie McMurry for receiving this honorable \ndistinction.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. BARRASSO", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "Senate", "num": "178", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "S6998-S6999", "wkday": "Thursday", "day": "2", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "TRIBUTE TO SUSIE McMURRY", "id": "CREC-2017-11-02-pt1-PgS6998", "title": null}
