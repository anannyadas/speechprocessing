Mr. Speaker, I consider it a great privilege to recognize \nSt. Peter's Evangelical Lutheran Church--located in Allentown, \nPennsylvania--on the occasion of its 175th anniversary.\n  In 1842, St. Peter's Union Congregation organized and purchased a \ntract of land for a physical building and cemetery in what was formerly \nknown as Rittersville. On November 5th, the Lutheran sect of the \ncongregation began conducting services in the new building; however, \nboth the Lutheran and Reformed congregations shared the meeting space, \nholding alternating services. The surrounding area was mostly comprised \nof German and Dutch immigrants, many of whom worked at nearby Bethlehem \nSteel Mill. The United States offered them a chance of a new life, and \nSt. Peter's served as a focal point for a community of shared faith and \nfamily ethics.\n  Until 1897, the services were primarily conducted in German, but soon \nafter, the Church purchased an English pulpit Bible. That same year, \nelectric lights were installed, indicating an embrace of modernity as \nthe Church entered the new century.\n  On June 29, 1913, St. Peter's Evangelical Lutheran Church placed the \ncornerstone for the current church at 1933 Hanover Avenue in Allentown. \nThe first service was held on November 2nd.\n  As St. Peter's Evangelical Lutheran Church celebrates its 175th \nanniversary as a congregation and its 104th anniversary in its current \nbuilding, the Church continues to serve the east side of Allentown and \nits ever changing neighborhood. May the next 175 years bring continued \ncongregational growth, community impact, and diligent ministry.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. DENT", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 3}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "178", "extension": true, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "E1499", "wkday": "Thursday", "day": "2", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "CELEBRATING THE 175TH ANNIVERSARY OF ST.
