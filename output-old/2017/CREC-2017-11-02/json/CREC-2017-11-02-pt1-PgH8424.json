Mr. Speaker, for weeks we have heard that \nthe partisan tax plan crafted behind closed doors might include the \nelimination of the deduction for families' State and local income \ntaxes. Today the rumors became reality. The tax plan announced today \nwould drastically reduce the State and local tax deduction.\n  Let me be as clear as I can be. This proposal is a tax increase on \nmiddle class families, and I oppose it. Working people in my State \nalready send more dollars to the Federal Government in taxes than they \nreceive back in support. For every dollar we send to Washington from \nConnecticut, we receive back just 83 cents. By attacking the State and \nlocal deduction, this tax plan would make life even harder for real \npeople in my district.\n  A senior citizen in Simsbury, Connecticut, called me to say that she \nmight lose her home if this tax deduction is taken away from her. \nSeniors who live on a fixed income shouldn't have to risk losing a roof \nover their head just so that Congress can cut the corporate tax rate.\n  Families who are already struggling to pay their bills, put their \nkids through college, and buy their first home shouldn't have to suffer \nin order to cut taxes for the wealthiest Americans.\n  The President promised that tax reform would help our middle class \nand would bring jobs back. It is doing neither.\n  I urge my colleagues to support keeping the State and local \ndeduction.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Ms. ESTY of Connecticut", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "178", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H8424", "wkday": "Thursday", "day": "2", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "SUPPORTING THE STATE AND LOCAL TAX DEDUCTION", "id": "CREC-2017-11-02-pt1-PgH8424", "title": "SUPPORTING THE STATE AND LOCAL TAX DEDUCTION"}
