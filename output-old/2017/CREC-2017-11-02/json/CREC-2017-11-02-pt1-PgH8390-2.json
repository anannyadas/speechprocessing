Madam Speaker, our veterans represent one of the \nmost highly skilled workforces in American history--the product of \nrigorous training, an ironclad commitment to teamwork, and the \nremarkable ability to succeed where others might fail. It is no wonder \nthat veterans are 45 percent more likely to be self-employed than \nnonveterans. In total, veteran-owned businesses make up nearly 10 \npercent of all businesses in the United States and account for more \nthan $1 trillion in business receipts every year.\n  One of those businesses is Navmar Applied Sciences Corporation, based \nin Warrington. Owned by Air Force veteran Tom Fenerty, Navmar engineers \ntechnology to make sure that our military has the best tools possible \nto complete any mission. Tom has also committed to employing veterans \nin the community. I am privileged to represent Tom and others like him \nin Congress.\n  In honor of their service--both in uniform and as part of our \neconomy--I am proud to recognize the importance of veteran-owned small \nbusinesses in our community by introducing and supporting H. Res. 588, \nwhich recognizes National Veterans Small Business Week this week, from \nOctober 30 to November 3.\n  Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues--and all Americans--to join me in \nsupporting the veteran-owned small businesses in our community.\n\n\n                       National Obesity Care Week\n", "turn": 1, "speaker": "Mr. FITZPATRICK", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "F000466", "text": "  Mr. FITZPATRICK. Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize National \nObesity Care Week and the over 90 million adult Americans living with \nobesity. National Obesity Care Week is recognized during the first week \nof November, when individuals and organizations from across the country \nraise awareness about the serious chronic disease of obesity.\n  Leading medical organizations, including the American Medical \nAssociation, the Obesity Society, the American Academy of Family \nPhysicians, the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists, and \nthe World Obesity Federation, all recognize obesity as a disease and \nthe belief that it should be treated as such.\n  National Obesity Care Week aims to advance an evidence-based \nunderstanding of obesity and widespread access to respectful, \ncomprehensive, and appropriate care. Obesity is a complex disease, \nlinked to over 50 disorders, including type 2 diabetes, hypertension, \nand cardiovascular disease. Over $1.4 trillion is spent in the U.S. on \ndirect and indirect costs for health-related conditions related to \nobesity each year.\n\n  This must change, Madam Speaker. It is time for action, and I commit \nto being part of the solution to improve care for obesity. I urge my \nfellow Members to join me in recognizing obesity as a serious, chronic \ndisease and working towards improving access to evidence-based tools \nfor chronic weight management.\n", "turn": 2, "speaker": "Mr. FITZPATRICK", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 3}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "178", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H8390", "wkday": "Thursday", "day": "2", "month": "November"}, "related_bills": [{"type": "HRES", "context": "FIRSTPARAGRAPH", "congress": "115", "number": "588"}, {"type": "HRES", "context": "OTHER", "congress": "115", "number": "588"}], "doc_title": "VETERAN-OWNED SMALL BUSINESSES", "id": "CREC-2017-11-02-pt1-PgH8390-2"}
