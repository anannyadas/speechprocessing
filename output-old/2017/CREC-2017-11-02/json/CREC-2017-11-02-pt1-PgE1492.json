Mr. Speaker, I rise to pay tribute to Scott Rasmussen, \nan important member of my team for many years who will be leaving my \noffice after this week to travel and pursue his varied interests.\n  Scott is a native Californian who graduated from Brown University in \n2010, then returned to the Bay Area where he worked in the areas of law \nand technology. I was soon fortunate to have him join my campaign team, \nwhere he demonstrated the confidence, intellectual curiosity, \ndiligence, and political instincts that have served him so well over \nthe years I have known him--and which I am sure will continue to bring \nhim success in the future.\n  Scott helped to form the initial core of my congressional staff in \n2013, showing a willingness to pitch in and cover any topic that was \nthrown to him, from answering phones to tackling policy questions. Over \nthe ensuing years, Scott has taken on new roles and regularly delivered \nresults for my constituents and the planet. Notable successes include \nthe passage of the Point Reyes Coast Guard Housing Conveyance Act, \nwhich will allow a former property in West Marin to be repurposed as \naffordable housing and community space, and his work on our successful \nbipartisan effort to strike a nearly half-century old congressional \nearmark that cost taxpayers millions of dollars each year to ship \nPennsylvania coal 3,000 miles to American bases in Germany.\n  With diligence and finesse, Scott has helped to develop a number of \nkey legislative initiatives, and his intellect and maturity have \nallowed me to entrust him with sensitive foreign policy matters as \nwell. Major projects have included my work to expand broadband access \nto rural communities, and our ongoing efforts to make sure that \nhomeowners are protected from an unexpected tax bill when they work to \nreduce water use. Finally, he has worked on the tribal policy portfolio \nthat is a priority in my office, helping to devise several complex and \nmeaningful bills for the tribal members I represent.\n  For six years I have had the benefit of Scott's good work, and I am \ndeeply appreciative. Along with my family and my staff, I wish Scott \nthe best of luck as he moves on the next phase of his career.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. HUFFMAN", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 3}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "178", "extension": true, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "E1492", "wkday": "Thursday", "day": "2", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "HONORING SCOTT RASMUSSEN", "id": "CREC-2017-11-02-pt1-PgE1492", "title": "HONORING SCOTT RASMUSSEN"}
