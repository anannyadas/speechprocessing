Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to pay tribute to a living \nlegend: my friend and colleague, Congressman Sam Johnson.\n  Recently, we had the opportunity to honor him by renaming the Texas \nTech University Vietnam Archive as the Sam Johnson Vietnam Archive.\n  Nobody in the United States Congress enjoys more esteem from his \ncolleagues, on both sides of the aisle, than Sam Johnson.\n  His legacy of service is awe-inspiring. Twenty-nine years in the \nUnited States Air Force, combat missions in Korea and Vietnam. Nearly 7 \nyears as a POW, roughly 3 of those years in solitary confinement.\n  There are many forces in politics that pull us from pillar to post, \nand many interests that compete for our time and attention. There is \none force that drives this man--it is his desire to fight for the \nfuture of this country. And there is only one interest, and that is \nonly what is in the best interest of all Americans.\n  I am grateful to Texas Tech for honoring Congressman Johnson's \nservice and sacrifice, and I am proud of the example Sam has set for \nall of us who serve in the people's House.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. ARRINGTON", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "178", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H8394", "wkday": "Thursday", "day": "2", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "TRIBUTE TO CONGRESSMAN SAM JOHNSON", "id": "CREC-2017-11-02-pt1-PgH8394-4", "title": "TRIBUTE TO CONGRESSMAN SAM JOHNSON"}
