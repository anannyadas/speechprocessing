Mr. Speaker, House Resolution 601 provides for the \nconsideration of a critical bill to provide health insurance and \nhealthcare to millions of underprivileged children. This package, which \nincludes two separate bills: H.R. 3922, the Community Health And \nMedical Professional Improves Our Nation, CHAMPION, Act of 2017; and \nH.R. 3921, the Healthy Kids Act. This was reported out of the Committee \non Energy and Commerce after lengthy deliberation and negotiation and a \nlengthy markup.\n  The rule provides for 1 hour of debate, equally divided and \ncontrolled by the chair and the ranking member of the Committee on \nEnergy and Commerce.\n  The rule adopts an amendment from the chairman of the Energy and \nCommerce Committee, modified by a second amendment by the same author, \ncombining the two bills into the package on the floor today.\n  Further, the rule waives all points of order and makes in order no \nfurther amendments to the legislation. However, the minority is \nafforded the customary motion to recommit.\n  The congressionally appropriated stream of funding for the Children's \nHealth Insurance Program expired at the end of September. Funding for \nother important public health programs, such as community health \ncenters, the National Health Service Corps, and Teaching Health Center \nGraduate Medical Education, also expired at the end of September.\n  While every State that receives Federal funding through these \nprograms continues to have adequate dollars to maintain health \ninsurance for every enrolled child, several States are beginning to \nexhaust their unspent 2017 funds and redistributed funds from the \nCenter for Medicare and Medicaid Services. With November now upon us, \nwaiting any longer will only put more\n\n\npressure on those States to begin sending notifications to children and \nfamilies that they are losing their coverage for those programs; so it \nis important that we reauthorize funding for the Children's Health \nInsurance Program and other programs now.\n  H.R. 3922, the CHAMPIONING HEALTHY KIDS Act, will achieve that \nimportant task. It is essential to our efforts to ensuring that these \nprograms continue to meet the healthcare needs of children and families \nwho have come to rely upon them.\n  Today, more than 8 million low-income children across our country \ndepend on the Children's Health Insurance Program for many of their \nhealthcare services. These include routine doctor visits, \nimmunizations, prescription medicines, and dental care. Through \nflexible, capped allotments to the States, the program has been able to \nsuccessfully support these children, while providing States with \nopportunities to tailor their respective programs as best meet the \nneeds of their respective populations.\n  The CHAMPIONING HEALTHY KIDS Act would extend CHIP for another 5 \nyears, which is the longest extension since its inception in 1996. An \nextension through fiscal year 2022 will provide financial stability for \nevery State's CHIP program and certainty for those children and their \nfamilies who are covered. Additionally, ensuring coverage for CHIP-\neligible children will make them less likely to have to enroll in \nMedicaid or ObamaCare.\n  This bill also contains and maintains a provision under the \nAffordable Care Act that provided 23 percent increased matching for 2 \nyears; then that draws down to an increase of 11.5 percent matching in \nthe third year; and then, finally, provides funding at pre-ACA levels \nfor the final 2 years.\n  These funding levels will provide the States enough time to plan \ntheir budgets before returning to the regular CHIP matching rates, \nthereby restoring the fiscally responsible Federal-State Medicaid \npartnership.\n  While reauthorizing CHIP funding is the primary focal point of this \nlegislation, the CHAMPIONING HEALTHY KIDS Act also includes other \nimportant provisions relating to our Nation's healthcare. The bill \nprovides a 2-year extension of funding for Federally Qualified Health \nCenters, community health centers.\n  One in thirteen individuals nationwide relies upon a community health \ncenter to receive healthcare services. The Community Health Center Fund \nplays an important role in supplementing the services that Federally \nQualified Health Centers are able to deliver to underserved communities \nby providing care to all Americans, regardless of income or ability to \npay.\n  Funding for the Teaching Health Center Graduate Medical Education \nprogram is also extended for another 2 years.\n  The legislation includes a 2-year extension of other important health \nprograms, including funding for the National Health Service Corps, \nFamily-to-Family Health Information Centers, the Youth Empowerment \nProgram, the Personal Responsibility Education Program, the Special \nDiabetes Program for Type 1 Diabetes, and the Special Diabetes Program \nfor American Indians.\n  In addition to the important funding streams addressed in this bill, \nthe Committee on Energy and Commerce incorporated a way to help our \nNation's territories in a time of need following recent natural \ndisasters. The bill includes more than $1 billion for the Medicaid \nprograms in both Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. This funding \nshould assist our territories in providing care for their populations \nwho have faced substantial devastation from Hurricanes Irma and Maria.\n  The Medicare funding issue is unique to Puerto Rico and the United \nStates citizens living in the territories. This was a problem that \npredated the hurricanes, but it was exacerbated by the devastation that \nthe storm brought to the islands. Without a legislative fix from \nCongress, this will be an ongoing and festering problem until it is \nproperly addressed, and the bill before us today begins to do just \nthat.\n\n\n  Additionally, the bill delays the $5 billion in cuts to many of the \nhospitals across the country from the Affordable Care Act-mandated \nMedicaid disproportionate share hospital reductions for fiscal years \n2018 and 2019. I am sure that many of my colleagues have heard from \nhospitals in their districts whose ability to remain operational and to \ncontinue to provide care could be jeopardized by these payment cuts.\n  These cuts are offset in future years, adding an additional $6 \nbillion in reductions in fiscal year 2021, 2022, and 2023. This delays \nbut does not fix a problem that ObamaCare created for safety net \nhospitals. It is one which we will have to revisit, but it delays the \ncuts that have already been affected by current law and protects these \nsafety net hospitals which provide care to the neediest citizens in our \ncountry.\n  Not only does the CHAMPIONING HEALTHY KIDS Act reauthorize funding \nfor essential health programs, the bill is fully offset. It will not \nadd to the national debt. The Committee for a Responsible Federal \nBudget called this a ``responsible health package,'' noting that the \n$18 billion cost of the bill is fully offset with savings beyond the \n10-year budget window.\n  One of the ways that costs are offset was to alter the qualified \nhealth plan grace period so that it would align with State law grace \nperiod requirements. This involved changing, in the Affordable Care \nAct, the grace period for subsidized individuals from 90 days to 30 \ndays unless a State specifically allows otherwise.\n  It also redirected $6.4 million from the Prevention and Public Health \nFund to help pay for the legislation. This fund is required by law to \nreceive $2.5 billion in annual appropriations which must be used for \nprevention, wellness, and public health initiatives administered by the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services. If Congress--let me say it \nagain--if Congress does not direct these funds toward specific efforts, \nthe Secretary of Health and Human Services has the authority to spend \nthe funds however he or she deems fit.\n  While we are redirecting these taxpayer dollars, the overarching \npurpose of the funding is still to improve the health and wellness of \nAmericans through existing mechanisms, and community health centers \nwill do just that.\n  We allow for certain wealthy Medicare beneficiaries with individual \nincomes of over $500,000 to pay increased premiums in order to offset \nsome of the cost of authorizing these programs. These beneficiaries \nwill be subject to higher premiums, thereby increasing their overall \ncost, but still their cost will be lower than if they purchased \ninsurance on the exchange.\n  The CHAMPIONING HEALTHY KIDS Act is a fiscally responsible way to \nfund some of our Nation's most important public health programs. The \nbill would ensure continued access to care for children and individuals \nwho rely on the programs for vital healthcare services.\n  Mr. Speaker, this is a good bill. Mr. Speaker, these offsets are \nreasonable. For these reasons, I encourage my colleagues to support \ntoday's rule and support the underlying bill, and I reserve the balance \nof my time.", "turn": 5, "speaker": "Mr. BURGESS", "itemno": 9}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "S000480", "text": "  Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume, and I thank the gentleman for yielding me the customary 30 \nminutes.\n  Mr. Speaker, 33 days ago, funding for the Children's Health Insurance \nProgram, which 9 million children rely on for their healthcare and \nwell-being, expired after the program was allowed to lapse. States \ncrafted budgets, assuming Federal CHIP funding would arrive on time as \nit has always done, and they are now scrambling to develop a patchwork \nsolution to keep the program alive.\n  Six States and the District of Columbia have warned they will run out \nof funding by December, next month. Thirteen States say they will soon \nhave to tell enrollees they could lose coverage without immediate \ncongressional action. Utah officials have even considered sending \nletters to enrollees as early as this week letting them know the \nprogram is being forced to wind down.\n  The Kaiser Family Foundation has found that 32 States are expected to \nrun out of funding by March if Congress fails to act. I am glad we are \nhere today with a bill to reauthorize CHIP and other public health \nprograms, but they are woefully inadequate.\n  This bill is paid for by eviscerating funding from one of the most \nimportant parts, again, of the Affordable\n\n\nCare Act that helps to keep people well: the Prevention Fund. This fund \nfocuses on children's health, expanding access to lifesaving vaccines \nand reducing the risk of lead poisoning, among many other things.\n  This is a particularly heartless cut when you consider that many \nresidents of Flint, Michigan, still can't get a clean glass of water \nfrom the faucet or bathe in uncontaminated water 3 years after the \nwater crisis began. Children there in Flint will be forced to live for \nthe rest of their lives with impacts ranging from neurodevelopmental \ndamage and behavioral changes to hypertension and anemia, damage caused \nby a government that failed to act.\n  If it fails to adequately fund Medicaid for Puerto Rico and the U.S. \nVirgin Islands as they continue to try to rebuild following the \ndevastating recent hurricanes, that would be a compounding of the \ntragedy. This bill fails to waive the requirement that both of those \nislands match Federal investment before they can access any of the \nMedicaid funding, and we don't deal with that at all, even for CHIP.\n  Seventy percent of Puerto Rico doesn't even have power 6 weeks after \nHurricane Maria hit. I am proud to say that a lot of New York utility \nworkers are down there now, and I am sure we will see results soon. \nResidents of Puerto Rico are washing clothes and bathing in \ncontaminated streams and rivers, and drinking it as well. A million \npeople there still don't have any running water. They don't have the \nability to put up millions of dollars, either, to match these funds \nbecause they are struggling to survive. We don't address that. These \nare American citizens, and we have an obligation to help them.\n  These reauthorizations are a chance to really work together and \ndeliver, but we are worried about this opportunity because there is no \nindication that this bill could pass the Senate with the cuts that it \nhas made to the Affordable Care Act. I am referring, of course, to the \nones that relate to preventive care. That would be a major tragedy.\n\n  As I have already said, so many States are right at the edge of not \nbeing able to fund the program at all. Other States are ready to tell \nboth community health services and CHIP that they are no longer \nproviding for them.\n  This partisan approach will only delay the extension of the programs \neven further. I consider that a major dereliction of our duties.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time", "turn": 6, "speaker": "Ms. SLAUGHTER", "itemno": 10}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "B001248", "text": "  Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 30 seconds in response \nbefore yielding to the chairman of the Rules Committee.\n  It pains me to hear people talk about the 33-day delay in getting \nSCHIP funding resubmitted. I just want to assure the House of \nRepresentatives that Republicans on the Subcommittee of Health in the \nEnergy and Commerce Committee have been ready to go with this \nlegislation. We did our legislative hearings early in the summer, as \nthe gentleman will recall because he was there, and we were ready for \nour markup in the month of September.\n  Why was it delayed? Let me reference an article from CQ News, October \n23, 2017: ``Democrats do not want a children's health insurance bill to \ncome to the floor this week for a vote, said Frank Pallone, Jr., \nranking member of the House Energy and Commerce Committee at a district \nevent. . . .''\n  `` `The idea is to not have the bill come to the floor this week,' \nsaid Pallone. . . .''\n  I include in the Record a copy of the CQ News article.\n\n                     [From CQ News, Oct. 23, 2017]\n\n          House Democrats Push To Delay Children's Health Vote\n\n                           (By Sandhya Raman)\n\n       Democrats do not want a children's health insurance program \n     bill to come to the floor this week for a vote, said Frank \n     Pallone Jr., ranking member of the House Energy and Commerce \n     Committee at a district event broadcast on Facebook Live on \n     Monday.\n       ``The idea is to not have the bill come to the floor this \n     week,'' said Pallone, emphasizing that Democrats still want \n     to find a bipartisan compromise and will not accept the \n     changes to Medicare or Medicaid that Republicans want to use \n     to fund the coverage. He later added, ``This is supposed to \n     come up Thursday. Hopefully, it won't.''\n       Pallone suggested that the process could be lengthy if the \n     House passes a partisan bill and the Senate does not act \n     quickly to pass their bipartisan measure. The two likely \n     would have to be reconciled through conference negotiations.\n       ``We're going to just delay this for months, and the end \n     result could be we don't deal with this until the end of the \n     year,'' said Pallone, speaking at a community health center.\n       Democrats disagree with the offsets in House bills to \n     reauthorize CHIP (HR 3921) and community health centers and \n     other safety net programs (HR 3922). The CHIP bill's offsets \n     include increasing premiums for Medicare recipients with \n     income over $500,000 a year and limiting Medicaid benefits \n     for lottery winners. In addition, Democrats take issue with \n     an offset that would bill other insurance before Medicaid for \n     recipients who use more than one form of coverage.\n       The offsets for the community health centers include \n     changes to undermine the 2010 health care law (PL 111-148, PL \n     111-152) including cutting almost $6.4 billion from the \n     Prevention and Public Health Fund over 10 years. Republicans \n     also would allow states to create their own grace periods for \n     individuals on the exchanges to pay their premiums or use a \n     default one-month grace period. The current grace period is \n     three months.\n       ``If you miss it and you don't pay it, you can't get your \n     insurance. You've got to re-enroll for the next year,'' \n     Pallone said about the grace period.\n       ``The problem is that they haven't been willing to give \n     much on taking this money from the Affordable Care Act or \n     Medicare, but why do they even have to come out of health \n     care at all? Why can't we use another vehicle to pay for \n     it?'' said Pallone, adding, ``Part of that could be cut back \n     significantly.''\n       Democrats also object to the way Puerto Rico's Medicaid \n     funding in the CHIP bill would be addressed.\n       ``They're still requiring a state match from Puerto Rico,'' \n     said Pallone. ``The bill funds a little bit, but it's totally \n     worthless if Puerto Rico has to come up with the match.''\n       The island does not have money to contribute, Democrats \n     say.\n       Earlier this month, Committee Chairman Greg Walden of \n     Oregon asked his Democratic colleagues to suggest offsets \n     that may be more amenable than those currently in the bill \n     that the committee passed. Last week, Walden said in a \n     statement that he had not received any Democratic offers.\n       Democrats contend they have put suggestions on the table.\n       One idea would require drug companies to help seniors \n     better afford their prescriptions by closing a funding gap, \n     known as the ``doughnut hole,'' in Medicare coverage. \n     Currently, seniors have to pick up more costs after a certain \n     spending threshold until they hit another limit when Medicare \n     resumes paying for coverage.\n       ``We've been making offers back. One of the things we said \n     is make the drug companies pay for the doughnut hole. We \n     still have a doughnut hole for Medicare Part D. So if they \n     pay for the cost of that, that could be used as a payfor,'' \n     said Pallone.\n       ``This bill that may go to the floor next week is going \n     nowhere,'' said Pallone, stating that it would ``be a totally \n     partisan vote.''\n       Federal funding for CHIP expired Sept. 30. The Centers for \n     Medicare and Medicaid Services has redistributed unused CHIP \n     funds to nine states and territories including Arizona, \n     California, Minnesota, Washington, American Samoa, Guam, \n     Northern Mariana Islands, U.S. Virgin Islands and Oregon. The \n     funds come from unused CHIP allotments from previous years \n     and are used to help states that are running low on their \n     current year funds.\n", "turn": 7, "speaker": "Mr. BURGESS", "itemno": 11}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "B001248", "text": "  Mr. BURGESS.

Mr. Speaker, I really appreciate the distinguished \ngentleman from Lewisville, Texas, Dr. Michael Burgess, who serves \nseveral roles in this House of Representatives. First of all, he is \nchairman of the Subcommittee on Health for the Energy and Commerce \nCommittee--actually, his favorite committee--and then his duties at the \nRules Committee, and Mike has spent a good number of years in service \nto the entire body. I want to thank Dr. Burgess for his personally \nhandling not only this matter, but bringing to Congress a really strong \nattitude that he has about children.\n  Dr. Burgess, for a number of years since his early days in Parkland \nHospital in Dallas, Texas, as a resident and then becoming an \nobstetrician-gynecologist who served not only the Dallas area, \nthousands of people, but he brought to that a love of children, women, \nand families to give precious life to the United States of America, I \nwant to thank him for his healthy child bill that he brought to the \nEnergy and Commerce Committee.\n  Mr. Speaker, let me say this. The gentlewoman from New York, the \nranking member of the Rules Committee, and the entire committee \nyesterday spent a great deal of time not only looking at this \nparticular bill, but other very germane issues related to healthcare. \nMy colleagues, including\n\n\nthe gentlewoman from New York, really have the best heart in this. I \nbelieve this is an issue where we agree. We agree that children's \nhealth is not only an important part of what Congress should be \ninvolved in but, actually, resolving the issues.\n  She is very correct. Several weeks ago it was brought up in the Rules \nCommittee the timeliness of this issue, the appropriateness of the \nRules Committee handling this bill to get it to the floor so that we \nwould allow not only the American people to understand what we were \ndoing, but, really, to put it in play so that this could be handled by \nthe United States Senate and the President.\n  I want to congratulate my colleagues. I think that my colleagues, to \na person, understand the importance of this--and certainly Mike \nBurgess' leadership at Energy and Commerce Committee--but also the \nRules Committee. So reauthorizing the Children's Health Insurance \nProgram, or CHIP, as it is known, is vitally important. It is important \nbecause there are some 400,000 children in Texas, alone, where Chairman \nBurgess and I live.\n  We see not only families, but we see the healthcare community. We see \nother elected officials and just normal people at home who expect us to \nget our work done. We are today. In fact, we are not only getting it \ndone, but, as Chairman Burgess has talked about and even as the \ngentlewoman, Ms. Slaughter, has talked about, there will be States at \nthe end of November that will be running on fumes, be running on empty, \nand a good number of States are funded until probably February or \nMarch. But that is not a reason for us to delay.\n  So we are here, respectfully, to ask the entire body, Republicans and \nDemocrats, and also to let the American people know that the Children's \nHealth Insurance Program, through the efforts of Mike Burgess and \nthrough the efforts of Greg Walden as chairman of the committee, who \nhave worked very diligently to make sure that it not only comes to the \nfloor, but that the new nuances of the bill that will include many, \nmany good bipartisan ideas will be offset, and it will be offset. We \nare going to have to make sure as we move forward that those are \ncareful instructions that we all understand.\n  But the bottom line to this is, Mr. Speaker, this Congress, because \nof the bipartisanship, because of the ability, because of the \nimportance of CHIP, is handling this today.\n  We are going to ask all Members if they did not have a chance to see \nwhat I thought was a robust, distinguished panel that came to us \nyesterday to talk about this, but also the thoughtful ideas from our \nMembers about the importance of this, I think we can convince this \nbody--this body, Republicans and Democrats--that the underlying \nlegislation helps secure for 5 more years--which is what the goal was, \n5 more years--to make sure that we can move forward; and it gives \nStates the authority and the responsibility, gives the American people \nconfidence that what we are doing to take care of this issue has not \nonly been done, but presented in such a way that it will be successful.\n  That is our job, Mr. Speaker. Our job is to take the work that comes \nfrom the committee of jurisdiction--in this case, the Energy and \nCommerce Committee--and move that through, look at it, vet it, and make \nsure the best ideas happen.

Mr. Speaker, I rise to voice my opposition to this rule \nand to the underlying bill.\n  First, by the way, my colleague from California (Ms. Matsui) talked \nabout the Democratic substitute. But let's be clear, it is our \nRepublican colleagues, the majority, who would not make a Democratic \nsubstitute in order that would allow us to come here to have a debate \non their proposal and what we proposed. How about that for democracy in \nthe United States House of Representatives? No Democratic substitute.\n  So let's leave that aside and focus on what we have here today. \nAgain, opposed to the rule, opposed to the bill.\n  The Children's Health Insurance Program is vital for millions of our \nNation's most vulnerable citizens--our children. The gentleman before \nspoke about 9 million children. Yes. But do you know how long we have \nwaited for the majority to reauthorize the Children's Health Insurance \nProgram? The length of time is shameful. But even more shameful is how \nthe majority intends to pay for the Children's Health Insurance \nProgram.\n  This is what the bill does. The bill includes massive cuts to \nsomething called the Prevention and Public Health Fund. What is the \nPrevention and Public Health Fund? It is inclusive of many of the \nprograms that we rely on in order to save lives.\n  Yes. They are the programs that go to help our community health \ncenters be able to treat people who come to their door. Twenty-three \nmillion people in the United States use community health centers. It is \noften their primary care.\n\n  But let me lay out for you what some of these programs are: the \nCenters for Disease Control childhood vaccines--vaccinations and \nimmunizations for our kids being cut--lead poisoning prevention. You go \nto any community in this country, and they will tell you whether it is \nwater or whether it is paint. Some of our children have the highest \nlevels of lead, and what we need to be doing is screening them at a \nvery early age so that we can address the issue. They cut this out, \nalso the Centers for Disease Control heart disease program, stroke and \ndiabetes programs, breastfeeding grants for hospitals, childhood \nobesity prevention, and suicide prevention. We are looking today at an \nopioid crisis in this Nation that so often results in suicides, and \nthey are willing to cut the heart out of the Prevention Fund programs \nto fund the Children's Health Insurance Program.\n  So we are harming children at one end of the spectrum and robbing the \nmoney from that end of the spectrum to pay for the Children's Health \nInsurance Program, which I am a big supporter of. So we are stealing \nfrom this prevention program.\n  Now today, my Republican colleagues have offered a tax cut proposal. \nTake a hard look at it because the richest, the wealthiest, and those \nwith the most lobbyists are the biggest beneficiaries of these tax \ncuts, and middle class working families will get the short end of the \nstick. Those people who make over $1 million--several million dollars--\nare going to get the benefit of the tax cut. Why aren't we taking that \nmoney and paying to reauthorize the Children's Health Insurance Program \nrather than taking the money from the Prevention and Public Health \nFund?\n  So instead of providing tax cuts today for the richest 1 percent of \nAmericans, we could have a strong Children's Health Insurance Program, \nand we could have a strong Prevention and Public Health Fund that does \nnot have to make these egregious cuts.\n  I think there is one more point that people need to know about this \nbill. The bill cuts something that was in the Affordable Care Act--the \ngrace period. They cut that back to 30 days. That means if someone \nmisses one health insurance payment, they can lose their insurance for \nthe remainder of the year.\n  Today, our biggest economic challenge as a nation is that people are \nin jobs that just don't pay them enough to live on. They can't afford \ntheir healthcare.

Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for yielding, and I rise \nto extend my support for this rule and the underlying legislation.\n  This legislation funds critical, bipartisan health programs that help \nkeep our communities healthy.\n  Mr. Speaker, I have long been a strong supporter of CHIP because I \nhave seen it in action back in my home State of Alabama. I served on \nthe Alabama State School Board back when Alabama implemented our CHIP \nprogram, known as ALL Kids. ALL Kids was the first CHIP program in the \ncountry, and it has made a real difference. In fact, the uninsurance \nrate for children in Alabama has gone from 20 percent pre-CHIP to 2.4 \npercent today.\n  For 83,000 Alabama children under 19, the program offers low-cost, \ncomprehensive healthcare coverage that includes regular checkups, \nimmunizations, sick child doctor visits, prescriptions, vision care, \ndental care, and much more.\n  CHIP has always been a bipartisan program, and I hope this \nreauthorization will earn bipartisan support for the children of \nAmerica.\n  This legislation also reauthorizes the community health centers fund. \nI am a huge champion of community health centers because, again, I have \nseen them work in Alabama from the Mostellar Medical Center in Bayou La \nBatre to Franklin Primary Health in Mobile to Southwest Alabama Health \nServices in McIntosh. These centers are vitally important to so many \nAmericans, but especially to low-income families and those in rural \nareas.\n  One in 13 people nationwide rely on a health center for their \nhealthcare needs, and this reauthorization is necessary to ensure those \nindividuals continue to receive access to medical care.\n  This legislation also includes many other healthcare provisions to \nmeet other priorities. Among these provisions, I am pleased the \nlegislation continues Medicaid disproportionate share hospital \npayments, or DSH payments, as they are commonly known.\n  DSH provides funding to hospitals that treat a large number of \nindigent patients. DSH is absolutely critical to the life of Alabama's \nhospitals, and failure to renew these important payments could result \nin numerous hospital closures in our State.\n  So, Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to \nget behind this legislation and ensure it gets across the finish line. \nWe should not let petty political arguments keep us from ensuring that \nchildren have access to affordable health insurance, keeping the doors \nopen at community health centers, or allowing Alabama's hospitals to \ncontinue serving communities in need.", "turn": 20, "speaker": "Mr. BYRNE", "itemno": 24}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "S000480", "text": "  Ms. SLAUGHTER.

Madam Speaker, I want to thank the ranking member of the \nRules Committee.\n  I just want to express the tremendous frustration that I have and \nthat Democrats have in general with the way the Republican leadership \nhas handled the CHIP bill, IPAB, and community health centers, the \nlegislation we are considering today and tomorrow.\n  First of all, I need to point out that it was over a year ago when I \nasked\n\n\nleadership of our committee to try to come up with bipartisan \nlegislation with regard to community health centers and SCHIP, the \nchildren's initiative, and all they wanted to do from January until \nSeptember--9 months--was repeal the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\n  That is all they were interested in. They didn't want to hear \nanything about CHIP or community health centers, just repeal the \nAffordable Care Act.\n  My colleagues on the other side suggested that somehow, because of \nCHIP, they are very concerned about kids. Well, the fact of the matter \nis, if you repeal the Affordable Care Act, children--everyone--and \ncommunity health centers would suffer such damage because they would \nlose their health insurance or the underpinnings of the community \nhealth centers, which have been financed with the Affordable Care Act, \nthat any suggestion that somehow because you are concerned now about \nCHIP or community health centers is belied by the fact that you spent \nthe last 9 months, through September, trying to repeal the Affordable \nCare Act. If you really cared about these things, then you would not \nhave sought that repeal.\n  Once that repeal seemed to be over in September, then the Republicans \non the committee and the leadership were willing to talk about CHIP and \ncommunity health centers. But mind you, the authorization for those two \nprograms ended September 30. So it was literally too late.\n  Now my colleagues on the other side say: Oh, well, we are bringing \nthis bill up today because we really care about kids and community \nhealth centers.\n  Exactly the opposite. If you did care, in the sense that you wanted \nto get legislation passed, then you wouldn't bring this bill up today. \nWe all know that if the bill is not bipartisan, which it is not, it \nwill never pass the Senate. What is going to happen is these bills will \npass on a partisan vote on Friday and, as a consequence, they will go \nto the Senate and there will be no action and we will have to deal with \nthis at the end of the year as part of some larger omnibus spending \nbill or whatever we do at the end of the year.\n  So anyone who tells you that the Republicans, in trying to pass a \npartisan bill, are actually moving forward on CHIP or on community \nhealth centers, that is simply not true.\n  Now, what are we facing here with these three bills? And I include \nIPAB, CHIP, and community health centers. What we are really facing is \nanother effort on the part of the Republican leadership to repeal or \nsabotage the Affordable Care Act.\n  All these things are part, in some fashion, of either pay-fors or \nauthorization of the Affordable Care Act. The fact of the matter is, we \nare now seeing what I would call piecemeal repeal.\n  You couldn't repeal it outright, so you do a piecemeal repeal. You \nrepeal IPAB. You basically use funding from the Prevention Fund and you \ngut that so you can pay for the CHIP funding. You change the grace \nperiod so something like half a million people lose their health \ninsurance. Meanwhile, the President of the United States is out there \nevery day issuing executive orders to get rid of cost-sharing subsidies \nto cut back on the outreach program.\n  If you look at all this, it is nothing more than a piecemeal repeal \nof the Affordable Care Act. It is sabotaging the Affordable Care Act.\n  This has not changed. The first 9 months to September, outright \nrepeal. Now, between now and the end of the year, piecemeal repeal. \nEvery day, a different bill.\n  The real inconsistency, which is the best I can say about what is \ngoing on, is to say that we have to come up with offsets to pay for the \nChildren's Health Initiative Program and the community health centers, \nbut we don't have to do it for IPAB. $17.5 million is what it is going \nto cost, according to the CBO, to repeal IPAB. If you use that money, \nit would almost pay for the CHIP and the community health centers bill \nthat will be considered the next day.\n  So, again, we have this total inconsistency suggesting that somehow \nwe care about one thing. What is really go on is robbing Peter to pay \nPaul. The way that you pay for the community health centers and the \nCHIP bill, basically, sabotaging the Affordable Care Act, is you \nshorten the grace period from 90 days to 30 days, when people, if they \ndon't pay their premium, will lose their health insurance.

Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.\n  Madam Speaker, we don't have time to spare playing games here with \nthe CHIP program. It is on life support in many States, with officials \nscrambling to try to keep it alive. This is a program, you have heard \nbefore, that 9 million children rely on.\n  And 2,800 community health centers are at risk of closing their doors \nif we do not reauthorize the community health centers. That would leave \nmillions of people without healthcare, cost more than 50,000 jobs, and \nalready the centers nationwide have been forced to consider cutting \nservices following the majority's failure to reauthorize the program \nbefore it expired on September 30.\n  Everybody knows that these centers do remarkable work. They deliver \nquality care at lower cost. More than 330,000 veterans relied on them \nfor healthcare last year alone. They could be reauthorized under a \nclean bill in seconds. Instead, the majority is putting them at risk \nthrough this partisan bill, which seems unlikely to pass the Senate, \nand we will then be nowhere.\n  If you want to know why only 13 percent of the public approves of \nCongress under the leadership, just look at the bill before us today. \nRepublican leaders have turned even the most bipartisan programs into \nendeavors that seem unlikely to become law.\n  They have disallowed the Democratic Party to have any substitute with \nany other ideas that they did not have before so that we can, as Ms. \nDeLauro mentioned, have an honest debate. We see that time after time \nin the Rules Committee, the inability for our side to even get \namendments passed. But not to allow a substitute bill of this magnitude \nis, I think, really a dereliction of duty. It speaks volumes about the \ninability to get things done.\n  And lastly, Madam Speaker, I want to recognize George Agurkis. He is \nsitting here with me. George has been on the Rules Committee staff for \n9\\1/2\\ years. He is leaving us at the end of the week to take a \nwonderful new job and new project. He is a Pennsylvania neighbor we \nalways could count on. He is a lot of fun. We are going to miss that \nand his aunt, Rose, who works in the cloakroom.

Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.\n  I do want to address one of the things that has come up in the \ndiscussion, and that is the issue of the language in the underlying \nbill that supports the citizens, the American citizens in Puerto Rico.\n  There was a problem in Puerto Rico with their Medicare system, the \nway people were not automatically enrolled as they were in every other \nState and territory. There was a problem under the Affordable Care Act \nwhere they faced a Medicaid funding cliff.\n\n  These problems existed prior to the two hurricanes that hit the \nisland, and a request was made to Chairman Walden and me, on behalf of \nthe people of Puerto Rico, to fix these problems prior to the storms \ncoming ashore, and that is what we fixed in the language of this bill.\n  I might remind this body that, when Hurricane Katrina came ashore \naround Labor Day of 2005, a similar problem was encountered. \nUltimately, the State's share of that FMAP payment was made. It was \nmade with funds from the Deficit Reduction Act, which were allocated on \nSeptember 30, 2006, over a year later.\n  The fact is that there are going to be funds available to Puerto Rico \nto help offset their part, their match of their State's share of the \nFederal match, but it will likely come through the money that is \nappropriated for disaster relief. But we are fixing their underlying \nproblem that existed before the hurricanes. If we don't fix it, it \ncontinues to be a problem year in and year out, and the American \ncitizens of Puerto Rico are poorly served by that.\n  So this body is taking that up today, and I am proud of the fact that \nour subcommittee and our full committee recognize that and provided \nthat relief.\n  Madam Speaker, I want to enter into the Record a letter from Texas \nHealth Resources, Mr. Barclay Berdan. I want to quote from this letter: \n``We . . . appreciate your leadership on delaying cuts to Medicaid DSH, \nwhich took effect on October 1, 2017.''\n  ``Thankfully, H.R. 3922 would eliminate the scheduled Medicaid DSH \nreductions in fiscal years 2018 and 2019, thus allowing a critical \nsource of funding to continue for safety net hospitals.''\n\n                                       Texas Health Resources,\n\n                                                 November 1, 2017.\n     Hon. Michael Burgess,\n     House of Representatives,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Representative Burgess: As one of the nation's largest \n     faith-based, nonprofit health care systems, Texas Health \n     Resources (Texas Health) provides more than 350 points of \n     access throughout North Texas, including 29 hospitals (acute-\n     care, short-stay, behavioral health, rehabilitation and \n     transitional care) and more than 100 outpatient facilities, \n     satellite emergency rooms, surgery centers, behavioral health \n     facilities, fitness centers and imaging centers. The system \n     also includes a large physician group, home health, \n     preventive and well-being services as well as more than 250 \n     clinics and physician offices to provide the full continuum \n     of care for all stages of life. I am writing to thank you for \n     your leadership on the Championing Healthy Kids Act of 2017 \n     (H.R. 3922) to extend funding for the Children's Health \n     Insurance Program (CHIP). We strongly support a five-year \n     extension of CHIP funding, along with the elimination of \n     reductions in fiscal years (FY) 2018 and 2019 to the Medicaid \n     disproportionate share hospital (DSH) payments.\n       Texas Health has supported CHIP since its inception, and \n     the program currently covers 8.9 million children with family \n     incomes above Medicaid eligibility limits who lack access to \n     affordable private coverage. The nation's uninsured rate for \n     children is a record low of 5 percent due in part to Medicaid \n     and CHIP coverage. While CHIP is authorized by Congress to \n     operate until October 1, 2019, legislative action is needed \n     to continue funding beyond FY 2017. Failure to extend CHIP \n     funding could result in coverage losses for millions of \n     children and increased financial pressure for states that may \n     lead to reductions in eligibility and benefits This \n     legislation safeguards the program by providing for a five-\n     year extension of funding.\n       We also certainly appreciate your leadership on delaying \n     cuts to Medicaid DSH, which took effect on October 1, 2017. \n     As you know, Medicaid DSH payments support Texas Health's \n     hospitals in serving north Texas' most vulnerable \n     individuals--the poor, the elderly, and the disabled. \n     Congress reduced Medicaid DSH payments in the Affordable Care \n     Act, reasoning that hospitals would care for fewer uninsured \n     patients as health coverage expanded. However, the projected \n     increase in coverage has not been fully realized, and \n     Congress subsequently delayed the start of the cuts that were \n     scheduled to begin in FY 2014. As a result, Texas hospitals \n     will sustain a $148 million cut in vital payments in federal \n     fiscal year 2018. The cumulative loss for Texas hospitals for \n     2018 through 2024 is $3.2 billion. Thankfully, H.R. 3922 \n     would eliminate the scheduled Medicaid DSH reductions in \n     Fiscal Years 2018 and 2019, thus allowing a critical source \n     of funding to continue for safety net hospitals.\n       Thank you for your steadfast leadership on addressing these \n     important programs by supporting H.R. 3922. As Congress moves \n     forward on these important issues, we appreciate your \n     continued willingness to work with us to extend funding for \n     CHIP, eliminate reductions to Medicaid DSH payments, and \n     safeguard programs critical to hospitals. If we can provide \n     you or your staff with additional information, please do not \n     hesitate to contact.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                               Barclay Berdan,\n\n                                   FACHE, Chief Executive Officer,\n                                           Texas Health Resources.\n", "turn": 43, "speaker": "Mr. BURGESS", "itemno": 50}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "B001248", "text": "  Mr. BURGESS.

We look \nforward to working with lawmakers to maintain a strong CHIP program and \nstrengthen healthcare for children in the future.''\n\n     Children's Hospitals Renew Call for Bipartisan CHIP Extension\n\n       Children's hospitals urge Congress to protect children and \n     families by passing a bipartisan five-year extension of the \n     Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) as soon as \n     possible.\n       We are pleased that members of the House Energy and \n     Commerce Committee have developed bipartisan CHIP policies \n     that reflect the needs of children, including a five-year \n     extension of the program that provides for robust CHIP \n     funding, and continue important beneficiary protections such \n     as the Maintenance of Effort provision, funding for\n\n\n     the Pediatric Quality Measures Program, express lane \n     eligibility, and outreach and enrollment grants. These \n     policies are also included in the bipartisan Senate proposal \n     on CHIP, and we thank the committees of jurisdiction in both \n     chambers for including these crucial policies.\n       If CHIP funding is not extended soon, CHIP-enrolled \n     children may become underinsured or uninsured altogether. \n     CHIP is an important bipartisan health coverage program for \n     over 6 million low-income children. CHIP builds off of a \n     strong Medicaid program by providing age-appropriate and \n     affordable coverage for children who fall above Medicaid \n     eligibility levels, but lack access to other health coverage \n     options.\n       Concerning reports indicate that states are taking steps to \n     limit programs in order to address the looming funding \n     shortfall, despite receiving federal redistribution funds. We \n     urge Congress to act now and avoid potentially disastrous \n     consequences caused by further delay by enacting a strong, \n     bipartisan five-year extension of CHIP.\n       Children's hospitals thank Congress for its long-term \n     bipartisan commitment to CHIP and the children it serves.

It is a \n     vote about what the House should be debating.\n       Mr. Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of \n     Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the \n     previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or \n     control the consideration of the subject before the House \n     being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous \n     question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the \n     subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling \n     of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the \n     House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes \n     the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to \n     offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the \n     majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated \n     the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to \n     a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to \n     recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (R-Illinois) said: \n     ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman \n     from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to \n     yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first \n     recognition.''\n       The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous \n     question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an \n     immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no \n     substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.'' \n     But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the \n     Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in \n     the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition, \n     page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the previous \n     question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is generally \n     not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member \n     controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of \n     offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by \n     voting down the previous question on the rule. . . . When the \n     motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the \n     time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering \n     the previous question. That Member, because he then controls \n     the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for \n     the purpose of amendment.''\n       In Deschler's Procedure in the U.S. House of \n     Representatives, the subchapter titled ``Amending Special \n     Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on \n     such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on \n     Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further \n     debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues: \n     ``Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a \n     resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control \n     shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous \n     question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who \n     controls the time for debate thereon.''\n       Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does \n     have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only \n     available tools for those who oppose the Republican \n     majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the \n     opportunity to offer an alternative plan.\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 54}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "B001248", "text": "  Mr. BURGESS.
