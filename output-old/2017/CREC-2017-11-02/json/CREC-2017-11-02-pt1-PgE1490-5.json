DON BACON\n\n                              of nebraska\n\n                    in the house of representatives\n\n                      Wednesday, November 1, 2017\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "B001298", "text": "  Mr. BACON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today with my colleagues in the \nClimate Solutions Caucus in recognition of a problem that concerns many \nof us--climate change.\n  It is hard to deny that our climate is changing. Whether caused by \ncyclical weather changes or impacted by man's role, it is clear we are \nseeing changes in the polar ice and a rise in temperatures. It is one \nof my goals in Congress to keep the momentum we have seen in previous \ndecades of continuing improvement in our environment. We all want to \nleave our planet cleaner for our children and grandchildren.\n  It is my hope to advance the dialogue and advocate for more renewable \nand diverse energy sources. Top defense authorities, such as Secretary \nMattis, have been vocal on how climate change has affected the DoD's \nthreat assessments, resources, and operation readiness, but Congress \nmust do more to combat this threat.\n  As an incoming freshman in the 115th Congress, I have made it my \nmission to get things accomplished. I have joined the Bipartisan \nClimate Solutions Caucus, and have advocated for an incremental \nimprovements approach to address climate change, while recognizing that \nthe issue is a matter of national security. During the FY18 National \nDefense Authorization Act debate, I as well as some of my other House \ncolleagues, led the charge to ensure adoption of Section 336, which \nrecognizes climate change as a national security issue, and allows the \nDOD to assess its risks and determine next steps to mitigate such \nthreats. This section ensures that the Armed Forces are prepared to \nhandle the effects of a changing climate as it relates to military \noperations. By conducting studies within the Services and Combat \nCommands, DoD will be able to better understand the problem. Congress \nhas a duty to ensure that the DoD is resilient and prepared for \nanything that may threaten its mission and operations and I hope to see \nthe text of Section 336 in the final NDAA bill.\n  It is in America's best interest to improve clean energy technology \nand expand production of renewable energies. Environmental practices do \nnot need to come at the expense of economic growth though. We must \nencourage greater environmental stewardship amongst the private sector \nand foster economic success. Omaha now has 30 percent of energy from \nwind and it's growing. I support continued use of solar, ethanol, and \nsources of hydrothermal.\n  As members of the Bipartisan Climate Solutions Caucus, we proactively \nseek pragmatic\n\n\nsolutions to address environmental concerns. It is a priority of mine \nto have all members recognize the impacts of climate change and our \nrole to leave a cleaner planet for our children and grandchildren. I am \ncommitted to ensuring energy independence for our country and North \nAmerica and ensuring that the use of renewable energy gains a larger \nshare of our overall energy production.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. BACON", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 3}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "178", "extension": true, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "E1490-E1491", "wkday": "Thursday", "day": "2", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "CLIMATE SOLUTIONS CAUCUS", "id": "CREC-2017-11-02-pt1-PgE1490-5", "title": "CLIMATE SOLUTIONS CAUCUS"}
