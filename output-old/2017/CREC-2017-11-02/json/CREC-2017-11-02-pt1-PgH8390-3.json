Madam Speaker, DREAMers are young people \nwho are fighting to give back to the only country they have ever known \nas home. They are not political bargaining chips, and they didn't ask \nto be at the center of this immigration debate. They were brought here \nbefore they were old enough to know the difference. They grew up as our \nneighbors, our kids' classmates, and our friends. They are also \ntaxpayers, teachers, medical students, and they are young people who \nare signing up to serve in our military.\n  Let me tell you about some of the DREAMers I have met in my district.\n  Richard Kim is a student at Tufts University. He was brought here by \nhis parents from Korea when he was just 2 years old. His parents \nsacrificed a great deal in America--even becoming homeless and living \nin a car for a while--for the chance that Richard would have a better \nlife than they had.\n  Their son worked hard, got good grades, and, ultimately, was admitted \ninto one of the best schools in the country. Now he is a freshman at \nTufts University, studying international relations. One day, he wants \nto work here in Congress. Richard calls himself 100 percent American. \nIn his words, he says: I grew up here just like everyone else. I want \nto make a difference in America because this is the place I call home.\n  Let me tell you also about Mario Delgado.\n  In Mario's words, he says: I know what it is like to live like a \nshadow in a room full of light, keeping my head down to make sure that \nI don't get sent back to a country that I know nothing of.\n  So Mario kept his head down. He studied, worked through high school \nto help pay the bills, and saved up money for the future. Mario expects \nto graduate from college next year. He wants to work in the renewable \nenergy industry. He says he intends to help America with the \nadvancement of fusion energy.\n  And then there is Marla, who started attending school in Framingham, \nMassachusetts, when she was in the first grade. She describes learning \nAmerican history, listening to popular music, and watching the Disney \nchannel like the rest of her friends, but something was different.\n\n\n  Unlike her friends, she realized she couldn't get a driver's license. \nAs a teenager, she suffered the crushing fear that every knock on the \ndoor could mean that she would never see her loved ones again. She \nfeared that applying for college would mean exposing her family, a \ncruel reality for someone who was the valedictorian of her graduating \nclass.\n\n\n  When DACA was enacted, a life of fear became a life of possibility. \nMarla could now drive. She could earn and save money. She could go to \ncollege and contribute to her community.\n  Marla not only went to college, she graduated at the top of her \nclass. She bought a home and is now contributing her talents to the \nCommonwealth's innovation economy.\n  Last week, Marla bravely came to me as a DREAMer, in front of her \ncoworkers, because she wanted to make a difference.\n  Madam Speaker, DREAMers are bright, young people who are American in \ntheir hearts and in their minds. They are American in every way but on \npaper, and their dream for a better future is unmistakably American.\n  Their families have often endured poverty, violence, and persecution, \nbut despite it all, they have excelled and charted their own path to \nsuccess. Though they know no other country, they grew up with the \nthreat of deportation and that their families could be torn apart at \nany given moment.\n  The DACA program showed them a way to come out of the shadows, to \nlift their heads and reach for their dreams, and give back to a country \nthey call home. Through DACA, 800,000 young people have been able to \ncontribute to our workforce and our Armed Forces.\n  As Marla put it, 800,000 is not just a number; it is birthdays, \nschool events, graduations, homes, and memories.\n  Reversing DACA would mean sending these talented young people to a \ncountry they don't even know, where they could potentially be our \ncompetitors in our workforce.\n  We have all the tools we need to prevent that from happening and keep \nDREAMers like Richard, Mario, and Marla in our communities, where they \ncan help us build successful futures. All we need is for leadership to \nallow us a vote.\n  What these young people deserve is no different than what we want for \nour own children. If we fail to pass the Dream Act, we not only fail \nthem, we fail to meet our potential as a country. Let's do what the \nvast majority of Americans are asking us to do. Let's give our DREAMers \nand the Dream Act a vote.\n", "turn": 1, "speaker": "Ms. CLARK of Massachusetts", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "178", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H8390-H8391", "wkday": "Thursday", "day": "2", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "DREAMERS", "id": "CREC-2017-11-02-pt1-PgH8390-3", "title": "DREAMERS"}
