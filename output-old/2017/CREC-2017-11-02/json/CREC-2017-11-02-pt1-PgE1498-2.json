Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the \nservice and achievements of an esteemed and valued citizen of Killeen, \nTexas. Colonel Raul Villaronga, U.S. Army Retired, has dedicated \nhimself to serving his community and is an embodiment of the Army \nvalues of honor, loyalty, and selfless service. He is a deserving \nrecipient of a Congressional Veteran Commendation.\n  His commission as an Infantry 2nd Lieutenant in 1959 began his 24 \nyears of service in which he completed assignments in Fort Bragg, the \nPanama Canal Zone, Vietnam, Germany, and Fort Hood. While assigned to \nthe 8th Special Forces Group, he participated in numerous classified \nMobile Training Teams in Central and South America. COL Villaronga \ndeservingly received awards including the Silver Star, the Legion of \nMerit, the Bronze Star, and the Meritorious Service Medal as a \ntestament to his exemplary service.\n  COL Villaronga is a respected citizen serving in numerous roles \nshowcasing his commitment to community and nation. Returning from the \nArmy, COL Villaronga served three terms as Mayor of Killeen. As Mayor, \nhe founded the Killeen Youth Advisory Commission and worked on the \nJoint Use Agreement for the Robert Gray Army Airfield. As Chairman of \nthe Killeen League of United Latin American Citizens Council 4535 \nFoundation, COL Villaronga has been responsible for the donation of \nover $175,000 in scholarships for local graduating seniors. He \ncontinues to serve veterans in his community alongside his wife. His \ntireless efforts have made Central Texas a place that we're proud to \ncall home.\n  COL Villaronga's patriotism and commitment to service reflect the \nvery best values of Central Texas. He is a hero who has devoted his \nlife to defending our freedoms abroad and serving his community at \nhome. I join his wife, Julia, along with his family and friends in \nwishing him the best in the years ahead.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. CARTER of Texas", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 3}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "178", "extension": true, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "E1498", "wkday": "Thursday", "day": "2", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "CELEBRATING THE SERVICE AND ACHIEVEMENTS OF COLONEL RAUL VILLARONGA, U.S. ARMY (RETIRED)", "id": "CREC-2017-11-02-pt1-PgE1498-2", "title": "CELEBRATING THE SERVICE AND ACHIEVEMENTS OF COLONEL RAUL VILLARONGA,  U.S. ARMY (RETIRED)"}
