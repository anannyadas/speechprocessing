Mr. Speaker, first of all, I want to thank \nthe Houston Astros for winning the World Series and giving some folks \nin Houston and southeast Texas something to cheer about. We have had a \ntough few months, but you could see from last night that there is a lot \nof cheering in Houston.\n  But I am here to talk about a major issue that is really important: \nthe Children's Health Insurance Program--the CHIP program--and the \nfederally qualified health centers. Both programs are bedrocks of our \nhealth system, providing health insurance for over 9 million lower \nincome children, and serving on the front lines of primary care, \nproviding high-quality primary and preventative care for 25 million \nAmericans.\n  Congress let funding for these programs expire more than a month ago, \nand we must act in a bipartisan manner to strengthen and sustain them. \nBoth CHIP and community health centers have always had strong \nbipartisan\n\n\nsupport since their creation 20 and 50 years ago, respectively, but not \nthis time.\n  We should not cut Medicaid to fund these two programs. You are taking \nmoney away from the poorest children to give to the less poor children. \nWe need to support vaccination programs, infectious disease detection \nand prevention, and chronic disease prevention. We need to make sure \nthis bill is bipartisan, and it is not right now.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "178", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H8393-H8394", "wkday": "Thursday", "day": "2", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "CHILDREN'S HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM", "id": "CREC-2017-11-02-pt1-PgH8393-8", "title": "CHILDREN'S HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM"}
