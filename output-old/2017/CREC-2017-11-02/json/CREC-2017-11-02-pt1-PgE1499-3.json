Mr. Speaker, it is with a heavy heart and \nsolemn remembrance that I pay tribute to a respected athlete, an \nambitious franchiser, and a friend of longstanding, Mr. Brady Keys, Jr. \nMr. Keys passed away on Tuesday, October 24, 2017. A memorial service \nwill be held on Saturday, November 4, 2017 at 1:30 p.m. at Rejoice in \nthe Lord Ministries in Apopka, FL and will be followed by a funeral \nservice and burial on Thursday, November 9, 2017 at 2:00 p.m. at \nInglewood Park Cemetery Chapel in Inglewood, CA.\n  Brady Keys, Jr. was born on May 19, 1937 in Austin, Texas. He \nattended Kealing High School in Austin, before moving to California, to \nattend Polytechnic High School.\n  After graduating high school, he enrolled at East Los Angeles Junior \nCollege, where he played semi-pro football and gained the attention of \nFido Murphy, a scout for the Pittsburgh Steelers. Murphy offered Keys a \nposition on the Steelers taxi squad, which he declined. Murphy then \noffered Keys an education at Colorado State University with the hope \nthat he could be legally drafted as a free agent. During his junior \nyear, he was ultimately drafted by the Pittsburgh Steelers and played \nwith them for six years. He played as a defensive back for a total of \neight seasons with the National Football League, also playing for the \nMinnesota Vikings and St. Louis Cardinals.\n  Brady Keys, Jr. was not only a natural athlete, but he was also a \nvery successful entrepreneur, owning numerous enterprises and \nfranchises. After leaving the NFL, Brady was determined to start his \nown restaurant franchise but was denied business loans as bankers were \nreluctant to lend to businesses with African-American management. \nHowever, he did not let that stop him. In 1967, with the financial help \nof Art Rooney, then Coach of the Steelers, he opened his first All-Pro \nChicken restaurant in Detroit, Michigan. As All-Pro Chicken expanded, \nMr. Keys became the first African-American to establish a national \nfranchise.\n  After the opening of his first All-Pro Chicken restaurant, Mr. Keys' \nbusiness empire expanded beyond his All-Pro restaurants. His businesses \nincluded several Kentucky Fried Chicken restaurants in Albany, Georgia; \nthe Urban Talent Development Corporation; The Keys Group; Pennky Mining \nand Oil Company; Brady Keys, Jr. Athletic Foundation, Inc.; Keys \nCommunications Group, Inc., (formed upon purchase of WJIZ 96.3 FM and \nWJYZ 960 AM radio stations in Albany, Georgia); Alpha-Keys Orlando \nRetail Associates; Keys Technology Group, Inc.; Keys News and Gift \nShop; Keys-Watt Productions, Inc.; and Keys and Sons Jewelers. Brady \nwas truly an asset to the Albany, Georgia, Orlando, Georgia, and \nDetroit, Michigan communities, and his companies contributed over $40 \nmillion to the economies of those states.\n  A prominent sports figure and successful business owner, Brady Keys, \nJr. received several awards and appointments including an appointment \nto the Advisory Council on Minority Business Enterprise by President \nNixon; an award for Outstanding African-American Albanian of the Year; \nand several rankings on Black Entertainment Magazine's list of 100 \nlargest minority owned businesses between the years of 1972 to 1979.\n  Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. once said, ``Life's most urgent question \nis: What are you doing for others?'' Brady Keys, Jr. committed a \nprodigious amount of time and love to the service of others, and he \nshared his own enthusiasm and wisdom in order to better those around \nhim. In life and in death, Brady has left a lasting impact on all those \nwhose lives he has touched.\n  Brady Keys, Jr. leaves behind his wife of many years, Anna, and a \nlarge loving family and a host friends who will miss him dearly.\n  Mr. Speaker, my wife Vivian and I, along with the more than 730,000 \nresidents of the Second Congressional District of Georgia, salute Brady \nKeys, Jr. for his outstanding entrepreneurism, untiring commitment to \nminority business ownership, and community development in the urban \ncommunities where he lived. I ask my colleagues to join all of us in \nextending our deepest condolences to the Keys family during this \ndifficult time. We pray that they will be consoled and comforted by an \nabiding faith and the Holy Spirit in the days, weeks, and months ahead.\n\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. BISHOP of Georgia", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "178", "extension": true, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "E1499", "wkday": "Thursday", "day": "2", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "IN HONOR OF MR.
