Mr. Speaker, I rise today to join my constituents in \ncelebrating the 100th birthday of Mrs. Thelma Kouzes, a truly \nremarkable woman and a beloved member of the Northern Virginia \ncommunity. Mrs. Kouzes was born Thelma Virginia Loss on July 26, 1917 \nin Audubon, Iowa. She proudly says she is a first-generation American, \nthe daughter of immigrants whose parents came to the United States from \nDenmark. She grew up in Iowa, was raised by hardworking parents, and \nexperienced the hardships of the Great Depression. She moved to \nWashington, D.C. in 1938 to work for President Roosevelt's \nAdministration. There she met her late husband Thomas Kouzes--also a \nfirst-generation American whose parents came to the U.S. from Greece.\n  Mrs. Kouzes has led an amazing life. Shortly after she moved to D.C., \nshe experienced culture shock when she attended a segregated religious \nservice. Because of experiences like this she became a proud and \npassionate civil rights activist. She remained steadfast in her \ncommitment to justice and equality--including marching alongside Dr. \nMartin Luther King, Jr.; in the March on Washington for Jobs and \nFreedom in 1963--even when others in her community criticized her \nefforts. She was an active member of the\n\n\nAmerican Field Service, UNICEF, the UN, the American Cancer Society, \nand American Mothers. She is proud to say that she helped to save the \npublic schools in Virginia during the period of desegregation, along \nwith hundreds of Northern Virginian mothers.\n  She and her late husband hosted 174 international students from 34 \ndifferent countries between 1960 and 2004. She also placed more than \n400 international students with American families. After her husband \ndied, she continued her devotion to hosting international students.\n  Mrs. Kouzes was elected the 53rd National Mother by the American \nMothers organization, chosen by a jury composed of representatives from \nlocal government as well as religious and educational leaders.\n  These are just a few examples of the many accomplishments of her \nlife.\n  Mrs. Kouzes has been part of our great American story, lending her \nvoice to the vibrancy of our community and offering her experience and \nwisdom to those around her. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me \nin thanking Mrs. Kouzes for her decades of contribution to the Northern \nVirginia area, and in wishing her a happy and healthy 100th birthday.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. CONNOLLY", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 3}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "178", "extension": true, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "E1498-E1499", "wkday": "Thursday", "day": "2", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "CELEBRATING THE 100TH BIRTHDAY OF MRS.
