Mr. Speaker, here in Washington, we are in the midst of \na major debate on tax reform, tax simplification, and tax cuts.\n  The plan unveiled by House Republicans today is a tax cut plan for \nmiddle-income, middle class families in America. If you are a family of \nfour making $59,000, which is the median family income in America, you \nwill receive a $1,200 tax cut as a result of the plan that we unveiled \ntoday.\n  That is real money for middle class families in North Carolina. Maybe \nit is not real money in Washington, D.C., but it is real money in \nwestern North Carolina.\n  We need tax cuts. We need tax simplification. We need economic \ngrowth, more American jobs, and a more competitive environment in \nAmerica so that we can keep jobs here in the United States and not \noffshore those jobs. We need middle class families to win. Our plan \ndoes that.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support our efforts.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. McHENRY", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 3}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "178", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H8424", "wkday": "Thursday", "day": "2", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "SUPPORT REPUBLICAN TAX PLAN", "id": "CREC-2017-11-02-pt1-PgH8424-2", "title": null}
