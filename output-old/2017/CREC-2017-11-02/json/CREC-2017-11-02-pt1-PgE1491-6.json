Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and \ncongratulate Cole Nicholson of Bondurant, Iowa for earning the rank of \nEagle Scout.\n  The Eagle Scout designation is the highest advancement rank in \nscouting. Approximately two percent of Boy Scouts earn the Eagle Scout \nAward. The award is a performance-based achievement with high standards \nthat have been well-maintained over the past century.\n  To earn the Eagle Scout rank, a Boy Scout is obligated to pass \nspecific tests that are organized by requirements and merit badges, as \nwell as completing an Eagle Scout Project to benefit the community. For \nhis project, Cole saw a need for exercise stations, consisting of\n\n\nitems like bars, boxes, and balance beams, around Lake Petocka in \nBondurant. After going through the approval process with the city and \nraising the $1,600 from friends and local organizations, Cole led a \nteam that installed the equipment last October, and has already seen \npeople using them. He completed his Eagle Scout journey at the young \nage of 14, years younger than most Eagle Scouts earn their ranking. The \nwork ethic Cole has shown in his Eagle Scout Project and throughout his \nscouting career speaks volumes about his commitment to serving a cause \ngreater than himself and assisting his community.\n  Mr. Speaker, the example set by this young man and his supportive \nfamily and community demonstrates the rewards of hard work, dedication, \nand perseverance. I am honored to represent Cole and his family in the \nUnited States Congress. I ask that my colleagues in the United States \nHouse of Representatives join me in congratulating him on obtaining the \nEagle Scout ranking and in wishing him nothing but continued success in \nhis future education and career.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. YOUNG of Iowa", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 3}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "178", "extension": true, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "E1491-E1492", "wkday": "Thursday", "day": "2", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "TRIBUTE TO EAGLE SCOUT COLE NICHOLSON", "id": "CREC-2017-11-02-pt1-PgE1491-6", "title": "TRIBUTE TO EAGLE SCOUT COLE NICHOLSON"}
