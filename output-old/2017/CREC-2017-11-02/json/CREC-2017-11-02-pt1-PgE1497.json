Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Major Barry \nRichard, United States Air Force, Retired. Maj. Richard, who answered \nthe call to defend our great nation for 20 years, continues to \ndutifully serve his community of Georgetown, Texas in civilian life. An \nexemplary serviceman and citizen, it is my honor to award Maj. Richard \nwith the Congressional Veteran Commendation.\n  His military service began in 1968 where his skills were utilized in \nvarious capacities as an engineer, pilot, and manager. He wore many \nhats during his years with the Air Force, including working as a \ntechnical design engineer for modifications to EC-135 aircraft and \nHound Dog Air-launched missiles, as pilot and rated staff officer, and \nas Chief of numerous Air Force Safety Units. Maj. Richard saw much \ncombat, and as a testament to the quality of his service, he received \nnumerous awards including the Air Force Distinguished Flying Cross, Air \nMedal, Meritorious Service Medal, and numerous Commendation Medals.\n  Maj. Richard's love of country is matched only by his commitment to \nhis fellow service members. After the end of his service in 1988, he \nand his friend Staff Sergeant Jim Harrell, United States Marines Corps, \nhave worked to improve the lives of veterans in Williamson County. Maj. \nRichard has contributed to building wheelchair ramps and making \nconsiderable home improvements to the homes of local veterans in need. \nThis dignified work has made a lasting impact on the community he \nproudly serves.\n  I commend Maj. Barry Richard's selfless service to the United States \nAir Force, his nation, and his community. His patriotism, citizenship, \nand commitment to excellence reflect the very best values of Central \nTexas. I join his friends and family in celebrating his outstanding \nachievements.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. CARTER of Texas", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 3}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "178", "extension": true, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "E1497", "wkday": "Thursday", "day": "2", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "HONORING MAJOR BARRY RICHARD, UNITED STATES AIR FORCE, (RETIRED)", "id": "CREC-2017-11-02-pt1-PgE1497", "title": "HONORING MAJOR BARRY RICHARD, UNITED STATES AIR FORCE, (RETIRED)"}
