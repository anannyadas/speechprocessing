Mr. Speaker, I stand against Republican \nefforts to give massive tax cuts to the wealthiest citizens and big \ncorporations while robbing the pockets of middle class families and \nransacking Medicare and Medicaid.\n  My constituents are worried. Just ask Marion, who uses Medicare to \nbuy her costly diabetes drugs, or Sherry, whose husband has Alzheimer's \nand lives in a nursing home paid for by Medicaid.\n  Americans want a better deal, one that invests in infrastructure, \neducation, and innovative research and lowers the costs of things like \nchild care and prescription drugs.\n  We want better jobs, better pay, and a better future, not more \ngiveaways to hedge funds and conglomerates.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Ms. FRANKEL of Florida", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "178", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H8422", "wkday": "Thursday", "day": "2", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "REPUBLICAN TAX PLAN", "id": "CREC-2017-11-02-pt1-PgH8422-3", "title": "REPUBLICAN TAX PLAN"}
