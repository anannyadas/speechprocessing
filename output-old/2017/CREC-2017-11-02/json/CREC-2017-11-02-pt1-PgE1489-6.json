Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Mrs. Judith \nHolzapfel of Orland, California, whose leadership and civic spirit has \nno bounds. Her service to country and community began when she enlisted \nin the United States Air Force after having graduated from Marquette \nUniversity with a degree in nursing. Following basic training, Judith \nwas stationed at Beale Air Force Base where she met her husband. \nFollowing the birth of her son, she began her civilian career working \nin area hospitals.\n   After pursuing further education, Mrs. Holzapfel eventually became \nGlenn County's school nurse and continued in that role for the next 30 \nyears. Her many years of work and\n\n\ndedication has made a difference in health education and quality of \nlife for thousands of students and their families.\n   After retiring from her many years of service to Glenn County, Mrs. \nHolzapfel decided to continue her public services. She ran for a \nposition on the Glenn County Board of Education, and won by an \noverwhelming majority.\n   Mrs. Holzapfel is an active member of many community service \norganizations throughout the county and devotes her time to helping \nyouth, veterans, and the impoverished. Above all, as a mother, \ngrandmother, community activist, and veteran; Mrs. Holzapfel is \npassionate and dedicated to upholding the values of her family, and of \nher country.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. GARAMENDI", "itemno": 3}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 4}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "178", "extension": true, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "E1489-E1490", "wkday": "Thursday", "day": "2", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "2017 WOMAN OF THE YEAR AWARD WINNER--JUDITH HOLZAPFEL", "id": "CREC-2017-11-02-pt1-PgE1489-6", "title": null}
