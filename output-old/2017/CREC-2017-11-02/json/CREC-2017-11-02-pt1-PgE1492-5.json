Mr. Speaker, today I rise in memory of \nfallen Mississippi soldier Army First Lieutenant (1LT) Robert Charles \nOneto-Sikorski who gave his life while in service to our great nation \non October 31, 2005, during Operation Iraqi Freedom. 1LT Oneto-Sikorski \nwas killed when an improvised explosive device detonated near his \ndismounted patrol in Iskandariyah, Iraq. 1LT Oneto-Sikorski was \nassigned to the 1st Battalion, 155th Infantry, Mississippi Army \nNational Guard, Biloxi, Mississippi.\n  1LT Oneto-Sikorski was born on September I, 1972, in New Orleans, \nLouisiana, but called Bay St. Louis his home. According to the \nAssociated Press, while 1LT Oneto-Sikorski was serving in Iraq, his \nhome was flooded from the\n\n\nstorm surge caused by Hurricane Katrina. Despite his loss, Elaine \nOneto, 1LT Oneto-Sikorski's mother, said her son looked to the future \nand talked about his homecoming which would have been in December 2005. \n``He was devoted to his children. He is so much more than any of us \ncould say,'' Mrs. Oneto said. ``He was a wonderful man who loved \neveryone and his loss is going to devastate this whole community.''\n  Patrick Rager, 1LT Oneto-Sikorski's son, recently said he will always \nbe remembered for his service and sacrifice. ``I am proud of his \nservice, and to this day, I strive to make him proud through hard work \nand getting good grades in school,'' Patrick said. ``Many people go \nthrough this life and have little to no impact. Because of his \nsacrifice, he will not be forgotten.''\n  1LT Oneto-Sikorski was remembered by a fellow soldier on a memorial \nwebsite. ``I was serving with Ski in Iraq. He was my XO and my close \nfriend,'' SFC Gene Dufrene said. ``Ski was by far the best officer that \nanyone could serve with. He was what we NCOs called a real soldiers' \nofficer. He would break his neck to take care of us. He took care of \neach and every soldier under his command. We all miss our brother and \nwe will always remember Ski for the man he was to each of us \nsoldiers.''\n  1LT Oneto-Sikorski was employed at Northrop Grumman's Ingalls \nShipyard in Pascagoula, Mississippi, where he worked in the engineering \ndepartment.\n  1LT Oneto-Sikorski was buried with full honors at the Biloxi National \nCemetery.\n  1LT Oneto-Sikorski is survived by his parents, Elaine Marie Oneto and \nRobert Charles Sikorski, II; his wife, Kristine Seamans Sikorski; his \nthree children, Robert Charles Sikorski, II, Patrick Rager, and Hannah \nRager; the mother of his children, Clare Rager; and his two sisters, \nShawn Durfey, and Kathleen Sherlock.\n  1LT Oneto-Sikorski demonstrated courage and bravery protecting the \nfreedoms we all enjoy. His service and sacrifice for America will not \nbe forgotten.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. KELLY of Mississippi", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 3}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "178", "extension": true, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "E1492-E1493", "wkday": "Thursday", "day": "2", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "RECOGNIZING THE LIFE OF FALLEN MISSISSIPPI SOLDIER ARMY 1LT ROBERT CHARLES ONETO-SIKORSKI", "id": "CREC-2017-11-02-pt1-PgE1492-5", "title": "RECOGNIZING THE LIFE OF FALLEN MISSISSIPPI SOLDIER ARMY 1LT ROBERT  CHARLES ONETO-SIKORSKI"}
