Mr. Speaker, House Resolution 600 provides for the \nconsideration of a bipartisan bill reported by the House Ways and Means \nCommittee and the Energy and Commerce Committee.\n  The rule provides for 1 hour of debate equally divided and controlled \nby the chairs and ranking members of the Committee on Energy and \nCommerce and the Committee on Ways and Means.\n  The rule adopts the amendment in the nature of a substitute \nrecommended by the Committee on Ways and Means.\n  Further, the rule waives all points of order and makes in order no \nfurther amendments to the legislation. However, the minority is \nafforded the customary motion to recommit.\n  Mr. Speaker, on behalf of millions of seniors in my home State of \nTexas and all across the United States, I am grateful that the House is \nconsidering H.R. 849, the Protecting Seniors' Access to Medicare Act of \n2017.\n  This bill has been championed by my good friend from Tennessee, Dr. \nPhil Roe, in this Congress and in previous\n\n\nCongresses. It accomplishes a very simple task: To repeal the unpopular \nIndependent Payment Advisory Board created under the Affordable Care \nAct.\n  This repeal has strong bipartisan support in both the Energy and \nCommerce Committee, on which I serve, and in this entire body.\n  As of today, there are 270 Republican and Democratic cosponsors to \nthe bill who all agree that the creation of this board was a very bad \nidea.\n  More than 800 organizations representing every State support this \nbill. If I may add, this includes seniors, patient advocacy groups, \nphysician groups, and other healthcare provider organizations.\n  This board is charged with broad, sweeping powers to reduce Medicare \nspending when Medicare spending exceeds an arbitrary target.\n  The board is a panel composed of 15 members appointed by the \nPresident, confirmed by the Senate for up to two consecutive 6-year \nterms. Fewer than half of the Independent Payment Advisory Board \nmembers can be healthcare providers, and no one--and this is an \nimportant point--on the board may receive outside income. So that means \nby its very definition that this board is comprised of people who \ncannot be practicing physicians.\n  The other members will come from the ranks of think tanks, unions, \nand academia.\n  For a panel with so much authority over Medicare spending, there \ncould be little to no clinical expertise amongst the board members.\n  Is this what Americans really want?\n  Now, here is some good news. The board has yet to be formed. Hooray \nfor that. According to the 2017 Annual Report on the Boards of Medicare \nTrustees from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services' Office of \nthe Actuary, the Independent Payment Advisory Board may not be formed \nuntil at least 2021, based on the current Medicare spending rate \nprojections.\n  Well, that is good news to seniors and their doctors and their \nfamilies, but these projections are just numbers and they can change. \nIn fact, last year the projection was very different, that the \nIndependent Payment Advisory Board would be triggered this year rather \nthan the delay.\n  The concern of many of us here in the House and hundreds of \nstakeholders I have heard from is that under the law, the Independent \nPayment Advisory Board's proposals are required to be implemented by \nthe Secretary of Health and Human Services unless Congress acts by \ncreating its own proposal to achieve the exact same savings or by \npreventing the automatic implementation process as defined by law.\n  So what is that process?\n\n       The law mandates immediate introduction of legislation \n     encompassing the Independent Payment Advisory Board proposed \n     bills in Congress--\n\n  Stop and think about that for a minute. That is not a bill introduced \nby a Member of Congress. That is a bill introduced by an outside board. \nThat is a bill introduced by the administration. Let me recapitulate.\n\n       The law mandates immediate introduction of legislation \n     encompassing the Independent Payment Advisory Board proposed \n     bills in Congress and establishes strict deadlines for \n     committee and Senate floor consideration, and places limits \n     on the appropriations process.\n       While Congress is permitted to modify the type of cuts to \n     Medicare, it must achieve identical savings amounts to \n     Medicare spending as contained in the board's plan. The law \n     bars Congress from changing the Independent Payment Advisory \n     Board fiscal targets in any other legislation it considers, \n     and it creates procedures whereby a super majority vote is \n     required in the Senate to waive this requirement.\n       If the Independent Payment Advisory Board fails to report \n     recommendations or never becomes operational, the Secretary \n     of the Department of Health and Human Services is given the \n     power to implement the cuts unilaterally.\n\n  Well, you might think that, then, of course this would be under \njudicial or administrative review, but the Independent Payment Advisory \nBoard is exempt from administrative or judicial review.\n  No matter what your views are on the Affordable Care Act, we should \nall agree that giving this much power to a panel of unelected and \nunaccountable officials or a Cabinet Secretary, whoever he or she may \nbe in any administration, giving away this much power is simply bad \npolicy. The House shouldn't be for that.\n\n\n  This process is extremely complicated, and maybe that was the intent \nof the people who wrote the provision creating this board under the \nAffordable Care Act.\n  I also fundamentally believe that the Independent Payment Advisory \nBoard infringes on the separation of powers by shifting authority from \nthe legislative to the executive branch. Not only does the creation of \nthis board significantly limit Congress' authority, it eliminates \nneeded transparency from hearings and debate. It eliminates any \nmeaningful opportunity for stakeholder input.\n  I believe leaving Medicare payment decisions in the hands of those \nwho are unelected and unaccountable, with little congressional \noversight, will actually harm seniors' access to quality healthcare.\n  Congress has played an integral role in shaping policies that best \nreflect the needs of our districts and our States, and our constituents \ndemand that. That is the reason they sent us here.\n  Lastly, as a physician, I treasure the doctor-patient relationship. I \nbelieve we must do more to honor this relationship and prevent the \nFederal Government from further eroding this precious commodity.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.", "turn": 5, "speaker": "Mr. BURGESS", "itemno": 9}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "S000480", "text": "  Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume, and I thank the gentleman for yielding me the customary 30 \nminutes.\n  Mr. Speaker, the Independent Payment Advisory Board was created, in \nfact, by the Affordable Care Act, as we have heard. It will be a 15-\nmember panel composed of Presidentially appointed and Senate-confirmed \nexperts charged with developing proposals to prevent Medicare costs \nfrom getting too high. It is about fiscal prudence.\n  The majority and its allies, however, spread many mistruths about the \nboard. It has even been called a death panel, if you remember that. In \nreality, nothing could be further from the truth. Its recommendations \nmay not increase cost-sharing premiums or taxes, or reduce benefits. \nThey have no way to do that.\n  Not a single soul has been nominated to the board. It is not yet \ninstituted as an entity. Today, in the absence of an appointed board, \nthe Secretary of Health and Human Services is directed to submit \nrecommendations to Congress if a trigger is met.\n  The independent Medicare actuaries predict that this board will not \nbe triggered until at least 2021, 4 years from now.\n  Mr. Speaker, I think we have to ask: Why are we spending time today, \nwith everything facing us, addressing a problem that could exist 4 \nyears from now? Is the majority so desperate to undermine the \nAffordable Care Act that they are repealing a panel whose sole purpose \nis keeping Medicare costs in line?\n  According to Gallup, 55 percent of the public approves of the \nhealthcare law. They want to see it strengthened, not eviscerated.\n  In contrast, under the majority's leadership, Congress has an \napproval rating of just 13 percent.\n  Should 13 percent be telling 55 percent what they need to do?\n  Instead, since the majority has so far been unable to repeal it, they \nare going to undermine it brick by brick. The President is even \nsabotaging the Affordable Care Act administratively, slashing the \nbudget to publicize the law by 90 percent, and cutting the open \nenrollment period in half.\n  In the interest of public service, let me say that the enrollment \nperiod started yesterday and continues to December 15. Please go and \ntake care of your health insurance.\n  What the White House has done is make a direct attempt to cause chaos \nto weaken signups under the open enrollment period that began this \nweek.\n  The Kaiser Family Foundation estimated that, as a result of the \nAffordable Care Act, Medicare growth has been historically low. The \ngrowth in healthcare prices is at its lowest level in 50 years. The \nnonpartisan Congressional Budget Office projected that Medicare growth \nrates will remain beneath this panel's targets until 2021, hence the \nreason for not doing a panel for 4 more years.\n  It is really too bad that this Congress and the majority insist on \nsabotaging\n\n\nthe Affordable Care Act, chipping away at its benefits. We should be \nstrengthening it. Remember that every President since Theodore \nRoosevelt just about has tried to do a healthcare bill like the one \nthat we have today. Perhaps just because Barack Obama did it that there \nis so much problem with it in the majority.\n  There is a bipartisan Senate bill crafted by Senator Alexander and \nSenator Patty Murray that the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office \nfound last week would save money, stabilize the insurance marketplace, \nand reduce the debt by $3.8 billion. That is all without anyone losing \ntheir insurance.\n  Why won't we take up that bill?\n  We never get an answer for that question.\n  What is it about trying to take healthcare away from poor people or \nthat we won't put a bill on the floor that has all the advantages and \nsavings that we know and that is totally bipartisan? Is it because the \nmajority knows it will pass?\n  Our Nation has urgent problems. Our infrastructure is crumbling, \neducation costs skyrocket so high so fast that it is unattainable to \nmany students. We desperately need to stabilize our health insurance \nmarkets by passing the compromise by Senators Alexander and Murray. \nThat is what we should be doing here today.\n  There are Members on both sides of the aisle who want to see \nimprovements to the board, but that is not what the bill does. It \nterminates it altogether. It is the wrong approach at definitely the \nwrong time.\n  Regardless of what you think about this board, we should be able to \nagree that this Congress has more important things to do than address a \nproblem that might not exist for 4 years, if at all.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.", "turn": 6, "speaker": "Ms. SLAUGHTER", "itemno": 10}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "B001248", "text": "  Mr. BURGESS.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the \nrule for my bill, H.R. 849, the Protecting Seniors' Access to Medicare \nAct of 2017.\n  Mr. Speaker, this bill would repeal the Independent Payment Advisory \nBoard, or IPAB, which was created solely as a cost containment \nmechanism as part of the Affordable Care Act. It has nothing to do \nabout quality of care or access to care. I can't think of anything more \nimportant, Mr. Speaker, that this Congress should be doing than \nproviding quality care and access to care for our senior citizens of \nthis country, some 58 million of them.\n  Whatever your feelings may be about the ACA, this provision has had \nstrong bipartisan opposition from its beginning, and it was not \ncontained in the House Democrat's version of the bill, but was jammed \nin by the Senate at the end.\n  If you still need convincing on just how unpopular this provision of \nthe law is, ask yourself: How often do we see a bill come to the floor \nunder a rule that has 270 bipartisan cosponsors?\n  Passing this bill will send a strong message to our Senate colleagues \nthat the time to act is now.\n  Mr. Speaker, the overwhelming bipartisan support for Members is only \noutdone by the overwhelming nationwide coalition of support.\n  Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from the Protect My \nDoctor and Me coalition, a letter that has been signed by nearly 800 \ngroups representing patients, providers, and all sectors of the \nhealthcare industry with support in all 50 States.\n\n                                                September 6, 2017.\n       Dear Member of Congress: The undersigned organizations--\n     representing Medicare beneficiaries and patients, all sectors \n     of the healthcare industry as well as employers and other \n     purchasers of health care--believe strongly that the Medicare \n     program must protect patient access to quality healthcare. \n     The Independent Payment Advisory Board (IPAB), a provision of \n     the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA), not \n     only poses a threat to that access but also, once activated, \n     will shift healthcare costs to consumers in the private \n     sector and infringe upon the decisionmaking responsibilities \n     and prerogatives of the Congress. We request your support to \n     repeal IPAB.\n       IPAB, as constructed under PPACA, is a board comprised of \n     Presidential appointees who will be charged with making \n     recommendations to cut Medicare expenditures if spending \n     growth reaches an arbitrary level. Once the Secretary of \n     Health and Human Services (HHS) implements an IPAB \n     recommendation, that action is not subject to administrative \n     or judicial review. As constructed, IPAB is granted \n     unprecedented powers--even the ability to change laws \n     previously enacted by Congress--with virtually no oversight.\n       The potential impact of this board causes deep concern \n     among our organizations and the millions of Americans we \n     represent. IPAB proponents suggest that the board will be an \n     asset in developing needed healthcare delivery reforms. That \n     goal, however, is not realistically achievable. The law \n     requires IPAB to achieve scoreable savings within a one-year \n     time period. Thus, instead of pursuing long-term reforms that \n     may not achieve immediate savings, IPAB is more likely to \n     consider short-term savings in the form of payment cuts for \n     healthcare providers. This was, in fact, the conclusion of \n     the Congressional Budget Office, which stated that IPAB is \n     most likely to focus on payment rates or methodologies for \n     services provided by non-exempt providers.\n       This would be devastating for patients, affecting access to \n     care and innovative therapies. Already, the number of \n     physicians unable to accept new Medicare patients due to low \n     reimbursement rates has been increasing over the past several \n     years. IPAB-generated payment reductions would only increase \n     the access difficulties faced by too many Medicare \n     beneficiaries. Furthermore, payment reductions to Medicare \n     providers will almost certainly result in a shifting of \n     health costs to employers and consumers in the private \n     sector.\n       Under IPAB's provisions, the responsibility for enacting \n     healthcare system changes of this magnitude would be \n     transferred from the legislative branch to the executive. \n     More specifically, an unelected board without adequate \n     oversight or accountability would be taking actions \n     historically reserved for the public's elected \n     representatives in the U.S. House and Senate. This is an \n     unacceptable decisionmaking process for a program that \n     millions of our nation's seniors and individuals with \n     disabilities rely upon.\n       Moreover, if IPAB does not act within the law's required \n     timeframe or if IPAB members are not appointed by the \n     President or confirmed by the Senate, the law transfers \n     IPAB's responsibilities solely to the HHS Secretary. This \n     places an enormous degree of power in the hands of one \n     unelected individual.\n       We strongly support bringing greater cost-efficiency to the \n     Medicare program. We also advocate continuing efforts to \n     improve the quality of care delivered to Medicare \n     beneficiaries.\n       The Independent Payment Advisory Board will achieve neither \n     of these objectives and will only weaken, not strengthen, a \n     program critical to the health and well-being of current and \n     future beneficiaries. We urge Congress to eliminate the IPAB \n     provision.\n           Sincerely,\n       1 in 9: The Long Island Breast Cancer Action Coalition; 60 \n     Plus Alabama; 60 Plus Association; A Partnership of \n     Diabetics;

Mr. Speaker, let me just read one paragraph:\n  ``IPAB, as constructed under PPACA, is a board comprised of \nPresidential appointees who will be charged with making recommendations \nto cut Medicare expenditures if spending growth reaches an arbitrary \nlevel. Once the Secretary of Health and Human Services implements an \nIPAB recommendation, that action is not subject to administrative or \njudicial review. As constructed, IPAB is granted unprecedented powers--\neven the ability to change laws previously enacted by Congress--with \nvirtually no oversight.'' Peter Orszag, President Obama's Office of \nManagement and Budget Director, said it was the largest transfer of \npower from the legislative branch to a bureaucratic branch since the \nFederal Reserve, and that is a mouthful.\n  Democrats and Republicans may not always agree on how to get things \ndone around here, but when you can bring 270 House Members together on \none bill, it is pretty clear that something needs to be done \nimmediately.\n  We were lucky this summer that the Medicare trustees report indicated \nthat IPAB would not trigger until 2021 or 2022, but our back is against \nthe wall and we must act. We cannot afford to let 15 unelected, \nunaccountable bureaucrats make decisions for our Nation's 58 million \nMedicare enrollees with no checks from Congress.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this.\n  I refer also to a bipartisan letter I signed on December 17, 2009, \nthat was written to the Speaker of the House at that time, Nancy \nPelosi, which said the following:\n  ``Finally, as the people's elected representatives, we must oppose \nany proposal to create a board that would surrender our legislative \nauthority and responsibility for a Medicare program to unelected, \nunaccountable officials within the very same branch of government that \nis charged with implementing the Medicare policies that affect so many \nAmericans.''\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this rule and support \nthe final passage because that will show the American people you stand \nwith America's seniors.", "turn": 9, "speaker": "Mr. ROE of Tennessee", "itemno": 13}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "B001248", "text": "  Mr. BURGESS.

Care would be rationed, physicians like myself would be \nunable to pursue the course of treatment we think is appropriate for \nour patients, seniors would lose access to the best care, all without \nany input from Congress or any accountability to voters.\n  With all of the divisiveness that we see in Washington, the IPAB \nrepeal bill we consider today is genuinely bipartisan.

Under the current law, section 1899A, 42 U.S.C. clearly \nstates: ``The proposal shall not include any recommendation to ration \nhealthcare; raise revenues or Medicare beneficiary premiums; increase \nthe cost sharing, including deductibles, coinsurance, and copayments; \nor otherwise restrict benefits or modify eligibility criteria.''\n\n\n  I regret I have to do that, because it is a direct contradiction of \nwhat my good friends on the other side have told the country and what I \nassume that they believe.\n  Mr. Speaker, Russia interfered with our 2016 election.

Mr. Speaker, I would like to include in the \nRecord the following letter:\n\n                                Congress of the United States,\n\n                                Washington, DC, December 17, 2009.\n     Hon. Nancy Pelosi,\n     Speaker, House of Representatives,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Madam Speaker: In July, 75 members of the U.S. House \n     of Representatives wrote to express strong opposition to \n     proposals, such as the ``Independent Medicare Advisory \n     Council (IMAC) Act of 2009'' and the ``Medicare Payment \n     Advisory Commission (MedPAC) Reform Act of 2009'' (H.R 2718, \n     S. 1110, S. 1380), that would divest Congress of its \n     authority for Medicare payment policy and place this \n     responsibility in an executive branch commission or board. \n     This letter clearly stated opposition to the inclusion of \n     these or any other similar proposals in health reform or any \n     other legislation, but with recent developments, we, the \n     undersigned members, believe it is imperative to restate our \n     strong opposition to any proposal or legislation that would \n     place authority for Medicare payment policy in an unelected, \n     executive branch commission or board.\n       Consistent with the July letter, on November 7, 2009, the \n     House passed the ``Affordable Health Care for America Act'' \n     (H.R. 3962) did not include provisions to create an unelected \n     Medicare board. Yet, at present, the Senate is considering \n     the ``Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2009,'' \n     which includes provisions to create an ``Independent Medicare \n     Advisory Board'' (IMAB) that would effectively end Congress's \n     authority over Medicare payment policy.\n       To create an unelected, unaccountable Medicare commission \n     as envisioned in the Senate's IMAB proposal would end \n     Congress's ability to shape Medicare to provide the best \n     policies for beneficiaries in our communities around the \n     country. Through the legislative process, and from Medicare's \n     beginning, Members have been able to represent the needs of \n     their communities by improving benefits for seniors and the \n     disabled, affecting policies that fill the health care \n     workforce pipeline, and ensuring that hospitals are equipped \n     to care for diverse populations across our individual \n     districts. Such a responsibility is one that is not taken, \n     nor should be given away, lightly.\n       These proposals would severely limit Congressional \n     oversight of the Medicare program, and to place this \n     authority within the executive branch, without Congressional \n     oversight or judicial review, would eliminate the \n     transparency of Congressional hearings and debate. Without \n     the open and transparent legislative process, Medicare \n     beneficiaries and the range of providers who care for them \n     would be greatly limited in their ability to help develop and \n     implement new policies that improve the health care of our \n     nation's seniors. An executive branch Medicare board would \n     also effectively eliminate Congress's ability to work with \n     the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to create and \n     implement demonstration and pilot projects designed to \n     evaluate new and advanced policies such as home care for the \n     elderly, the patient-centered medical home, new less invasive \n     surgical procedures, collaborative efforts between hospitals \n     and physicians, and programs designed to eliminate fraud and \n     abuse.\n       The creation of a Medicare board would also effectively \n     eliminate state and community input into the Medicare \n     program, removing the ability to develop and implement \n     policies expressly applicable to different patient \n     populations. Instead, national policies that would flow from \n     such a board would ignore the significant differences and \n     health care needs of states and communities. Geographic and \n     demographic variances that exist in our nation's health care \n     system and patient populations would be dangerously \n     disregarded. Furthermore, all providers in all states would \n     be required to comply even if these policies were detrimental \n     to the patients they serve. Such a commission could not only \n     threaten the ability of Medicare beneficiaries, but of all \n     Americans, to access the care they need.\n       Finally, as the people's elected representatives, we must \n     oppose any proposal to create a board that would surrender \n     our legislative authority and responsibility for the Medicare \n     program to unelected, unaccountable officials within the very \n     same branch of government that is charged with implementing \n     the Medicare policies that affect so many Americans. \n     Therefore, we must strongly oppose the creation of IMAB, \n     IMAC, a reconstituted MedPAC or any Medicare board or \n     commission that would undermine our ability to represent the \n     needs of the seniors and disabled in our own communities. \n     Again, we urge you to reject the inclusion of these or any \n     like proposal in health reform or any other legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n       Richard Neal, Gary Ackerman, Shelley Berkley, Brian \n     Bilbray, Tim Bishop, Marsha Blackburn, Mary Bono Mack, Ginny \n     Brown-Waite, Michael Burgess, G.K.

It is a \n     vote about what the House should be debating.\n       Mr. Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of \n     Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the \n     previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or \n     control the consideration of the subject before the House \n     being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous \n     question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the \n     subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling \n     of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the \n     House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes \n     the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to \n     offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the \n     majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated \n     the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to \n     a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to \n     recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (R-Illinois) said: \n     ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman \n     from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to \n     yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first \n     recognition.''\n       The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous \n     question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an \n     immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no \n     substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.'' \n     But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the \n     Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in \n     the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition, \n     page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the previous \n     question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is generally \n     not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member \n     controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of \n     offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by \n     voting down the previous question on the rule. . . . When the \n     motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the \n     time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering \n     the previous question. That Member, because he then controls \n     the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for \n     the purpose of amendment.''\n       In Deschler's Procedure in the U.S. House of \n     Representatives, the subchapter titled ``Amending Special \n     Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on \n     such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on \n     Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further \n     debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues: \n     ``Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a \n     resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control \n     shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous \n     question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who \n     controls the time for debate thereon.''\n       Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does \n     have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only \n     available tools for those who oppose the Republican \n     majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the \n     opportunity to offer an alternative plan.\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 27}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "B001248", "text": "  Mr. BURGESS.
