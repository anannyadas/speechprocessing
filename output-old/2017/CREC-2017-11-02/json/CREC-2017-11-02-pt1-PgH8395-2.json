Mr. Speaker, I rise today to highlight the recent \npassage of H.R. 1488, the Indiana Dunes National Park Act, which passed \nthe House unanimously yesterday.\n  This bill renames the Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore as the Indiana \nDunes National Park, creating the first national park in Indiana and \nthe 60th in the country.\n  The Indiana Dunes are a treasured source of natural beauty where \nHoosiers and their families can enjoy countless recreational \nactivities. It is a diverse landscape consisting of dunes, oak \nsavannas, swamps, bogs, marshes, prairies, rivers, and forests, \ncreating one of the most biologically diverse areas in the country. The \npark contains over 2,000 unique animal and plant species.\n  Making the Dunes National Lakeshore Indiana's first national park \nwill draw the attention of more Americans from around the country and \ngive them an opportunity to enjoy one of the most beautiful places in \nour land.\n  Mr. Speaker, I look forward to this bipartisan bill being quickly \npassed by the Senate and signed into law by the President.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mrs. WALORSKI", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "178", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H8395", "wkday": "Thursday", "day": "2", "month": "November"}, "related_bills": [{"type": "HR", "context": "FIRSTPARAGRAPH", "congress": "115", "number": "1488"}, {"type": "HR", "context": "OTHER", "congress": "115", "number": "1488"}], "doc_title": "INDIANA DUNES", "id": "CREC-2017-11-02-pt1-PgH8395-2"}
