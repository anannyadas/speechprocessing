Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to recognize \nseveral distinguished Members of the House for the next hour.\n  When our constituents show up on the first Tuesday in November to \nexercise their right of self-governance, they carry with them the \ndreams of a better Republic.\n\n\n  In 2016, the American people commissioned us with a task. They asked \nus to fight for jobs. They asked us to fight to fix healthcare. They \nasked us to roll back regulations. They asked us to secure the free \nworld. They asked us to secure our own borders.\n  The House of Representatives heard them. We have been busy developing \nand passing legislation that meaningfully improves the lives of \nAmericans. I commend the Speaker and his leadership in moving these \nbills through the House.\n  Unfortunately, much of the House's important work is stalled in the \nU.S. Senate. It is time the Senate pass important legislation and \nrestore trust in our Republic, because before this week, the House had \nsent 308 bills to the Senate that are still stalled in that Chamber. \nThis is more than any of the previous four Presidential administrations \nhad stalled at this same time in their first year.\n  For the record, the House of Representatives in the 115th Congress \nhas also passed more total bills than Houses in any of the last four \nPresidential administrations at this point. We are at 394 total bills \npassed.\n  The dreams of this great Republic cannot be realized by the House \nalone. The Senate must hear the people and come together around the \noften bipartisan measures we have been sending to them.\n  As a way of reminding the Senate, I would like to spend the next hour \nrecognizing Members to discuss some of the important bills passed by \nthe House of Representatives that now sit motionless in the U.S. \nSenate.\n  I am thankful for my colleagues who are joining me this evening to \ntalk about the House's successful legislative efforts.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Iowa (Mr. King) to talk \nabout the No Sanctuary for Criminals Act, H.R. 3003.", "turn": 3, "speaker": "Mr. BUCK", "itemno": 4}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "K000362", "text": "  Mr. KING of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Colorado \nfor organizing this Special Order and recognizing me to address it.\n  I would like to say at the start of this that the folks that had the \nSpecial Order ahead of us had not read the bill that they were \nexpounding upon, and it would be impossible for them to have done so. \nSo I want to remind the body of that, Mr. Speaker, and then address the \nNo Sanctuary Cities Act.\n  It is this: that we saw what happened in San Francisco when the \nmurderer of Kate Steinle had been deported five times. He was a seven-\ntime felon, five-time deportee. He still came back, and he came to San \nFrancisco because he knew that it is a sanctuary city, and if he got \ncrossways with the law for whatever it might be, sleeping on the street \nor shoplifting or any of the additional felonies that were brought \nagainst him, they were not going to notify immigration officials. They \nwere going to turn him back loose on the streets of San Francisco. If \nhe was taken care of as an indigent, they would turn him loose on the \nstreets of San Francisco.\n  So Kate Steinle now lies in her grave, her family grieves for her \nloss, and America felt that pain.\n  San Francisco is a sanctuary city, and now the entire State of \nCalifornia has declared themselves a sanctuary State.\n  I think, Mr. Speaker, about the hole in the wall. Butch Cassidy and \nthe Sundance Kid, they had a spot in the canyon there where you had to \nride through a notch to get in there, and they posted a guard there. \nAll the bad guys that wanted to get along with the other bad guys in \nthe West went in that place, and if law enforcement came, then they \nwould line up against them and block them from coming in to enforce the \nlaw.\n  That is essentially what we have got going on in city after city all \nover America: sanctuary cities operating under the erroneous idea that \nbecause their cities are so full of illegals, that if they would ever \nallow Federal immigration enforcement officials to work and cooperate \nwith local law enforcement, those folks might not be in America.\n\n  Well, I met with some people today at the Remembrance Project. These \nare the families who had their family members killed by illegal aliens \nwho are in America. Many of these illegal aliens who killed Americans \nand killed other illegal aliens and killed people who are here and \nlawfully present in America, many of them had criminal records. Many of \nthem had been interdicted by law enforcement, but the local \njurisdictions decided it wasn't politically correct to cooperate with \nFederal law.\n  Well, the Constitution of the United States is the supreme law of the \nland, and it is an enumerated power that Congress establish an \nimmigration policy. We do that, and we direct that those laws be \nenforced. The executive branch's job is to do that.\n  All throughout law enforcement, it has been seamless throughout all \nof my growing up years. I grew up in a law enforcement family. There \nwas no separation. There was no segregation between city police and \ncounty law enforcement officers, the sheriff's department, and highway \npatrol and DCI and FBI. When there was a crime that was committed, \neverybody worked together seamlessly.\n  How is it that these cities and now the State of California have \ncarved themselves out an exception to what has been a timeless, time-\nhonored, established cooperation between all levels of law enforcement?\n  So the No Sanctuary for Criminals Act, which was my bill, is now \nsitting on Mitch McConnell's desk with the scores of other bills that \nthe gentleman from Colorado has addressed, and it is one that says \nthere will be no sanctuary cities any longer and that we will be \ncutting off funds going to these cities until they get the message.\n\n\n  I think it is about time that the Justice Department moved on all of \nthe jurisdiction that they actually have, but we need to help them here \nin Congress. And it is about time that this bill, along with Sarah's \nLaw and Kate's Law, be moved off of Mitch McConnell's desk to the floor \nof the United States Senate.\n  That is just a small piece of the broad picture we are addressing \nhere tonight, Mr. Speaker. We need some action over in the Senate. If \nthey would get rid of that filibuster rule, we would see more action \nthan we are seeing today.\n  Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding to me, and I \nencourage him to continue this effort. I am going to stand with him on \nthis.

Mr. Speaker, I sincerely appreciate the \ngentleman's great leadership in this, and I am grateful to be able to \nspeak on this issue of life.\n  There have been, as mentioned a few moments ago, some 300, plus or \nminus, bills sent to the Senate that we have labored here in the House \nand worked through, negotiated, duked it out, so to speak, gotten ideas \non the table, worked it out, sent it over to the Senate, only to see \nthem sit there and do nothing.\n  Right in the midst of all of that, at the heart of it all, are a \ncouple of very important bills dealing with the issue of life, which is \nimportant to all of us. I firmly believe, and I know my colleagues do \nas well, that all human life at every stage of development is worthy of \nprotection. I am deeply honored and proud of the fact that this House \nhas passed a couple of extremely important bills in that regard.\n  As the gentleman from Colorado just mentioned, H.R. 7, No Taxpayer \nFunding for Abortion, by our friend from New Jersey, Chris Smith, and \nH.R. 36, the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act, by Trent Franks \nof Arizona,\n\n\nare fantastic bills. One basically says that the American taxpayer \nshould not be footing the bill to end the life of unborn children. It \nhas been sitting for over 200 days in the Senate without even a debate.\n  The other says that, after 20 weeks, when an unborn child is capable \nof feeling pain, we are not going abort that child in the midst of a \nperiod of time where pain is absolutely scientifically proven to be \nfelt. Again, that bill is sitting across the way in the Senate Chamber, \nand they have not done anything about it whatsoever.\n  These are important bills. These bills affect lives. Every day that \nthe Senate does nothing, lives are being lost.\n  The question is: Where is the Senate?\n  We all sit here and we wait and we wait and we wait. The time has \ncome that the Senate has to take ownership of what the American people \nelected not only us, but the American people elected them to do, and \nthat is the job, the task, the platform that we all ran on, and at the \nheart of that is the fight, the battle for life.\n  I am also proud of the fact that the House, in our appropriations \npackage, defunded Planned Parenthood. This is a promise that we made \nthe American people after the gruesome discovery of how Planned \nParenthood was selling baby body parts. Again, we just recognize that \nlife is a gift from God and it is precious and it is to be protected. \nIt is an inalienable right that we as Members of Congress have the \nresponsibility to defend those inalienable rights. Obviously, without \nthe right to life, there, likewise, is no right to liberty, and \ncertainly no right to the pursuit of happiness.\n  Again, the question is: Where is the Senate on these issues?\n  It is time that we join together. Again, I thank my friend for having \nthis Special Order and calling on the Senate to deal with this 60-vote \nthreshold that has become an enormous barrier, causing all of us to be \ndysfunctional in that which the American people sent us here to do.\n  Our conservative principles, as well as our whole Nation, rests upon \nus advancing these things that the American people sent us here to do, \nand at the heart of that is to defend life. I just join in calling on \nthe Senate to deal with this 60-vote rule and move forward on the \nagenda that we are here to do.\n  Again, I just thank the gentleman for his kindness in allowing me to \nspeak on this issue, which is important not only to me, but to all of \nus; and for his leadership on joining us in having a united voice, \ncalling our colleagues down the hallway here to do the job that they \nwere called on to do.", "turn": 6, "speaker": "Mr. JODY B.

Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend and colleague from \nColorado for yielding to me on such an important issue not only to my \ndistrict, not only to my city, not only to my State, but to our Nation.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise this evening to discuss a vital program within \nthe Department of Homeland Security, the Securing the Cities program.\n  The Domestic Nuclear Detection Office's Securing the Cities program \nenhances the ability of States and localities to detect and prevent \nterrorist attacks and other high-consequence events using nuclear and \nradiological materials in high-risk urban areas through the provisions \nof training, equipment, and other resources.\n  Securing the Cities began as a pilot program in 2006 in the New York \nCity region, including surrounding jurisdictions of New Jersey and \nConnecticut. Since that time, it has expanded to Los Angeles; Chicago; \nWashington, D.C.; and Houston. Once the program is fully implemented, \nit is estimated that it will protect nearly 100 million people \nnationwide, Americans.\n  Hailing from New York City and representing Staten Island and \nBrooklyn, I have seen firsthand the positive impact of the Securing the \nCities program. Since 2007, our region has purchased more than 13,000 \nradiation detectors and trained nearly 20,000 personnel.\n  I had the opportunity to observe an exercise in Brooklyn last year \nand witnessed New York City Police Department personnel using Securing \nthe Cities-procured equipment to locate and identify hidden \nradiological sources in a baseball stadium. During the exercise, I \nspoke with the participating officers and received a demonstration of \nthe different types of equipment they deployed.\n  This program is making a difference in New York City, and I support \nits continued expansion. That is why I introduced H.R. 655, the \nSecuring the Cities Act of 2017. This bill authorizes the Securing the \nCities program, underscoring our commitment to protecting our major \ncities from catastrophic terrorist attacks.\n  As we, unfortunately, saw earlier this week, our major cities, \nincluding my hometown of New York City, in particular, remain targets \nfor terrorist groups. We have to do everything we can to ensure the \nDepartment of Homeland Security and our State and local partners have \nthe tools they need to address the threats that we face. The Securing \nthe Cities program is one of those tools.\n  I am pleased that the House quickly passed my legislation earlier \nthis year on January 31. It is now time for the Senate to act. Mr. \nSpeaker, I urge the Senate to move swiftly to approve H.R. 655 to \nauthorize the Securing the Cities program and ensure its continued \nexpansion.\n  In April 2010, President Obama stated: ``The single biggest threat to \nU.S. security, both short term, medium term, and long term, would be \nthe possibility of a terrorist organization obtaining a nuclear \nweapon.''\n  Since that time, the FBI has disrupted attempts by smugglers in \nEastern Europe to sell nuclear materials to extremist groups and \ncriminal organizations. The threat has not abated.\n  I am thankful for the work of the Domestic Nuclear Detection Office \nto provide support and guidance to New York City and other urban areas \nto meet the threats we face.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge the Senate to quickly take action to pass the \nSecuring the Cities Act of 2017.

Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from Colorado, Mr. Buck, \nfor yielding to me. I am grateful for his leadership as a conservative. \nIt has been my honor to serve with him this past year. I appreciate him \nsharing some time with me tonight as I share several important stories.\n\n  Mr. Speaker, these are stories of real people, not just some people \nwho are distant to us. These are people that we know, people just like \nthis.\n  Mr. Speaker, one early January morning in 2015, a young man named \nGrant Ronnebeck began the graveyard shift at a QuikTrip convenience \nstore in my district. After his parents divorce, Grant took the \ninitiative to find a job working at this convenience store\n\n\nin Mesa, Arizona, to help his family pay the bills. He was only 21 \nyears old. He had his entire life ahead of him.\n  Just before 4 a.m., an angry customer walked in, demanded a pack of \ncigarettes, and dumped a handful of change on the store counter. Grant \nstarted to count the money, but he saw the customer pull a gun out and \npoint it directly at his head.\n  Grant tried to immediately hand over the cigarettes in a desperate \nattempt to save his life, but it was too late. The customer shot Grant \nin the face in cold blood, took the cigarettes, and casually walked out \nof the store.\n  Grant's father describes him as being his buddy from the minute he \nwas born and a person that brightened everybody. He did not leave the \nstore alive that night.\n  The customer's name was Apolinar Altamirano. He was an illegal alien \nwith a long criminal record, including violent crimes. He was held in \nFederal custody, but then released while he awaited deportation \nproceedings. Our government let Grant down when they allowed Grant's \nkiller to walk out of custody and onto our streets.\n  Altamirano should have remained in custody until he was deported, but \nhe was set free, and Grant was killed due to the government's failure \nto hold this violent criminal in custody until deported.\n  Sadly, Grant's story is not unique. Many Americans are aware of \nanother tragic incident, the case of Kate Steinle. Kate was 32 years \nold. She was walking along a San Francisco pier when an illegal alien \nshot and killed her. This illegal alien had just been released from \nprison again. He should have been held until deportation, but he, in \nfact, had been deported many times previously.\n\n\n  Even then, he was set free, only to kill Kate Steinle.\n  In 2014, Mesa, Arizona, Police Officer Brandon Mendoza was killed in \na wrong-way crash by an illegal alien who was driving under the \ninfluence of drugs and alcohol.\n  And in January 2016, Sarah Root was murdered by an illegal alien who \nwas drunk and drag racing in Omaha, Nebraska.\n  In each of these cases, Grant and Brandon, I am privileged to know \ntheir parents, Steve Ronnebeck and Mary Ann Mendoza. These are fierce \nadvocates who tirelessly work to make sure these types of tragedies \nnever happen to another family. I am grateful for their efforts, and I \nbelieve that we are making significant headway to stop these types of \ncatch and release programs that allow criminals to remain on our \nstreets.\n  In June of this year, the House of Representatives passed H.R. 3003, \nthe No Sanctuary for Criminals Act, and H.R. 3004, Kate's Law, \ntandemly. These bills would end the policies that contributed to the \ntragic deaths of Grant, Kate, Brandon, and Sarah.\n  I was pleased to coauthor the first bill, which included my \nlegislation, Grant's Law. Grant's Law is named in memory of Grant \nRonnebeck.\n  All Americans can agree that someone who is criminally violent should \nnot be released back on to the streets. Yet, for years, the Obama \nadministration's policies failed to protect Americans by allowing \ncriminally violent illegal aliens to roam our streets and \nneighborhoods.\n  These types of tragedies are preventable when the Federal Government \nenacts and enforces the No Sanctuary for Criminals Act and Kate's Law. \nCongress has begun to take meaningful action to bring these tragedies \nto an end, starting with the two bills we passed in June.\n  Chairman Bob Goodlatte showed leadership and commitment to ensure \nthese important bills received swift consideration. These two bills, if \nenacted and enforced, would protect innocent Americans to prevent \nfuture tragedies like those of Grant, Kate, Brandon, and Sarah.\n  When the bills passed out of the House, I hoped these bills would \nreceive a swift vote in the Senate. That has not happened. I am still \nhoping for this vote to take place. I call upon the leadership of the \nSenate to put these bills up for a floor vote.\n  We owe it to our constituents to put arcane tradition aside and to \npass policies that will protect them. Yet, even in a Republican-\ncontrolled Senate, we cannot receive an up-or-down vote on these \nimportant immigration enforcement bills.\n  Why is this?\n  Mr. Speaker, I firmly believe the answer lies in the fatally flawed \n60-vote rule. It is more commonly known as the filibuster, but the \nSenate's tradition is preventing consideration of nearly all \nlegislation passed from the House.\n  For example, look at our current situation. Since January, the House \nhas passed over 300 bills, including the two immigration and \nenforcement bills I have just discussed. These bills will most likely \nlanguish until the end of the term, in large part, due to the \nfilibuster rule.\n  So what can be done about this irresponsible inaction? Well, the \nSenate can change the rule. Indeed, the Senate must change the rule.\n  Many people do not realize that the 60-vote requirement is not even \nin the United States Constitution. It dates back to 1917, when the \nSenate agreed that debate could be cut off with a two-thirds majority \nvote. Decades later, when deciding a two-thirds vote was found to be \ntoo difficult to achieve, the Senate reduced the number of required \nvotes to three-fifths, or 60 of the current 100 Senators.\n  The filibuster is a tradition, barely a century old, less than half \nthe age of the U.S. Constitution.\n  There is a place for rules and traditions, but not when they obstruct \nthe will of American people. Is it honorable for the United States \nSenate to have a gentleman's agreement to keep bills from being voted \non, or to dilute our representation in the United States Senate?\n  Americans would rather that Congress pass just and reasonable laws \nthan to preserve extraconstitutional, institutional traditions. \nAmericans want our borders secure and our immigration laws to be \nenforced.\n  Congress is running out of time to keep its promises to the American \npeople. We promised to ensure that what happened to Kate, Grant, \nBrandon, and Sarah would not happen again. The House has done its duty. \nIt is time for the Senate to do its duty.\n  There are no excuses to allow these bills to die in the Senate. I \nencourage my friends in the Senate to eliminate the 60-vote rule and to \nconsider the two immigration enforcement bills that the House passed in \nJune. We must not allow inaction to be the enemy of our sworn \nresponsibilities as representatives of the American people.\n  Again, I thank my friend from Colorado.

Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from Arizona for his \ninsight, and I appreciate his comments here tonight.\n  Mr. Speaker, in 2010, President Obama and Congress passed the Dodd-\nFrank legislation that attempted to reform Wall Street and end the too-\nbig-to-fail problem. But instead of fixing the financial industry, \nDodd-Frank was mainly served to excessively regulate local community \nbanks, making it harder for individuals on Main Street to gain access \nto credit.\n  The Financial CHOICE Act, sponsored by Chairman Jeb Hensarling from \nthe Financial Services Committee, replaced Dodd-Frank with a system \nthat holds Wall Street accountable, while also making credit more \naccessible for Main Street America.

It has been stuck in the Senate for 148 days.\n  I yield to the gentleman from West Virginia (Mr. Mooney), my friend \nand colleague, who sits on the Financial Services Committee, to talk \nabout H.R. 10, the Financial CHOICE Act.\n", "turn": 11, "speaker": "Mr. BUCK", "itemno": 12}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "M001195", "text": "  Mr. MOONEY of West Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from \nColorado, Mr. Buck, for leading this Special Order effort and for \nrecognizing me to talk about this issue and the general problem in the \nSenate today of having legislation considered, debated, and passed in a \nway that we can go to conference committee.\n  As the gentleman mentioned, the Senate has already failed to act, and \nis currently failing to act, as we stand here, on over 270 House-passed \nbills. One of those bills is a really important one, very important to \nthe committee on which I serve.\n  I am proud to be on the Financial Services Committee. The tradition \nof\n\n\nthat position was held by my predecessor, Shelley Moore Capito, who \nserved on that committee for 14 years. Ably led by Chairman Jeb \nHensarling from Texas, we work in a bipartisan fashion, as much as we \npossibly can, to bring relief to the American people, give consumers \nchoices in banking products, and the ability to get a small loan or get \na mortgage for their house. We are doing very important work there.\n  So, as was mentioned, on June 8 of 2017, this year, here, the U.S. \nHouse of Representatives, where I now stand, passed H.R. 10, the \nFinancial CHOICE Act, by a vote of 233-186. I was very proud to vote \nfor that legislation, as I know were a lot of my colleagues.\n  The Financial CHOICE Act, if you are not familiar with the bill, \nafter the financial crisis in 2007, Democrats held all the Chambers in \nthe House, the Senate, and the Presidency, and they passed sweeping \nlegislation that fundamentally changed the way our economy works for \nthe worse; much more interference in your lives in banking, and the \nability to make loans and consider requests for bank loans were done.\n  Basically, Dodd-Frank is to the financial services industry what \nObamaCare is to the healthcare industry. It is a government-knows-\nbetter, one-size-fits-all, federally mandated set of laws that have \nhurt the very people they claim they want to help. It hurts the same \npeople they want to help. So we are repealing most of that, and we are \ngoing to empower consumers, give you the choices back.\n  So we have passed this bill. Let me just give you one example of \nsomething in the bill, to be specific. There was something that was \ndesignated in the Dodd-Frank bill called too big to fail. You may \nremember that term, ``too big to fail.''\n  That is a situation where Washington bureaucrats had decided that \ncertain banks--the theory is that they are so essential to the global \neconomy that failure would be catastrophic. So it takes the ability to \nfail out of the banks' system, which then makes them act more risky. \nBig does not necessarily refer to the size of the company, just what \nthe government decides is essential, too big to fail.\n  So the first bank that was too big to fail was Bear Stearns. In March \nof 2008, the Federal Reserve lent $30 billion to JPMorgan Chase to buy \nthe failing investment bank. Bear was a small bank, but very well-\nknown, and there was a worry that it would destroy confidence in other \nbanks. So your tax dollars were used to, essentially, bail out banks.\n  So this bill repeals the authority of the Financial Stability \nOversight Council to designate firms as systematically important \ninstitutions. It prohibits the use of Exchange Stabilization Funds to \nbail out banks. Most Americans I talk to don't think their taxpayer \ndollars should be used to bail out banks, so this bill would stop that.\n  So we passed that bill. We sent it to the Senate. We didn't think the \nSenate would pass the exact same bill, word for word, that the House \npassed. We thought they would consider our bill, take the parts they \nlike, maybe change some parts, maybe add some parts, or move some \nparts, pass a bill in the Senate, and then we would go to a conference \ncommittee to reconcile the differences.\n  One of the biggest travesties I have seen around here of the \npolitical process, Mr. Speaker, is the failure to have conference \ncommittees in the Congress any longer. The House passes all these \nbills, over 300 over there; 270 are waiting for the Senate to do \nanything on. Anything. And we wait for the Senate to act so we can have \na conference committee and reconcile the differences.\n  It is important to understand that no one in the House is demanding \nthey get their way on every bill, every provision, all the time. We \nsimply want to have a product sent to the Senate, have the Senate do \ntheir job, do their due diligence, pass legislation in whatever form \nthey can get out of the Senate, and have a chance to go to conference \ncommittee, reconcile the differences.\n  There is some give-and-take there. They won't get everything they \nwant. We may not get everything we want. You can reconcile those \ndifferences, and it has to go back and pass again.\n  Over the past 3 years, my third year in Congress now, I have taken to \nreminding folks things they learned in fifth grade, in fifth grade \ngrade school, about how I am just a bill sitting on Capitol Hill, and \nhow it is supposed to go to one Chamber; then it is supposed to go to \nthe other, and they appoint a conference committee to reconcile the \ndifferences.\n  Instead, as the previous speaker, Congressman Biggs from Arizona, \nmentioned, the filibuster is abused. You have 48 Democrats in the \nSenate who filibuster everything. Everything. And for some reason, my \ncolleagues on the majority side of the aisle, the Republicans, don't \nput the bills on the floor to make the American people see them \nfilibuster, and obstruct, and shut down, avoid conference committees, \navoid passing anything in the Senate that would require action, and, \ntherefore, just stop anything from happening. It is a travesty of the \npolitical process.\n  Neither Republican nor Democrats should stand for such an abusive \nsystem in the Senate. So I think we should put the bills over there and \nmake them act. We have actually started passing pieces of the CHOICE \nAct, one small bill at a time, in order to get other stuff over to the \nSenate, in the hope that they will just do something, act on something.\n\n  But we shouldn't have to do that, frankly, Mr. Speaker, because the \nSenate can simply pass any bill they want, or any Senate bills they \nwant, and then we can consider it in the House as well. We have led by \npassing the CHOICE Act bill, which is the right thing to do.\n  You know, as disappointing as it was to see the U.S. Senate fail to \npass anything on healthcare, maybe the one silver lining was the \nAmerican people could finally see what happens if three Republicans \njoin with 48 Democrats to vote against the bill. We did not have the \nvotes to pass anything on healthcare, and the whole healthcare reform \nplan died at that moment.\n  We are sitting here today with a failing healthcare system that is \ngoing to continue to fail. ObamaCare is going to continue to fail. It \nis not getting any better. It is getting worse.\n  Look, our bill wasn't perfect, Mr. Speaker, but at least we did \nsomething in the House to address the problem. I am not saying this \nbill is perfect, the CHOICE Act for financial services, but we are \ndoing something to address the problem that consumers are demanding, \nwhere they can have more choice and more access to funds to buy a home \nor start a small business. We are doing something about it, and the \nSenate is doing nothing. They don't pass anything.\n  In fact, we have passed all 12 appropriations bills in this Chamber. \nAll 12 are sitting over there in the Senate, waiting for someone to \nact.\n  I think the first thing they should do is bring up the military \nfunding bill. We are in November already. In December, next month, \nfunding runs out. We have passed our appropriations bills. The Senate \nis doing nothing on appropriations bills.\n  They should bring that military bill to the floor of the Senate, \nright now, and have a vote. It passed this Chamber with a strong, \nbipartisan majority. Funding the military is not a partisan issue. \nThere are votes, I believe, in the Senate and the House to fund the \nmilitary.\n  But if the 48 Democrat Senators want to filibuster, abuse their \npower, abuse this filibuster tradition, which was mentioned is not in \nthe Constitution, it is simply a courtesy extended to the minority \nparty; if they want to continue to abuse that power, the American \npeople should see them, ruthlessly, politically, try to shut down the \nmilitary, and then try to blame the President or blame the House when \nthey won't pass anything.\n  They should pass a military appropriations bill that helps fund our \ntroops. We will reconcile the differences and send it to the \nPresident's desk. That, ladies and gentlemen, is how the process is \nsupposed to work. That is what kept our democratic republican form of \ngovernment, constitutional form of government, with democratic \nelections, the rule of law, a republican constitution; that is what has \nkept our country, to this point, functional and working well, having \nthat bipartisan, bicameral process.\n  What is currently happening is really a travesty to this process, \nwhere it is being abused by the Senate. They have all these bills over \nthere. It is high time for them to take action, pass\n\n\nsomething, pass the best product they can on this issue, and let's go \nto conference committee and reconcile the differences.\n\n\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge the Senate to act as quickly as possible on the \nCHOICE Act, on whatever provisions they want to. We are trying to \nrepeal the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Another part of that, \nthe fiduciary rule, has really hurt consumers. These are other parts of \nthe CHOICE Act that need action.

Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from Colorado (Mr. Buck) \nfor taking the opportunity to highlight some of the good work the House \nhas accomplished this year. I urge my colleagues in the Senate to build \non these accomplishments so that Congress as a whole can keep their \npromises to the American people.\n  As Congress continues to face the preeminent task of repairing our \nNation's healthcare system, first and foremost, we must establish the \nproper foundation for a competitive and consumer-driven health \ninsurance marketplace. The Competitive Health Insurance Reform Act of \n2017 will restore the application of Federal antitrust and competition \nlaws to the health insurance industry.\n  Ending the special interest exemption is the first step to broader \nhealthcare reform. Popular cost-reducing reform priorities, such as \nselling insurance across State lines and developing diverse consumer-\ndriven plans, are predicated on the robust competitive markets this \nbill will ensure.\n  The McCarran-Ferguson Act of 1945 exempted the insurance industry \nfrom the Sherman Act and the Clayton Act, acts that have the purpose of \nensuring fair competition. This broad exemption was intended to assist \nthe newly developing business of insurance so that those companies \ncould set sustainable premiums by permitting data sharing between \ninsurance companies.\n  However, after 70 years, it is apparent that the broad-stroked \nexemption created by Congress in the 1940s was not wise. Over the \ndecades, and expeditiously since the passage of ObamaCare in 2009, the \nhealth insurance market has devolved into one of the least transparent \nand most anticompetitive industries in the United States.\n  It is clear that the continued exemption of the health insurance \nindustry from the full application of the Federal antitrust laws has \nhad an unfair impact on consumers. It shows up as artificially higher \npremiums, unfair insurance restrictions, harmful policy exclusions, and \nsimply no diversity of choice.\n  These antiquated exemptions are no longer necessary. There is no \nreason in law, policy, or logic for the health insurance industry to \nhave special exemptions that are different from all other businesses in \nthe United States.\n  Repeal of the specific section of the McCarran-Ferguson Act, which \napplies only to health insurance, has strong bipartisan support. A form \nof this legislation passed the Democratic-controlled House during the \n111th Congress by a vote of 406-19 and passed the Republican-led House \nin the 112th Congress by a voice vote.\n  Similar legislation has been introduced by multiple Democratic \nMembers of the House, and the text of my bill has been included in the \nRepublican Study Committee's healthcare reform bill for the last four \nCongresses in a row.\n  In March of this year, this pro-market reform received its biggest \nshow of support yet, passing by an overwhelming majority of 416-7. Now, \nwhen 416 Members of the House agree, it sends a strong call to action \nin the Senate.\n  As a dentist, I know how important robust competition is to dynamic \nand effective health insurance. It should protect the patient as well \nas the healthcare provider. It should uniformly apply associated checks \nand balances that incentivize competition and prevent monopolies. \nToday, in the healthcare market, those equally applied antitrust \nprotections just simply don't exist.\n  I don't have a crystal ball that will tell you what the future holds \nfor healthcare or what it will look like. I don't think anybody knows. \nBut I can tell you that history is an important guide. The 70-year \nantitrust exemption for health insurance has strangled competition and \nresulted in a consolidated, anticompetitive, and nontransparent scheme \ncontrolled by seven megacorporations. That is not what we want for our \nfuture.\n  Instead, let's liberate the market by removing this antitrust \nexemption. Imagine what could exist when we put the patient first and \ndemand that health insurance companies compete for their business. This \nmarket should be patient-centric, patient-focused, and provide a \nvariety of affordable, quality options that empower patient involvement \nand accountability.\n  The passage of the Competitive Health Insurance Reform Act into law \nis an important first step toward increasing competition in the health \ninsurance market and will assist in setting the foundation for real \ncompetitive and patient-centered healthcare reform.\n  I thank my friends in the House for their strong support, and at the \nsame time, promises were made in the Senate to get a vote on the Senate \nfloor. I urge my colleagues in the Senate to build upon the good work \nof this Chamber and do their part to restore competition in the health \ninsurance industry.\n  There is an old saying: Trust is a series of promises kept.\n  Keep the promise.

For the past 30 years, our technology \nhas drastically advanced, but our electronic communications policy has \nbeen stuck in the 1980s.

This bill simply requires the government to have a \nwarrant if they are going to search your email.\n  This legislation passed on voice vote. After 269 days, the bill still \nsits in the Senate Judiciary Committee.\n  I yield to my friend and colleague, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. \nPoe), to speak about this important legislation.", "turn": 15, "speaker": "Mr. BUCK", "itemno": 16}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "P000592", "text": "  Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Arizona \n(Mr. Buck) for yielding and for doing this Special Order.\n  Most Members of Congress agree, I believe, that the Constitution \nshould be followed. There are certain rights in the Constitution that \nare very, very important to all of us. One of those is the right of \nprivacy, enumerated specifically in the Fourth Amendment.\n  The Fourth Amendment is unique to America. Other countries don't have \nthe Fourth Amendment. We have it in the United States to protect the \nprivacy of Americans.\n\n\n  Let me give you a little history.\n  As Congressman Buck pointed out, back in 1986, which was an eternity \nago when you start talking about the digital age, Congress passed \nlegislation to protect the emails that people had on their server for 6 \nmonths. The idea was that people wouldn't keep their emails. They would \ndelete them, and 6 months was a good enough time to protect those \nemails from the spies in our government--I will use that phrase, that \nis my phrase--and that is the current law. But here is what has \nhappened over that 30 years.\n  Many Americans stored their emails after that 6-month period. They \nstore them in the cloud, for example. Americans store their schedules \nin the cloud. They store photographs in the cloud.\n  When Americans store those items that are over 6 months old in the \ncloud, they are not protected against the search by our government of \nthat email, of those photographs, of that schedule. In fact, searches \ncan take place without the knowledge of the person whose email is being \nsearched, without the approval of that individual, and the government \nnever notifies that individual that that email stored in the cloud was \nsearched because, under current law, the American citizen is only \nprotected for emails stored on their server up to 6 months.\n  So after about 4 years of working on this legislation with my friend \nZoe Lofgren from California, bipartisan, we presented to Congress H.R. \n387, the Email Privacy Act. As Congressman Buck said, on February 7, to \nbe exact, of this year, that passed by voice vote on this floor, and we \nsent it down the hallway to the siesta Senate to take a vote over \nthere, and they have yet to vote on it.\n  So what does that legislation do? It protects the right of privacy of \nAmericans. It requires government to follow the Constitution.\n  I was a former criminal court judge in Texas for 22 years. Like Mr. \nBuck, I was also a prosecutor in the DA's office in Houston.\n  The Fourth Amendment of the Constitution--remembering that this is \nunique to America--protects Americans, their persons, their houses, \ntheir papers, and their personal effects from the intrusion of \ngovernment unless government has probable cause and government gets a \nsearch warrant. That is the law. That is the Fourth Amendment.\n  If government has a probable cause, go get a warrant from a judge. I \nsigned hundreds of warrants from law enforcement as a judge.\n  A simple example: the government can't search our mail, snail mail as \nit is now called. When you put a letter in the mailbox and the \npostmaster picks it up and sends it across the fruited plain and it \nlands in somebody else's mailbox, government cannot generally go into \nthat letter and seize it for any purpose unless they have a warrant to \ndo so.\n\n  There are some exceptions, but government can seize your emails after \n6 months if they are stored in the cloud, as I already mentioned, \nwithout a warrant. So this legislation basically requires government to \nfollow the Constitution.\n  We have heard about the widespread abuse--that is my opinion--of the \nNSA over the last several years, the government agencies that felt like \nthey had a blank check to search and seize Americans' information \nwithout their knowledge, without their approval, and without a warrant. \nThis legislation goes to prevent that and simply requires that \ninformation stored in the cloud--emails, photographs, schedules, or \nwhatever--the government can go get it, but the government has got to \nget a search warrant to seize that information.\n  That is what this legislation does. It protects the Fourth Amendment. \nIt protects Americans. It is simple legislation. It passed the House on \nvoice vote, yet the Senate refuses to protect Americans from unlawful \nsearches without the knowledge of Americans. We need to pass the \nlegislation that Zoe Lofgren and I have sponsored that has passed the \nHouse to protect that basic right.\n  Mr. Speaker, I think our Senators would all vote ``yes'' for the \nlegislation. They believe in the Constitution like the rest of us. They \nbelieve in the Fourth Amendment like the rest of us.\n  So let's get a vote. Another piece of legislation the House has \npassed. We have done our job. We want the Senate to follow up and pass \nthis good legislation to make it the law of the land so Americans are \nmore secure in their papers and their effects and their homes.\n  And that is just the way it is.\n\n", "turn": 16, "speaker": "Mr. POE of Texas", "itemno": 17}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "B001297", "text": "  Mr. BUCK.

It is the first time in decades that that has happened. I am \nproud that our Chamber worked hard to return to a regular \nappropriations process, and I can tell you that there were many late \nnights spent looking through amendment after amendment both in the \nRules Committee hearing room and on the House floor.
