Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the hard work \nand significant impact of numerous nonprofit organizations in Bucks \nCounty, Pennsylvania.\n  Recently, I had the opportunity to meet with a group of CEOs from \nnonprofits across Bucks County.

Buck International, the David Library of \nthe\n\n\nAmerican Revolution, the Mercer Museum and Fonthill Castle, Libertae, \nThe Open Link, YWCA Bucks County, and the Central Bucks County Family \nYMCA--Doylestown Branch.
