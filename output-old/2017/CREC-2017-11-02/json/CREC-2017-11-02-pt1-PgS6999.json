Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate the \nMissouri Association of Student Financial Aid Personnel, MASFAP, which \nis celebrating its 50th anniversary. MASFAP organized in 1967 with a \nsteering committee of five members. Today the association has grown to \nover 800 members. The observance of MASFAP's 50th anniversary provides \nan opportunity to recognize the work of Missouri's student financial \naid personnel and the association's partnerships and to raise awareness \nabout the affordability of a postsecondary education.\n  MASFAP is a dynamic association dedicated to serving and advocating \nfor practitioners, users, and providers of student financial aid \nprograms. Most families and students are aware of student financial aid \nprograms because they provide valuable funds to assist in the costs of \na postsecondary education, without which many would be unable to \nachieve their education goals.\n  As a former high school teacher and university president, I know how \nfortunate it is for Missouri to have so many great post-secondary \neducation options. With the assistance of student financial aid \nadministrators throughout Missouri, students are learning about the \nresources available to help them attend one of the great schools of \ntheir choice. As a result, students are getting the education and \ntraining they need to succeed.\n  When I served as Missouri Secretary of State, I had the opportunity \nto sign the first articles of incorporation for MASFAP. Today I thank \nthe association and all its members for their work and congratulate \nthem on their 50th anniversary.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. BLUNT", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 3}], "header": {"chamber": "Senate", "num": "178", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "S6999", "wkday": "Thursday", "day": "2", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS", "id": "CREC-2017-11-02-pt1-PgS6999", "title": "ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS"}
