{"content": [{"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "H001041", "text": "  Mr. HELLER. Mr. President, this week, we have the unique opportunity \nto move forward on promises we made to the American people last year, \nconfirming judges and providing tax relief to hard-working Americans. \nThe American people sent us to Congress to complete this critical work, \nand we must stop at nothing to do it. We have already taken significant \nsteps to address both of these issues by confirming 13 judges, with 5 \nmore this week, and passing a budget with instructions for tax reform.\n  There is still much more that we need to do, and I stand ready to \nstay here until that job is done. Most people can't go home until their \nwork is finished; I don't think we should either. Imagine dropping your \ncar off at the auto mechanic and, instead of staying to finish the job, \nthey leave at 3 p.m. to go home because that is convenient for their \nschedule; yet you still have to pay them for a full day's work. That is \neffectively what we have been doing here in Congress, and that needs to \nstop. We need to work as much as possible to ensure that the Federal \njudiciary is filled with judges that will uphold the Constitution and \nbring us closer to providing tax relief for the American people.\n  We need to have a fully occupied, fully functioning Federal judiciary \nto ensure that Americans' constitutional rights are upheld. In almost \n10 months, we have started to address the issue of judicial vacancies \nby confirming 13 judges, most notably Justice Gorsuch, who has already \nserved as a strong, conservative voice on the Supreme Court. As a \nfellow westerner, I was proud to vote for such a qualified judge to \nserve in our Nation's highest Court.\n  Beyond the vacancy we filled on the Supreme Court, there are \nvacancies on all levels of our Federal judiciary. We cannot forget the \nimportance of every single court that makes up the Federal system. We \nmust prioritize confirming judges to fill these openings, especially \nthose deemed judicial emergencies. The fact that we have so many \njudicial emergencies is incredibly concerning and should be a wake-up \ncall to all Senators, especially those who are slowing down this \nimportant process.\n  The President is continuing to send us well-qualified nominees, and \nChairman Grassley has done an excellent job of moving nominees through \nthe committee process. I am especially encouraged that this week we are \nconfirming five more judges, including four circuit court judges. This \nis the pace we need to keep. If that means working 24/7 to continue \nconfirming these constitutionalists, you can count me in. Confirming \nFederal judges is a unique duty of the U.S. Senate, and we cannot allow \nobstructionism from the other side of the aisle to prevent us from \nfilling vacancies throughout the country.\n  It is clear that when judges are brought to the floor for a vote by a \nhealthy majority, the gridlock being caused is purely political. \nBecause of this, leadership is having to file cloture on all of these \njudicial nominees, and some of my colleagues across the aisle\n\n\nare just running the debate clock on these nominees instead of actually \ndebating. We have what is known as a 1-hour rule in the Senate, and I \nthink it is time to start enforcing it.\n  Members are entitled to their opinions, and, as the deliberative \nbody, we should debate nominees. But if you are going to debate a \nnominee, I think you actually need to come here and speak about them. \nYou can't just hide behind your desk and run the debate clock. If you \nhave a problem with a nominee, then you should come to the floor and \nvoice your concerns. If you are not willing to do this, then you \nshouldn't hold this nominee hostage to an artificial clock. This is \nwhat is wrong in Washington. We should use debate time on a nominee to \ndebate the nominee, and if there is no more debate, then we should vote \non that nominee and move on to the next one.\n  The Constitution guarantees the right to a speedy trial. As the body \nthat confirms judges to make that constitutional right possible, we \nhave a critical responsibility, and we need to do whatever it takes to \nfulfill this duty. In order to deliver swift justice throughout the \ncountry, these seats need to be filled.\n\n  I am ready and willing to work day and night, weekends and holidays, \nto do what Nevadans sent me to Washington to do and to accomplish. As \nthe leader mentioned last week, we should work through the week of \nThanksgiving. Hard-working Americans don't go home until their work is \ncomplete, and neither should we. That work also includes reforming our \nTax Code, providing desperately needed relief to the middle class.\n  Today Chairman Brady and the Ways and Means Committee released a \ndraft of their tax bill, which is another enormous step forward in \nproviding meaningful tax relief to Nevadans and other hard-working \nAmericans across this country. Middle-class tax relief is particularly \ncritical to the residents of my home State of Nevada. Whether it is the \nsingle mother from Gardnerville who doesn't receive child support, \nworks full time, and is simply trying to make ends meet or the \nentrepreneur in Elko who is fighting hard to get his small business off \nthe ground and wondering whether he will ever catch a break and be able \nto afford his first employee, I continue to hear from diligent, hard-\nworking Nevada families and small business owners who are struggling to \ncover their expenses and get ahead in life.\n  For too many people, the American dream--previously achievable \nthrough hard work, sheer determination, and playing by the rules--feels \nas though it is slipping away. That is in part because, for too long, \nNevadans and Americans across this country have faced stagnant wages \nand slow economic growth.\n  Under the failed economic policies of the previous administration, we \nhave suffered through 8 years of historically low economic growth. In \nfact, in those 8 years, we didn't have a single year in which the \neconomy grew by 3 percent. As a result, wages and workers suffered. As \na result, job creation suffered. And as a result, middle-class \nAmericans like you and your neighbors suffered.\n  We still bear the scars of the Obama-era economic policies today. \nMedian household incomes in Nevada are $7,000 lower today than they \nwere 10 years ago. Nevada families are more likely to be living \npaycheck to paycheck than families living in nearly every other State. \nIt is fair to say--in Nevada at least--the recession has never really \nended. To me, this situation is unacceptable. I am doing everything in \nmy power to right the economic wrongs that have been committed by the \nprevious administration.\n  Under the leadership of the new administration, however, we are \nstarting to see our economy improve. There are positive signs \neverywhere. Last week, the Commerce Department announced that for the \nsecond quarter in a row, the economy had grown by at least 3 percent. \nThis impressive growth occurred despite hurricanes that destroyed the \nhomes and businesses of our good friends and colleagues in Texas and in \nFlorida. Despite these natural disasters, if 3 percent economic growth \nis possible under the leadership of President Trump and a unified \nRepublican government, just think about how much more we can add to \nthis growth by passing comprehensive tax reform.\n  As a member of that tax writing committee, I have been working with \nmy colleagues to craft a tax package that accomplishes three major \ngoals: First, create more jobs; second, increase wages; and third, \nboost Americans' competitiveness worldwide.\n  What does tax relief mean to you, the average Nevadan who works hard \nand is trying to provide a better life for his or her children and save \nfor a secure retirement? It means cutting your taxes so that you can \nkeep more of your hard-earned money. It means a bigger child tax credit \nto help you confront the increasing costs of raising children. It means \na simpler and fairer tax code that you yourself can understand. Lower \nrates for business mean more jobs, higher wages, and growth in our \ncommunities--all of which will benefit you. Taken together, all these \nthings mean that you will have a profound increase in your take-home \npay and your economic opportunities.\n  A recent study by the White House Council of Economic Advisers found \nthat reducing the corporate tax rate by 15 percent alone would increase \nhousehold incomes by an average of $4,000. A similar study by a Boston \nUniversity economist put the increase at $3,500. I don't know about \nyou, but I think the average American could do a lot with an additional \n$3,500 to $4,000 in his or her bank account.\n  As a son of a school cook and an auto mechanic, I understand the \ndiscipline and the hard work that go into every dollar and every \npaycheck, and I am working to see that you have more of it in your back \npocket. I am confident that we will fulfill these promises, but that \nwill take a commitment from our colleagues to stay here and work.\n  In addition to overhauling the Tax Code and confirming judges, we \nhave many other significant legislative responsibilities to complete. I \nbelieve we must spend as much time as necessary, including working \nthrough the scheduled November constituent work period, to fulfill our \ncommitment to the American people.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. HELLER", "itemno": 0}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
