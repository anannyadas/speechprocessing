{"content": [{"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "S001197", "text": "  Mr. SASSE. Mr. President, I rise on the floor with a simple message. \nWe should completely dispel with the fiction that the American Bar \nAssociation is a fair and impartial arbiter of facts. This is a sad \nreality, but it is the reality.\n  Let's back up. We in this body have taken an oath to uphold and \ndefend the Constitution of the United States. Considering judicial \nnominees who have lifetime appointments is the most important thing \nthis Senate will do over the weeks ahead. It demands the full attention \nof every single Member--Republican, Democrat, and Independent. This \nought to be an opportunity for this body to pause and stand back from \nthe frenzy of day-to-day media cycles and cable news shouting and \nrecommit ourselves to basic American civics and some very basic \nAmerican ideas: the idea that our three branches of government have \nthree separate roles; the idea that we in the article I branch, the \nlawmakers, make the laws because we stand before the people and can be \nhired and fired--if the people are going to be in charge of our system, \nthey need to be able to fire the people who make the laws--the idea \nthat judges are explicitly not to make law; the idea that judges do not \nhave R and D, Republican and Democrat, behind their names but rather \nthat judges should be dispassionately ruling on the law and the facts; \nand the idea that all of us, temporary public servants, although the \njudiciary have lifetime appointments, can be upholding and defending a \nlimited system of government, again, through our three differentiated \nroles.\n  Unfortunately, over the last few days in this body, it has become \nclear that some of us are attempting to outsource our constitutional \nduties to an outside organization. That organization, the American Bar \nAssociation, purports to\n\n\nbe a neutral arbiter but is frankly twisting its ratings process to \ndrive a political agenda in an important nomination pending before this \nbody. I am referring specifically to the smear campaign of the ABA \nagainst Steve Grasz, a qualified public servant, who has been nominated \nby the President to the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals.\n  Steve Grasz has decades of honorable service in Nebraska, including \nmore than a decade as the chief deputy attorney general of my State.\n  Mr. Grasz is, in fact, eminently qualified for the circuit court \nbench as has been testified to by Republicans and Democrats across our \nState.\n  Let's set the scene first for the ABA's silly decision earlier this \nweek to announce that they regard Steve Grasz as ``not qualified.'' I \nwill highlight three specific items.\n  First, we should discuss the two people who interviewed Mr. Grasz and \nrecognize that unfortunately they are blatant partisans with a sad \ntrack record of hackery.\n  Second, the ABA is trying to paint Mr. Grasz as an extremist simply \nbecause he did his job as the chief deputy attorney general of Nebraska \nand defended Nebraska laws and Nebraskans who wanted to outlaw the most \nbarbaric of abortion practices--partial birth abortion.\n  Third, we should talk about the obvious bigotry of cultural liberals \nevident in their interview process of Mr. Grasz when they asked him \nrepeated questions about nonlegal matters that had nothing to do with \nthe claims of competence of the ABA.\n  First, let's talk about the two reviewers. The lead reviewer for the \nbar association on the Grasz nomination was Arkansas law professor \nCynthia Nance. As it turns out, this is an encore performance for Ms. \nNance. In 2006, she opposed then-nominee and now-Supreme Court Justice \nSamuel Alito because of his ``pro-life agenda,'' and she argued that \nmade him unqualified to sit on the U.S. Supreme Court. I wonder if \nthere is anyone in this body who rejected her view then and voted to \nconfirm now-Justice Alito who would now echo her claims that Justice \nAlito is not qualified to sit in the seat he now holds. Hopefully we as \na body are better than that.\n  The ABA's second reviewer, Lawrence Pulgram, is an attorney from San \nFrancisco. A cursory glance at Mr. Pulgram's political involvement \nshows a long track record of support for leftwing candidates and \naggressively progressive political organizations. These are the \nreviewers who are setting themselves up as dispassionate umpires \ncalling balls and strikes. It is hogwash. These are not umpires. These \nare folks in the starting lineup of the ABA, an organization that \nexplicitly endorsed pro-abortion policies beginning two decades ago.\n  To be clear, there is nothing wrong with Nance and Pulgram's zealous \nadvocacy. They enjoy First Amendment rights just like all 320 million \nAmericans do. There is nothing wrong with advocacy. What is wrong here \nis advocacy disguised as objective analysis, and that is what is \nactually happening in the case of the Grasz nomination.\n  This brings us to our second point about the ABA's treatment of Mr. \nGrasz. When you read their letter, it makes many anonymous claims that \nsome people supposedly support the author's great worry about Grasz's \nalleged deeply held social views, but the closest thing the ABA ever \ncomes to stating a fact--let alone producing a smoking gun--is the fact \nthat as the chief deputy attorney general of the State of Nebraska, Mr. \nGrasz did the job of the chief deputy attorney general of the State of \nNebraska. That is not news.\n  It is no secret that the vast majority of Nebraskans are pro-life, \nand thus it is no surprise that our State's laws reflect this. In the \n1990s, Nebraska outlawed the most horrifying of all abortion \nprocedures--the partial birth abortion. Unless anyone seeks comfort \nbehind empty euphemisms like ``choice,'' let's be very clear what the \npeople of Nebraska were outlawing. The people of my State banned a \ngruesome and grotesque practice where a doctor partially delivers an \nunborn baby and, while that baby girl's head is the only thing still in \nthe mother's womb, the doctor would then collapse the baby's skull. If \nthere is anyone in this body who believes that is a good and a moral \nact, that it is a good and a moral thing to deliver that baby girl, and \nthen moments before her complete and full entry into the world, to \nvacuum out her brains, please come to the floor because few people \nbelieve that is a good or a moral or a just act--or at least few would \nadmit it openly.\n  In fact, that is why, just a few years later, Federal law followed \nNebraska's law and outlawed partial birth abortion, but in the 1990s, \nwhen Nebraska first outlawed that partial birth abortion procedure, \nmany pro-abortion advocates brought suit and Steve, as chief deputy \nattorney general of Nebraska, defended the law of our State, which \nagain is now the Federal law. He defended that law because it was his \njob. He defended the law because that is what the people of Nebraska \nwanted when they said this unspeakably barbaric procedure had no place \nin our State and now, thankfully, has no place in our Nation. Anyone \nwho would paint Steve as an extremist needs to take a long, hard, and \nhonest look at what he did as chief deputy attorney general of Nebraska \ndefending the laws of the State of Nebraska.\n  Third, I know the ABA has an august-sounding name, but here is the \nreality of the kinds of stuff they did in their interview with Mr. \nGrasz. They asked him: What kind of schools do your kids go to? I don't \nreally understand the connection to their legal interview. When they \nfound out his kids attended a religious institution, they asked him why \nhis kids would go to a religious institution. Well, it turns out, in my \nState, lots and lots of Lutherans and Catholics and lots of non-\nLutherans and Catholics send their kids to Lutheran and Catholic \nschools. I don't know what that has to do with someone's competence, \nman or woman, to sit as an objective judge on a court of appeals, and \nyet the interviewers decided they should go there.\n  Then they began to refer to Mr. Grasz repeatedly in the interview as \n``you people.'' They would frame questions to him and ask about ``you \npeople.'' At one point, he finally paused and asked: Can you tell me \nwho ``you people'' are? Because at this point, he didn't know if it was \npro-life people, people who send their kids to religious schools, maybe \njust Nebraskans. They informed him they were using the term ``you \npeople'' to mean conservatives or Republicans.\n\n  Third, in the course of their time with Mr. Grasz, their interview \nwent from actual legal questions to just asking him more and more \ndetail about his pro-life views, again that has nothing to do with the \ndistinction between sitting on the bench as someone who applies facts \nand law and someone who, in a private capacity or in his public \ncapacity, as the chief deputy attorney general of Nebraska had been \ndefending the laws of the State of Nebraska.\n  Ed Whelan is the president of the Ethics and Public Policy Center and \nis a legal and jurisprudential expert. He has been covering the ABA \ncase and their judgment on Mr. Grasz this week closely, and so I would \nlike to read a few of his comments into the Record.\n\n       The ABA contends that Grasz is not sufficiently able ``to \n     differentiate between the roles'' of advocate and \n     adjudicator.\n       As its first example, the ABA contends that there is an \n     inconsistency between Grasz's stated respect for stare \n     decisis (that is, for binding precedent) and the views he \n     expressed in a 1999 law-review article (and that it says he \n     continues to adhere to). Selectively quoting that article, \n     the ABA faults him for his supposed ``suggestion that a lower \n     court judge was entitled, in deciding the issue [whether a \n     `partially born' fetus has a right to life under the 14th \n     Amendment], to question the jurisprudence of a superior \n     court.''\n       But in the law-review article that the ABA criticizes--\n\n  In that same article--\n\n     Grasz states [on pages] 27-28:\n       ``Lower federal courts are obliged to follow clear legal \n     precedent regardless of whether it may seem unwise or even \n     morally repugnant to do so. However, a court need not extend \n     questionable jurisprudence into new areas or apply it in \n     areas outside of where there is clear precedent.''\n       Read together, these sentences set forth an uncontroversial \n     position. In order to create controversy, the ABA entirely \n     omits the first sentence, and it then pretends that the \n     second sentence, rather than setting forth a general \n     proposition, is ``referring to the Supreme Court's rulings in \n     Roe and Casey.'' Yes, Grasz applies that general proposition \n     to the question whether Roe v. Wade and Planned Parenthood v. \n     Casey speak to the legal status of ``partially-born human \n     beings,'' but, much as the ABA would have\n\n\n     the reader think otherwise, he isn't concocting a special \n     rule for abortion precedents.\n\n  Skipping ahead:\n\n       The ABA states that ``members of the bar shared instances \n     in which Mr. Grasz's conduct was gratuitously rude.'' \n     Amazingly, it doesn't bother to give a simple example of rude \n     conduct by Grasz, so its claim is [entirely] impossible to \n     address.\n       Aside--\n\n  This is again quoting Whelan--\n\n       Aside: According to Larry Tribe, as Josh Blackman reminds \n     us, Sonia Sotomayor had a ``reputation for being something of \n     a bully'' when she was nominated to the Supreme Court. (It \n     was I [Whelan], by the way, who uncovered and published \n     Tribe's letter to President Obama.)\n       The ABA alleges that ``there was a certain amount of \n     caginess, and, at times, a lack of disclosure [on Grasz's \n     part] with respect to some of the issues which the evaluators \n     unearthed.'' But once again it provides no specifics or \n     illustrations, so it's impossible to assess whether Grasz can \n     be fairly faulted here.\n       Something very fishy is going on.\n\n  And here pulling up from Whelan, I would comment that my senior \nSenator Deb Fischer and I from Nebraska, both of whom were advising \nPresident Trump on the selection of Steve Grasz for this Eighth Circuit \nvacancy, received literally boxes of letters from Nebraska lawyers--\nboth Republican and Democratic--for months in the moment after the \nEighth Circuit vacancy appeared, and at no point did we hear either \nverbally from people we know in the State or in our interview process \nor in those boxes of letters--at no point did we hear of any rudeness \non the part of Mr. Grasz. Yet the ABA is judging him ``not qualified'' \nfor the bench based on anonymous sources that say he is rude, without a \nsingle example. There is not one example.\n  It is an embarrassing letter from the ABA. Folks in this body who \nwould be tempted to take the ABA's judgment seriously should read the \nletter. It is filled with anonymous claims that once he was rude to \nsomeone, and they have no examples.\n  Back to Ed Whelan:\n\n       [Reviewer] Nance's strong ideological bias is not difficult \n     to uncover. Among other things, she signed a letter opposing \n     the confirmation of Justice Alito. Given the ABA's persistent \n     complaints about Grasz's supposed inability to separate his \n     judging from his ``pro-life agenda,'' it's notable that \n     letter against Alito complains about the impact that he would \n     have on . . . women's reproductive [rights]. Nance also \n     signed a letter arguing that the ``government's interests in \n     protecting women's health and reproductive freedom, and \n     combating gender discrimination,'' meant that even \n     religiously affiliated organizations--like the Little Sisters \n     of the Poor--should be required to provide contraceptive \n     coverage (including drugs and devices that can also operate \n     in an abortifacient manner) notwithstanding their own \n     religiously informed views on what constitutes illicit moral \n     complicity in evil.\n       Nance's very active Twitter feed (more than 24,000 tweets) \n     also offers some revealing insights. Among other things, \n     Nance retweeted the question whether Justice Scalia would \n     have been in the majority in Dred Scott, and she evidently \n     found amusing or insightful the observation that \n     ``Constitutional strict constructionists . . . want women to \n     have all the rights they had in 1787.'' Yes, this is just the \n     sort of fine and balanced legal mind, with a great grasp of \n     conservative judicial principles, that the ABA puts in charge \n     of evaluating judicial nominees.\n\n  Finally:\n\n       The ABA's supposed check against a hostile lead \n     investigator is to have a second investigator conduct a \n     supplemental evaluation of the nominee in those instances in \n     which the lead investigator recommends a ``Not Qualified'' \n     rating.\n       So if you're the head of the committee, whom would you \n     select to ensure that ideological bias isn't warping the \n     process? Probably not a very liberal [activist] lawyer from \n     San Francisco. But that's exactly what the ABA did [in this \n     case].\n       Lawrence Pulgram, the second investigator, is a member of \n     the left-wing Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights of the San \n     Francisco Bay Area.\n\n  We have a crisis of institutional trust in this country that should \nconcern all of us. Our job here, in seeking to preserve and protect and \nuphold the Constitution, and a Constitution that is focused on limited \ngovernment, is because our Founders believed that the vast majority of \nthe most interesting questions in life happen in the private sector, \nnot just for-profit entities but primarily civil society, families, \nneighborhoods, and not-for-profit organizations, and religious \ninstitutions, and the Rotary Club, and philanthropies, and voluntary \nenterprises. The most interesting things in life are not in government. \nGovernment provides a framework for order of liberty, but once you have \nthat framework, once you are free from violence, you are free to live \nyour life in all of these fully human-fit community ways in your local \ncommunity.\n  Our job in this body is to not only pass good legislation and repeal \nbad legislation and to advise and consent on the President's nominees \nto faithfully execute the laws that have been passed by the article I \nbranch, but our job is also to speak to a constitutional system, where \na separation of powers exists so power is not consolidated in \nWashington and so there is room for the full flowering of social \ncommunity across our great land.\n  So the decline of trust in our institutions is something that should \ntrouble all of us. Our job here isn't merely about government, it is \nalso teaching our kids about the Constitution and basic civics. I ache \nwhen private sector institutions and civil society institutions see the \ntrust in those institutions decline. But one of the things that is \nclearly happening in our time is that the ABA is becoming much less a \nserious organization and much more an activist organization advancing a \nspecific political agenda.\n  The ABA is due to appear before the Judiciary Committee in 2 weeks to \nexplain this interview process and why they gave this judgment on Mr. \nGrasz with so few facts and so little evidence and so much pro-abortion \nzealotry driving the opinion of the lead reviewer in this case.\n  I hope that when the ABA comes before the Judiciary Committee, it \nrecants this very silly opinion of ``not qualified'' on a man who is \neminently qualified and is going to serve very well the people of not \njust the Eighth Circuit but this country on the Eighth Circuit Court of \nAppeals.\n  I would hope that the ABA would recant this silly judgment, but if \nthey do not, I think we should recognize that the fiction of the ABA as \na serious organization that ought to be taken seriously as a neutral, \nimpartial arbiter of qualifications for the Federal bench should be \ndispensed with; and that we in this body, who have actually taken an \noath to three separate-but-equal branches, with differentiated roles of \nlegislating, executing, and ultimately judging, would continue to \naffirm that distinction; and that we should want judges who do not try \nto be superlegislators but, rather, seek to attend themselves to the \nfacts and the law, as is indeed the calling of article III branch \njudges.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. SASSE", "itemno": 0}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cassidy).
