Mr. Speaker, first, a hearty congratulations to my Texas \ncolleagues from northern California, Giants country. Orange October \nfeels good, doesn't it, especially when you defeat the hated southern \nCalifornia franchise?\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today to join my colleagues in support of the new \ntax reform bill that was released just today by the Ways and Means \nCommittee. This legislation contains many provisions that Congress has \nbeen promising the American people a long time: doubling the standard \ndeduction, lowering the corporate tax rate, cutting taxes for small \nbusinesses.\n  That is what these reform measures are about: saving money for \nmillions of Americans and simplifying the act of doing your taxes, as \nwell as creating an environment for American business to thrive and \ncome home and bring the jobs with them here in America and invest in \nthe American economy.\n  The American people want tax reform, they need tax reform, and they \nhave waited a long time, indeed since 1986. They shouldn't have to wait \nmore years than actually the last time the Dodgers won the World Series \nto kick start their economy and help American jobs.\n  Mr. Speaker, we need to make this happen now.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. LaMALFA", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "178", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H8395", "wkday": "Thursday", "day": "2", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "SUPPORT FOR THE NEW TAX REFORM BILL", "id": "CREC-2017-11-02-pt1-PgH8395", "title": "SUPPORT FOR THE NEW TAX REFORM BILL"}
