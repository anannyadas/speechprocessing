Mr. President, I rise to give my fifth in a series of \nspeeches addressing what I think will be a monumental achievement of \nthis Senate and House when we pass our tax reform bill.\n  I have spoken previously about how I believe tax reform will be good \nin a lot of different ways. First of all, I talked about how this tax \nreform bill will spur economic growth in our country. Second, I talked \nabout how it would grow jobs in small businesses. Third, I talked about \nthe benefits working-class families will have through policies such as \nthe child tax credit.\n  So today I rise to talk about the importance of tax simplification. \nAccording to a publisher who analyzed the issue, since 1913, the \nFederal Tax Code is 187 times longer than it was a century ago. On top \nof the Tax Code itself that spans thousands of pages, there are \nadditional IRS regulations that are complicated, and you need somebody \nnot just to figure them out for you and interpret them for you but to \nfigure out how that translates to your own tax return. Of course, \ntaxpayers have to comply with all of these.\n  Beyond the code and the regulations, there are countless IRS \nprocedures, technical memorandums, and more, and all of this adds to \nthe length and complexity of our tax system. You can see it when you \nturn toward the April 15 date, the stress level in this country really \nrises, and a lot of it has to do with the complications of our tax \nsystem.\n  The point is this, when it comes to figuring out your taxes, it is \njust far too complex. That is why businesses and individuals spend 6 \nbillion hours a year complying with the Tax Code. That is more than 18 \nhours for every man, woman, and child in this country. That is \nequivalent to 3 million people working full time--3 million people \nworking full time to comply with the Tax Code and fill out your tax \nforms or, another way of looking at it, that is $195 billion in lost \nproductivity.\n  Again, our Tax Code is just too complicated, and that is also what \ntax reform is about, simplifying and making it easier for Americans to \ncomply.\n  According to the Brookings Institution, ``The notion that taxes \nshould be simpler is one of the very few propositions in tax policy \nthat generates almost universal agreement.''\n\n\n  Despite years of bipartisan talks, we are now on the verge of major \ntax reform for the first time in 30 years. Making our Tax Code simpler \nwill benefit every single working family in this country. By roughly \ndoubling the standard deduction, filing your taxes will be easier and \nmore understandable. The higher standard deduction will let more \nmiddle-class Americans benefit from not just lower taxes but also \nwithout the hassle of itemizing your tax return. Lower rates and fewer \ndeductions will help all Americans spend less time and energy and worry \non tax compliance.\n  Our goal is for the overwhelming number of Americans to be able to \nsubmit their tax forms on a single sheet of paper without all those \nextra forms, and for many families in West Virginia and around the \ncountry who already use the standard deduction, increasing it will \nreduce their taxes. Now, 83 percent of West Virginians last year--or \nmaybe it was the year before, 2015, 2016--83 percent filed a simple \nform.\n  Simplicity in our Tax Code and relief for middle-class families, \nthose are the reasons I offered a straightforward amendment to the \nSenate's budget resolution. My amendment said Congress should focus on \neliminating deductions that primarily benefit wealthier individuals in \nfavor of tax policy that benefits the middle class. Let me say that \nagain. Congress should focus on eliminating deductions that primarily \nbenefit wealthier individuals in favor of tax policy that benefits the \nmiddle class. That means a tax code that is simpler with fewer \ndeductions and lower rates.\n  It will not just be individuals and families who benefit from a less \ncomplicated tax code. Tax simplification will help our small businesses \nstart, grow, and succeed. Ninety-five percent of the businesses in my \nState of West Virginia are small businesses, and they employ over half \nof West Virginia's private sector workforce. So in addition to their \nhigh marginal tax rate, the complexity and compliance cost of their \ntaxes impedes their economic growth, impedes their ability to grow \ntheir job, raise their wages, spur growth. A CNBC survey found that 22 \npercent of small business owners aren't sure what their effective tax \nrate really is. If Congress can simplify the code just to cut \ncompliance costs in half, that would free up significant resources that \ncould be used to grow the economy. Given that 50 percent of U.S. job \ngrowth has occurred in just 2 percent of our country's counties, we \nneed that growth. Think about that. Over the last several years, 50 \npercent of the U.S. job growth has only occurred in 2 percent of our \ncountry's counties. We need the rest of the country to be able to enjoy \nthat growth. To do that, we need to help the small businesses that are \nthe major economic drivers in our economy.\n  Simplifying the Tax Code will benefit so many across this country \nthrough GDP growth and higher wages. I look forward to working with my \ncolleagues to make tax reform and tax simplification a reality.\n  Thank you.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.", "turn": 2, "speaker": "Mrs. CAPITO", "itemno": 5}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, later this morning, after months of \nhemming, hawing, and delaying, House Republicans will finally release \nsome legislative details about their tax plan. It may not even include \nall the details. The on again, off again nature of these deliberations \nshould concern every Member of both Chambers. That is not how you \nconstruct sound policy, especially with something as complicated and \nimpactful as the Tax Code. Each decision has enormous ramifications. \nLast-minute changes and sloppy drafting could change the fate of entire \nindustries. Rushing it through in a hasty manner could have disastrous \nconsequences.\n  We know why my colleagues are doing this. They don't want the public \nto know what is in this bill--increases on the middle class, breaks for \nthe wealthy, big corporations getting a huge tax break, with no \nguarantee and very little likelihood that they will use the money to \ncreate jobs. That is why they don't want it to be public. It is not \npopular. On polls, it says: Do you support tax reform? They say yes. Do \nyou support cutting the taxes on big corporations? They say, \noverwhelming, no. Do you support increasing taxes on the middle class? \nOverwhelming, they say no. Do you support decreasing taxes on the \nwealthy? They say, overwhelming, no. Those are the three tenets of this \nbill.\n  I hope my Republican colleagues here in the Senate are watching what \nis going on in the House--the problems they are having, the secrecy \nthey need--and realize how difficult and dangerous it is to rewrite the \nTax Code by the seat of your pants. Looking at the Tax Code and real \ntax receipts after all the loopholes, the wealthy in our country pay \nfar less in Federal taxes than they did historically while the middle \nclass pays more. Corporate profits are at a record high, while average \nwages have been stagnant. Those statistics articulate a real problem \nwith the basic fairness of our Tax Code that tax reform could underline \nand could fix. This plan doesn't.\n  Instead, what we are seeing today is a plan that exacerbates the \nunfairness and inequality in our Tax Code. If the details of the \nRepublican tax plan are anything like we have seen in the press--to \nrepeal the estate tax, to create a huge new loophole for wealthy \nindividuals in the form of a reduction in the pass-through rate, and \nlowering the big rates on corporations and the wealthy--this sure \ndoesn't fit the bill of helping the middle class.\n  Meanwhile, to pay for all the tax giveaways in their bill, the \nRepublicans are likely to make it worse for the middle class--not just \nnot help them but hurt them. It will slash State and local \ndeductibility, which is a bedrock middle-class and upper middle class \ndeduction, that would hurt so many middle-class taxpayers. Nearly one-\nthird of all taxpayers claim it from all over the country, the vast \nmajority of whom make under $200,000 a year.\n  Today, Republicans will crow about reaching a compromise on State and \nlocal, whereby they don't eliminate the deduction; they just reduce its \nvalue by about 70 percent. That means the bulk of the deduction will go \naway for so many middle class Americans. I would remind my Republican \ncolleagues over in the House, particularly those from States like New \nYork, New Jersey, California, Pennsylvania, Illinois, Virginia, and \nColorado, that this compromise will not solve your problem. You will \nstill pay the price with the voters.\n  I have been in politics a long time. I know how this will affect \npeople--this compromise. They will not look and say: Oh, it could have \nbeen worse. Maybe we would have lost the entire deduction. They will \nsay: This year, I have the whole deduction, and next year, I have less \nthan half of it. They will take it out on our Republican colleagues who \nvote for it, particularly from those States, and they are throughout \nthe country--in well-to-do and upper middle class and middle-class \nsuburban districts.\n  So anyone who thinks this compromise is going to help them doesn't \nunderstand how politics works. It is not what it could have been. It is \nwhat it is and what it will be. Now it is a complete deduction. What it \nwill be is that you will lose 70 percent of that deduction. No one is \ngoing to breathe a sigh of relief and say: I could have lost 100 \npercent.\n  Taxpayers will see that the Republicans have capped the amount of \nmortgage interest they can deduct from purchasing a new home now. That \nis the latest. Again, that hits right at the middle class. The mortgage \ndeduction doesn't really affect the wealthiest. They have all their \nmoney in unearned income and capital gains, and all of that is what \naffects them the most. But the mortgage deduction is one of the hearts \nof the middle class. To play with it--to reduce it, to cap it, so they \ncan do tax giveaways for the very rich--is not going to fly, I don't \nthink--not in America, not in the America most of us know.\n  Taxpayers in the big cities and small ones, in the exurbs and \nsuburbs, who\n\n\ncommute to work, will also notice if they never receive the critical \ntransit benefits they receive now. Thousands of dollars a year that \nhelp pay when you transit to work will be gone. Why? To help the \nwealthy.\n  While some working Americans and middle-class taxpayers watch their \ntaxes go up, they will read about how Republicans repealed the estate \ntax, which benefits only 5,500 families whose estates are worth over $5 \nmillion. They will learn how, instead of keeping the estate tax or \nclosing the egregious carried-interest loopholes, the Republicans \nreached into their pockets--the middle-class pockets--to pay for a big \ncorporate tax break that has no guarantee and very little likelihood of \nproducing jobs. They will learn that, while the reduction to the \ncorporate tax rate is permanent, the increase in the child tax credit \nis temporary.\n  Big, wealthy corporations count far more than kids in this bill. \nCorporations get permanent benefits, and families with kids get \ntemporary and meager ones.\n  The Tax Code is a reflection of fairness in our society. Do we want \nto be in a country where everyone pays their fair share, including big \ncorporations and the very wealthy? I think so. I think most Americans \nagree with that. Yet right now, our Tax Code is slanted in favor of the \nrich and the powerful, and the Republican plan makes it only worse.\n  The Republican tax plan would put two thumbs down on a scale already \ntipped toward the wealthy and powerful. It wouldn't create jobs. It \nwouldn't raise wages. The Tax Policy Center, as we know, estimated that \n80 percent of the benefits of the Republican plan go to the top 1 \npercent--this new bill doesn't change that a bit--while nearly one-\nthird of middle-class Americans would see a tax increase; 80 percent of \nthe benefits to the top of our country, 20 percent of the benefits to \nthe other 99 percent. That is not a middle-class tax bill, as President \nTrump said it would be.\n  Surely, we can do better. If our colleagues--whether it be in the \nHouse or Senate, our Republican colleagues who are trying to go it \nalone--can't pass this bill, we would welcome them. We would welcome an \nopportunity to sit down together and come up with a bill that really \nhelps the middle class.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.", "turn": 6, "speaker": "Mr. SCHUMER", "itemno": 10}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, today is an important day on our promise \nto deliver tax relief for America's working families and our \nbusinesses, to create more jobs and grow our economy faster. The House \nWays and Means Committee is about to unveil their first draft of a tax \ncut bill. That is a good step forward after we both passed our budgets \na couple of weeks ago.\n  As we move forward through this process, it is important that we all \nrecognize that tax cuts are a way to let the American people and our \nbusinesses keep more of their money, not the government's money but \ntheir money. We also have to be mindful of the impact it has on our \nstaggering national debt of over $20 trillion and rising deficits. We \ncan expect the economy to grow at a much healthier rate than it has in \nrecent years if we pass a good tax bill. But we also need to look for \nother ways to offset the costs of those tax cuts to a degree.\n  There have been a lot of discussions during the year about what I \nwould consider unwise and painful changes to our tax law. Eliminating \ndeductions, credits, exclusions, exemptions--they are popular and \nwidespread. Some people call that the spinach, in addition to the ice \ncream of tax cuts.\n  However, I have what I would call maybe a creative idea, a novel \nidea--one that I think is gaining momentum in the Senate and in the \nHouse. We can repeal the individual mandate of ObamaCare and save $300 \nto $400 billion for the Federal Government and therefore deliver more \ntax relief to our families and our workers and our businesses. That is \nnot my math. That is the math of the Congressional Budget Office. They \nhave said repeatedly that eliminating the individual mandate of \nObamaCare would save $300 to $400 billion. That is a lot of tax cuts.\n  The individual mandate has also been the most unpopular part of \nObamaCare. More than two-thirds of Americans want to see it repealed. \nThe House has voted repeatedly to repeal it. The Senate has voted to \nrepeal it. Even some Democrats have said that they want to repeal the \nindividual mandate as well. It is the first time in our country's \nhistory, after all, that the Federal Government has said: You must buy \nthe product of a private company for the mere privilege of being an \nAmerican citizen.\n  We also know that the individual mandate simply has not worked. It \nwas designed to hold down premiums on the ObamaCare exchanges. That has \nnot been the case. Despite the individual mandate being in place now \nfor 4 years, we continue to see premiums spiral out of control. So I \nthink it is a pretty reasonable proposal to repeal the most hated part \nof ObamaCare to help pay for tax cuts the American people want rather \nthan trying to eliminate popular and widely used deductions, credits, \nexemptions, and exclusions.\n  Moreover, it allows us to make more of the tax cut bill permanent \nbecause the $300 to $400 billion savings over a 10-year period is just \na 10-year period, but it will continue to save money after those 10 \nyears. With the crazy way we do our budgeting around here, that allows \nus to make more of those tax cuts permanent so that our families and \nour businesses can have greater predictability to save and invest and \ngrow our economy.\n  It is also a kind of tax cut for working-class Americans in its own \nright. According to IRS data, more than five out of six households that \npaid the mandate fine last year made less than the median income. They \nwere in the bottom half of income earners.\n  So what are we doing? We are imposing a fine on the working class and \nworking poor because they can't afford the insurance that ObamaCare \nmade unaffordable in the first place. That is crazy.\n  We can do this in a way that makes it easier to pass a tax bill. I \nknow some of my colleagues around here, especially some of my \nRepublican colleagues, say: Oh, no. We can't go back to healthcare. It \nis going to make the tax bill a little harder to pass. That is \nnonsense. It makes the tax bill easier to pass--easier to pass because \nit helps make the fiscal picture balance, and it helps deliver more tax \ncuts to our families and our businesses back home.\n  Some of my Democratic colleagues, drawing on that same estimate from \nthe Congressional Budget Office, will say: You are going to take \nhealthcare away from 15 million people. That is nonsense. This bill \ndoesn't cut a single dime out of ObamaCare, not even one penny, not one \npenny taken out of Medicaid, not one penny taken out of the subsidies \nfrom the exchanges, not a single regulation change. It simply says that \nthe IRS will not fine you if you cannot afford the insurance that \nObamaCare made unaffordable.\n  The $300 to $400 billion--even in Washington, that is a lot of money, \nand that is money that is better left in the pockets of America's \nworkers and families and on the financial statements of businesses that \nare looking to expand their operations, increase their wages, and hire \nmore workers.\n  No, this hasn't been part of the tax debate for a long time. This \nChamber considered repealing the mandate as part of our healthcare \ndebate, but the Obama administration called the individual mandate a \ntax.\n  In 2012, the Supreme Court upheld its constitutionality saying that \nit was a tax. The IRS collects it. You pay it on your 1040. That is \nabout the ``taxiest'' provision I can think of.\n  Let's make a commonsense decision, even if it is a little late in the \ngame. Repeal the individual mandate. Pay for more tax cuts for families \nand businesses. Make a tax bill easier to pass. Deliver on the promise \nthat we made to the American people to repeal the most unpopular part \nof ObamaCare and have a very big victory for the American people.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.", "turn": 10, "speaker": "Mr. COTTON", "itemno": 14}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

We \ndon't have a conducive tax environment now. We cannot compete globally \nwith the second highest or the highest corporate tax rate in the \ndeveloped world.\n  We also have a tax code that is far too complicated. Taxpayers and \ncompanies alike spend about 9 billion hours a year--9 billion hours a \nyear--combined with IRS requirements, and this costs the U.S. economy \nmore than $400 billion a year. This is just compliance costs.\n  The Tax Code is also full of costly loopholes which allow businesses \nand millions of individuals to get away with paying no income tax or no \ncorporate tax.\n  After over 30 years, I am pleased to see Congress finally getting \ndown to the work of doing a tax overhaul. A few weeks ago, we passed a \nbudget that allows some cuts--about $1.5 trillion. I believe that when \nwe do cut certain taxes, it does generate a greater economic activity, \nwhich does in turn mean additional revenue to government. However, \nthere are limits to that model. We cannot simply assume we can cut all \ntaxes and realize additional revenue. It is important that tax reform \ncomes as well.\n  We have been hearing a lot about cuts, cuts, cuts. If we are going to \ndo cuts, cuts, cuts, we have to do a wholesale reform. With the \nnational debt exceeding $20 trillion, we have to take this seriously. \nRate reductions have to be accompanied by repeal or reform. We cannot \nsimply rely on rosy economic assumptions, rosy growth rates to fill in \nthe gap. We have to make tough decisions. We cannot have cuts today \nthat assume we will grow a backbone in the out-years in terms of the \nreal reforms we are going to need. We have seen this before. We make \nthe cuts now; we rely on rosy economic assumptions; and then, in the \nout-years, if those don't come about, we forget what we were supposed \nto do in terms of reform. We can't do that today, not with a debt of \n$20 trillion, not with a deficit of over $600 billion a year adding to \nthat total debt.\n  I welcome this opportunity to do tax reform. It is needed. As I \nmentioned, we have to have a conducive tax and regulatory environment \nin order to compete, but we have to be realistic as well about what we \ncan achieve, and we can't push off the reforms for cuts today.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.", "turn": 14, "speaker": "Mr. FLAKE", "itemno": 18}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, today I rise with my colleague from New \nMexico, Senator Heinrich, to discuss the Securing America's Voting \nEquipment Act of 2017, or the SAVE Act, which we introduced earlier \nthis week.\n  I know that you are well aware that the Senate Intelligence Committee \nhas been conducting an in-depth investigation into attempts by the \nRussians to interfere with our elections last fall. What we have found \nis that the Russians' active measures preceded last fall, and they \ncontinue to this very day.\n  We have an election coming up in November of this year and a major \nelection next year, and both Senator Heinrich and I believe that it is \nso important that we act to assist States in protecting the integrity \nof their voting systems.\n  Our bill seeks to facilitate information sharing on the threats posed \nto State election systems by foreign adversaries, to provide guidance \nto States on how to protect their systems against nefarious activity, \nand, for States that choose to do so, to allow them to access some \nFederal grant money to implement best practices to protect their \nsystems.\n  Let me be clear that I know of no evidence to date that actual vote \ntabulations were manipulated in any State in the elections last fall. \nNevertheless, as early as the summer of 2016, the FBI discovered that \nforeign-based hackers had gained access to voter registration databases \nin two States. The Department of Homeland Security confirmed that \nRussia-linked actors attempted to access voter rolls and registration \ndata in those two States.\n  More alarming is that further investigation revealed that many more \nStates than just two were ultimately found to have had their voting \nsystems probed by the Russians. The Department of Homeland Security \nnotified election officials in a total of 21 States that their election \nsystems had been targeted by Russian Government-linked hackers.\n  If voter rolls were altered or voting equipment tampered with, a \ncompromise of these systems could open the door to voter \ndisenfranchisement and would undermine public confidence and the \nintegrity of our free and fair elections--a bedrock principle of our \ndemocracy.\n  In response to these alarming threats, the SAVE Act would assist \nStates in hardening their systems. It does not aim to tell States how \nto conduct their elections. The responsibility for conducting elections \nwould remain with each State, as has been our country's tradition since \nits founding. State and local election officials alone, however, cannot \nbe expected to defend against cyber attacks from foreign adversaries. \nThat is why our bill seeks to bring to bear the unique authorities, \ncapabilities, and resources that the Federal Government can offer to \nState and local election officials.\n  Let me briefly describe the Heinrich-Collins bill.\n  First, our bill would codify a decision made by both Secretaries of \nHomeland Security, Jeh Johnson and John Kelly, to designate election \nsystems as ``critical infrastructure.'' This designation allows DHS to \nprioritize providing assistance to election jurisdictions and to \nestablish formal mechanisms to enhance information sharing and \ncollaboration within the electoral sector. More than 30 States took \nadvantage of DHS's offer of assistance last year.\n  Our bill also addresses a shortcoming that I raised during a hearing \nbefore the Senate Intelligence Committee in June regarding foreign \nefforts to compromise American voting systems. During this hearing, we \nlearned that not a single secretary of state had been cleared to \nreceive classified information before the 2016 election or in the 6 \nmonths since voting systems had been declared as critical \ninfrastructure. This delay is truly inexplicable. We have to be able to \nshare this critical information in order for State election officials \nto take the necessary steps to safeguard their systems.\n  Our bill addresses this limitation on information sharing by \nauthorizing the Director of National Intelligence to provide security \nclearances to designated chief election officials in each State. That \nway, the intelligence community can share appropriate classified \ninformation with States regarding foreign threats targeting election \nsystems.\n  Our bill also mandates that DHS conduct a threat assessment on \nphysical and electronic risks to voting systems. Then, in collaboration \nwith stakeholders, the Department will develop best practices to \naddress those risks.\n  A few simple measures can make a big difference. Best practices like \nrelying upon paper ballots, as the State of Maine currently does, and \nconducting postelection audits to ensure that the tabulation by vote-\ncounting machines matches the results of the paper ballots can bolster \nboth resilience and public confidence in the integrity of the voting \nprocess.\n  Finally, our bill creates a Federal grant program available for \nStates to upgrade and safeguard the integrity of their systems by \nimplementing the best practices that have been identified.\n  Last year, the Russian Government sought to disrupt our democracy by \nthreatening the integrity of our elections. It is incumbent upon \nCongress to\n\n\nassist the States and those charged with conducting elections at the \nlocal, State, and Federal level to protect them from foreign \ninterference. Our bill would do just that.\n  I am very pleased to work with the leader on this effort, Senator \nHeinrich, and I would urge all of our colleagues to join Senator \nHeinrich and me in sponsoring this bill.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.", "turn": 18, "speaker": "Mr. COLLINS", "itemno": 22}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I want to start by thanking my \nRepublican colleague from Maine, Senator Susan Collins, for her work on \nthis legislation. In addition to her excellent work on the Intelligence \nCommittee, her experience in homeland security and critical \ninfrastructure was absolutely critical to the drafting of this \nlegislation.\n  As current members of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, we \nare continuing to work on the investigation into Russian interference \nin the 2016 Presidential election. Yesterday, our committee held an \nimportant open hearing where we had representatives from companies such \nas Facebook, Google, and Twitter. We know that Russian Government-\nlinked actors purchased online advertisements last year in order to \ninfluence voters and, frankly, in order to divide Americans. \nAdditionally, Russia used bots and trolls to spread misinformation and \ndivision organically through social media networks.\n  While the President has labeled reports of these ads as a ``hoax,'' \nnow that Facebook has actually released many of those ads and \nacknowledged their extensive reach last year, I hope we can all agree \nthat this is a problem which we must solve before future election \ncycles.\n  I have called on the Federal Election Commission to consider new \nguidance on how online advertisement platforms can better prevent \nforeign nationals from illicitly spending in future U.S. elections. I \ncertainly support legislation to require the same transparency for \nonline political ads that we currently enjoy for television or print or \nradio ads. These are simple, straightforward steps we can and must take \nto protect the sanctity of our democracy.\n  We also know, based on intelligence assessments, that as part of \nRussia's larger hostile effort to interfere in last year's election, \nRussian actors targeted State election voting centers and State-level \nvoting registration databases--the very heart of the infrastructure we \nall rely on for free and fair elections. In my view, these intrusions \ndemonstrate a troubling vulnerability to potential future cyber attacks \nand manipulations by foreign hackers of our elections and our \ndemocratic process.\n  Our democracy fundamentally hinges on protecting the rights of \nAmericans to be able to fairly choose their own leaders. That is why I \nam proud to be partnering with Senator Collins in introducing the \nbipartisan Securing America's Voting Equipment Act, or the SAVE Act, to \nprovide increased security for American election systems. I am proud to \njoin Senator Collins on the floor today to demonstrate our commitment \nto being able to move forward in a bipartisan and pragmatic way to find \nsolutions to protect the integrity of that voting process.\n  Our bipartisan legislation would permanently designate State-run \nelection systems as ``critical infrastructure,'' and it would require \nthe Department of Homeland Security to create a Federal grant program \nto help States upgrade the physical, electronic, and even the \nadministrative components of their voting systems and develop those \nbest practices that Senator Collins mentioned in her speech earlier.\n  The SAVE Act would also require the Director of National Intelligence \nto sponsor security clearances to the officials responsible for the \nadministration and certification of Federal elections in each State--\nusually our secretaries of state. The Director of National Intelligence \nwould then share all appropriate classified information with those \nState officials to help them protect their election systems from these \nkinds of security threats.\n  Finally, the SAVE Act would create a Federal competition that would \naward computer programmers who discover vulnerabilities in nonactive \nvoting systems so that the equipment and the software vendors can work \nto fix those vulnerabilities.\n  The SAVE Act does not aim to tell States how to conduct their \nelections or what policies or procedures or equipment is best where \nthey are; rather, this bill is designed to facilitate information \nsharing with States, to provide guidelines on how best to secure those \nsystems, and to allow States to access funds to develop solutions and \nimplement best practices in response to these threats.\n  I consulted closely with my own Secretary of State from New Mexico, \nSecretary of State Maggie Toulouse Oliver, in drafting this legislation \nto ensure that it provides the security measures State election \nofficials need to keep our voting systems secure. I commend Secretary \nToulouse Oliver for her tremendous leadership in the effort to \nsafeguard election infrastructure at the State level.\n  We are at a critical juncture in the Russia investigation in which \nthe public is beginning to see the tactical evidence of how the Kremlin \nsought to influence our elections and divide our populous. Until we set \nup stronger protections of our election systems and take the necessary \nsteps to prevent future foreign influence campaigns, our Nation's \ndemocratic institutions will remain vulnerable. But we have the tools \nto fix those vulnerabilities. I look forward to working with Senator \nCollins and all of our colleagues on both sides of the aisle to ensure \nthat we do that.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.", "turn": 20, "speaker": "Mr. HEINRICH", "itemno": 24}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Cory Gardner,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Steven Daines,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators: As President of the National Native American \n     Bar Association, it is my privilege to endorse Colorado \n     Supreme Court Justice Allison Eid to be a Judge on the United \n     States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit. Since she \n     began her tenure on the Colorado Supreme Court in 2006, and \n     indeed throughout her legal career before her\n\n\n     appointment to the bench, Justice Eid has demonstrated deep \n     understanding of federal Indian law and policy matters, as \n     well as significant respect for tribes as governments. Such \n     qualities and experiences are rare among nominees to the \n     federal bench and consequently, many in Indian Country \n     strongly support Justice Eid's confirmation.\n       The National Native American Bar Association's mission is \n     to advance justice for Native Americans. As our name implies, \n     NNABA represents the interests of all populations indigenous \n     to the lands which are now collectively the United States: \n     American Indians, Alaska Natives, and Native Hawaiians. Our \n     members include Native American attorneys, Indian law \n     practitioners and professors, as well as numerous tribal \n     court advocates and tribal court judges. As you know, all \n     branches of the Federal government play an integral role in \n     justice for Native Americans and their government-to-\n     government relationship with the United States. The unique \n     legal posture of Indian tribes to the federal government is \n     deeply rooted in American history and has always been heavily \n     intertwined with often-shifting federal Indian policy, but \n     often a central role in justice for Native Americans rests \n     with the federal courts. Yet nearly all federal courts have \n     suffered without any Native voice on the bench and often \n     without judges with knowledge of federal Indian law or \n     familiarity with Indian Country. NNABA strongly encourages \n     the confirmation of judges with experience or interest in \n     federal Indian law and who respect the role of tribal \n     sovereigns under the Constitution and treaties with the \n     United States. It is NNABA's honor and privilege to commend \n     for your consideration for the confirmation of Justice \n     Allison Eid, who exemplifies those qualities and who is also \n     an exceptionally well-qualified candidate in every other \n     regard, as well as the first Colorado woman to be nominated \n     to the Tenth Circuit.\n       Her academic credentials are excellent. Raised by a single \n     mother in Spokane, Washington, Justice Eid began college at \n     the University of Idaho and then transferred to Stanford \n     University where she graduated with distinction and was a \n     member of the Phi Beta Kappa honor society. After Stanford, \n     Justice Eid served as a speechwriter to President Ronald \n     Reagan's Secretary of Education, William Bennett. She went on \n     to attend the University of Chicago Law School where she \n     served as Articles Editor on the Law Review, graduated with \n     High Honors, and was elected Order of the Coif. Justice Eid \n     began her legal career as a law clerk for Judge Jerry Smith \n     on the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. \n     She then served as a law clerk to Justice Clarence Thomas on \n     the United States Supreme Court.\n       In private practice at Arnold and Porter following her \n     clerkships, Justice Eid practiced both commercial and \n     appellate litigation for a variety of clients, including \n     significantly for the Hopi Tribe. She was a key part of \n     litigation teams asserting the Hopi Tribe's sovereign rights \n     in litigation against the United States Department of the \n     Interior, for example in the so-called ``Bennett Freeze'' \n     litigation, wherein the Hopi Tribe sought the right to \n     develop its lands and resources despite a federal moratorium \n     on such development.\n       Justice Eid later became a tenured professor at the \n     University of Colorado Law School where she taught \n     Legislation, Constitutional Law, and Torts, and served as the \n     faculty clerkship advisor. During her time at the University \n     of Colorado, Justice Eid continued her service in the legal \n     community, being active in a number of bar organizations and \n     serving as a frequent speaker and author. In 2005 she was \n     appointed by Colorado Attorney General John Suthers to serve \n     as the Solicitor General of Colorado. One year later, \n     Governor Bill Owens appointed Justice Eid to the Colorado \n     Supreme Court where she has served for 11 years, and was \n     successfully retained by the voters of Colorado on a \n     statewide ballot. While serving as a Justice on the \n     Colorado Supreme Court, Justice Eid has continued to teach \n     at the University of Colorado. She also serves as the \n     Chair of the Supreme Court Water Court Committee which \n     works to identify rule and statutory changes to achieve \n     efficiencies in water court cases, while maintaining \n     quality outcomes for all. Justice Eid was also appointed \n     by Chief Justice John Roberts to serve on the Federal \n     Advisory Committee on Appellate Rules--a prestigious \n     appointment where she has served alongside federal judges, \n     law professors, and lawyers to craft revisions to the \n     Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure--including her \n     support for efforts to allow tribes to file amicus briefs \n     as of right at the Supreme Court just as state governments \n     can. Justice Eid is also active in her community and \n     church. As the mother of two children, Justice Eid has \n     volunteered numerous hours at her children's schools and \n     for their extracurricular activities.\n       NNABA is very concerned that federal appointees, whether \n     judicial, executive branch or independent agency \n     representatives, be well versed in and respectful of tribal \n     sovereignty. Justice Eid has significantly more experience \n     with Indian law cases than any other recent Circuit Court \n     nominee. Her Indian law cases generally reflect her respect \n     for tribes as sovereign governments and understanding of \n     tribes' roles in our federalism. Justice Eid has been \n     involved in five Indian law cases, each addressing only a \n     subset of myriad issues of importance to Indian tribes. We \n     have examined Justice Eid's record and are heartened by the \n     respect and fairness she has always shown tribes appearing \n     before the Colorado Supreme Court. We have canvassed NNABA \n     members who have appeared before or clerked for Justice Eid \n     (yes, Justice Eid has hired a Native American law clerk!) and \n     received unanimous positive feedback.\n       Justice Eid has knowledge gained from living in and working \n     in a State which has Indian Country and strong tribal \n     governments, and also from being the spouse of a noted \n     American Indian Law practitioner, Mr. Troy Eid, who served as \n     Chair of the Indian Law and Order Commission, as the United \n     States Attorney for Colorado from 2006-2009, and who now co-\n     chairs the national Indian law practice group at Greenberg \n     Traurig LLP, is admitted to practice before numerous tribal \n     courts and serves as a Tribal appointee on the Navajo Nation \n     Commission on Judicial Conduct. Her husband is widely \n     regarded as an expert in Indian law, and in particular on \n     tribal law enforcement and access to justice issues. In her \n     personal life, Justice Eid regularly interacts with tribal \n     leaders and Native American lawyers and often brings that \n     knowledge to bear on the bench. We believe her to be a \n     conscientious, diligent, careful and scholarly jurist. Each \n     NNABA member we heard from concluded that Justice Eid is a \n     woman of integrity and extremely well-qualified for the Tenth \n     Circuit.\n       NNABA has long sought the nomination of federal judges with \n     knowledge of federal Indian law, and more generally with \n     experience on western issues directly impacting Indian tribes \n     such as water law and public lands. With Justice Neil \n     Gorsuch's elevation to the U.S. Supreme Court, that knowledge \n     base and experience is lacking in the current makeup of the \n     Tenth Circuit, and is a vitally important perspective. In \n     short, Justice Eid has shown herself to be interested and \n     engaged and willing to make the federal judiciary more \n     accessible to tribes, who regrettably often find themselves \n     in the position of federal court litigants.\n       On the Colorado Supreme Court, Justice Eid has always \n     ``gotten it right'' on Indian law matters, as reflected in \n     her majority opinion in Pawnee Well Users v. Wolfe, 320 P.3d \n     320 (Colo. 2013) (tribal water rights), in her joining of the \n     dissent in Southern Ute v. King Consolidated Ditch Co., 250 \n     P.3d 1226 (Colo. 2011), and in her votes to grant certiorari \n     in TMR v. TER, 2013 WL 3809175 (Indian Child Welfare Act \n     case) and Begaye v. People, 2011 WL 6162622 (Batson challenge \n     involving Native American jury pool). We also note her \n     important concurring opinion in Cash Advance & Preferred Cash \n     Loans v. State, 242 P.3d 1099 (Colo. 2010), principally a \n     case about tribal enterprises' sovereign immunity from suit \n     and service of process. This opinion illustrates Justice \n     Eid's respect for tribal sovereignty and we think is \n     emblematic of the practicality, fairness, the careful \n     attention to what the law requires, and the accessibility of \n     writing style that she would bring to the Tenth Circuit.\n       In sum, while we do not expect that Justice Eid will agree \n     with tribal interests on every issue, we also believe that \n     she is immensely well qualified and we are confident that \n     Justice Eid is a mainstream, commonsense Westerner who will \n     rule fairly on Indian Country matters. We endorse her \n     confirmation to serve.\n       Thank you for considering our views.\n       And special thanks to Senators Daines and Gardner, who have \n     consistently solicited feedback from tribes and tribal \n     organizations regarding federal judicial nominations. NNABA \n     appreciates your continued commitment to Indian country, to \n     fortifying the government-to-government relationship between \n     the United States and tribes, and to ensuring that Native \n     American voices are heard at the highest levels of the \n     federal government.\n       If you have any further questions, do not hesitate to \n     contact our NNABA Nominations and Endorsements Committee \n     Chair, and Immediate Past NNABA President Jennifer Weddle.\n           Respectfully and humbly,\n\n                                              Diandra Benally,\n\n                                        President, National Native\n                              American Bar Association, 2017-2018.\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "The RECORDER", "itemno": 30}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "G000562", "text": "  Mr. GARDNER.
