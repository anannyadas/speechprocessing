Nash. \nMajor General Nash retired on October 31st, after leading the Minnesota \nNational Guard for the past 7 years. His leadership has ensured the \nexcellence of the Minnesota National Guard.\n  Major General Nash enlisted in the infantry in 1972 and quickly rose \nthrough the ranks, earning a commission as a second lieutenant \nfollowing completion of officer candidate school. Since then, he has \ncommanded at all levels, starting as a company level commander and \nrising to lead the U.S. Divisions-South supporting Operation Iraqi \nFreedom in 2010.\n  In November of 2010, Major General Nash was appointed by Governor Tim \nPawlenty to be the adjutant general of the Minnesota National Guard. In \nthis role, he has skillfully commanded Minnesota's Army and Air \nNational Guard units not only in missions in Minnesota, but also as \nthey have served across the globe, in places such as Iraq, the Sinai \nPeninsula, and the Baltics. Under Major General Nash's stewardship, the \nMinnesota National Guard has performed every mission reliably and with \ndistinction.\n  I have had the honor of working closely with Major General Nash \nduring my time in office. He has been a tireless advocate for the Guard \non issues ranging from installations, to the Guard's renewable energy \nuse, to the important task of ensuring the Guard's annual priorities \nare met. One area I worked particularly closely with Major General Nash \non has been our efforts to expand medical, education, and retirement \nbenefits that had been previously denied to National Guard soldiers \ndeployed under the 12304b authority. Major General Nash has been a \nstrong voice on this issue, and his work was critical to my efforts to \nenact bipartisan legislation to ensure Minnesota Guardsmen and \nReservists have access to these services. Our veterans have earned \nthese benefits through their service and sacrifice to our country, and \nthey should not be denied those benefits.\n  In addition to his exemplary leadership of the Minnesota Guard's \nservice in missions foreign and domestic, Major General Nash deserves \nspecial recognition for his work preparing the force for future energy \nand sustainability challenges. In particular, his work developing the \nMinnesota Guard's sustainable infrastructure has made the Minnesota \nGuard a pioneer in the use of solar and geothermal energy initiatives. \nIn 2011, Minnesota National Guard facilities set a goal to reduce \nenergy consumption by 3 percent. Forty-one Minnesota National Guard \narmories participated in this program and energy consumption was \nreduced by an average of 5.4 percent year over year through the use of \ngeothermal and solar thermal heating, water reuse, solid waste \nrecycling, as well as natural and LED lighting. Furthermore, all new \nconstruction projects under Major General Nash's leadership have been \ndesigned to LEED standards. These developments are so important because \nthey reduce the Guard's reliance on fossil fuels and foreign oil, \nsupport jobs in the local economy, and reduce energy costs for the \nGuard, allowing them to invest more in our civilian soldier's \nreadiness, training, and education. The work Major General Nash has \ndone to prepare for future energy and sustainability challenges has \nensured that the Minnesota National Guard will continue to lead the \ncountry on the battlefield and at home.\n  Finally, I want to note with my gratitude Major General Nash's many \nyears of service as a judge in my annual poetry contest that allows \nMinnesota students to write about a military veteran who has made a \ndifference in their lives. Each year, he spends hours reading these \nheartfelt poems and helping me decide which ones will hang in my Senate \noffice.\n  I would like to extend my best wishes to Major General Nash upon his \nretirement and wish him the best of luck in his future endeavors. Thank \nyou, General Nash. Your service to our Nation and our State has been \nindispensable and invaluable. Above all, it has made a difference to \nthe men and women who served under you.\n  Thank you.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. FRANKEN", "itemno": 0}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 1}], "header": {"chamber": "Senate", "num": "178", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "S6999", "wkday": "Thursday", "day": "2", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "TRIBUTE TO MAJOR GENERAL RICHARD C.
