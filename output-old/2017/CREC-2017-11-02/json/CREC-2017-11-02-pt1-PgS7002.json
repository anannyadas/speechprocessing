A bill to amend the Violent Crime Control and Law \nEnforcement Act of 1994, to reauthorize the Missing Alzheimer's Disease \nPatient Alert Program, and to promote initiatives that will reduce the \nrisk of injury and death relating to the wandering characteristics of \nsome children with autism; to the Committee on the Judiciary.", "turn": -1, "speaker": "The RECORDER", "itemno": 0}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "G000386", "text": "  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today Senators Klobuchar, Tillis, \nSchumer, Durbin and I will introduce legislation to help America's \nfamilies locate missing loved ones who have Alzheimer's disease, autism \nor related conditions that may cause them to wander. Congressman Chris \nSmith will introduce a virtually identical companion bill in the House \nof Representatives today as well.\n  Our bill, which was introduced for the first time in the 114th \nCongress, extends an existing program that helps locate individuals \nwith Alzheimer's disease or dementia. It also adds new support for \npeople with autism.\n  We have named the legislation in honor of two boys with autism who \nperished because their condition caused them to wander. One of these \nchildren, nine-year-old Kevin Curtis Wills, slipped into Iowa's Raccoon \nRiver near a park and tragically drowned in 2008. The other, 14-year-\nold Avonte Oquendo, wandered away from his school and drowned in New \nYork City's East River a few years ago.\n  Theirs are not isolated cases. Just a few months ago, a four year-old \nwith autism drowned in a pool after wandering away from her caretakers. \nWe've all read or heard the heartbreaking stories of families \nfrantically trying to locate a missing loved one whose condition caused \nhim or her to wander off.\n  Our bill will give communities the tools they need to help locate \npeople with Alzheimer's disease or other forms of dementia as well as \nchildren with autism spectrum disorders who wander away from their \nfamilies or caregivers and into dangerous situations.\n  My home State of Iowa has the fifth highest Alzheimer's death rate in \nAmerica and we have about 63,000 Iowans living with the disease, \naccording to the Alzheimer's Association. Additionally, the CDC \nidentified 1 in 68 children across the country as having autism \nspectrum disorders. In Iowa alone, about 8,000 individuals have been \ndiagnosed with autism spectrum disorders.\n  This bill will make resources available to equip first responders, \nlaw enforcement officials, and other community leaders with the \ntraining and tools necessary to better prevent and respond to these \ncases as soon as possible. With better information sharing, communities \ncan play a central role in reuniting autistic children and other \nindividuals who wander with their families.\n  Finally, the bill will ensure that local law enforcement agencies and \nnonprofits that educate and train people on how to proactively prevent \nand locate missing individuals who wander are eligible for grants from \nthe U.S. Department of Justice. These grants will facilitate the \ndevelopment of training and emergency protocols for\n\n\nschool personnel, supply first responders with additional information \nand resources, and make local tracking technology programs available \nfor individuals who may wander from safety because of their condition. \nGrant funding may also be used to establish or enhance notification and \ncommunications systems for the recovery of missing children with \nautism.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation, which in \nthe 114th Congress passed the Senate unanimously. The House companion \nbill garnered over 90 cosponsors and passed the other chamber by vote \nof 346 to 66 in the 114th Congress. Our bill has been endorsed by, \namong others, the Autism Society of Iowa, Autism Speaks, the National \nAutism Association, SafeMinds, the National Center for Missing and \nExploited Children, ANCOR (American Network of Community Options), \nNational Autism Society of America, the Alzheimer's Impact Movement, \nthe National Down Syndrome Society, and the Color of Autism Foundation.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. GRASSLEY", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "Senate", "num": "178", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "S7002-S7003", "wkday": "Thursday", "day": "2", "month": "November"}, "related_bills": [{"type": "S", "context": "FIRSTPARAGRAPH", "congress": "115", "number": "2070"}, {"type": "S", "context": "OTHER", "congress": "115", "number": "2070"}], "doc_title": "STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS", "id": "CREC-2017-11-02-pt1-PgS7002"}
