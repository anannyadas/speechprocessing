Madam Speaker, on Tuesday, we had the holiday of \nHalloween, and a character came to my house with paint all over their \nface, and I thought they were the musical group KISS. Well, they \nweren't.\n  They were the Trump administration, disguised as the Trump \nadministration is, and with the simple logo of KISS: Keep it simple, \nstupid. That is what the Trump administration's attempts are to the \nAmerican people.\n  The previous speaker made some comments about regulations and said \nthat the Obama administration wanted to stop Second Amendment advocates \nfrom getting guns, arbitrarily, for Social Security recipients. Well, \nthat sounds good. It is simple. Keep it simple.\n  Well, they weren't Social Security recipients. They were Social \nSecurity recipients who had been declared incompetent to manage their \nown affairs. That is who they said shouldn't get guns, not Social \nSecurity recipients.\n  The previous speaker said something about abortion provider Planned \nParenthood getting their funds cut off. Planned Parenthood does most of \ntheir work outside of the arena of abortion. Mostly, they do women's \nbasic health services, and by cutting that off, they are hurting women, \nparticularly in my community and other communities where poor people \noften get their healthcare, their women's care, from Planned \nParenthood, and they are depriving them of that healthcare.\n  Just yesterday, in the subcommittee of which I am the ranking member, \nwe had a hearing on changing Roe v. Wade. They called it the Heartbeat \nbill. In reality, it is destruction of women's right to choose, a \nfundamental right established in Roe v. Wade, and an unconstitutional \nbill that could limit the right of a woman to have an abortion as early \nas 6 weeks, while right now it is 20 to 24 weeks, the period of \nviability.\n  They brought a sonogram in and showed a sonogram on the monitor. What \nthey didn't do when they talked about their ``culture of death'' was \nbring in any lifesaving equipment that\n\n\nwill not be available when they cut $1 billion from Medicaid and $500 \nmillion from Medicare in their tax proposal, when they put 23 million \npeople off of healthcare, the Affordable Care Act, which is what they \ntried to do but couldn't accomplish.\n  It is difficult to sit here and watch what is happening to our \ncountry. Having the Trump administration tell the middle class they are \ngoing to get a tax cut on the one hand, but on the other hand, they are \ncreating over a trillion dollars in debt, where is that debt going to \ncome from? It is going to come from programs that the middle class will \nhave to give up, so they will be net losers.\n  One of the main thrusts of their tax proposal is to eliminate the \nState tax, originally to do it immediately. Now they are talking about \nmaybe phasing it out over 5 or 6 years. That will cost the Federal \nbudget $290 billion. That will come from Pell grants that give people \nthe opportunity to go to college and not have a terrible debt over \ntheir heads when they leave; from SNAP payments that give nutritional \nbenefits to people that otherwise would go without, the families that \nwould go without food and proper nutritional benefits; and even LIHEAP, \nwhich gives help with heating bills to people who can't afford it in \ndifficult winter conditions.\n  What they are proposing is not a middle class tax cut. It is a cut \nfor the wealthiest in our country, and that is who will get the \nbenefits. That is who they are about.\n  Their whole program is KISS: Keep it simple, stupid. That is the only \nway they can try to sell their wealthy tax break, their aims to prevent \nwomen from getting proper healthcare, and their attacks on women in \ngeneral.\n\n  It is unfortunate what we see, what we saw earlier this week in the \nindictments handed out to Mr. Manafort, Mr. Gates, and the guilty plea \nof Mr. Papadopoulos. Individuals involved with the campaign and the \nadministration have not been the best, as they were supposed to be. In \nfact, they are suspected of criminal behavior, and one has admitted to \nit.\n  Our democracy is at risk, and I fear what could happen to it. That is \nwhy I introduced an amendment to the Constitution to limit the \nPresident's pardon power so he couldn't pardon himself, members of his \nfamily, members of his administration, or paid members of his campaign \nstaff.\n  He has already pardoned Joe Arpaio, and he has threatened to use that \npower in furtherance as he discussed the possibility of pardoning \nhimself. If he does so, any of these pardons, it will be a test of our \ndemocracy, and it will be a test of my colleagues on the other side.\n  We must protect democracy and protect America from unlawful activity.\n  God bless America.\n", "turn": 1, "speaker": "Mr. COHEN", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "178", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H8391-H8392", "wkday": "Thursday", "day": "2", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "KEEP IT SIMPLE, STUPID", "id": "CREC-2017-11-02-pt1-PgH8391-2", "title": "KEEP IT SIMPLE, STUPID"}
