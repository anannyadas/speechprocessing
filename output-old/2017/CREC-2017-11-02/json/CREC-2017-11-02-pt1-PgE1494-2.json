Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Jaswinder \nSandhu of Sutter County, California, who has spent her career focused \non improving the lives of people in her community. At a young age, she \njoined her farmworker parents in the fields to earn extra money during \nthe summer. It was during those times that she realized the plight of \nthe poor and became determined to make a difference.\n   Jaswinder's passion to help others has always been her priority. \nHaving left a job in the private sector in 2003, she began her career \nas Site Manager for Mahal Plaza, a low income multi-family farm labor \ncomplex in Yuba City. Since then, she's been credited with securing \n$313,000 in grant funding to build a safe passage route for children \nfrom Mahal Plaza as they walk to school. She also implemented several \ncommunity programs and services at the property, including a community \ngarden, day care, and ESL and exercise classes. She also offers Mahal \nas a venue for community gatherings such as the annual National Night \nOut, which is one of the most largely attended community events in Yuba \nCity.\n   A testament to Jaswinder's commitment to the community and her \nexcellence in property management, she was honored as Site Manager of \nthe Year for Farm Labor Housing for the State of California.
