Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the \naccomplishments of Staff Sergeant James Harrell, U.S. Marine Corps, who \nserved his country and continues to selflessly serve his fellow \nveterans and his community following his retirement He is a fitting \nrecipient of a Congressional Veteran Commendation.\n  SSG Harrell served six years in the United States Marine Corps, \nincluding two tours in Vietnam. During his service, SSG Harrell was a \nrecipient of numerous awards and recognitions, including the Marine \nCombat Action Ribbon. After being Honorably Discharged, SSG Harrell \nreturned to Texas where he rose to become the Assistant Chief Deputy \nfor Williamson County's Sheriff's Department.\n  SSG Harrell's love for his country is matched only by his commitment \nto his fellow service members. After recognizing the needs of our \ncounty's less fortunate veterans, SSG Harrell joined his good friend \nMajor Barry Richard, United States Air Force, Retired to help over \ntwelve Williamson County veterans by rebuilding homes, bringing them up \nto code, doing repairs, and more for over five years. Together, they've \nmade real and lasting impacts on the lives of their fellow veterans.\n  SSG Harrell serves his fellow men with the same dedication, honor, \nand humility with which he defended his country. He exemplifies what it \nmeans to be an American, consistently placing his country and fellow \nmen before himself. I thank and commend SSG Harrell, a passionate \nleader with a servant's heart, for his dedication and service.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. CARTER of Texas", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 3}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "178", "extension": true, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "E1496", "wkday": "Thursday", "day": "2", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "CELEBRATING THE ACCOMPLISHMENTS OF STAFF SERGEANT JAMES HARRELL, U.S. MARINE CORPS", "id": "CREC-2017-11-02-pt1-PgE1496", "title": "CELEBRATING THE ACCOMPLISHMENTS OF STAFF SERGEANT JAMES HARRELL, U.S.  MARINE CORPS"}
