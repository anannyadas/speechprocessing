Mr. Speaker, it is game seven of the World Series. \nBest hitting team in baseball, the Houston Astros Orange, vs. the best \npitching team in baseball, the LA Dodgers Blue. The series is tied up \nthree games apiece.\n  Top of the second inning, Springer is at the plate. It is the third \npitch. Springer loads up and belts it. Home run. Springer smacks his \nfifth round tripper of the World Series. The Astros are up 5-0.\n  Next inning--next several innings--all the bats are silent, except \nLA, the best record team in baseball, gets a run.\n  It is the bottom of the ninth. The Astros take the field. Score: 5-1. \nOne out. Two outs. Houston pitcher Morton sends a sinker straight \nacross the plate. It is a ground ball. Three outs.\n  It is all over but the shouting. Astros win! Astros win! Astros win! \nWorld Series Champions of 2017.\n  The championship predicted in 2014 by ``Sports Illustrated'' with \nSpringer on the cover finally happens after 55 years.\n  And the city of Houston goes ASTRO-nomical.\n  And that is just the way it is.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. POE of Texas", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "178", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H8393", "wkday": "Thursday", "day": "2", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "AND THE FANS GO WILD", "id": "CREC-2017-11-02-pt1-PgH8393-5", "title": "AND THE FANS GO WILD"}
