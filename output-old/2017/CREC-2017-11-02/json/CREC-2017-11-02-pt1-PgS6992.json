{"content": [{"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "C001088", "text": "  Mr. COONS. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to join several \nof my colleagues in raising concerns about nominations to the Federal \njudiciary and the Senate's role in carrying out its constitutional \nadvice and consent responsibilities. From my vantage point as a member \nof the Judiciary Committee, I can see all too clearly that an alarming \ntrend of more and more extreme judicial candidates appearing before us \nis growing, that more extreme judicial candidates are being nominated, \nand that the safeguards here in the Senate that are important to our \nvetting process are being threatened.\n  Let me start by giving a simple overview of what has happened, first \nin terms of the speed at which we are considering critical lifetime \nappointments to some of the most central courts in our whole Federal \njudicial system.\n  Just this week, my Republican colleagues have brought forward four \ncircuit court nominees--four nominees in one week--beginning to end. \nThat is more than the number of circuit court nominees than were \nconfirmed in the entire first year of President Obama's Presidency.\n  More important to me than the speed is the quality of our process of \nreviewing these important nominations. The\n\n\nAmerican Bar Association has issued unanimous ``not qualified'' ratings \nfor two current judicial nominees. That hasn't happened in over a \ndecade--since 2006. The American Bar Association is not a partisan or a \npolitical group. Founded in 1878, the ABA is a national professional \norganization with over 400,000 attorney members. The ABA's \nuncontroversial objectives are to serve its members, improve the legal \nprofession, enhance diversity, and advance and secure the rule of law \nin our Nation. Its contributions to the legal profession are \nsignificant. It is the ABA that accredits law schools and establishes \nmodel ethical codes.\n  Additionally, since 1953, when President Eisenhower invited the ABA \nto provide specific, timely input on candidates for Federal judgeships, \nthe ABA has evaluated nominees for professional competence, integrity, \nand judicial temperament. This is a rigorous process that involves \ncollecting impartial, peer-review evaluations of candidates.\n  It is startling that less than a year into this administration, two \nnominees have already received ``not qualified'' ratings from the ABA, \nand two more nominees are under consideration of what is called a \nsecond evaluator. This is concerning. You see, the ABA does not take \ngiving a ``not qualified'' rating lightly. Any time an evaluator is \nconsidering recommending ``not qualified,'' a second evaluator is \nbrought in to conduct an independent review. I believe all nominees to \nlifetime article III appointments on the Federal bench should have the \ncompetence, integrity, and temperament to do the important work that \nFederal judges are called on to perform.\n  The nominees we are seeing not only raise concerns about professional \nqualifications and the speed with which they have been processed. Many \nof the President's recent candidates are notable for their polarizing, \ndivisive, even offensive rhetoric, rather than the depth of their legal \nexperience or the quality of their judicial temperament. I will give \njust a few selections from a broad range.\n  We have recently considered candidates on the Judiciary Committee who \nhad blogged at length in support for birtherism, the discredited and \nuntrue conspiracy theory that suggested that our immediate past \nPresident wasn't born in the United States. Another suggested that \n``Mama Pelosi'' should be ``gagged.'' Another called Supreme Court \nJustice Kennedy a ``judicial prostitute,'' compared abortion to \nslavery, complained that Americans overreacted to Sandy Hook, repeated \nanti-gay slurs, and said transgender children are proof that ``Satan's \nplan is working.'' Many alarming, even extreme comments are in the \nrecords of folks brought forward for confirmation--a startling number \nof them.\n  Frankly, this isn't about party allegiance--being a Republican or a \nDemocrat, being a conservative or a liberal. This is about having the \njudgment and the temperament to be a Federal judge.\n  The mechanisms we have for completely evaluating nominees are today \nbeing strained. The American Bar Association has been cut out of some \nof the White House's efforts, its prenomination vetting process. That \nmeans that when the ABA conducts an evaluation and seeks feedback from \na candidate's peers, they discover the nomination has already been \nannounced by the White House. The candidate has already been chosen. \nUnderstandably, lawyers are reluctant to provide candid feedback when \nthey know a potential judge has already been nominated. Additionally, \nit is concerning that we have had hearings in the Judiciary Committee \nbefore the ABA rating process is completed. When that happens, it \nprevents the ABA, our professional organization of attorneys, from \nbeing called to testify to explain a ``not qualified'' rating at a \nhearing where a nominee is considered. In fact, just earlier today, we \nhad two judicial nominees listed on our agenda who do not yet have an \nABA rating.\n  I am not suggesting that every Senator needs to vote in lockstep with \nthe ABA rating, but I feel strongly that the ABA's evaluation must be \navailable to Senators before they are asked to vote on a nominee for a \nlifetime position as a Federal judge.\n  Another tool that is under attack that is a century-old tradition of \nthe Judiciary Committee is the so-called blue slip. This is a practice \nthat allows the two home-State Senators to give a positive or negative \nrecommendation on a nominee before they receive a hearing and are \nconsidered for lifetime tenure. It allows each Senator to approve the \njudicial nominations for vacancies in their home States or in the \ncircuit courts where a seat is traditionally associated with that home \nState. By requiring that blue slips be returned before a nominee is \nconsidered, each Senator is afforded the courtesy to evaluate whether a \njudicial nominee will meet the needs of his or her constituents and the \npriorities and values of their home State. It is an important tool for \nensuring that the White House of either party consults with Senators \nabout the judicial candidates the President is considering for \nnomination. In the end, this tool promotes consensus candidates by \nensuring all Senators' views are taken into account, without respect to \npartisan registration.\n  As a Senator from Delaware--a State with two current judicial \nvacancies in one of the busiest district courts in America, which only \nhas four active judgeships--I have been focused on working \ncollaboratively with the White House in a productive manner that \nensures that my State gets qualified consensus nominees from the White \nHouse. I am pleased to report that Senator Carper and I have had a very \npositive experience so far working with the White House on these \npotential nominations, and it is my hope that we will soon see nominees \nI can support without reservation. But the blue slip process ensures \nthat this consultative, constructive experience is the rule, not the \nexception. It is unfortunate that this blue slip practice--this \ncentury-old tradition of the Judiciary Committee--is under sustained \nattack. I believe we should maintain it for all Senators, in the best \ninterests of this institution and our Federal judiciary.\n  Article III judges, as I have said, serve with lifetime tenure. They \ndecide issues of civil rights, of personal freedom, commercial disputes \nof enormous value, and even life and death. These judges can and \nshould, on occasion, also serve as checks on Presidential power \noverreach. Just in the past few months, article III judges have \nenjoined executive orders, including the so-called travel ban, the \ntransgender military ban, and the decision to strip funding from \nsanctuary cities.\n  We should be advancing nominees who can earn broad support from \nMembers of both parties, nominees with the experience to handle some of \nthe most complex and demanding judicial issues of our time, nominees \nwho have demonstrated the temperament to administer justice fairly. \nThese nominations matter. The nominees who will fill the 140 current \njudicial vacancies on district and circuit courts across our country \nwill play a critical role in either protecting or undermining the \nconstitutional rights that are the bedrock of our Republic. Our courts \nmust continue to be the place where everyone is treated fairly and the \nlegal rights of our citizens can be vindicated.\n  I wish to close by calling on my colleagues to reconsider how we are \nconducting the judicial nominee process. This race to confirm as many \nnominees as possible is not how we respect the rule of law--one of the \nmost treasured American values.\n  I have come to the floor multiple times since the beginning of this \nCongress to convey and speak about the importance of bipartisanship, \nand I will continue to do that today.\n  As we have seen in important public policy matters, from the \nhealthcare debate to the current debate on tax reform, Republicans and \nDemocrats need to work together to get things done. Purely partisan \nprocesses will not succeed in this or future Congresses. We have to \nwork together to protect our democracy and our rule of law.\n  I would also like to note that today Sam Clovis withdrew as a nominee \nfor Chief Scientist at the USDA.\n  I am not here to comment on any connection to any ongoing \ninvestigations or other social issues but, rather, would like to \ncomment on a simple concern I have had since his nomination; namely, \nthat Mr. Clovis is unqualified to serve as Chief Scientist, lacking any \nprofessional training in the hard sciences. This is not just my opinion \nbut a matter of statutory requirement. It is a requirement in statute \nto have a background in science.\n\n\nScience is critically important to agriculture, and this is another \nFederal agency that depends on good science.\n  Given the serious challenges facing America's farmers and our food \nsystem--from pollinator declines, to deteriorating soil health, to a \nchanging climate--USDA's science mission is extremely important. As \nsomeone whose home State university has a vibrant department of \nagriculture, as someone who knows the very broad range of Federal \nfunding for USDA that supports agriculture-related scientific \nresearch--the USDA is critical in helping provide our farmers with the \ninformation they need to improve plant and animal resilience, to be \nmore effective stewards of the land, and to adopt new technologies and \npractices on their farms. This could all be at risk if the agency's \nhead of science has no relevant scientific training and even rejects \ncurrent scientific thinking.\n  I believe that science, not mere opinion or partisan attitude, should \nunderpin our decisions when it comes to our Nation's agricultural \npolicy.\n  It is my hope that the administration will now go back and recommend \na nominee who is scientifically trained and who cares deeply about the \nrole of science in our Nation's agriculture.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. COONS", "itemno": 0}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
