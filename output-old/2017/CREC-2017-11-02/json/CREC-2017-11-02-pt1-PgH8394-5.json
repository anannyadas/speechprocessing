Mr. Speaker, good morning, America. What about those \nHouston Astros?\n  As Representative of the 18th Congressional District in the great \ncity of Houston, let me thank the Houston Astros for taking a Harvey-\nworn community to the highest lengths. We had never won the World \nSeries.\n  Minute Maid is a fine stadium and the L.A. Dodgers were a very fine \ncompetitor. Let me thank all of them for the great sportsmanship, the \ncharacter that was shown.\n  It shows what America is about. You can be two great adversaries on \nthe battlefield of baseball, but you can still be great friends and \ncolleagues and part of the great American pastime.\n  Thank you to the mayor, the county government, the State government, \nall of those fans out there. Thank you to George Springer and Altuve, \nwho caught the final out. Oh, I was so excited.\n  Congratulations to those southern boys, the boys of the south, the \nboys of the southwest. They did a great job. Yes, we are the World \nSeries champion, the American League champion. Go, Houston Astros.\n  Mr. Speaker, I thank you for your kindness. I am so excited. They are \ngreat young men.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Ms. JACKSON LEE", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 3}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "178", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H8394", "wkday": "Thursday", "day": "2", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "CONGRATULATING THE HOUSTON ASTROS WINNING THE WORLD SERIES", "id": "CREC-2017-11-02-pt1-PgH8394-5", "title": null}
