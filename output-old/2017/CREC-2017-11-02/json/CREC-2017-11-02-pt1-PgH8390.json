Madam Speaker, the so-called Republican tax plan will \nincrease taxes on the middle class, explode the deficit, and undermine \nMedicare and Medicaid. It will saddle your children and grandchildren \nwith more than $1 trillion in debt, simply to provide millionaires and \nbillionaires with a massive tax cut.\n  Now, House Republicans will argue that trickle-down economics, \nsupply-side economics, and dynamic scoring will somehow magically save \nthe day. But the notion that massive tax cuts for millionaires and \nbillionaires will somehow result in strong economic growth is a phony, \nfraudulent, and fake argument. It has no basis in reality. There is no \nevidence to support this fantasy.\n  When Ronald Reagan cut taxes on millionaires and billionaires, it \ndidn't result in strong economic growth. It led to a massive deficit.\n  When George W. Bush cut taxes on millionaires and billionaires, it \ndidn't result in strong economic growth. It led to the Great Recession.\n  When the Republican Governor of Kansas cut taxes on millionaires and \nbillionaires, it didn't result in strong economic growth. It led to \nprison riots, overcrowded schools, and crumbling infrastructure.\n  We cannot allow this scheme to happen to the United States of \nAmerica. The American people deserve a better deal.\n", "turn": 1, "speaker": "Mr. JEFFRIES", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "178", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H8390", "wkday": "Thursday", "day": "2", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "REPUBLICAN TAX PLAN", "id": "CREC-2017-11-02-pt1-PgH8390", "title": "REPUBLICAN TAX PLAN"}
