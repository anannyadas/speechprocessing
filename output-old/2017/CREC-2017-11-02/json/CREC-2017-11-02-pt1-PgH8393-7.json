Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge my colleagues to \nsupport the CHAMPIONING HEALTHY KIDS Act. This critical healthcare \nlegislation provides a 5-year extension to the CHIP program that so \nmany children and low-income families rely on.\n  In my district alone, over 21,000 children use CHIP for access to \nlow-cost healthcare services.\n  I am also proud that this legislation includes a needed 2-year \nextension of funding for community health centers. This is an issue I \nhave worked hard on, as almost 95,000 people in my district receive \ncritical healthcare and preventative services from these centers.\n  There is still much more work to do to improve our healthcare system \nfor families in the north country.\n  In Congress, I will keep fighting to protect the programs our \ndistrict depends on, and I will continue working toward the affordable, \nhigh-quality healthcare system that my district deserves.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Ms. STEFANIK", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "178", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H8393", "wkday": "Thursday", "day": "2", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "CHAMPIONING HEALTHY KIDS", "id": "CREC-2017-11-02-pt1-PgH8393-7", "title": "CHAMPIONING HEALTHY KIDS"}
