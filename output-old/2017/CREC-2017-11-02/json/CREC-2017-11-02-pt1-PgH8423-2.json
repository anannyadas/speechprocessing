Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak in favor \nof H.R. 3922, the Community Health and Medical Professionals Improve \nOur Nation Act. This legislation reauthorizes the Children's Health \nInsurance Program--or CHIP, as we know it--as well as funding for \ncommunity health centers in a fiscally responsible manner.\n  These programs have proven to be a valuable asset for many of the \npeople in this country and many of the constituents that I have back \nhome in Louisiana who don't qualify for Medicaid but still need \nassistance in accessing affordable health insurance.\n  In Louisiana alone, insurance providers have projected that rates \nwill increase substantially next year as healthcare options continue to \ndwindle. For that reason, many Americans are choosing to forgo \nhealthcare coverage altogether rather than suffer under the weight of \nthe new, increased costs.\n  In times of high uncertainty in our healthcare system due to \nObamaCare, this legislation makes meaningful reforms to ensure the most \nvulnerable among us, our children, remain protected.\n  The Community Health Center Fund has proven to be a critical resource \nfor Louisiana's Fourth Congressional District by delivering much-needed \nresources to my local community health centers.\n  I just want to say this program, in particular, is vitally important \nfor the safety and security of our children. Republicans in Congress \nhave worked tirelessly to draft this legislation to ensure that this \nbill maintains important safeguards for our children and families and \nprotects their access to critical care.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "178", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H8423", "wkday": "Thursday", "day": "2", "month": "November"}, "related_bills": [{"type": "HR", "context": "FIRSTPARAGRAPH", "congress": "115", "number": "3922"}, {"type": "HR", "context": "OTHER", "congress": "115", "number": "3922"}], "doc_title": "CHIP AND COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTERS", "id": "CREC-2017-11-02-pt1-PgH8423-2"}
