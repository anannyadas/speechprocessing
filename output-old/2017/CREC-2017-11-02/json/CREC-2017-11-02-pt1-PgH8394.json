Mr. Speaker, there are less than 21 legislative \ndays left this calendar year, and the House has yet to vote for a \npermanent solution to protect DREAMers from deportation.\n  H.R. 3440, known as the Dream Act, introduced by Congresswoman \nLucille Roybal-Allard and me, is an effort to put an end to the fear \nand the uncertainty that surrounds over 800,000 young immigrants living \nin our country.\n  This bill will allow qualified DREAMers an opportunity to better plan \nfor their future in the only country they truly know as home--the \nUnited States.\n  After several years, they will be able to apply for conditional \npermanent residency, and eventually for citizenship. And during that \ntime, they will continue to participate in their daily activities, such \nas contributing to our communities, helping our economy, and showcasing \ntheir talent and ingenuity.\n  Mr. Speaker, let's do what is right for these young immigrants \nbecause they are already Americans in their hearts and minds. Let's \nbring the Dream Act for a vote so that these young professionals can \nmake their American Dream a reality. The clock is ticking, Mr. Speaker.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "178", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H8394", "wkday": "Thursday", "day": "2", "month": "November"}, "related_bills": [{"type": "HR", "context": "FIRSTPARAGRAPH", "congress": "115", "number": "3440"}, {"type": "HR", "context": "OTHER", "congress": "115", "number": "3440"}], "doc_title": "DREAMERS", "id": "CREC-2017-11-02-pt1-PgH8394"}
