Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor and congratulate \nJeff Garnsey as he is named the 2017 Clayton Citizen of the Year.\n  Jeff began his long career of service to both his country and \ncommunity upon entering the United States Navy in 1983. Throughout his \n26-year military career, he served on seven different submarines, one \nof which broke the endurance record under the North Pole by spending 97 \nconsecutive days submerged in water. He also served on the Navy's most \ndecorated warship, the USS Parche, where his crew received the \nPresidential Unit Citation, as well as the USS Cheyenne, which \nparticipated in the Iraq war's first shots and strategic strike. Jeff \nwas ultimately advanced to the Navy's highest enlisted paygrade of \nMaster Chief Petty Officer.\n  Now retired from his naval career, Mr. Garnsey is the proud owner of \nGarnsey's Classic Island Cruises and holds several leadership positions \nin the Clayton community, including Board President at Save The River \nand Director of the Muskie Hall of Fame. Truly committed to giving \nback, he also volunteers at many local organizations such as the 1000 \nIslands Museum, the Clayton Rotary Club, the Clayton Opera House, and \nthe Clayton Chamber of Commerce.\n  I would like to thank Mr. Garnsey for the sacrifices he has made in \nserving our country and the people of the North Country. His commitment \nto others is a reminder of the strength that veterans bring to our \nlocal communities and sets a wonderful example for residents of New \nYork's 21st District.\n\n\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Ms. STEFANIK", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 3}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "178", "extension": true, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "E1494-E1495", "wkday": "Thursday", "day": "2", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "HONORING JEFF GARNSEY, THE 2017 CLAYTON CITIZEN OF THE YEAR", "id": "CREC-2017-11-02-pt1-PgE1494-5", "title": "HONORING JEFF GARNSEY, THE 2017 CLAYTON CITIZEN OF THE YEAR"}
