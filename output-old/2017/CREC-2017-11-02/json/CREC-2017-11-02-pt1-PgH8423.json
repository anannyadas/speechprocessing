Mr. Speaker, today I rise to congratulate a group that I \nhave worked with for some time, the Jersey City H.O.N.E.Y. Bees Double \nDutch team for their big wins at the American Double Dutch League's \n44th international competition.\n  But tragedy intervened. Sadly, on October 28, one of the H.O.N.E.Y. \nBees passed away. I ask my colleagues to join me in honor and \nremembrance of the life of Jeremiah Grant.\n  Jerry was a student at the Ollie Culbreth Jr. School in Jersey City, \nNew Jersey. He excelled in academics and in the world of competitive \njump rope. At only 8 years old, Jerry was the youngest member of the \nH.O.N.E.Y. Bees. He was also the only boy on the team and was called \nPrince Bee. Jerry was a winner, and his legacy of love will live on in \nnorth Jersey.\n  May Jerry ``Prince Bee'' continue flying high in eternal peace.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. PAYNE", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "178", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H8423", "wkday": "Thursday", "day": "2", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "HONORING THE LIFE OF JEREMIAH GRANT", "id": "CREC-2017-11-02-pt1-PgH8423", "title": "HONORING THE LIFE OF JEREMIAH GRANT"}
