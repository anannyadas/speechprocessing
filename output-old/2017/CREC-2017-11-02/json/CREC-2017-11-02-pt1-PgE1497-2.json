Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize the Literacy Council \nof Northern Virginia (LCNV) and to congratulate the volunteers, \ninstructors, students, community partners, and others who will be \nrecognized at the 2017 LCNV Recognition Celebration.\n  The mission of LCNV is to teach adults the basic skills of reading, \nwriting, speaking, and understanding English in order to empower them \nto participate more fully and confidently in their communities.
