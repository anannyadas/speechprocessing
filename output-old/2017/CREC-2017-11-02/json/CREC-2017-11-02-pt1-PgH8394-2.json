Mr. Speaker, I have received hundreds of \nletters from constituents who are deeply worried about the proposed tax \nplan.\n  One San Diegan told me that, without the State and local tax \ndeduction, his family of seven faces a loss of over $40,000 in \ndeductions.\n  Another constituent told me that his family would lose $20,000 in \ntake-home pay under this tax plan.\n  Why on Earth would we do this to middle class families? Why would we \ncap the mortgage deductions middle class home buyers depend on to lower \ntaxes for huge corporations?\n  This plan is simply reckless and hurtful to the American people and \nour economic growth.\n  Let's take a look at real tax reform for real people, not a plan that \nhelps those who need it the least.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mrs. DAVIS of California", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "178", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H8394", "wkday": "Thursday", "day": "2", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "REAL TAX REFORM FOR REAL PEOPLE", "id": "CREC-2017-11-02-pt1-PgH8394-2", "title": "REAL TAX REFORM FOR REAL PEOPLE"}
