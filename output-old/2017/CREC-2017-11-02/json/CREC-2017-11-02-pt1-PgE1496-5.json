Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the New Jersey \nBroadcasters Association (NJBA) as its members gather to celebrate its \n70th anniversary this year. This milestone and the NJBA's efforts to \nsupport radio and television stations in New Jersey are truly deserving \nof this body's recognition.\n  Since its inception, the NJBA has represented the common interests of \nNew Jersey's broadcasters. It continues to be the leading voice in \nTrenton, New Jersey and Washington, D.C. on broadcast issues and \npriorities and is an effective advocate on behalf of its member \nstations. In addition to its advocacy, the NJBA's training and \neducational programs are invaluable resources to radio and television \nstations and its understanding of compliance rules and procedures help \nits members navigate the changing broadcast landscape.\n  Initiated by New Jersey radio stations, the NJBA's success is evident \nin its growth to include both radio and television stations throughout \nthe state as well as several stations in New York City and \nPhiladelphia. Its current President and CEO, Paul Rotella, maintains \nthe NJBA's mission, while also adapting to meet the complex changes of \ntechnology in the broadcast field.\n  Mr. Speaker, I sincerely hope that my colleagues will join me in \nmarking the 70th anniversary of the New Jersey Broadcasters Association \nand recognizing its outstanding efforts to promote New Jersey's local \nbroadcast stations.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. PALLONE", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 3}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "178", "extension": true, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "E1496", "wkday": "Thursday", "day": "2", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "IN RECOGNITION OF THE 70TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE NEW JERSEY BROADCASTERS ASSOCIATION", "id": "CREC-2017-11-02-pt1-PgE1496-5", "title": "IN RECOGNITION OF THE 70TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE NEW JERSEY BROADCASTERS  ASSOCIATION"}
