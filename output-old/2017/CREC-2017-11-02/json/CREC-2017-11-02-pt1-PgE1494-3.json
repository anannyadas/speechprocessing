Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize Wells \nMiddle School in Dublin, California for its designation as a 2017 \nNational School of Character.\n  Wells Middle School is the only school in California to receive the \n2017 National School of Character Award. The administration of Wells \nMiddle School has worked diligently to meet the stringent standards \nnecessary to receive this distinction. It has minimized incidences of \ncheating and bullying while maximizing student and parent engagement.\n  At Wells Middle School, character education is made a priority by the \nadministration and teachers. The character education program focuses on \nbringing relevant, engaging and versatile resources directly to the \nstudents. The school makes an extensive effort to prioritize the \nsuccess of its students.\n  One example is the Response to Intervention program. This program \nprovides a network of instructional sessions for teachers and students, \nwhich work to address academic and behavioral concerns. This \nprogramming stresses inclusivity and adaptability as it seeks to meet \nthe needs of all Wells Middle School students.\n  In addition to the National School of Character designation, Wells \nMiddle School was named a 2017 California Gold Ribbon School by the \nCalifornia Department ofEducation and a 2017 California School of \nCharacter.\n  I am honored to have such an incredible school within my district, \nand as a Wells Middle School student, benefited myself from its focus \non character. The continual effort of Wells Middle School to promote \nthe success of its students both academically and behaviorally, serves \nas a statewide example of an ideal institution for holistic student \ngrowth. Our community is better and stronger as a result of its \ntireless dedication.\n  I want to congratulate Wells Middle School on receiving the 2017 \nNational School of Character Award, and I wish the school and its \nstudents continued success in the years to come.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. SWALWELL of California", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 3}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "178", "extension": true, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "E1494", "wkday": "Thursday", "day": "2", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "RECOGNIZING WELLS MIDDLE SCHOOL AS A 2017 NATIONAL SCHOOL OF CHARACTER", "id": "CREC-2017-11-02-pt1-PgE1494-3", "title": "RECOGNIZING WELLS MIDDLE SCHOOL AS A 2017 NATIONAL SCHOOL OF CHARACTER"}
