Mr. Speaker, today, my colleagues on the Republican \nside of the aisle released their fiscally irresponsible tax bill.\n  I am still reading my way through the 492-page proposal, but it \ndoesn't take long to notice a huge flaw in the process: the majority is \nusing the partisan budget reconciliation process, a process \ntraditionally reserved for deficit reduction, to add over $1.5 trillion \nto the deficit and jam a reckless bill through the House without \nhearings, study, or debate. We don't have to operate that way.\n  Let's compare where we were the last time Congress reformed the Tax \nCode in 1986 to where we are today.\n  When Congress last took up this monumental task, it took over 2 \nyears. There were 4 months of public hearings, more than 450 witnesses, \n26 days of markup, and months of debate. This wasn't easy, but what did \nwe get?\n  We got a simplified Tax Code that did not add to the deficit and a \nbill that had broad bipartisan support in the House and the Senate, and \nthe support of the American people.\n  Mr. Speaker, let's work together on a bipartisan basis. Let's reform \nthe Tax Code in a way that helps the middle class and does not add to \nour children's deficit in the future.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. SCHRADER", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "178", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H8424", "wkday": "Thursday", "day": "2", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "FISCALLY IRRESPONSIBLE TAX BILL", "id": "CREC-2017-11-02-pt1-PgH8424-3", "title": "FISCALLY IRRESPONSIBLE TAX BILL"}
