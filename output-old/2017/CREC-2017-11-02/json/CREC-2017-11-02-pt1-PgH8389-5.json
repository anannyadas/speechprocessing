Madam Speaker, I recently visited the \nInnovation Commons at Penn State Behrend in Erie County, which is an \nidea lab that offers support for entrepreneurs and startup companies.\n  It opened in January of 2016 to innovators, including those at the \nstudent level, who sought a place to organize, collaborate, compose, \nand construct their ideas.\n  The Innovation Commons is a part of the Innovation Beehive, which is \nhoused at, and managed by, Penn State Behrend. It is in partnership \nwith three additional Erie County universities: Mercyhurst, Gannon, and \nEdinboro. It was the first of its kind in 2016, and its success \nestablished a business network across Erie County--or, in other words, \nthe beehive.\n  The beehive sites will operate as both individual service providers \nand as part of a larger, connected network, with multiple points of \nentry for entrepreneurs. All services will be available to the public \nand to businesses seeking to develop new products or enter new markets.\n  Each lab will specialize in different aspects of product or business \ndevelopment:\n  Edinboro University will provide advertising, marketing, and public \nrelations strategies for business startups. Both current students and \nthose entrepreneurs in the community can all seek assistance with all \nof these universities. The lab, which will be equipped with high-end \nprinters, art supplies, drafting tables, and other multimedia support, \nwill be located in the Baron-Forness Library;\n  Gannon University will focus on business development, including \nbusiness analysis. The Gannon beehive, which will be located in the \nCenter for Business Ingenuity, will offer access to the Small Business \nDevelopment Center and the Erie Technology Incubator;\n  Mercyhurst University will provide business intelligence services and \nsolutions to help developers commercialize their ideas. Blended \nfaculty-student teams will use high-end computers, plotters, and other \ntools to develop custom intelligence products from within the Ridge \nCollege of Intelligence Studies.\n  Madam Speaker, this northwest Pennsylvania Innovation Beehive network \nis working to serve the region. It will enable innovators to access \nuniversities' resources and applied research\n\n\ncapabilities for new business development or expansion at little to no \ncost.\n\n  I recently participated in a roundtable discussion with the \nuniversity presidents, and I am very excited to see this collaborative \neffort take root in Erie County. This network was made possible thanks \nto the Ignite Erie Industry and Business Acceleration Collaborative, \nthe Erie County Gaming Authority, and the Appalachian Regional \nCommission.\n  This truly is a collaborative effort, and it is my hope that the \nbeehive will soon be abuzz with good ideas throughout Erie County. This \nis an excellent partnership that will give innovators and students \nhands-on, real-world experience to test their ideas and make their \ndreams become reality.\n  Madam Speaker, I am glad to see Erie County leveraging the strengths \nof these four universities for the betterment of its community. It is \nan exciting time in Erie County. I look forward to seeing what this \nbrings to the region.\n", "turn": 1, "speaker": "Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "178", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H8389-H8390", "wkday": "Thursday", "day": "2", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "ERIE COUNTY INNOVATION BEEHIVE SUPPORTS ENTREPRENEURS", "id": "CREC-2017-11-02-pt1-PgH8389-5", "title": "ERIE COUNTY INNOVATION BEEHIVE SUPPORTS ENTREPRENEURS"}
