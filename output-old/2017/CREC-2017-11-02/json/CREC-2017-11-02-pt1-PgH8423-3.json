Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my greatest \nsorrow for the New Yorkers, their families, and visitors who were \naffected by the tragedy in Lower Manhattan just 2 days ago. I offer my \nsincere condolences and prayers to their family members.\n  After this senseless and indiscriminate attack, Mr. Speaker, we \ncannot wait for another tragedy to pass before we decide to better \nprotect pedestrians and bicyclists, especially in areas of high foot \ntraffic.\n  The sidewalks and bike lanes of Times Square, the Financial District, \nand other city centers nationwide remain vulnerable. The STOP Act is a \nbipartisan bill that I have introduced, along with my colleague \nCongressman Dan Donovan from New York, just this last month and was \nrecently introduced by Senator Gillibrand in the Senate.\n  As we saw in Charlottesville, Barcelona, and in Times Square months \nago, vehicles are increasingly utilized in terror attacks worldwide. We \nmust prioritize the safety of our constituents first, including the \nsafety of pedestrians and of our communities. The STOP Act will provide \nfor the installation of bollards in areas of high foot traffic.\n  This attack does not define New York, just as no other attack can \ncrush the spirit of our city. We rise above those threats when we \ncontinue being a city that embraces people of all cultures and teaches \nlove and respect.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. ESPAILLAT", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "178", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H8423", "wkday": "Thursday", "day": "2", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "SAFE PEDESTRIAN AND BICYCLE PATHS", "id": "CREC-2017-11-02-pt1-PgH8423-3", "title": "SAFE PEDESTRIAN AND BICYCLE PATHS"}
