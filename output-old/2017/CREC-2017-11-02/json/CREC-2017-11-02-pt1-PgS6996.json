The Senator from Nebraska.\n\n\n       Confirmations of Amy Barrett, Joan Larsen, and Allison Eid\n", "turn": 10, "speaker": "The PRESIDING OFFICER", "itemno": 14}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "F000463", "text": "  Mrs. FISCHER. Mr. President, although nearly half of those graduating \nfrom law school are women, only about a third of the Federal judges are \nfemale. This week, we had the honor of adding three more.\n  I rise to congratulate these three successful women because their \nadditions to the Federal court system are historic. They serve as more \nevidence that well-qualified women are becoming more confident in \nstepping forward and serving our great Nation.\n  Amy Coney Barrett, Joan Louise Larsen, and Allison Eid are three more \ncracks in that glass ceiling. Their confirmations are proof that \nsuccessful women can balance responsibility and seize opportunity when \nit knocks on their doors. These accomplished nominees are not joining \nthe Federal bench because of a frivolous attempt at trying to balance \nout the gender disparity in our courts. They will be donning the black \nrobes because they will have earned it.\n  Amy Coney Barrett, our new judge for the Seventh Circuit, climbed to \nthe ranks by clerking for Judge Laurence Silberman on the DC Circuit \nand Justice Scalia on the U.S. Supreme Court. In working with her \nhusband, who is a successful lawyer in his own right, she has balanced \nfamily responsibilities while having achieved personal success. At the \nage of 30, she was hired as a professor at one of the Nation's best law \nprograms, Notre Dame. Over the past 6 years, she has sat on the \nAdvisory Committee on Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure on the \nrecommendation of Chief Justice Roberts.\n  Joan Louise Larsen, the next U.S. circuit judge for the Sixth \nCircuit, is proof that hard work pays off. After graduating at the top \nof her class from Northwestern, Judge Larsen clerked for Justice Scalia \non the U.S. Supreme Court before serving as a Deputy Assistant Attorney \nGeneral in the U.S. Department of Justice, Office of Legal Counsel. She \nmost recently sat on the highest court in her State, the Supreme Court \nof Michigan. She has done this while raising two children with her law \nprofessor husband.\n  Allison Eid, the newest judge for the Tenth Circuit, has demonstrated \nbrilliance throughout her career. After graduating from Stanford, she \nworked as an assistant speechwriter for William Bennett, President \nReagan's Secretary of Education. After graduating from law school with \nhonors, she clerked for Justice Clarence Thomas of the U.S. Supreme \nCourt. She has served with distinction on the Colorado Supreme Court \nsince 2006. With her husband, Troy, the first Egyptian American to \nserve as a U.S. district attorney, she has helped to raise two \nchildren.\n  These three successful women should serve as role models to girls and \nboys across this Nation. They are proof that women do not need to stand \nback while others find success, and their confirmations are evidence \nthat, when women support each other, they will achieve at the highest \nlevel. They also demonstrate the power of families when they work \ntogether to accomplish goals.\n  We should be proud to have confirmed these three great women to the \nFederal bench. All of us receive letters from children who ask \nquestions about: What do you do in the U.S. Senate? Weeks like this one \nshould be part of our response. We empower those who have empowered \nthemselves regardless of their gender. We shape our legal system by \nfilling it with qualified women who are dedicated to preserving and \nprotecting our Constitution--the framework of our free Nation. We \nproclaim that hard work is to be rewarded. These three important \nconfirmations are further proof that young women do not have to choose \nbetween raising families and rising to the top of their chosen \nprofessions.\n  I stand here today and send a message to every little girl who \nwonders about politics and every young woman who faces the challenges \nof starting out in her career: You can do this too. We love you, and we \nsupport you. Be confident when you want to step forward and serve your \ncommunity and serve your country.\n  The judicial nominees who were voted on this week exemplify the best \nof our Nation's legal community. Their confirmations to the Federal \nbench have added significant talent to our Nation's system of justice. \nThe work being done by the President and by this Senate in shaping the \nFederal courts with those who will follow the rule of law is historic. \nPresident Trump should be applauded for nominating such well-qualified \npeople to be on the Federal bench.\n  All of the nominees voted on this week will make exceptional \nadditions to the Federal bench, and I hope that the President will send \nmany more like them for us to consider. All four are deserving of their \nnew positions, and I am sure that they will honor and protect the \nConstitution and serve the American people well as good judges.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.", "turn": 11, "speaker": "Mrs. FISCHER", "itemno": 15}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
