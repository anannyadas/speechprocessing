Madam Speaker, I would like to start by saying I am \nheartbroken and shocked by the terror attack in New York this week. \nThis atrocious act of hatred and violence has no place in this country, \nand we must make it clear that we will not stand for it.\n  I offer my sincere condolences to every single person who has been \nimpacted by this senseless tragedy. My family and I will be in prayer \nfor everyone who has been hurt by this act, whether physically or \nemotionally.\n  I also want to thank law enforcement officers who responded so \nquickly, who saved lives and apprehended the suspect. As scary as this \nincident was, we can all be reassured by the courage and \nprofessionalism of our law enforcement, the military, and the \nintelligence community that work together to keep our country safe.\n  Madam Speaker, it has been a busy 10 months here in the House of \nRepresentatives. We have passed more than 360 bills this year alone in \na unified effort to deliver on our promises to the American people. Of \ncourse, many of those bills are aimed at rolling back the Big \nGovernment policies of the Obama era. So I would like to say we are \ndoing a lot to make sure that the Federal Government does less.\n  As a limited government conservative, I am especially glad that we \nhave taken action to return some of Washington's bureaucratic power to \nthe American people. The last 7 years saw the emergence of a regulatory \nstate that never stopped in its mission to grab power and impose its \nwill at the expense of everyday Americans. This town is overrun with \nFederal agencies and departments where bureaucrats sit around every day \nconcocting rules and regulations that might sound like a good idea but, \nin reality, end up weighing down businesses, destroying jobs, and \nlimiting freedom.\n  In his 8 years, President Obama added 18,000 pages to the Federal \nRegister, amounting to 6 pages added every day that he held office. \nThis habit costs American households roughly $15,000 per year, each.\n  While President Obama is no longer in office, his regulatory state is \nalive and well, but not for long. Madam Speaker, the people of Alabama \nelected me to help put an end to that, and I am proud to report that is \nexactly what we are doing. The House is changing the game because the \nAmerican people deserve better than to pay for unnecessary Big \nGovernment mandates. We have utilized the Congressional Review Act to \nstrike 15 Federal regulations that were imposed by executive action.\n\n  What kind of regulations?\n  One extended intrusive, overreaching, and punitive environmental \npenalties on energy companies, costing tens of thousands of jobs, but \nnot anymore.\n  One attempted to force State and local schools to use Washington's \npreferred teacher preparation programs, undermining local control--not \nanymore.\n  One restricted States' ability to enforce existing laws stopping \notherwise able-bodied drug abusers from receiving unemployment \nbenefits--not anymore.\n  One attempted to take away the Second Amendment rights of millions of \nAmericans without due process by arbitrarily restricting Social \nSecurity disability beneficiaries from purchasing firearms--not \nanymore.\n  Finally, one attempted to force States to steer millions in Title X \nfunding to abortion provider Planned Parenthood, even over the State's \nobjections--not anymore, thank God.\n  These rules no longer exist because this Congress, working together \nwith the Trump administration, struck them one by one. In all, 15 bills \nrolling back these Big Government policies have been passed and signed \ninto law.\n  Madam Speaker, I am proud of the work the House of Representatives \nhas done, and I hope it can give us momentum for tackling more pressing \nissues like tax reform and infrastructure.\n", "turn": 1, "speaker": "Mrs. ROBY", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "178", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H8391", "wkday": "Thursday", "day": "2", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "CONGRESSIONAL REVIEW ACT PROGRESS", "id": "CREC-2017-11-02-pt1-PgH8391", "title": "CONGRESSIONAL REVIEW ACT PROGRESS"}
