Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Ms. Christine \nPonce of Woodland, California, who has dedicated 27 years to \nCalifornia's agricultural industry. She has worked cultivating many \ncrops, ultimately becoming California's first female rice miller. In \nthat role she managed many facets of rice production, ensuring that the \nplant operated at full capacity. In her 27 year career she overcame \nmany challenges--from low wages to serious injury--and inspired many \nwomen that they too could pursue a career once considered only for men.\n   A proud descendent of a Bracero, Ms. Ponce has strong ties to the \nCalifornia agricultural community. In her time as a rice miller she \nhelped advocate for the rights of agricultural workers by serving the \nlocal chapter of the International Longshore and Warehouse Union. In \naddition to working long, demanding hours, she took time to serve as a \nsecretary for the ILWU Local 150. Ms. Ponce's long and distinguished \ncareer has demonstrated her devotion to California's vibrant \nagricultural community.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. GARAMENDI", "itemno": 3}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 4}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "178", "extension": true, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "E1492", "wkday": "Thursday", "day": "2", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "2017 WOMAN OF THE YEAR AWARD WINNER--CHRISTINE PONCE", "id": "CREC-2017-11-02-pt1-PgE1492-2", "title": null}
