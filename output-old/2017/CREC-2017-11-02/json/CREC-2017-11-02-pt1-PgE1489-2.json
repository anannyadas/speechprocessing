Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the \nlife of Robert C. Harrison of Huntsville, Alabama in my district. He \npassed this life on October 25, 2017 at age 74 and leaves behind a \nwife, two children, their spouses, and four grandchildren.\n   Throughout his life, Mr. Harrison exemplified hard work, commitment, \nand service. He established and owned multiple local business efforts, \nincluding the Bob Harrison Ford & Lincoln Mercury Dealership and USA \nLand Development & Consulting. Mr. Harrison was also a steadfast \ncommunity volunteer, civil rights activist, and member of many civic \nand charitable organizations. He served as Vice President of the \nNational Association of Black County Officials, Subcommittee Vice Chair \nof the National Association of County Officials Justice and Public \nSafety Steering Committee, and a lifelong member of Alpha Phi Alpha \nFraternity.\n   To North Alabama's lasting benefit, Mr. Harrison was also elected to \nthree terms as County Commissioner of Madison County, Alabama between \n2004 and 2012. From that position, Mr. Harrison worked to bring \neconomic improvement to the northwest area of Huntsville. A few \nexamples of his legacy there include the Northwest Huntsville Community \nService Organization, the Northwest Community Learning Center, and the \nRobert ``Bob'' Harrison Senior Wellness and Advocacy Center.\n   I am confident that the 5th Congressional District of Alabama is \nbetter today for Commissioner Harrison's dedicated service. Today, I \njoin with all of those touched by his life in offering my condolences \nand prayers to his family.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. BROOKS of Alabama", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 3}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "178", "extension": true, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "E1489", "wkday": "Thursday", "day": "2", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "TRIBUTE TO ROBERT C.
