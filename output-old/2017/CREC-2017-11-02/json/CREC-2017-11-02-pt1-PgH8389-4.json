Madam Speaker, today, I rise to honor the life of \nsomeone I was lucky to call a colleague and mentor--Redlands City \nCouncil member Pat Gilbreath.\n  I was heartbroken to learn of Pat's passing in early October, but I \nwill always be grateful for her countless contributions to our \ncommunity. Her imprint can be seen throughout the city of Redlands and \nour region. She was the earliest advocate for Redlands' passenger rail, \nsupported the Healthy Communities Initiative and Open Space Initiative \nto honor our citrus heritage.\n  When I was just starting out on the city council, Pat's leadership \nand poise helped shape the type of public servant that I aim to be. She \nwas pragmatic, measured, and listened intently to the public.\n  I will always be thankful for everything that she taught me, not the \nleast of which was how to hide the chocolate in the city council dais \nso we could eat it during our late night council meetings.\n  A loving mother and grandmother, she was always proud to beam about \nher family. I know that when they look at her legacy and the impact she \nmade in the community, her family can be just as proud of her.\n  Pat will always be remembered in our region for her thoughtfulness, \nher dedication, and her problem-solving ability. I will always remember \nher for her friendship.\n", "turn": 1, "speaker": "Mr. AGUILAR", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "178", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H8389", "wkday": "Thursday", "day": "2", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "REMEMBERING PAT GILBREATH", "id": "CREC-2017-11-02-pt1-PgH8389-4", "title": "REMEMBERING PAT GILBREATH"}
