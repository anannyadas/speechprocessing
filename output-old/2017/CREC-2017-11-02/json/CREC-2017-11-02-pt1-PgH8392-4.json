But, Father, I \ncome to You on the merit of the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, who \nwashed me from my sins in His shed blood.\n  Father, we are aware, more than any, of the bitter divisiveness \nthroughout this room and across this Nation of ours. I know that this \ngrieves Your heart, Father. I pray that we would repent of our sins, \nthat You might forgive them and heal this land of ours.\n  Father, I pray that You will work in the hearts of the Members of \nCongress, that they be willing to put aside their political expedience \nand partisan politics and personal agendas, that they would strive to \ndo what is best for our Nation as a whole and uphold the Constitution \nwhich they avowed to uphold, that they would seek to do what is \npleasing in Your sight, that they would seek Your will and wisdom for \nthe decisions of this day and each and every day.\n  I ask these things in the precious name of Jesus Christ, my Savior.\n  Amen.\n", "kind": "Unknown", "speaker": "Unknown", "itemno": 0, "turn": -1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 1}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "178", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H8392", "wkday": "Thursday", "day": "2", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "PRAYER", "id": "CREC-2017-11-02-pt1-PgH8392-4", "title": "PRAYER"}
