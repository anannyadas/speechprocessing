Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Jeannie Klever, \nwho has an extensive record of service in Sutter County, California, \nwhich she has called home for the past 27 years. Jeannie embodies the \nqualities of a community activist and public servant, and we are proud \nto honor her today. Growing up in the 60's, Jeannie experienced a \nmixture of gender and racial inequalities which influenced and shaped \nher career choices. Her activism began at an early age when during \nschool she protested an end to the Vietnam War. She also advocated for \nmore on-site tutors for students of color and when met with opposition, \nJeannie volunteered as a tutor through the rest of her school years. \nShe strongly believes education was and remains the path out of \npoverty.\n   Jeannie's desire to help families with special needs children was \ndue to the challenges her family endured after her brother was \ndiagnosed with severe autism. She operated a Family Resource Center \nthat delivered support services and resources to families of low income \nand special needs adults and children. She taught self-advocacy for the \nlocal school's individualized education programs and medical service \nneeds students.\n   Jeannie's community and public service involvement is extensive. \nJeannie has been a member of and continues to support several nonprofit \norganizations. For the past 15 years, she has sponsored an annual Art \nContest for Sutter Union High School students. In 2008, Jeannie joined \nthe local Democratic Party's central committee as a way to increase \ncommunity engagement where she served three terms. In 2013, Jeannie \njoined the U.S. House of Representatives as my district representative \nserving Yuba and Sutter counties until her recent retirement.\n   Jeannie continues to volunteer in the community and helps families \nin need when she can. Jeannie has learned to appreciate the art culture \nand enjoys mixed media arts as a way to relax. She and her husband Dale \nare enjoying family time with their children and two grandchildren.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. GARAMENDI", "itemno": 3}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 4}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "178", "extension": true, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "E1491", "wkday": "Thursday", "day": "2", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "2017 WOMAN OF THE YEAR AWARD WINNER--JEANNIE KLEVER", "id": "CREC-2017-11-02-pt1-PgE1491", "title": null}
