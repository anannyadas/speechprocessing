Mr. Speaker, today is a big day. I want to congratulate \nmy colleague and friend, Mr. Brady, the chairman of the Ways and Means \nCommittee, and the committee for the rollout of our tax reform \nproposal, the first time in over 30 years.\n  For the individual, what do we get?\n  We get a fairer, flatter, simpler Tax Code. We are lowering the \nrates. We are doubling personal exemptions. And guess what. Most \nAmericans will be able to file their tax returns on a postcard.\n  For corporate America, we get a reduction from 35 percent to 20 \npercent, which will make us competitive across the world. Most \ncountries in the major industrialized nations tax their corporations at \na 20 percent rate.\n  We will eliminate most every loophole that will deprive special \ninterests of being able to interrupt and intercede in that Tax Code.\n  For what purpose?\n  A simple purpose: more money in individuals' pockets, and a growing, \nthriving economy for all Americans.\n  Again, I congratulate Chairman Brady and the Ways and Means \nCommittee. I look forward to seeing quick passage on the floor.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. SHIMKUS", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "178", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H8395", "wkday": "Thursday", "day": "2", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "THE ROLLOUT OF THE TAX REFORM PROPOSAL", "id": "CREC-2017-11-02-pt1-PgH8395-3", "title": "THE ROLLOUT OF THE TAX REFORM PROPOSAL"}
