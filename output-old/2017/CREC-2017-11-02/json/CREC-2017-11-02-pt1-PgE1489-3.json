Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Ms. Kate \nMellon-Anibaba of Davis, California, who has made it her mission to \nbring people together in the name of tolerance and spread support for \nmarginalized groups within her community. Following this year's attacks \non Muslim communities throughout California, Ms. Mellon-Anibaba \norganized an event she called a ``Statement of Love.'' Her idea was to \nbring people together to show their support for Muslims in her \ncommunity. In response to the hateful words and actions she saw \ndirected at certain minorities, Ms. Mellon-Anibaba created her own \ndemonstration of support, solidarity, and acceptance. She was \ndetermined to make a positive impact in her community, and she \nsucceeded.\n   Following a particularly disturbing attack on the Islamic Center \nright in her own community, she brought together over 1,000 people to \nshow their support for their neighbors. She helped raise tens of \nthousands of dollars to help pay for repairs to businesses and places \nof worship targeted by hate-driven vandalism.\n   Ms. Mellon-Anibaba brought people together to show their support, \ntolerance, and acceptance of a marginalized community within their \ncommunity. Her message of peace, tolerance, and support has spread to \nsurrounding communities and inspired similar demonstrations of \nsolidarity. Her determination to bring her community together in the \nface of hatred is inspirational.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. GARAMENDI", "itemno": 3}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 4}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "178", "extension": true, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "E1489", "wkday": "Thursday", "day": "2", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "2017 WOMAN OF THE YEAR AWARD WINNER-KATE MELLON-ANIBABA", "id": "CREC-2017-11-02-pt1-PgE1489-3", "title": null}
