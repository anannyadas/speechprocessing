Mr. Speaker, today I rise to speak on the importance of \nreauthorizing the Children's Health Insurance Program, commonly \nreferred to as CHIP.\n  In my home State of Virginia, there are 66,000 children and 1,100 \npregnant women who rely on CHIP. Almost 6,000 of those children and \npregnant women live in my district. They need a clean reauthorization \nof CHIP. Instead, this week, we are expected to vote on a bill that \nwill put my constituents at risk.\n  As reported from committee, this new version of CHIP, the so-called \nHEALTHY KIDS Act, is loaded with poison pills that would undermine the \nAffordable Care Act, Medicare, and Medicaid. According to the \nGeorgetown University Center for Children and Families, CHIP with \nMedicaid boosted the rate of children's health coverage to more than 95 \npercent.\n  Mr. Speaker, why tamper with such success? I urge my colleagues on \nthe other side of the aisle to bring a bill to the floor that \nreauthorizes CHIP and supports our constituents.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. McEACHIN", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "178", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H8423", "wkday": "Thursday", "day": "2", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "CALLING FOR CHIP REAUTHORIZATION", "id": "CREC-2017-11-02-pt1-PgH8423-5", "title": "CALLING FOR CHIP REAUTHORIZATION"}
