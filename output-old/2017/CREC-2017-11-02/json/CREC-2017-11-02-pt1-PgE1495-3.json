ROBERT B. ADERHOLT\n\n                               of alabama\n\n                    in the house of representatives\n\n                       Thursday, November 2, 2017\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "A000055", "text": "  Mr. ADERHOLT. Mr. Speaker, I received the sad news earlier this week \nthat the Honorable James (Jim) Martin passed away from this life at the \nage of 99, in Gadsden, Alabama. Jim Martin was not only a former member \nof this body, but he was the Congressman for the district of Alabama, \nwhich I now represent.\n  James Martin was born in Tarrant, Alabama on September 1, 1918, the \nson of a railroad engineer and school teacher. Martin attended school \nin a log cabin. After graduating high school in 1936, he attended a \nbusiness college, and then started a job as a clerk at Pan-American \nPetroleum in Birmingham.\n  In 1941, shortly before America was drawn into World War II, Martin \ndecided to join the U.S. Army. Martin served as a captain and was part \nof the American effort to liberate Europe from the Nazis.\n  Martin and his men liberated concentration camps and saw the horrors \nof war firsthand. In an interview with the Library of Congress, Martin \nsaid, ``I'm not the same person I was before World War II.''\n  After fighting in that war, he came back to Alabama and settled in \nthe city of Gadsden. It was in Gadsden where he met his future wife Pat \nHuddleston.\n  It was in 1962, that Martin decided to enter politics. He challenged \nthen U.S. Senator Lister Hill, the incumbent Democrat. Martin came \nwithin 6,000 votes of upsetting Hill.\n  Alabama voters elected Martin to the U.S. House of Representatives in \nNovember of 1964. Martin took office as the Member of Congress from \nAlabama's 7th Congressional District in 1965 which was the year I was \nborn. He served one term, from January 1965 to January 1967.\n  To say that Congressman Martin was a trailblazer in Alabama politics \nis an understatement. His election in 1964 marked a change of course in \na state that had been dominated by a single party for decades.\n  During his time in Congress, Martin worked diligently to represent \nthe wishes and interests of his constituents back in Alabama. He was a \ngreat leader and one of those rare individuals who could convey his \nconservative message in words like few others.\n  In 1966, Martin chose not to seek reelection to Congress, but instead \ndecided to seek the Governorship of Alabama. While Martin did not win \nthe election against the wife of George Wallace, Lurleen Wallace, his \nshowing was remarkable. Martin received more support than any \nRepublican candidate for governor since Reconstruction.\n  Then in the 1990s, Martin served as Alabama's Conservation and \nNatural Resources director under Governor Fob James. Just as Martin had \nbeen a trailblazer in politics, he did the same during his time serving \nin this capacity.\n  Martin convinced the state to purchase Cathedral Caverns in Marshall \nCounty. It has since become a state park. He also started Alabama's \nForever Wild Program. Its mission\n\n\nis to secure Alabama's wild and natural wonders and to save them from \ndevelopment.\n  After leaving public life, Martin remained active, engaged and \ninvolved in his community. I would regularly see Congressman Martin \naround the Gadsden area as he always had a lot of advice for his \ncongressman.\n  Martin is survived by his wife, Pat, two sons Douglas Martin, Jr. and \nRichard H. Martin, and one daughter, Annette Graham Martin, along with \nmany grandchildren and great-grandchildren.\n  James Martin's remarkable life and legacy will live on for many \ngenerations. It is my honor and privilege to recognize him and his \naccomplishments and have this statement included in the Record of the \nCongress in which he served, a tribute to his service, his love for his \nstate and country and his faith in his creator.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. ADERHOLT", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 3}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "178", "extension": true, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "E1495-E1496", "wkday": "Thursday", "day": "2", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "RECOGNIZING THE LIFE AND LEGACY OF THE HONORABLE JAMES (JIM) MARTIN", "id": "CREC-2017-11-02-pt1-PgE1495-3", "title": "RECOGNIZING THE LIFE AND LEGACY OF THE HONORABLE JAMES (JIM) MARTIN"}
