Mr. Speaker, I rise in recognition of National Obesity \nCare Week on behalf of the over 90 million adult Americans living with \nobesity today.\n  Treating obesity is more than just eating right and exercising and is \ncaused by a number of factors that are often out of that person's \ncontrol. These include genetics, socioeconomic status, and \nphysiological, psychological and environmental factors.\n  As important, obesity is also linked to over 50 disorders including \nType 2 diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease. In fact, \nover $1.42 trillion is spent in the U.S. on direct and indirect costs \nfor health related conditions related to obesity a year.\n  National Obesity Care Week aims to advance an evidence-based \nunderstanding of obesity and widespread access to comprehensive and \nappropriate care. Unfortunately, at 31.6 percent, Illinois has the 18th \nhighest adult obesity rate in the nation--4 million people--almost a \nthird of our population. This must change. I urge my fellow Members, \nthe scientific community, and researchers, to treat obesity seriously--\nas the chronic disease that it is--and I urge the medical community to \nhave conversations with their patients, their students, and their \ncolleagues about obesity and how we can effectively treat this disease.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. SHIMKUS", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 3}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "178", "extension": true, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "E1498", "wkday": "Thursday", "day": "2", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "RECOGNIZING NATIONAL OBESITY CARE WEEK", "id": "CREC-2017-11-02-pt1-PgE1498-3", "title": "RECOGNIZING NATIONAL OBESITY CARE WEEK"}
