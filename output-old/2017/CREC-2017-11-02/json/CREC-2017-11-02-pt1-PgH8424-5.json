Mr. Speaker, today, the Republicans released their tax \nplan. Unsurprisingly, it is a gift-wrapped tax cut to the rich. \nChristmas came early, Mr. Speaker. From huge corporate tax cuts to the \nelimination of the alternative minimum tax paid by the wealthiest \nAmericans, this tax plan will hurt our economy and prioritize the top \nearners of our country. But there is one person--maybe a group of \npeople--who is very thrilled about this tax plan, Mr. Speaker, and that \nperson is Mr. Money Bags. Mr. Money Bags is really going to benefit \nfrom this tax plan.\n  First of all, the President himself will greatly benefit from the tax \nplan. It is impossible to know exactly how much because we still don't \nhave his tax returns. He has refused to release them. We would really \nappreciate, and we demand, frankly, that the American\n\n\npeople know exactly how much he is going to benefit from this tax plan.\n  Mr. Speaker, as the vice chair of the House Budget Committee, I saw \nfirsthand how the Republicans rammed through a budget plan that paved \nthe way for the massive Ryan-McConnell tax giveaway to the wealthy. \nFrankly, as a new Member, I find it an affront to the legislative \nprocess and an affront to families across the United States in red and \nblue States alike that we did not have hearings on that budget, that we \nare not going to have hearings on this tax plan, which is a complete \nrewrite of the U.S. economy that is going to be pushed through, \napparently, in 2 weeks or less. We still have no score on this because \nwe just saw the details of a tax plan today.\n  The Republicans have made this habit of relying on fake logic and \nfaulty assumptions. They did it with healthcare and the budget, and it \nis safe to assume that is what we are looking at here.\n  These cuts do not pay for themselves. Despite the claims that this \ntax plan is really going to help middle class Americans, the reality is \nthat it is going to hurt millions of American families just to fast-\ntrack tax cuts for millionaires, billionaires, and large corporations.\n  If the Republicans are so opposed to so-called government handouts, \nas we are always told they are called, then why is it that they seem to \nbe more willing to hand out everything we have to the wealthiest people \nin this Nation?\n  Now, we are still exploring all of the details of this tax plan that \nwas just released today, but there is no question that this bill is \ngoing to make sure that the wealthiest individuals and the largest \ncorporations in this country get a tax cut of a million dollars. If you \nhappen to be in the top one-tenth of 1 percent, then bingo, Mr. \nMoneybags is going to get a million dollars in a tax cut every year.\n  Consider this: if this tax bill lines up with the budget resolution, \nthen 80 percent of the Republican tax cut goes to the top 1 percent by \n2027; the average tax cut for the top 1 percent in 2027 would be \n$207,000; for millionaires, the cut would be $230,000; and, as I said, \nfor the top one-tenth of 1 percent, you get to have a million dollars a \nyear. For the middle class, on the other hand, 42 million middle class \nhouseholds would face a tax increase.\n  Let's not be fooled by this idea that the standard deduction is going \nup, and let me tell you what that means. It means that, along with the \nstandard deduction going up, you are also getting your credits for \nindividual children taken away, the itemization of it.\n  So if you have a family with several children, as many Americans do, \nyou will actually end up probably being able to deduct less.\n  Let's also be clear that when you eliminate the deduction for \nproperty taxes and State and local taxes, and you cut all of the \nservices that are going to be required to be cut if you are going to \npay for this tax cut, then you will end up paying more in your States, \nboth in terms of the SALT deduction, but also in terms of all of the \nincreased taxes you are going to have to pay at the local level to fund \nthings like infrastructure and education.\n  Let's be clear that this plan gives a $4 trillion tax cut to the \nwealthiest 1 percent and largest corporations, taxes 42 million working \nfamilies more, and borrows millions from the future to give those tax \ncuts.\n  Last week, in the Rules Committee, I offered an amendment to the \nRepublican budget resolution that would have stopped some of the most \negregious impacts of the billionaire's budget.\n  My amendment would have said that none of the tax cuts proffered in \nthis plan should apply to households in the top 1 percent of income \nearners. It would have plainly said that the United States is not in \nthe business of giving massive tax cuts to those who are already \nincredibly wealthy.\n  Mr. Speaker, I talked about some of the millionaires in my district, \nbecause I do have some. I am fortunate to have a good economy in \nSeattle, where we have a $15 minimum wage, where we have paid family \nleave for everybody, yet business is still booming, the economy is \ndoing well. We have people who have done well, and they would like to \npay their fair share.\n  For decades, Republicans have prioritized the interests of \ncorporations and the wealthiest ahead of working class families.\n  What is being proposed in this budget, this tax plan, is exactly what \nRepublicans in Kansas proposed in 2012.\n\n  In 2012, a Republican Governor and Republican Legislature in Kansas \npassed through the same thing. They said: Let's make sure that we have \ntax benefits for these passthrough corporations--by the way, Donald \nTrump owns 500 passthrough corporations; he will benefit greatly from \nthis--and let's make sure that we reduce the tax rates on the \nwealthiest. In doing so, we will make sure that we are investing in the \neconomy.\n  That meant, by the way, all those tax cuts had to be paid for. So \nthere was a $700 million cut to the Kansas State budget, which resulted \nin schools not being able to operate full time, resulted in roads being \nin disrepair, and ultimately resulted in Kansas' bond ratings going \ndown.\n  In the end, that GDP growth that we were promised, the economic \ngrowth that was guaranteed if you were to put the money into the top \ncorporations and the top income earners that were supposed to somehow \ntrickle down, that growth never came to be.\n  So, guess what happened, Mr. Speaker? The Republican Legislature in \nKansas rolled back those tax cuts. They said: That trickle down thing \ndidn't work.\n  The promises of economic growth didn't work, and ultimately they had \nto move it back. Finally, Kansas is starting to come out of that by \ninvesting in working families.\n  Ultimately, I believe, and I think Democrats believe, if you invest \nin regular folks, if you put the money into working families, you give \nthem a tax cut and you make sure that they are actually paying less, \nnot more, even if you say that you are giving them a deduction, in the \nend, they are paying more in this tax plan. But if you invest the money \nthere, instead of taking $270 billion that is proposed by repealing the \nestate tax--which only a tiny portion of people pay, by the way; that \nestate tax--and 5,400 families are going to get $270 billion in this \nRepublican tax plan. I say, let's take that money and give it to \nworking families instead of those.\n  I think that we have a lot of different options. The Congressional \nProgressive Caucus has put forward our own budget, a people's budget, \nwith our own tax principles. The bottom line is: we believe in ordinary \nAmericans. We believe if you invest there and you give people the \nopportunity to work in good jobs, to earn good wages, and to really \nmake sure that they have dignity, respect, and can save for the future \nand send their kids to college, that ultimately builds our economy.\n  So I am really honored to be doing this Special Order hour with my \ngood friends and colleagues. We are going to do a little bit of a back-\nand-forth here.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Gallego) to \nhave him talk a little bit about what we are hearing. Is it true? Is it \nhypocrisy? What do you think about those debts and deficits?", "turn": 3, "speaker": "Ms. JAYAPAL", "itemno": 4}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "G000574", "text": "  Mr. GALLEGO. Mr. Speaker, we know that the Republican tax plan is a \nmassive, unconscionable giveaway to millionaires and billionaires. We \nknow that it will blow up the deficit and do nothing to raise wages or \ncreate solid middle class jobs.\n  What we don't know, Mr. Speaker, is how much the GOP tax proposal \nwill personally benefit Donald Trump. That is because, unlike every \nother American President, Donald Trump has refused to disclose his tax \nreturns.\n  Trump claimed that he couldn't release his returns throughout the \ncampaign because he was ``under audit.'' But, Mr. Speaker, he never \nprovided any concrete proof. More importantly, the IRS confirmed that \nbeing under audit in no way prohibits someone from making their returns \npublic. In fact, President Nixon did just that while he was in office.\n\n\n  More recently, when The Economist magazine asked Trump about \nreleasing his returns, he said: ``I don't know. That's a very \ninteresting question. I doubt it. I doubt it . . . Nobody cares about \nmy tax return except for the reporters. Oh, at some point I'll release \nthem. Maybe I'll release them after I'm finished. . . .''\n\n\n  That is right, Mr. Speaker, we will have to wait until Trump leaves \noffice just to find out just how much money he made thanks to his own \ntax reform bill. And my Republican friends are apparently just fine \nwith that. There is a shocker. They don't care that Donald Trump is \nusing his office to enrich himself. They don't care that we can't even \nsay with any certainty exactly how much richer he is going to get. They \ndon't care about the debt. They don't care about the deficit. They \ndon't care about making our tax system fairer. Literally, the only \nthing they care about and that truly matters to House Republicans is \nthat they get to cut taxes for the richest Americans, the people who \nneed a tax cut least of all.\n  Mr. Speaker, Donald Trump does not need a tax cut, neither does \nSecretary Mnuchin or Secretary DeVos or Secretary Tillerson or Paris \nHilton, but they are going to get one if Republicans have their way.\n  In 2012, Paul Ryan said: ``We have a debt crisis right in front of \nus, and what brings down great empires, past and future, is debt.''\n  In 2013, Paul Ryan said: ``Our debt is the biggest threat to this \ncountry. We have to tackle this problem before it tackles us.''\n  In 2016, Donald Trump said: ``I am the king of debt. I love debt.''\n  It certainly seems like Speaker Ryan has come around to President \nTrump's way of thinking. Republicans are planning to add $1.5 trillion \nto our national debt, and they couldn't be happier about it.\n  Here is the simple reality, Mr. Speaker. Republicans only care about \ndeficits when they want to cut spending on programs for the poor or for \nveterans or for the elderly or for our children. Republicans only care \nabout debt when they want to slash Social Security and Medicare. Mr. \nSpeaker, Republicans only care about debt and are only fiscally \nresponsible when there is a Democrat in the White House.\n  The American people are now seeing right through this hypocrisy, just \nlike they see right through Donald Trump's excuses about his tax \nreturns. They want us to reject this Republican tax plan, and it is \nabout time we started listening to them.", "turn": 4, "speaker": "Mr. GALLEGO", "itemno": 5}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "J000298", "text": "  Ms. JAYAPAL.

One of the things, when we think about this plan, there is \nreally--it is a three-step plan.\n  Number one, transfer trillions of dollars of wealth and tax cuts from \nmiddle class working families to the top 1 percent.\n  Number two, explode the deficit, which we know is part of this deal. \nWe are going to explode the deficit.\n  Number three, use that exploding deficit as a way to cut spending.\n  But most of all, I am not sure that the numbers add up. So I wanted \nto ask my good friend from the Progressive Caucus, Representative Ted \nLieu from California, to just weigh in with his wisdom around what \nexactly is going on with these numbers and what are we seeing in this \nbudget. Does it add up?\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr. Ted Lieu).", "turn": 5, "speaker": "Ms. JAYAPAL", "itemno": 6}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "L000582", "text": "  Mr. TED LIEU of California. Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative \nJayapal for yielding.\n  You know, today is Thursday, so we first have to ask: Why does Jared \nKushner still have a security clearance?\n  But I digress. We are going to talk about the GOP's disastrous tax \nplan. The reason we know that it is a disaster is one simple fact: the \nmath doesn't add up.\n  So if you believe that 2 plus 2 equals 5, then this tax plan is for \nyou. For the rest of us, it is going to explode the deficit and add to \nthe Federal debt.\n  What does that mean?\n  That means massive cuts to Medicare, to Medicaid, to other vital \nprograms that are protecting seniors and all Americans who depend on \nsome of these programs in order to survive.\n  Now, we can look at this tax plan and we can say, ``Hey, it might \ngive tax breaks to the wealthy who are then going to trickle down,'' \nexcept in the history of the United States, that kind of trickle-down \neconomics has never worked. If you look at how the tax plan is \nconstructed, it really chafes States such as California, New York, New \nJersey, Washington, and other States by eliminating the State and local \ntax deduction.\n  When you do that, it causes filers to not be able to deduct their \nState and local taxes; and in California, New York, New Jersey, \nWashington, and other States, there's going to be tax increases to \nmiddle class families.\n  In addition, because the way the tax plan is constructed, it has the \npotential to lower housing prices because it also caps your mortgage \ninterest rate deduction. That is why the National Association of Home \nBuilders came out opposing this plan, and they have put out something \nwhich is deeply concerning. They are saying this could potentially \ncause a housing recession.\n  You also have the National Federation of Independent Business, which \nrepresents small businesses across America, opposing this plan.\n  Why?\n  This is a big tax giveaway to the ultrawealthy. If you look at an \nearly analysis by The Washington Post, they say that 80 percent of this \ntax plan's benefits will go to the top 1 percent.\n  If you look at this tax plan, it is going to hurt middle class \nAmericans in order to fund those at the very top. This is not something \nwe should be doing in our country.\n  I also request this Speaker work with Democrats on a bipartisan \nbasis. We are not opposed to tax reform. We are opposed to stupid tax \nreform. And this is just a really stupid plan that, again, explodes the \ndeficit, adds to our Federal debt, and whacks States like California, \nNew York, and New Jersey, as well as Washington State. So I urge that \nRepublicans work with Democrats and come up with a plan that actually \nhelps middle class Americans instead of going after them.\n", "turn": 6, "speaker": "Mr. TED LIEU of California", "itemno": 7}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "J000298", "text": "  Ms. JAYAPAL. Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative Lieu.\n  I wanted to just point out that there was a study that was done out \nof Wharton on the tax plan. It wasn't on this most recent version, but \nI think the majority of the things that are in this are still true in \nwhat they analyzed. What they came out with and said is that the \nassumption of 3 percent growth does not make sense; that, really, what \nthey are looking at is 1.3 to 1.4 percent, ultimately, growth, and that \nit would create a $10 trillion deficit over time. I believe it was $3 \ntrillion in the first 10 years. I have to go back and check that \nnumber.\n  Essentially, what they are staying is it doesn't work. The person who \nactually wrote the 1981 tax cut under Ronald Reagan, who was working \nfor Jack Kemp at the time, wrote an op-ed in The Washington Post, I \nbelieve it was, and said: ``This theory of trickle-down economics \ndoesn't work. We were wrong when we did that, when we said that back \nthen, and it is wrong to look at that same idea today.''\n  Now, Representative Lieu said Democrats are not opposed to tax \nreform. That is right if it was real reform. We do think that the Tax \nCode could be simplified, that it could be fair so that small \nbusinesses and working families and folks who are really investing in \nthe economy are the ones to get the benefits of any tax reform, that we \nwould close some of the tax loopholes. Unfortunately, this is not tax \nreform. What has been proposed is not tax reform. It is tax giveaways \nto the wealthiest.\n  I want us to be very clear about what the majority is trying to do \nhere. They are trying to rewrite the U.S. economy with absolutely no \nhearings. It is, frankly, outrageous that we would not even have a \nhearing on a major tax bill that is going to affect every single person \nin this country.\n  We should have hearings. I don't know what happened to regular order. \nPeople talk about regular order, but as a new Member who was just \nelected last year for my first year in Congress, I can tell you I have \nnot seen regular order. I sat on the Judiciary Committee. We don't have \nhearings in the Judiciary Committee. The majority of the bills that \ncome to the floor are bills that we have never had an opportunity to \nhave a hearing on. When you look at this tax plan, I believe we should \nbe able to have more than 2 weeks to vote on it.\n  I think every single American should understand what is in the plan \nand at least have the opportunity to decide whether or not it is \nbeneficial for them. Unfortunately, Mr. Speaker, I don't think that is \nhappening.\n  Let me just summarize what we think is happening in this current\n\n\nversion of the tax proposal that has been put forward.\n  First of all, it is a win for the well connected and the wealthy. \nThat is what the Ryan-McConnell tax bill is. President Trump promised \nthe tax reform would benefit the middle class, not the wealthy; but, \nunfortunately, rhetoric does not match reality. Instead, this bill that \nwe are looking at now would create a new passthrough loophole that \nwealthy individuals would exploit to lower their own taxes.\n  Just as an example, a version of this loophole was used by University \nof Kansas Basketball Coach Bill Self to avoid paying more than $125,000 \nin State taxes in 1 year alone. The alternative minimum tax, which we \ncall the AMT, which ensures that the wealthy at least pay more of their \nfair share, is eliminated in the Ryan-McConnell plan.\n  While little is known about President Trump's taxes, we do know that, \nwithout the AMT, the President would have paid $31 million less in \ntaxes in 2005 alone. So you see why Mr. Moneybags over here is so \nimportant to this discussion, because that is ultimately who is going \nto benefit.\n  Now, Speaker Ryan also believes, as I mentioned, that we should give \na windfall to the ultrawealthy by eliminating the estate tax. Again, \nthat estate tax is paid by less than 5,400 families across the Nation, \nand in 2016, not one person paid the estate tax in seven States.\n  So what happens to middle class families? Because if all these \nwealthy folks are going to get all the money, then the question is: So \nwhat happens for middle class families? Because that is really where \nthe attention should be. That was what was promised by Donald Trump.\n  Speaker Ryan and the Republican establishment have attacked \ncommonsense policies used by millions of middle class families in order \nto pay for this tax giveaway to the wealthy. So Republicans have taken \naway the ability to write off your State and local tax bills, forcing \nmillions of families to pay taxes twice on the same dollar earned, \nexcept for property taxes, up to a mere $10,000. That is the cap that \nthey are proposing on property taxes.\n  Americans that are hit with significant medical costs, for example, \nthose who have cancer or ALS or Alzheimer's, would lose their ability \nto write off these costs under the Republican plan.\n  The Ryan-McConnell tax bill also eliminates deduction for personal \ncasualty losses. A big blow if you are a victim of crime, theft, or \ndisaster. It also excludes--it eliminates the exclusion for dependent \ncare assistance program, which is an incredibly important benefit for \nworking families.\n  So in the end, you just have to ask yourself: In order to give \ntrillions of dollars of tax cuts to the wealthiest and the biggest \ncorporations, what does that mean for working families?\n  It means working families are going to foot the bill over and over \nagain. I believe this is a bad deal for middle class families, for \nAmerica, and for our economy.\n  One last thing I forgot to mention is that there is actually an \nincentive. After all of the talk of bringing jobs back to America, \nthere is actually an incentive in this bill to take work and jobs to a \ntax-haven country because the amount of taxes that you would pay on \nthat is actually lower than the amount of taxes you would pay if you \nwere to start a factory here in Iowa or Kansas or somewhere in the \nUnited States. If you were to actually create jobs here, you would have \nto pay a higher tax rate than if you were to create that same factory \nin some tax-haven country in other parts of the world where you don't \nhave to pay--you would end up not paying the same amount of taxes. So \nthis is a bad deal for middle class families.\n  I don't know if my friend, Mr. Jeffries, would like to speak on the \ntax excellence, so I am really thrilled now to be able to turn this \nover to a member of the Progressive Caucus, a leader on our Judiciary \nCommittee, Representative Hakeem Jeffries from New York.", "turn": 7, "speaker": "Ms. JAYAPAL", "itemno": 8}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "J000294", "text": "  Mr. JEFFRIES. Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative Jayapal, my good \nfriend and tremendous colleague on both the House Budget Committee and \nthe House Judiciary Committee, the distinguished gentlewoman from the \ngreat State of Washington, for her tremendous advocacy, for anchoring \nthis Congressional Progressive Caucus Special Order, and for addressing \nthe American people on this critically important issue, so-called tax \nreform put forth by House Republicans today in a manner that is clear-\neyed, that is authentic, that is comprehensive, and that will hopefully \nawaken the American people to the notion that this is an attempt by \nHouse Republicans to do nothing more than to jam tax cuts for \nmillionaires and billionaires down the throats of the American people.\n\n\n  Now, I represent the Eighth Congressional District in Brooklyn and \nQueens. I am proud to be a Member of the House of Representatives, \nproud to be from the city of New York. And we are generous people in \nNew York City; generous people in New York State. In fact, New York \nState regularly sends tens of billions of dollars more to the Federal \nGovernment than we get back in return.\n  The State of Connecticut sends billions of dollars more to the \nFederal Government than they get back in return. So does New Jersey. So \ndoes California. So does Illinois. So does Pennsylvania. And, for \ndecades, we have allowed that generosity to continue to show itself in \nterms of the fact that we get shortchanged in homeland security \ndollars, transportation and infrastructure dollars, and a whole host of \nother Federal funds that disproportionately make its way to other parts \nof the country, often to States in the deep South.\n  We are generous people. But at what point is enough enough? And \ntoday, you have crossed the line by putting a target on the backs of \npeople in New York, and New Jersey, and Pennsylvania, and Illinois, and \nCalifornia, and several other States, including people who live in \nplaces like Charleston, South Carolina, or other cities that may have \nrelatively modest State taxes, if any at all, but who are taxed at the \nlocal level, or who pay property taxes.\n  And so everyone throughout the United States of America, tens of \nmillions of people, are going to be hurt by this Republican tax plan, \nbecause of the limitations on deductibility related to State and local \ntaxes, because of the draconian limitations on deducting property \ntaxes, and because of the limitations placed on middle class homeowners \nas it relates to the mortgage interest deduction. You can't make this \nstuff up.\n  The Republican tax plan is nothing more than a Ponzi scheme to \nprovide a windfall to millionaires and billionaires, the wealthy and \nthe well-off, to special interest corporations, and to hide it in the \nnotion that it is a middle class tax cut. The Republican tax plan won't \nhelp the middle class. It will hurt the middle class. It is a Ponzi \nscheme. It will undermine Medicare and Medicaid. It will impose \nbillions and billions of dollars in additional deficit. It will force \nyour children and grandchildren to shoulder approximately $1.5 trillion \nin additional debt. And this is all being done in order to provide \nmassive tax cuts to millionaires and billionaires, the overwhelming \nmajority of whom will be the ones who disproportionately benefit from \nthe so-called tax reform plan. Yes, it is a Ponzi scheme.\n  And why do I say that? Well, because what you are going to hear is \nthat trickle-down economic theory; supply-side economic theory; or the \nlatest word craft that they have come up with, dynamic scoring, will \nresult in a situation where these massive tax cuts for millionaires and \nbillionaires, and for special interest corporations, will somehow \nmagically result in unprecedented economic growth. Sounds good.\n  The only problem is that it is a failed, fraudulent, and fake \nargument. It is a fantasy that has no basis in reality.\n  When Ronald Reagan, in 1981, cut taxes for the wealthy and for the \nwell-off, we didn't get unprecedented economic growth, we got massive \ndeficits.\n  When George W. Bush cut taxes for the wealthy and for the well-off in \n2001 and 2003, we didn't get unprecedented economic growth, we got a \nGreat Recession--the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression.\n  When the Republican Governor of Kansas moved forward with what he\n\n\ncalled the Kansas experiment, massively cut taxes for the wealthy and \nfor the well-off in Kansas, so much so that the wealthiest 300,000 \nfolks from Kansas didn't pay a single dollar in taxes at all--the \npeople of Kansas were promised unprecedented economic growth, \nunprecedented job creation--this is the Republican Governor of Kansas--\nwhen he cut taxes, you didn't get unprecedented economic growth. What \nyou got were prison riots, overcrowded classrooms, and crumbling \ninfrastructure.\n  The Republican tax plan is nothing more than a Ponzi scheme. Supply-\nside economics has failed; trickle-down economics has failed; dynamic \nscoring is a fantasy. We would say in Brooklyn: Don't believe the hype. \nWe will surgically communicate to the American people why the \nRepublican tax plan will hurt the middle class, hurt working families, \nhurt children, hurt senior citizens, and hurt those who aspire to be \npart of the middle class.\n  And one last point that I would make: I am shocked that you would put \na target on the back of people who are paying State and local taxes--\npresumably because you think this is a deduction that the American \npeople no longer deserve--but then in your same tax plan you allow \ncorporations and businesses, wealthy titans of corporate America who \nrun these companies, to continue to deduct State and local taxes on \ntheir corporate tax returns. Seriously? You don't even pretend to have \nequitable treatment? Oh, I forgot: corporations are people, too.\n  This is an extraordinary scheme that they are going to try to jam \ndown the throats of the American people. But we are here, as Democrats, \nto make sure that the American people understand that you are being \noffered a raw deal. We are going to present to you and fight for a \nbetter deal for middle class tax cuts, for tax cuts for small \nbusinesses, tax cuts for working families, and to make sure that people \nin America continue to pay their fair share.\n  Mr. Speaker, I thank the distinguished gentlewoman from Washington \nfor yielding to me.", "turn": 8, "speaker": "Mr. JEFFRIES", "itemno": 9}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "J000298", "text": "  Ms. JAYAPAL.

Regular order \nequals democracy, and democracy is being undermined as it relates to \nthe Republican tax plan, Ponzi scheme, because they are going to try to \njam it down the throats of the American people.\n  Not a single meaningful hearing, as was done on a bipartisan basis in \n1986, when Ronald Reagan and Tip O'Neill got together to reform the Tax \nCode in a meaningful way, in a bipartisan way, in a thoughtful way. \nBut, unfortunately, regular order, democracy, is being undermined by \nthis Republican-led Congress, as it relates to this tax bill.", "turn": 10, "speaker": "Mr. JEFFRIES", "itemno": 11}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "J000298", "text": "  Ms. JAYAPAL. Mr. Speaker, what strikes me is, when you don't have a \nprocess, you don't have discussion and debate, and you try to jam \nsomething through, it means you are trying to hide a whole lot. So I \njust wanted to say that there is an article in The Washington Post \ntoday about winners and losers in the Republican tax plan, and here is \nwhat they say are winners.\n  This isn't a Democrat saying this. This is The Washington Post \nsaying, big corporations--number one winner, big corporations. American \nmegabusinesses would get a substantial tax reduction.\n  And, by the way, that is not just on one level, that is a number of \nlevels. And my colleagues over here know that this is the number one \nplan here, because there is a clear difference of opinion. You all \nthink that, if you invest in these big corporations and in the \nwealthiest individuals, you would rather put your faith into those \nfolks rather than middle class families across the country who could \nactually build our economy.\n  So this bill cuts the top rate that large corporations would have to \npay the biggest one-time drop in the big business tax rate ever; I \nrepeat, the biggest one-time drop in the big business tax rate ever.\n  On top of that, you would get some new tax breaks if you are a \ncorporation, so you would get to lower your bills.\n  What I have seen in the polling is that Americans across the country \nthink that corporations are already getting too good of a deal and they \nshould pay their fair share. And what millions of struggling families \nacross the country want is for somebody to actually fight for them, \nsomebody to fight for people who are going to work every day, who are \ndoing everything they can to have an American life that pays them \nenough money to get a job to put food on the table, to send their kids \nto college, to retire with dignity, a better deal than the raw deal \nthat they are getting right now. But that is the number one winner.\n  The second biggest winner, according to The Washington Post: the \nsuperrich. And that was the estate tax that I mentioned, which only \nbenefits 5,400 families across the United States who pay that estate \ntax. But we are going to put hundreds of billions of dollars into \nrepealing the estate tax so that those 5,400 families can continue to \nearn more and more money on the backs of the middle class.\n  And, of course, the third one is anyone paying the alternative \nminimum tax. That is Donald Trump. The biggest part of his tax bill \nthat he paid, on the one tax return that he released, was from the \nalternative minimum tax. But that alternative minimum tax is now \ngetting eliminated in this bill to benefit Donald Trump. And it forces \npeople who earn more than $130,000 to calculate their taxes twice.\n  There is one more. They said, ``Hedge funds, doctors, and lawyers''--\nthat is the fourth one that they mention--as the wealthiest hedge fund \nmanagers, who are going to, ultimately, get a sizable discount, while \n``under the GOP bill, high-earning small-business owners will only pay \na tax rate of 25 percent on 30 percent of their business income,'' the \npassthrough business rate.\n  The reality is that even though there are some small businesses that \nare passthrough entities, most of those small businesses do not get the \nmajority of their income as passthrough income, they get it from other \nthings. The only people who really benefit from that passthrough are \nthose hedge fund managers and folks like that.\n  Who are the losers? Small-business owners. The National Federation of \nIndependent Business, which represents 325,000 small businesses said: \nUh-uh, we are not supporting the GOP bill. Why? ``It leaves too many \nsmall businesses behind.''\n  So Main Street is hurting under this proposal.\n  Who else? Like you said, people in high-tax blue States. So say good-\nbye to most of the State and local tax deductions from States like \nCalifornia, New Jersey, New York, Connecticut, and my State. My home \nState of Washington is really going to be hurt by this because we don't \nhave an income tax, so we have very high property taxes, and we have \nvery high other sales taxes. None of that would be--well, property tax, \naccording to this plan, you would get a tiny, little cap on it of \n$10,000.\n  And then who else is a big loser? The working poor. Here is what The \nWashington Post says: ``While the bill includes lots of tax breaks for \nbig businesses and the rich, the bottom 35 percent of Americans do not \nget any extra benefits.''\n\n\n  So there is one more loser here, which is interesting. It says, \n``charities.''\n  The National Council of Nonprofits says that charitable deductions, \nwhen Americans chip in to take care of folks who have been hurt by \ndisasters across the country or they contribute to nonprofits or \nothers, that those charitable deductions are likely to go down under \nthis bill because, interestingly and ironically, the Republicans still \nenable ``the wealthy to continue deducting\n\n\ntheir charitable giving.'' But most people would not be able to get the \ntax break because they probably stop itemizing their deductions, so you \nwould actually lose all of that.\n  So I don't know, Mr. Jeffries. I think we are going to have a lot of \nwork to do here to make sure that the American people understand \nexactly what this proposal is and to really get the word out.", "turn": 11, "speaker": "Ms. JAYAPAL", "itemno": 12}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "J000294", "text": "  Mr. JEFFRIES. Well, I appreciate you going through that important \nlist. I think it can be distilled, you know, quite simply.\n  The winners of the Republican tax plan are the billionaire boys club; \nthe losers are the American people, everyday Americans, all premised, \nagain, on, and you are going to hear this over and over again, dynamic \nscoring--sounds great--trickle-down economics.\n  You know, I figured out that trickle-down economics essentially \nmeans, for the middle class, you may get a trickle, but you are \nguaranteed to stay down, because there is no evidence--no evidence from \nthe Reagan experiment, no evidence from the Bush experiment, no \nevidence from the Brownback experiment in Kansas, no evidence--that if \nyou cut taxes for the wealthy or the well off, for special interest \ncorporations, whether you do it directly or through passthrough \nentities, that when you cut those taxes, it results in strong, \nunprecedented economic growth. In fact, our history tells us precisely \nthe opposite.\n  Bill Clinton raised the top tax rate on high-income earners from 35 \npercent to 39.6 percent. Did we suffer from a recession as a result of \nincreasing taxes on millionaires and billionaires so that they would \npay their fair share? No, quite the opposite--unprecedented economic \ngrowth, 20 million-plus jobs created during 8 years of Bill Clinton.\n  Then George W. Bush comes into town, and we actually had a balanced \nbudget at that time. What does he do? Deficits don't matter according \nto the Bush administration. We are going to stimulate tremendous \neconomic growth by cutting taxes on millionaires and billionaires \nbecause of trickle-down economics, supply-side economics, dynamic \nscoring, lower the tax rate from 39.6 on millionaires and billionaires \nto 35.\n  What happened? We lost more than 500,000 jobs in 8 years of the Bush \nPresidency.\n  Barack Obama comes into town and we had all of these doom-and-gloom \nprojections from my good friends on the other side in terms of what was \ngoing to happen. He campaigns on millionaires and billionaires paying \ntheir fair share, raises the top tax rate from 35 percent to 39.6 \npercent. Twelve million-plus private sector jobs were created during 8 \nyears of the Obama Presidency.\n  That is why I say that the Republican tax plan is nothing more than a \nPonzi scheme based on a failed, fraudulent, phony theory of trickle-\ndown economics that has no basis in reality.\n  I thank the distinguished gentlewoman from Washington for yielding \nand being so generous and thoughtful in her discussion.", "turn": 12, "speaker": "Mr. JEFFRIES", "itemno": 13}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "J000298", "text": "  Ms. JAYAPAL. I thank the gentleman from New York for his thoughts.\n  Once again, I would just draw your attention back to who the real big \nwinner is here in this Republican tax plan. It is Mr. Moneybags.\n  So if you have got money in bags, millions of dollars, if you are a \nlarge corporation, if you are a billionaire, then you are going to \nbenefit from this plan--yes, you will. And you know who is going to pay \nfor that is middle class working families across the country who are \ngoing to see their taxes go up, who are going to see their services \ncut, who are going to ultimately be a part of the plan that has three \nparts.\n  The number one part for the Republican plan is transfer trillions of \ndollars of wealth from middle class America to the wealthiest in the \ncountry who don't need it; number two, explode the deficit, because \nthere is no way to pay for this unless you cut a bunch of stuff; and \nthen, number three, cut more. Use the exploding deficit as an \nopportunity to cut spending even more: raid Social Security; raid \nMedicare; raid Medicaid.\n  This is all part of the budget that was passed last week by \nRepublicans. Let me say, there were 20 Republicans who voted against \nthat budget, and I congratulate them for their courage in voting \nagainst that budget. It was a close vote. If we had just gotten a \ncouple more, we would have been able to defeat that budget, and we \nwould have been able to at least require a more thoughtful process for \nhow we move forward on tax reform, because part of what that budget \nvote did is to allow this process to move forward with less democracy, \nwith less vetting, and with less knowledge for the American people.\n  Once again, I would say that the only reason to do this without a \nreal debate, to rewrite the American economy without a real debate, is \nif you want to hide who is going to benefit from it. We know who is \ngoing to benefit. It is right here. Mr. Moneybags is going to benefit. \nWorking people are going to suffer.\n  So I know that we Democrats are absolutely committed to making sure \nthat working families across this country, the vulnerable, the low-\nincome, the folks who are struggling every day, who are just making it, \nwho feel like this economy is not working for them because it is \ncontrolled by corporations, by lobbyists, by folks who are here not \nworking for the American people but working for their own special \ninterests, we know that Americans want that to stop. Unfortunately, \nthis plan does not do that.\n  So Democrats are going to fight every step of the way. The \nCongressional Progressive Caucus is going to fight every step of the \nway. We have our own People's Budget. We have a real proposal for how \nto invest in infrastructure, in jobs, in education, in healthcare to \nmake sure that Americans across the country, whether you are in a red \nState or a blue State, whether you are a Republican or a Democrat, \nwhether you are in rural America or urban America--I actually believe \nwe all want the same things, which is we want to be able to put food on \nthe table; we want to be able to put a roof over our head; we want to \nbe able to go to a job and feel dignity about that job; we want to be \nable to send our kids to college or to higher education so they can get \nthe skills and training they need and not be mired in student debt--\nacross the country, $1.4 trillion of student debt that we have, even \nlarger than credit card debt--and we want to be able to retire with \ndignity.\n\n  So, ultimately, my friends, what we are going to have to do as \nDemocrats--and I hope that there are Republicans across the aisle who \nwant the same things and who know that this is a bad deal for middle \nclass families, for working families, for folks who are just struggling \nto make it, who want to have that better deal, better jobs, better \nfuture, we Democrats are going to fight for that.\n  I hope that we have colleagues on the other side of the aisle who \nrecognize that their districts in blue States, red States, urban, and \nrural will suffer if this plan goes through.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.", "turn": 13, "speaker": "Ms. JAYAPAL", "itemno": 14}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "  The SPEAKER pro tempore.
