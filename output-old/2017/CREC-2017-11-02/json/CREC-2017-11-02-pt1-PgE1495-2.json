Mr. Speaker, I rise to include in the Record an Op-Ed \nby Angel Cabrera, president of George Mason University, John J. \nDeGioia, president of Georgetown University, DeRionne P. Pollard, \npresident of Montgomery College, and Scott Ralls, president of Northern \nVirginia Community College. I am proud to represent George Mason \nUniversity and Northern Virginia Community College. This important and \neloquent piece, titled ``College presidents: Protect our students, pass \nthe Dream Act,'' was published in the Hill on October 16, 2017:\n\n       ``One month ago, the lives of 800,000 young people around \n     our nation were put in jeopardy, with the decision by the \n     White House to rescind the Deferred Action for Childhood \n     Arrivals (DACA) program. This decision fails to understand \n     the overwhelmingly positive impact that the DACA program has \n     had for so many students, and the devastating consequences \n     that rescinding it will have on them, their families, our \n     schools, our communities and our country.\n       We cannot set aside the invaluable contributions of these \n     students and their passion and commitment to the work of our \n     colleges and our country.\n       We cannot forget the impact of their contributions to our \n     economy--estimated at $460 billion over the next decade.\n       We cannot ignore the joy they bring to our communities and \n     the degree to which we are strengthened by their presence.\n       We believe, as presidents of colleges and universities, it \n     is imperative that we protect these young people through the \n     passage of the Dream Act. They have grown up here in America. \n     They've gone to grade school, middle school and high school \n     with our children. They are student body presidents, medical \n     students and doctoral candidates. Some serve in high school \n     ROTC and volunteer in their churches. Others help single \n     parents raising younger siblings and tutor their peers as \n     they prepare for college. They are members of our \n     communities. They have done all the things we expect of our \n     young people, and for their efforts so many have been able to \n     earn places on our college campuses. They want--and deserve--\n     the chance to continue learning and living in America without \n     the constant fear of deportation.\n       We have seen the contributions that these extraordinary \n     young people make to our campuses and our communities. \n     Colleges and universities are about opportunity and the \n     pursuit of each and every student's version of the American \n     dream. No matter who they are--or where they came from--every \n     student deserves an equal shot at success. We take \n     responsibility for fostering academic and social environments \n     that give every student the means and opportunity to pursue a \n     better future.\n       Across our nation, our higher education community is coming \n     together in support of our Dreamers. This week, the American \n     Council on Education and colleges and universities around the \n     country are contributing their voices to a national campaign: \n     ``Higher Education Week'' in support of Protecting Dreamers. \n     To launch this week, our institutions--which represent public \n     and private as well as two- and four-year institutions in \n     Virginia, Maryland and Washington, D.C.--have come together \n     to reflect on the invaluable presence of these students on \n     our campuses. Our region has approximately 23,000 DACA \n     recipients and we know that almost half of all DACA \n     recipients are in school or pursuing a college degree.\n       These young people belong here. They have played by our \n     rules since the day they arrived as minors with their \n     parents. They have done everything we could expect of them. \n     They have earned their places on our campuses. They are \n     poised to contribute to the future of our nation. We have the \n     capacity, and responsibility, as a nation to provide a \n     permanent bipartisan legislative solution.\n       We call upon Congress to pass the bipartisan DREAM Act so \n     that these talented and hardworking students, brought here as \n     children by parents who only wished for a better life, are \n     able to get the shot at success and the American dream that \n     they so rightfully deserve.''\n\n  Mr. Speaker, I agree wholeheartedly with Presidents Cabrera, DeGioia, \nPollard, and Ralls. I invite my colleagues to read their thoughtful \npiece, and I urge them to take its message to heart.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. CONNOLLY", "itemno": 4}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 5}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "178", "extension": true, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "E1495", "wkday": "Thursday", "day": "2", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "RECOGNIZING ``COLLEGE PRESIDENTS: PROTECT OUR STUDENTS, PASS THE DREAM ACT,'' AUTHORED BY ANGEL CABRERA; JOHN J.
