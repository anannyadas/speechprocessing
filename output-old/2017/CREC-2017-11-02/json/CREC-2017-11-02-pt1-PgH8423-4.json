Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Rachel Champney, a \nmarkswoman who was recently awarded the 2017 Rimfire World Championship \ntitle in the ladies limited division.\n  A 15-year-old sophomore at Vernon-Verona-Sherrill High School, Rachel \nbegan shooting only 2 years ago but has developed a deep love and \nrespect for the sport. She learned how to shoot through local \nmarksmanship programs before being encouraged to compete nationally by \nmembers of the Trenton Fish and Game Club. Now, Rachel can fire through \nsix targets with deadeye accuracy in under 3 seconds.\n  With Rachel's success has also come a passion to share her advocacy \nfor gun safety. Rachel spends her free time teaching new shooters, \nincluding her family and friends, proper firearm safety measures. As \nRachel grows as a markswoman, she continues to grow as a community \nleader.\n  Congratulations on this amazing accomplishment, Rachel, and I hope to \nhave the honor of shooting with you in the near future.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Ms. TENNEY", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "178", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H8423", "wkday": "Thursday", "day": "2", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "RECOGNIZING RACHEL CHAMPNEY", "id": "CREC-2017-11-02-pt1-PgH8423-4", "title": "RECOGNIZING RACHEL CHAMPNEY"}
