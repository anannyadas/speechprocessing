Mr. Speaker, today, I would like to recognize the local \nfire departments from the 25th Congressional District--specifically, \nthe ones located in Johnson County.\n  Altogether, first responders from this county were deployed for over \n8 weeks to help with Hurricane Harvey relief efforts. Twenty \nfirefighters and personnel were sent from Cleburne, Bono, Godley, \nGrandview, and Joshua fire departments to help out with the storm's \nimpact.\n  Just 2 weeks ago, these first responders were honored during the \nJohnson County Emergency Services District Number 1 monthly meeting. \nOver the course of 2 months, they contributed a great deal to the total \nnumber of 17,000 rescue missions in Texas.\n  More than 33,000 individuals were displaced as a result of this \ntragedy, and these heroes put their own lives on hold to help out their \nfellow Texans.\n  Mr. Speaker, these crews, who serve their local community, are a rare \nfind--they are heroes--and I am honored to represent them in the 25th \nCongressional District of Texas.\n  They voluntarily left their families and put their lives on the line \nin order to save others. The folks in Houston and south Texas will be \nforever grateful.\n  Texas is still recovering and, together, we will be stronger than \never before.\n  God bless Texas, God bless the first responders, and God bless the \nUnited States of America.\n  In God we trust.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. WILLIAMS", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "178", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H8394", "wkday": "Thursday", "day": "2", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "25TH CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT OF TEXAS FIRE DEPARTMENTS", "id": "CREC-2017-11-02-pt1-PgH8394-3", "title": null}
