Mr. Speaker, today I rise in memory of Army \nStaff Sergeant (SSG) Joe Nathan Wilson who paid the ultimate sacrifice \nwhile defending our great nation on November 2, 2003, during Operation \nIraqi Freedom. SSG Wilson was mortally wounded in an attack on a CH-47 \nChinook helicopter near Fallujah, Iraq. Fifteen other servicemen were \nkilled in the crash. He died from his injuries in a Kuwait hospital. \nSSG Wilson was assigned to Alpha Battery, 2nd Battalion, 5th Field \nArtillery Regiment, 3rd Corps Artillery, Fort Sill, Oklahoma.\n  According to the Associated Press, an Ohio serviceman said he \nsurvived because of the heroic act of SSG Wilson. Sergeant (SSG) Joe \nMlinar said SSG Wilson cradled his head with his body to shield him \nwhen the helicopter crashed.\n  SSG Wilson was remembered on a memorial website by a fellow soldier. \nStaff Sergeant (SSG) Benjamin Dunlap of Stroud, Oklahoma, said SSG \nWilson was a leader, ``I served with SSG Wilson during our tour in \nIraq. He was the epiphany of the NCO corps. He was always leading by \nexample. He could never be seen without a smile on his face. I \nconsidered him to be my friend. He was a friend to all who knew him.''\n  SSG Wilson graduated from Crystal Springs High School in Crystal \nSprings, Mississippi in 1992. Robert Green, the Crystal Springs High \nSchool athletic director, said SSG Wilson was a standout student, ``He \nwas a nice young man, especially on the football field.'' Shortly after \ngraduation, SSG Wilson enlisted in the U.S. Army. Maxine Adams, SSG \nWilson's mother, said he always wanted to be in the military, ``He was \na great son. It was important to Nate to be an accomplished person.'' \nPatricia Fortenberry, SSG Wilson's sister, is proud of her brother's \nservice, ``He was a great brother. He was my best friend.''\n  Shortly after SSG Wilson's death, the city of Crystal Springs \ndesignated November 2nd as an official day to recognize his service to \nour nation. His family hosts a picnic and speakers are included at the \nevent. It is held at the Joe Nathan Wilson Sportsplex and Memorial Fire \nStation in Crystal Springs which is named in his honor. Sally Garland, \nmayor of Crystal Springs, said the city will begin a new tradition in \nhonor of SSG Wilson. Beginning this year, flags will be lowered to \nhalf-staff on the anniversary of his death.\n  SSG Wilson was buried at Brushy Creek Cemetery in Hopewell, \nMississippi. SSG Wilson is survived by his mother, Maxine Adams; his \nwife, Erica; his daughter, Yasmin; his three nephews, Jaydan Adams, \nJordan Adams, and Specialist (SPC) Jerrick Wilson; his two nieces, \nKawanza Fortenberry and Latria Wilson.\n  SSG Wilson's bravery under fire demonstrated his devotion to his \ncomrades and to our nation. His service will always be remembered.\n\n\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. KELLY of Mississippi", "itemno": 4}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 5}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "178", "extension": true, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "E1493-E1494", "wkday": "Thursday", "day": "2", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "RECOGNIZING THE LIFE OF FALLEN MISSISSIPPI SOLDIER STAFF SERGEANT (SSG) JOE NATHAN WILSON", "id": "CREC-2017-11-02-pt1-PgE1493-3", "title": null}
