Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I rise today in support of H.R. 849, the Protecting Seniors' Access \nto Medicare Act. This discussion is not new. Republicans and Democrats \ncame together to pass this same bill back in 2015. This year there is, \nonce again, strong bipartisan support with 45 Democratic Members and \n225 Republican cosponsors. It passed out of the Ways and Means \nCommittee last month with bipartisan support, too.\n  This bill will repeal the Independent Payment Advisory Board, or \nIPAB, created in ObamaCare, the Affordable Care Act. The IPAB puts 15 \nunelected bureaucrats in charge of Medicare spending with significant \nunilateral powers to slash payments to providers, forcing them to stop \nseeing Medicare patients without any accountability, judicial review, \nor transparency.\n  The board's unprecedented authority to alter Medicare policy could \nultimately reduce seniors' access to healthcare and put the government, \nrather than the patient, at the center of the healthcare system.\n  Putting Medicare on a sustainable financial footing is a top priority \nfor all of us here in Congress, but passing the buck to a handful of \nunaccountable bureaucrats is not the right approach.\n  Last year, the Medicare Trustees Report stated that this was to be \nthe year that the IPAB's authority to make cuts would be triggered. \nFortunately, this year's Medicare Trustees Report has given us slightly \nmore time, but next year, they can come back and move that date up once \nagain. This is a cloud that will hang over providers and beneficiaries, \nunless we act and pass this bill today.\n  Now some have stated that this bill does not solve any immediate \nproblem, and they have questioned the need to act on the bill today. I \nbelieve that our seniors and our healthcare providers are a priority. \nWhy should we kick the can down the road when we can stop this today?\n  There are letters of support from over 700 bipartisan groups \nrepresenting patients, employers, hospitals, doctors, nurses, and other \nhealthcare professionals all voicing strong support for IPAB repeal.\n  They believe that the threat of this board is enough to warrant \nrepeal and to place the decisionmaking back in the hands of elected \nMembers of Congress, and I agree.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.", "turn": 5, "speaker": "Mr. PAULSEN", "itemno": 11}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "L000263", "text": "  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, this is really the question: Why in the world are we \ntaking up a bill to terminate a board that does not exist? Why in the \nworld are we doing so when premiums are rising and action should be \ntaken to strengthen them? Why in the world are we passing a bill that \nwould increase the deficit by $17.6 billion? Pay for CHIP, the \nRepublicans say, but not this bill.\n  So however you feel about IPAB, this is the wrong time and the wrong \nbill for addressing it. The ACA enrollment period began yesterday, and \nbecause of actions of the Trump administration, consumers across the \ncountry face confusion and instability in the market.\n  Rather than addressing these urgent issues, we are engaged today in a \npolitical exercise to repeal IPAB, a board that has no members under a \nprovision that has never taken effect and is not projected to be \ntriggered before 2021, according to CMS actuaries.\n  In September, every Democratic member of the Ways and Means Committee \nwrote to Chairman Brady urging bipartisan action to stabilize the \ninsurance market. But after repeated requests, we never received a \nresponse from the chairman, and, to date, the House has taken no action \non behalf of consumers.\n  In the meanwhile, the Trump administration has continued to work to \nundermine the law and access to healthcare by: one, cutting off funding \nfor cost-sharing assistance for moderate-income enrollees; two, \nslashing funds to navigators that help consumers enroll in coverage--\nthe biggest navigator in Michigan had its funding cut by 90 percent; \nthree, shortening the enrollment period; four, shutting down \nhealthcare.gov on weekends; and five, proposing to chip away at \nconsumer protections through executive fiat.\n  These actions have significantly contributed to insurers exiting the \nmarket and raising premiums. It is nothing less than direct and \ndeliberate sabotage; so, instead, the Republicans today bring up a bill \nabout a board that does not exist, and the latest is it would not until \n2021, at the earliest.\n  There are simple actions that we can take today to repair some of the \ndamage and, thereby, improve the insurance markets. Senators Lamar \nAlexander and Patty Murray recently came to a bipartisan agreement that \nwould provide funding for the cost-sharing reductions and outreach and \nenrollment activities that strengthen the risk pool in the marketplace.\n  Unfortunately, as we see today, my Republican colleagues continue to \nignore these and other important issues, while allowing an \nadministration, obsessed with repeal of ACA, to do so through executive \naction what could not be done legislatively.\n  What is more, they are bringing to the floor today a bill that the \nCongressional Budget Office estimates will raise the deficit by $17.5 \nbillion over the next decade. I repeat, raise the deficit by $17.5 \nbillion over the next decade. And this is just a small preview of the \ncoming GOP tax bill, which would increase our Nation's debt by $1.5 \ntrillion according to the Republican's own budget resolution.\n\n  And whatever happened to the crocodile tears we used to hear from \nRepublicans about the deficit? In terms of today's bill lacking any \noffset, how about at least starting to address the staggering cost of \nprescription drugs, a step that would save both senior citizens and the \nMedicare program money.\n  Mr. Speaker, the American people need Congress to take action to \nlower their healthcare costs and to stabilize the markets. They do not \nneed today an irrelevant political bill such as H.R. 849. If you \nsupport real steps to lower health insurance premiums now, vote ``no'' \non this bill.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.", "turn": 6, "speaker": "Mr. LEVIN", "itemno": 12}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "P000594", "text": "  Mr. PAULSEN.

We should all be \njoining together. There is bipartisan support on this bill to eliminate \nthis unnecessary and potentially very destructive body, one that I \nwould define as a major flaw in the law. This is the exact process that \nwe have been asking for--you have been asking for.\n  The bill has been through regular order. We have had countless \nhearings on this topic. We have actually voted not once, but twice, in \npast Congresses to repeal the IPAB to keep it from harming access to \nseniors' care.\n  So today we are bringing this bill forward--this legislation \nforward--as a stand-alone provision, not tied to any other policies, to \nonce and for all allow Members to say whether they support or oppose \nthis unaccountable board.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. \nRoe), who has been a tireless champion for seniors in Tennessee and, \nsince day one, has been working on this legislation to repeal the IPAB.", "turn": 7, "speaker": "Mr. PAULSEN", "itemno": 13}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "R000582", "text": "  Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of my bill, H.R. \n849, the\n\n\nProtecting Seniors' Access to Medicare Act of 2017, a bipartisan bill \nwith 270 cosponsors, that repeals two sections of the Affordable Care \nAct and terminates the Independent Payment Advisory Board--or the \nIPAB--once and for all. I thank Chairman Brady and Chairman Walden for \nbringing this important bill to the floor.\n  I also want to start by thanking my lead Democrat cosponsor from \nCalifornia, Dr. Raul Ruiz. Dr. Ruiz and his staff have worked \ntirelessly with my staff to get more cosponsors this Congress than we \nhave ever had before, including 45 Democrats. Seeing such strong \nbipartisan support for my bill only makes sense, however, since doing \naway with the IPAB has been a bipartisan idea since it was first \nproposed.\n  In December of 2009, I joined Congressman Richard Neal and 72 other \nbipartisan Members in writing then-Speaker Pelosi expressing our \nopposition to the IPAB's creation. On the day the ACA passed the House, \nI filed legislation to repeal the IPAB, and have received bipartisan \nsupport in every Congress since. This is about access for seniors' care \nand quality of their care. By the way, the IPAB was not in the House \nversion of the Affordable Care Act. Only the Senate sent that back over \nhere. So it was not part of the House to begin with.\n  We got lucky this summer that the Medicare trustees' report did not \ntrigger the IPAB. Otherwise, there would have been significant \nstatutory requirements to cut Medicare within a year. These cuts would \nhave been made to provide reimbursements, which would do nothing but \ndrive providers out of Medicare and would eliminate options for our \nseniors to receive healthcare.\n  Peter Orszag, President Obama's Office of Management and Budget \nDirector, said this was the greatest ceding of power from the Congress \nto a bureaucracy since the formation of the Federal Reserve. Remember, \nit has been stated here, Mr. Speaker, that the board hasn't been \nformed. That means one person makes these decisions, not the Congress. \nMedicare recipients can't come to their elected official and effect \nchanges in this IPAB if it is enacted, and it will be.\n  One of the major concerns we hear today is that the CBO has estimated \nthat this bill will cost over $17 billion that is not paid for. First \nof all, the CBO describes its estimates as ``extremely uncertain'' \nbecause it is quite possible that under current law, the IPAB will not \nbe triggered.\n  Secondly, this is the same dilemma we were in with the sustainable \ngrowth rate--SGR. Medicare says to doctors: You go out and provide the \ncare, but if you provide too much, we will cut your payments.\n  As a physician myself, having seen how much havoc the SGR wreaked \nevery year, we can't afford to put providers through this again. We \nspent months and years getting that corrected. Knowing that many \nMembers were concerned about the offsets in previous years, we have a \nbill on the floor today that all of our cosponsors can support.\n  I look forward to seeing all 270 of my cosponsors voting in favor of \npassage in order to preserve Medicare for our Nation's seniors. We have \na chance to send a strong statement of support to Americans of Medicare \nage that do not want to see their healthcare arbitrarily cut by a body \nof 15 unelected, unaccountable bureaucrats, or the Secretary of HHS, if \nthe board is not empaneled. If there are hard decisions to be made on \nMedicare, Congress should not abdicate that duty to a group of people \nwith no oversight or legal recourse. Those decisions should be made by \nthe people elected as representatives of the people.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support final passage of this \nbill and maintain Medicare services for our Nation's seniors, because \nthis is truly a bipartisan issue that will affect all seniors equally.", "turn": 8, "speaker": "Mr. ROE of Tennessee", "itemno": 14}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "L000263", "text": "  Mr. LEVIN.

Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend for yielding me this time.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition of the repeal of the \nIndependent Payment Advisory Board.\n  This is another classic example of a solution in search of a problem. \nOf all the things that we should be working on in Congress in a \nbipartisan fashion to improve and to fix the problems that exist within \nour healthcare system, we have legislation on the floor before us today \nthat calls for the repeal of a nonexisting commission, based on \nnonconsistent spending cuts being proposed for Medicare, based on a \nnonconsistent cost of rate of increase in spending under the Medicare \nprogram, all of which is going to add $17.5 billion to the deficit over \nthe next 10 years because this bill isn't paid for. And the irony is \nthey are coming forward with this legislation, which will add another \n$18 billion to the debt, on the same day they release a tax bill that \ncalls for an additional $1.5 trillion worth of deficit spending because \nthe tax bill hasn't been offset. At some point and at some time, we \nhave got to take a bipartisan stand on fiscal responsibility in this \nplace again because it is not happening today.\n\n  Instead, we should be working on short-term, practical solutions to \nstabilize and bring more certainty to the health insurance marketplace, \nin light of what the administration is doing to completely undermine \nthe marketplaces today. We ought to be working on delivery system \nreform proposals that will emphasize the establishment of accountable \ncare organizations and medical homes and value-based purchasing and \nbundling arrangements and different alternative payment models to get \nus to a system of value, quality, and outcomes, and away from the fee-\nfor-service payment for the volume of services, regardless of results.\n  Let's be honest, the real cost driver in our Federal budget--and it \nis true at the State and local level--has been healthcare costs because \nwe have an aging population. That is the work that we should be working \non together, is the delivery system reform and the payment reform, so \nwe are aligning the incentives in the right direction where we are \ntelling our healthcare providers: You will be compensated based on good \nresults, not on how much you do.\n  There is a lot within the Affordable Care Act giving our providers \nthe very tools in order to accomplish that, and we ought to be \nenhancing that here today. Instead, we are wasting time on a commission \nthat, according to the CMS's own actuary, says, at the very earliest, \nit might be comprised in 2021. But, even then, it warrants us, with the \nmission that we have given it, that: Hey, you have got healthcare \nspending within the healthcare system that, Congress, you need to deal \nwith. And then come back with recommendations. And then it is up to us \nto make corrective action at that time.\n  So all this talk about unelected bureaucrats making these decisions \nbelies what the legislation actually calls for in the establishment of \nthe IPAB. This was, however, another important cost containment tool \nthat was put into the Affordable Care Act to try to restrain the growth \nof healthcare spending. We need more of those type of ideas, rather \nthan efforts today to remove those tools and then possibly see just \nunbridled healthcare spending in the future.\n  What is really disturbing is I know there is a lot of common ground \nin this area, yet the American people wouldn't know it, with this \npolitical ping-pong ball on healthcare reform going back and forth and \nthe chaos and the confusion that it is causing, and that is \nunfortunate.\n  So, instead, today, we ought to first take steps to stabilize the \ninsurance exchanges, rather than an administration that is doing \neverything they can to limit the enrollment during the signup period, \nwhich actually started yesterday and lasts until December 15. They have \ncut by 90 percent funding for marketing of the exchanges. They have cut \nby almost 50 percent the funding for our navigators back home who are \ntrying to help people get affordable healthcare coverage in their \nlives. They ended the cost-share payments, which only increases the \ncost for healthcare for everyone else because of the risk that the \ninsurance plans now face.\n  The other segment of the population that we should be focused on in \nhelping is that 5 or 6 percent of the population that are in the \nindividual market who don't qualify for premium tax credits because \nthey are getting hammered today. You would think that would be another \narea of bipartisan commonality that we can come together on\n\n\nto provide relief for those individuals who are in the individual \nmarket experiencing these higher premiums, part of it being done \nbecause of the elimination of the cost-sharing reduction payments, but, \ninstead, nothing is being done on that front.\n  My friend from Michigan also pointed out that we should be having \nhearings about the cost of prescription drugs in committee. That is one \nof the main cost drivers within the healthcare system, yet there is \ndeafening silence in the Halls of Congress when it comes to taking \nmeasure on that front, even though President Trump promised during the \ncourse of his campaign and even earlier this year to try to take some \naction in a bipartisan way to address drug costs.", "turn": 10, "speaker": "Mr. KIND", "itemno": 16}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

This will repeal \nthe Independent Payment Advisory Board, IPAB.\n  The purpose of IPAB is to reduce Medicare's per capita growth rate. \nWhile, certainly, that is important work, this is not the solution.\n  The IPAB, created by the Affordable Care Act, would be composed of 15 \nunelected bureaucrats authorized to unilaterally make decisions \nregarding Medicare's finances, whether that be through draconian cuts \nto provider payments or by imposing policy changes that would reduce \nMedicare spending if the program exceeds an arbitrary growth rate \ntarget.\n  In other words, they can do just about anything they want to cut \nMedicare, and we don't have much of a say in it. These changes would \nautomatically go into effect, and the Secretary of Health and Human \nServices would be forced to implement these reductions should IPAB be \ntriggered, unless Congress passed legislation that would achieve the \nsame amount of savings.\n  It is also worth noting that current law does not require a public \ncomment period before IPAB issues their recommendations, so there would \nbe no chance for the public to weigh in.

Mr. Speaker, the issue here about Medicare is one where \nthere is universal support in this body for that program that was \npassed in 1965 by a bipartisan vote. It is a lifeline for many of our \nseniors--for all of our seniors. It is a program where, since everybody \npays, everybody benefits. It gives all of us confidence that our \nparents or ourselves will have access to good healthcare.\n  We have a challenge. The cost of healthcare in this country is far \ntoo expensive, and it is for a variety of reasons that our country \nspends twice as much on healthcare as most industrialized countries in \nthe rest of the world and we don't get better results for that.\n  The challenge for us, if we want to save healthcare, particularly \nMedicare, is to start focusing on reforms that bring the cost of \nhealthcare down and don't compromise quality.\n  The Affordable Care Act extended access to healthcare for millions of \nAmericans, but it also included some steps that began bending the cost \ncurve. The rate of growth in the Medicare spending has started to come \ndown under the Affordable Care Act. It was patient-centered programs, \nit was accountable care organizations, it was value-based payment \nsystems. These things where, for the first time, Congress talked not \njust about extending access, but trying to reform payment systems so \nthat we could get the benefit of a more efficient system.\n  The IPAB is simply one of the potential tools that would be used in \norder to present to Congress recommendations. Unlike what Mr. Walden \nsaid, it would be the final say of Congress whether we wanted to \napprove or not any recommendation by the IPAB.\n  Here is the difference in how we are approaching healthcare. Many in \nthis body on the Republican side have focused on the cost of \nhealthcare, its contribution to the debt. The policy proposal in the \nform of repealing the Affordable Care Act, its way of reducing the cost \nof healthcare was to take healthcare away from 24 million Americans. \nThat is what that bill did.\n  That is one way to control the cost of healthcare, have people go \nwithout. It is the wrong way. We all know that. We have got to bite the \nbullet here and start addressing the fact that we spend too much. Some \nof it is wasteful procedures, some of it is gaming the system, some of \nit is these incredible maneuvers by drug companies.\n  I am just going to give one example because I want to give this \nexample as an indication of how right before our eyes bad things are \nhappening that we are allowing to occur.\n  HUMIRA, a very good drug by AbbVie. Their patent was expiring. That \npatent is legislatively provided to give them exclusive marketing and \nselling rights. They have a monopoly price. It is incredibly expensive, \nlike $70,000 for a supply.\n  Amgen had a biosimilar that was going to be marketed, and then you \nwould have the benefit of competition. The price would go down.\n  AbbVie and Amgen made a deal. We don't know how much AbbVie paid to \nAmgen, but suddenly Amgen is not going to bring its generic, in effect, \nto market until 2023, but--and this is part of their agreement--they \nare going to sell their biosimilar product in Europe now.", "turn": 35, "speaker": "Mr. WELCH", "itemno": 41}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

We see the \npay-fors for community health centers and the CHIP tomorrow, taking \naway money from the Prevention Fund from the Affordable Care Act, \nlimiting the grace period when people will lose their insurance that \nthey have under the Affordable Care Act.\n  This goes along also with what is happening with the President as \nwell. The President has, in the last month or so, said that he is not \ngoing to pay the cost-sharing subsidies. He has cut back on the \noutreach so that people don't know what is in the Affordable Care Act. \nHe has cut back on the period when people can sign up and get their \ninsurance in half.\n  What we are seeing, in my opinion, is the Republicans sabotaging the \nAffordable Care Act. They couldn't repeal it, so now they are doing \nwhatever they can to sabotage it. It is really ironic or inconsistent, \nhowever you want to put it. On the one hand they are insisting that \nwhen it comes to kids and community health centers, which is a group of \npeople you would think they would be most concerned about, they insist \non paying for it by taking money from other healthcare programs. We are \nasked to take money from the Prevention Fund, which pays for vaccines \nfor children, which pays for the children's lead poisoning program, \nwhich is a major part of our opiate prevention program. This is the \nmoney that comes from the Prevention Fund. Basically, they are taking \nthat money and using it to pay for the community health centers and the \nChildren's Health Initiative, which means that that money is lost. That \nmoney is lost for those other purposes.\n  With regard to the grace period, they are saying, well, if you fail \nto pay your insurance, it used to be 90 days before you lost it. Now it \nwould be 30 days before you lost it, which means that you end up with \nabout 500,000 or 600,000 people who have insurance now under the \nAffordable Care Act that would lose it, according to the CBO.\n  Yet, at the same time, with the IPAB repeal, which we are considering \nnow, which costs $17.5 billion, and which, as my colleague from Vermont \nsaid, is a mechanism to try to save costs, they are saying: Well, we \ndon't have to pay for that. We can just repeal it. We will forego those \nadditional costs, which become part of the deficit.\n  Mr. Speaker, for all these reasons, the bottom line is, what the \nRepublicans are doing is not fair. It is not fair to the kids. It is \nnot fair to the people who are going to lose their health insurance.\n  I will say as the last thing that this is going nowhere. One of the \nreasons why Democrats have been urging the Republicans with regard to \nthe CHIP and community health centers to work with us on a bipartisan \nbasis is because we know if this bill passes today on a partisan vote, \nbecause we can't support it for the reasons I explained, then that \nmeans that it is going to go to the Senate and it is going to die \nbecause there is no reason to believe that the Senate is going to take \nup this partisan bill.\n  I think it is just a huge mistake on the part of Republicans. \nBasically, what they are signaling today is that they don't really care \nabout this. They wanted to stick around until the end of year, which \nmeans the community health centers and CHIP just basically wither on \nthe vine for lack of funds. That is not fair. It is not fair to the \nkids. It is not fair to those who use community health centers.\n  Mr. Speaker, for all these reasons, I would urge a ``no'' vote on the \nbill today, the IPAB repeal; and I will also ask for a ``no'' vote \ntomorrow on the CHIP and the community health centers legislation.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.", "turn": 43, "speaker": "Mr. PALLONE", "itemno": 49}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "G000558", "text": "  Mr. GUTHRIE.

On the value-based payments--which I think \nis the direction we need to go to rein in the costs and make sure we \nhave sustainable programs, but the IPAB's annual short-term focus \nsavings provision would affect Medicare and the wider health system in \nunpredictable ways with potentially many negative unintended \nconsequences by doubling down on the traditional practice of squeezing \npayment rates in order to slow spending with no meaningful eye to how \nthese changes impact long-term incentives--the IPAB could work at cross \npurposes to broaden reform that would base Medicare payments on quality \nand value.\n  On the offset, we did offset CHIP and the community health centers. \nWe know that money is going to be spent. We know that when we authorize \nit, it is going to be spent. We believe it is going to be spent wisely. \nThat is why we are moving forward with these bills.\n  The IPAB has not been constituted, and repealing it should not have \nto be offset since it has not spent any money nor been charged yet with \nfinding any savings. The IPAB trigger has never been hit. The CBO \nestimates that the IPAB would be triggered in 2023, 2025, and 2027. But \nby their own admission, and I quote from the report, ``Given the \nuncertainty that surrounds these projections, it is possible such \nauthority would be invoked in other years,'' or we could also assume \npossibly never at all.\n  The CBO estimate also has to assume the level of cuts required by the \namount Medicare is spending that exceeds the trigger. The CBO also then \nhas to speculate on how reductions made in any one year would impact \nthe trigger in future years, further laying assumption upon guesswork. \nAs the CBO notes in their estimate, the estimate represents a broad \nrange of possible effects.\n  The CBO admits they do not know if the IPAB will be triggered or what \npolicies they might pursue if activated. Some of their assumptions are \none-sided bets that may or may not achieve savings, and the CBO must \nfurther speculate on the probabilities associated with such variations.\n  Mr. Speaker, in closing, I believe the IPAB will not be effective \nproviding real solutions for Medicare solvency. It contributes \ndisproportionately little to the projected cost savings needed in \nMedicare, but it has the potential to hurt seniors' access to care. \nFundamentally, I believe it is a constitutional affront to the \nlegislative branch.\n\n\n  The IPAB decisions don't come to Congress to be approved or \ndisapproved. We can undo the IPAB decisions if we have dollar-for-\ndollar replacement, but that could even be blocked by a minority vote \nin the Senate.\n  So I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 849, to repeal the \nIndependent Payment Advisory Board, and I hope there will continue to \nbe bipartisan support for this important legislation.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.", "turn": 44, "speaker": "Mr. GUTHRIE", "itemno": 50}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "J000032", "text": "  Ms. JACKSON LEE.

they have struck out every \ntime because the American people appreciate and strongly support the \nAffordable Care Act.\n  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to look at the facts and abandon \nthis misguided effort to undermine the ACA and impose significant \nnegative impacts on Americans currently insured.\n  The Independent Payment Advisory Board is to recommend to Congress \npolicies that reduce the rate of Medicare growth and help Medicare \nprovide better care at lower costs.\n  IPAB membership by law is to be made up of 15 members appointed by \nthe President and confirmed by the Senate and been comprised of the \nnon-partisan CBO, economists, and health policy experts as contributing \nto Medicare's long-term sustainability.\n  Mr. Speaker, the IPAB is already prohibited from recommending changes \nto Medicare that ration health care, restrict benefits, modify \neligibility, increase cost sharing, or raise premiums or revenues.\n  Under current law, the Congress retains the authority to modify, \nreject, or enhance IPAB recommendations to strengthen Medicare, and \nIPAB recommendations would take effect only if the Congress does not \nact to slow Medicare cost growth.\n  Finally, Mr. Speaker, let me point out to our friends across the \naisle that according to the CMS actuary, IPAB will not be triggered \nuntil 2021, so the timing of today's repeal is premature and \npolitically motivated.\n  IPAB was enacted as a backstop to the other cost saving and quality \nimprovement efforts in ACA, such as accountable care organizations, \npatient-centered care models like medical homes, programs that pay for \nquality not quantity, and value based purchasing.\n  Because of the ACA and these programs, Medicare spending growth has \nslowed and Medicare's solvency has been extended.\n  Increasing the deficit by $17.5 billion as a result of repealing the \nIPAB would is fiscally irresponsible, especially now that Republicans \nhave introduced a tax package that will saddle our country with $1.5 \ntrillion of debt in order to give tax cuts to the wealthy and \ncorporations.\n  Mr. Speaker, despite the Supreme Court's upholding of the law's \nconstitutionality, the reelection of President Obama, and Speaker \nRyan's admission that ``Obamacare is the law of the land,'' Republicans \nrefuse to stop wasting time and taxpayer money in their effort to take \naway the patient protections and benefits of the Affordable Care Act.\n  Mr. Speaker, I call upon House Republican leaders to stop wasting our \ntime trying to take away healthcare protections that Americans depend \non and to start addressing pressing national priorities.\n  And they should start with working with Democrats on a bipartisan and \nresponsible plan to reauthorize the Children's Health Insurance Program \n(``SCHIP'') which insures more than 9 million kids and fully funding \nthe relief efforts needed to help American communities recover from the \ndevastating effects of Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in voting against H.R. 849.", "turn": 45, "speaker": "Ms. JACKSON LEE", "itemno": 51}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "  The SPEAKER pro tempore.
