The administration didn't halt--and \n     indirectly bolstered--the federal subsidies that help \n     consumers with their insurance premiums.\n       The new analysis doesn't project exactly how many consumers \n     could be eligible for the no-premium plans, a figure that \n     depends on variables including people's income, household \n     size, age, location and access to other types of health \n     coverage.\n       In the coming weeks, insurers are gearing up to promote the \n     no-premium option. Amid uncertainty about the future of the \n     2010 health law, known as Obamacare, many insurers have \n     pulled back from the law's marketplaces. Many of the \n     remaining ones are worried about losing enrollment next \n     year--largely among consumers who aren't eligible for \n     subsidies and won't be able to get premium-free plans.\n       Insurers hope the no-premium insurance draws in more \n     enrollees, particularly those they need most: people with few \n     health needs. Healthy consumers help bolster the stability of \n     the market by balancing out the health costs of sicker \n     enrollees.\n       ``We absolutely will be promoting this opportunity to get \n     coverage at a zero price,''\n\n\n     said Wendy Curran, a spokeswoman for Blue Cross Blue Shield \n     of Wyoming, which is mentioning the no-premium plans in \n     print, radio and social-media advertising. ``We hope those \n     younger people will say, `Well yeah, if it's not going to \n     cost me anything, sure.' ''\n       Ms. Curran said it was ``astounding even to us'' how many \n     people will be able to get no-premium insurance in Wyoming.\n       The no-premium plans will also receive a hefty promotional \n     push from insurance agents. EHealth Inc. and HealthMarkets \n     Inc., both big national agencies, said they're preparing to \n     highlight the option in advertising and other outreach.\n       ``It's just the idea of something free being really \n     appealing,'' said Nate Purpura, a vice president at eHealth. \n     The company's surveys have consistently shown that price is \n     the most important factor in consumers' choice of plan, he \n     said.\n       Availability will vary by age and income, but some \n     enrollees who don't have a very low income may be able to \n     land zero-premium coverage, according to the analysis of \n     federal data conducted by consulting firm Oliver Wyman, a \n     unit of Marsh & McLennan.\n       The firm found that zero-premium ACA exchange plans would \n     be available next year to at least some consumers in a total \n     of 2,692 counties, out of 2,722 in the study.\n       A 60-year-old making about $36,000 a year could find free \n     2018 plans in 1,590 counties, while one with income of about \n     $48,000 could do so in 654 counties, according to the \n     analysis, which used data released Wednesday for plans \n     available on HealthCare.gov, the federal marketplace used by \n     39 states.\n       For 2017, no-premium plans were available in many places \n     for the very lowest-income enrollees, but for those at \n     slightly higher levels, they were much more scarce. For \n     instance, in 2017, a 60-year-old making about $36,000 could \n     find free plans in about 300 of the counties.\n       That is what is different in 2018, said Kurt Giesa, a \n     partner at Oliver Wyman. The zero-premium plans are ``much \n     more prevalent now than they were,'' he said.\n       In California, which isn't included in the federal data, \n     consumers must pay a minimal $1 a month. But there is a \n     ``huge increase from last year'' in the number of people who \n     will be able to buy virtually free plans, said Peter V. Lee, \n     executive director of Covered California, the state's ACA \n     exchange. Covered California currently has about 1.1 million \n     enrollees who receive federal-premium subsidies, and more \n     than half of them will be able to buy a plan for $1 for 2018, \n     he said.\n       The growing availability of no-premium plans is tied to the \n     complicated dynamics of the 2010 health law, as well as a \n     recent move by the GOP president.\n       Under the law's rules, subsidies that help pay for premiums \n     are available to people making up to about $48,000 a year. \n     Those subsidy amounts are linked to the cost of the second-\n     cheapest silver plan in an enrollee's location. So, when \n     silver premiums go up, subsidies go up.\n       Earlier this month, Mr. Trump's administration cut off \n     federal payments to insurers for covering certain out-of-\n     pocket costs for low-income enrollees in silver plans. In \n     response, insurers raised premiums on their 2018 policies \n     sharply to cover the extra expense, now coming out of their \n     pockets--and in many cases, they loaded the extra boost only \n     onto the silver plans.\n       Because the separate premium subsidies, which Mr. Trump \n     didn't cut, are linked to silver-plan prices, those subsidies \n     are rising, too. In many states, the costs for cheaper bronze \n     plans are going up much less rapidly than silver plans, so \n     many more people will wind up being eligible for no-premium \n     plans.\n       On the flip side, those who don't get premium subsidies \n     under the 2010 law may be responsible for the full brunt of \n     steep rate increases, though they may be able to mitigate the \n     impact by staying away from silver plans.\n       For those who can get free plans, the lure may be \n     irresistible.\n       Medica, an insurer that is offering exchange plans in \n     states including Iowa, Nebraska and Wisconsin, is running ads \n     in some places that say ``$0 premium plans for individuals \n     who qualify.'' It is also sending letters to some current \n     exchange enrollees with bronze plans, who are likely to be \n     enrolled with Medica in 2018, informing them that they can \n     stop paying premiums next year. ``That's a nice letter to \n     get,'' said Geoff Bartsh, a vice president at Medica.\n       Jerry Dworak, chief executive of Montana Health Co-op, \n     said, ``of course we're hoping that'' young and healthy \n     enrollees flock to the no-premium plans.\n       ``If they see that it's free, why not take it?,'' he said.\n       Mr. Dworak said that a person making as much as $33,000 a \n     year could get one of his company's Idaho plans and pay no \n     premium.\n       The plans may attract more older consumers than younger \n     because premiums and subsidies rise with age, making free \n     plans more available to older people.\n       And for some, the zero-premium plans won't actually be the \n     best deal, insurers and insurance agents say. The silver \n     plans could be cheaper overall for people who use much health \n     care, despite their higher premium costs, if these people are \n     eligible for the health law's cost sharing help.\n       According to HealthCare.gov, for instance, a 40-year-old \n     man in Cheyenne, Wyo., who makes about $24,000 a year could \n     get a zero-premium bronze plan, but he could pay as much as \n     $6,650 over the course of 2018 in deductibles and other out-\n     of-pocket charges. Or he could get a silver plan that would \n     cost him around $125 a month, but cap his out-of-pocket costs \n     at $2,450.\n       ``There's this trade-off,'' said Michael Z. Stahl, a senior \n     vice president at HealthMarkets, who said the company's \n     agents will walk through the pros and cons with clients.\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "The RECORDER", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 3}], "header": {"chamber": "Senate", "num": "178", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "S6997-S6998", "wkday": "Thursday", "day": "2", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "HEALTHCARE", "id": "CREC-2017-11-02-pt1-PgS6997-4", "title": "HEALTHCARE"}
