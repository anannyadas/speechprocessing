                    in the house of representatives

                       Thursday, November 2, 2017

  Mr. CARTER of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Major Barry 
Richard, United States Air Force, Retired. Maj. Richard, who answered 
the call to defend our great nation for 20 years, continues to 
dutifully serve his community of Georgetown, Texas in civilian life. An 
exemplary serviceman and citizen, it is my honor to award Maj. Richard 
with the Congressional Veteran Commendation.
  His military service began in 1968 where his skills were utilized in 
various capacities as an engineer, pilot, and manager. He wore many 
hats during his years with the Air Force, including working as a 
technical design engineer for modifications to EC-135 aircraft and 
Hound Dog Air-launched missiles, as pilot and rated staff officer, and 
as Chief of numerous Air Force Safety Units. Maj. Richard saw much 
combat, and as a testament to the quality of his service, he received 
numerous awards including the Air Force Distinguished Flying Cross, Air 
Medal, Meritorious Service Medal, and numerous Commendation Medals.
  Maj. Richard's love of country is matched only by his commitment to 
his fellow service members. After the end of his service in 1988, he 
and his friend Staff Sergeant Jim Harrell, United States Marines Corps, 
have worked to improve the lives of veterans in Williamson County. Maj. 
Richard has contributed to building wheelchair ramps and making 
considerable home improvements to the homes of local veterans in need. 
This dignified work has made a lasting impact on the community he 
proudly serves.
  I commend Maj. Barry Richard's selfless service to the United States 
Air Force, his nation, and his community. His patriotism, citizenship, 
and commitment to excellence reflect the very best values of Central 
Texas. I join his friends and family in celebrating his outstanding 
achievements.
