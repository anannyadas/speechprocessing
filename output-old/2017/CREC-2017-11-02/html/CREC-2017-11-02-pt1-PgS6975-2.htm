                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, offered the following prayer:
  Let us pray.
  Eternal King, You are great and marvelous. Without Your wondrous 
deeds, our lawmakers, our Nation, and our planet could not survive. 
Lord, let the nations You have made acknowledge Your sovereignty.
  Continue to meet the needs of our Senators, providing solutions to 
their most challenging problems. Lord, teach them Your precepts so that 
they may walk in Your truth, experiencing the reverential awe that 
comes from Your presence. Make them wise and knowledgeable leaders. At 
their work, may they be diligent, ever striving through their 
faithfulness to please You. In their dealings with each other, may they 
be honest, courteous, and kind, never forgetting that You are the 
unseen guest in all of their deliberations.
  We pray in Your strong Name. Amen.
