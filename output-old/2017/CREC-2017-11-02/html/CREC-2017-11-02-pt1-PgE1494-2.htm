                    in the house of representatives

                       Thursday, November 2, 2017

  Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Jaswinder 
Sandhu of Sutter County, California, who has spent her career focused 
on improving the lives of people in her community. At a young age, she 
joined her farmworker parents in the fields to earn extra money during 
the summer. It was during those times that she realized the plight of 
the poor and became determined to make a difference.
   Jaswinder's passion to help others has always been her priority. 
Having left a job in the private sector in 2003, she began her career 
as Site Manager for Mahal Plaza, a low income multi-family farm labor 
complex in Yuba City. Since then, she's been credited with securing 
$313,000 in grant funding to build a safe passage route for children 
from Mahal Plaza as they walk to school. She also implemented several 
community programs and services at the property, including a community 
garden, day care, and ESL and exercise classes. She also offers Mahal 
as a venue for community gatherings such as the annual National Night 
Out, which is one of the most largely attended community events in Yuba 
City.
   A testament to Jaswinder's commitment to the community and her 
excellence in property management, she was honored as Site Manager of 
the Year for Farm Labor Housing for the State of California. In 2011 
and 2014 Jaswinder was presented with the national award for excellence 
in Washington, D.C.
