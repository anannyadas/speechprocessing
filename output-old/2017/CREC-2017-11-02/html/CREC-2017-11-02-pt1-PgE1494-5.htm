      HONORING JEFF GARNSEY, THE 2017 CLAYTON CITIZEN OF THE YEAR

                                 ______
                                 

                         HON. ELISE M. STEFANIK

                              of new york

                    in the house of representatives

                       Thursday, November 2, 2017

  Ms. STEFANIK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor and congratulate 
Jeff Garnsey as he is named the 2017 Clayton Citizen of the Year.
  Jeff began his long career of service to both his country and 
community upon entering the United States Navy in 1983. Throughout his 
26-year military career, he served on seven different submarines, one 
of which broke the endurance record under the North Pole by spending 97 
consecutive days submerged in water. He also served on the Navy's most 
decorated warship, the USS Parche, where his crew received the 
Presidential Unit Citation, as well as the USS Cheyenne, which 
participated in the Iraq war's first shots and strategic strike. Jeff 
was ultimately advanced to the Navy's highest enlisted paygrade of 
Master Chief Petty Officer.
  Now retired from his naval career, Mr. Garnsey is the proud owner of 
Garnsey's Classic Island Cruises and holds several leadership positions 
in the Clayton community, including Board President at Save The River 
and Director of the Muskie Hall of Fame. Truly committed to giving 
back, he also volunteers at many local organizations such as the 1000 
Islands Museum, the Clayton Rotary Club, the Clayton Opera House, and 
the Clayton Chamber of Commerce.
  I would like to thank Mr. Garnsey for the sacrifices he has made in 
serving our country and the people of the North Country. His commitment 
to others is a reminder of the strength that veterans bring to our 
local communities and sets a wonderful example for residents of New 
York's 21st District.
