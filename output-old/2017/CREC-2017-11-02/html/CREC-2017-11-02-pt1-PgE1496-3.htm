                  HONORING THE LIFE OF JEREMIAH GRANT

                                 ______
                                 

                       HON. DONALD M. PAYNE, JR.

                             of new jersey

                    in the house of representatives

                       Thursday, November 2, 2017

  Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, I ask that my colleagues join me to honor the 
life of Jeremiah Grant, an eight-year-old boy from my district who lost 
his life on October 28, 2017.
   Jerry was a student at the Ollie Culbreth Junior School in Jersey 
City, New Jersey. He excelled in academics and in the world of 
competitive jump rope. At only eight years old, Jerry was the youngest 
member of the Jersey City Honey Bees double dutch team. Earlier this 
year, the Honey Bees earned the title ``world champions'' at the 
American Double Dutch League's 44th International Competition.
   ``Jerry Prince Bee'', as his friends called him, was all smiles 
during his double-dutch performance on The Tonight Show in August. That 
smile and his legacy of love will live on in North Jersey.
