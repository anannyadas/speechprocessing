   HONORING PATRICIA DONNELLY AND THE AWARDEES OF THE 2017 LITERACY 
             COUNCIL OF NORTHERN VIRGINIA RECOGNITION EVENT

                                 ______
                                 

                        HON. GERALD E. CONNOLLY

                              of virginia

                    in the house of representatives

                       Thursday, November 2, 2017

  Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize the Literacy Council 
of Northern Virginia (LCNV) and to congratulate the volunteers, 
instructors, students, community partners, and others who will be 
recognized at the 2017 LCNV Recognition Celebration.
  The mission of LCNV is to teach adults the basic skills of reading, 
writing, speaking, and understanding English in order to empower them 
to participate more fully and confidently in their communities. LCNV 
serves low-literacy and limited English language proficient adults with 
a selection of low-cost, moderately intensive courses to help them 
transition into the workforce or other educational opportunities. LCNV 
provides the crucial first steps of language and literacy learning for 
workplace, citizenship, and community integration to help adults make 
measurable improvements in their lives.
  Each year LCNV gathers at its Annandale headquarters to recognize 
students and members of the community who have achieved exceptional 
milestones. I am proud to include in the Record the following 2017 LCNV 
honorees.
  Community Partnership Awards: Accenture Consulting, Crestwood 
Elementary School, Paul M. Engell Family Foundation.
  Volunteers of the Year: Liz Castillo, Alexandra Roncal, Valerie 
Sutter.
  I would also like to give special recognition to Patricia Donnelly, 
who is retiring from her role as Executive Director of LCNV after 
leading the organization for more than 15 years. She has three decades 
of experience in the nonprofit sector, most of which has been in 
education and the performing arts. In addition to her role as Executive 
Director of LCNV, Patti serves on the Board of the Virginia Literacy 
Foundation, the Virginia Adult and Continuing Education Board and 
WETA's Community Advisory Council. Her selfless efforts on behalf of 
others were recognized when she received the 2007 Nancy Jiranek Award 
for Leadership Excellence in Literacy. Though she may be retiring from 
her role as Executive Director, I am confident that she will continue 
to be engaged in our community and in the causes that are dear to her.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in thanking Patricia 
Donnelly for her service to our community and in congratulating each of 
the honorees of the 2017 LCNV Recognition Celebration. I wish all of 
them great success in all their future endeavors.

                          ____________________
