                       Thursday, November 2, 2017

  Mr. YOUNG of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and 
congratulate Collin Nelson of West Des Moines, Iowa for being named the 
West Des Moines Chamber's Emerging Citizen of the Year for 2017.
  The West Des Moines Chamber every year recognizes an Emerging Citizen 
of the Year, a community member under the age of 30 who ``demonstrates 
an unparalleled dedication to service and general betterment of the 
community.'' Collin works in the real estate business, and has been 
active in numerous metro area organizations that aim to better the 
community. These organizations include the West Des Moines Accelerate 
Advisory Committee, Downtown Des Moines Chamber of Commerce, Emerging 
Leaders Collaborative, the Iowa Commercial Real Estate Association, the 
Iowa Corporate Games, and the Multiple Sclerosis Society.
  Mr. Speaker, I'm proud to represent community leaders like Collin in 
the United States Congress and it is with great pride that I recognize 
him today. I ask that my colleagues in the United States House of 
Representatives join me in congratulating Collin for this outstanding 
achievement and in wishing him nothing but continued success.

                          ____________________
