                       Thursday, November 2, 2017

  Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize the 
100th anniversary of the Navy Pier and commemorate the beginning of the 
Pier's second century as a public community resource and treasured 
Chicago landmark. After 100 years of significant impact, Navy Pier has 
been reimagined and adopted the new mission: Navy Pier is the

People's Pier, Chicago's lakefront treasure, welcoming all and offering 
dynamic and eclectic experiences through partnerships and programs that 
inspire discovery and wonder; Navy Pier opened to the public in 1916 
and originally named ``Municipal Pier No. 2; Navy Pier was built under 
nationally-known architect Charles Sumner Frost, based on Daniel 
Burham's ``Master Plan of Chicago.'' Municipal Pier was the first of 
its kind to accommodate both the commercial shipping industry and 
recreation and entertainment for the public drawing over 3 million 
visitors annually.
  In 1917 it was adapted to house several regiments of soldiers, Red 
Cross, and ``Home Defense'' units and served as a barracks during World 
War I. It was officially renamed Navy Pier in 1927 as a tribute to the 
Navy personnel who were housed at the Pier during the conflict. From 
1941 to 1947, the Pier was leased to the U.S. Navy as a naval training 
center for 60,000 recruits. One of those pilots who qualified for 
military service was President George H. W. Bush.
  Navy Pier was the original home to the University of Illinois at 
Chicago from 1946 to 1965, and more than 100,000 students attended 
classes during that time. Dubbed `Harvard on the Rocks,' the University 
shared the space with the Chicago Police Department's Traffic Division, 
the North Pier Terminal Company, and several military detachments. The 
Pier was designated a Chicago historic landmark in 1977; between the 
years of 1978 through 1982, Navy Pier was host to ChicagoFest, a summer 
music festival full of food, fun, and festivities. ChicagoFest 
eventually grew to become the Taste of Chicago, drawing millions of 
guests to the Pier and spurring millions of dollars in economic impact.
  The Pier re-opened in 1995 following a $150 million redevelopment 
having improvements made to nearly every aspect of the three-quarter 
mile long public Pier. Since that renovation, year-round entertainment, 
shopping, dining, attractions and exhibitions have positioned the Pier 
as one of the most unique settings in the world; in July of 2011, Navy 
Pier, Inc., the newly formed nonprofit entity entrusted with the 
operation and redevelopment of Navy Pier put forth The Centennial 
Vision, a framework for reimagining Navy Pier as a unique public space 
and cultural mecca. The Centennial Vision's purpose is not only to 
expand the Pier's audience, but to enrich the experience of its guests. 
The Vision, divided into two phases, establishes a framework befitting 
Chicago, a world-class city, with a vibrant architectural, cultural, 
and recreational landscape and includes a 30-year Sustainable Master 
Plan to address the Pier's long-term environmental impact.
  With the completion of the Centennial Vision's ``Phase 1'' in 2016, a 
record 9.26 million guests enjoyed new amenities such as the state of 
the art Centennial Ferris Wheel, Chicago-centric food experience, 
redesigned south dock promenade with increased access to the waterfront 
and recreational boat experiences, and over 245 free public arts and 
cultural programs.
  As the Pier now enters ``Phase 2'' of the redevelopment with 
extensive plans to upgrade the built environment and Pier structures 
such as the Family Pavilion and Crystal Garden. In 2017, with the 
completion of 13-acre Polk Bros Park, the new Chicago Shakespeare 
Theater and expanded Chicago, Children's Museum, the Pier projects to 
see attendance increase by as much as 26 percent as guests enjoy 
innovative, free public programming, participatory arts, cultural 
showcases, and the Pier's sustainable, recreational footprint; and the 
Pier currently employees over 3,000 individuals, is home to 77 
businesses and 5 nonprofit organizations. The redevelopment is expected 
to generate 1,565 permanent and 1,659 temporary jobs across the city.
  I am honored to represent Navy Pier and congratulate Marilynn 
Gardner, President & CEO; Patrick Sheehan, Chief Development and 
Strategy Officer, the Board of Directors and the multitude of 
individuals working that make the Pier a fascinating and enjoyable 
destination. Enjoy this landmark celebration and always remember, ``To 
accomplish great things we must not only act, but also dream; not only 
plan, but also believe.''
