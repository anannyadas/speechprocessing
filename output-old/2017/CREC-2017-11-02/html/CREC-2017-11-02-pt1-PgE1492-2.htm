          2017 WOMAN OF THE YEAR AWARD WINNER--CHRISTINE PONCE

                                 ______
                                 

                          HON. JOHN GARAMENDI

                             of california

                    in the house of representatives

                       Thursday, November 2, 2017

  Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Ms. Christine 
Ponce of Woodland, California, who has dedicated 27 years to 
California's agricultural industry. She has worked cultivating many 
crops, ultimately becoming California's first female rice miller. In 
that role she managed many facets of rice production, ensuring that the 
plant operated at full capacity. In her 27 year career she overcame 
many challenges--from low wages to serious injury--and inspired many 
women that they too could pursue a career once considered only for men.
   A proud descendent of a Bracero, Ms. Ponce has strong ties to the 
California agricultural community. In her time as a rice miller she 
helped advocate for the rights of agricultural workers by serving the 
local chapter of the International Longshore and Warehouse Union. In 
addition to working long, demanding hours, she took time to serve as a 
secretary for the ILWU Local 150. Ms. Ponce's long and distinguished 
career has demonstrated her devotion to California's vibrant 
agricultural community.
