  Mr. YOUNG of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and 
congratulate Carrie Smith from Summerset Winery in Indianola, Iowa for 
being named the 2017 ``Winemaker of the year'' by the Iowa Wine Growers 
Association.
  Carrie has spent the last 10 years working at Summerset Winery, 
serving as winemaker and vineyard manager. She is responsible for 
making over 20 different wines every year. Carrie has been recognized 
at the local and national level for her winemaking prowess, winning the 
Dick Peterson award for best Iowa wine twice, along with numerous gold 
medal wines and other awards.
  Mr. Speaker, I am proud to represent Carrie, and Iowans like her, in 
the United States Congress and it is with great pride that I recognize 
her today. I ask that my colleagues in the United States House of 
Representatives join me in congratulating Carrie for this outstanding 
recognition and in wishing her nothing but continued success.

                          ____________________
