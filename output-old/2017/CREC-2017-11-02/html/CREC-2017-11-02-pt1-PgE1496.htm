                       Thursday, November 2, 2017

  Mr. CARTER of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the 
accomplishments of Staff Sergeant James Harrell, U.S. Marine Corps, who 
served his country and continues to selflessly serve his fellow 
veterans and his community following his retirement He is a fitting 
recipient of a Congressional Veteran Commendation.
  SSG Harrell served six years in the United States Marine Corps, 
including two tours in Vietnam. During his service, SSG Harrell was a 
recipient of numerous awards and recognitions, including the Marine 
Combat Action Ribbon. After being Honorably Discharged, SSG Harrell 
returned to Texas where he rose to become the Assistant Chief Deputy 
for Williamson County's Sheriff's Department.
  SSG Harrell's love for his country is matched only by his commitment 
to his fellow service members. After recognizing the needs of our 
county's less fortunate veterans, SSG Harrell joined his good friend 
Major Barry Richard, United States Air Force, Retired to help over 
twelve Williamson County veterans by rebuilding homes, bringing them up 
to code, doing repairs, and more for over five years. Together, they've 
made real and lasting impacts on the lives of their fellow veterans.
  SSG Harrell serves his fellow men with the same dedication, honor, 
and humility with which he defended his country. He exemplifies what it 
means to be an American, consistently placing his country and fellow 
men before himself. I thank and commend SSG Harrell, a passionate 
leader with a servant's heart, for his dedication and service.
