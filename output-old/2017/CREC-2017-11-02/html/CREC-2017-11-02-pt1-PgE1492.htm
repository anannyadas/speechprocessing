                        HONORING SCOTT RASMUSSEN

                                 ______
                                 

                           HON. JARED HUFFMAN

                             of california

                    in the house of representatives

                       Thursday, November 2, 2017

  Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise to pay tribute to Scott Rasmussen, 
an important member of my team for many years who will be leaving my 
office after this week to travel and pursue his varied interests.
  Scott is a native Californian who graduated from Brown University in 
2010, then returned to the Bay Area where he worked in the areas of law 
and technology. I was soon fortunate to have him join my campaign team, 
where he demonstrated the confidence, intellectual curiosity, 
diligence, and political instincts that have served him so well over 
the years I have known him--and which I am sure will continue to bring 
him success in the future.
  Scott helped to form the initial core of my congressional staff in 
2013, showing a willingness to pitch in and cover any topic that was 
thrown to him, from answering phones to tackling policy questions. Over 
the ensuing years, Scott has taken on new roles and regularly delivered 
results for my constituents and the planet. Notable successes include 
the passage of the Point Reyes Coast Guard Housing Conveyance Act, 
which will allow a former property in West Marin to be repurposed as 
affordable housing and community space, and his work on our successful 
bipartisan effort to strike a nearly half-century old congressional 
earmark that cost taxpayers millions of dollars each year to ship 
Pennsylvania coal 3,000 miles to American bases in Germany.
  With diligence and finesse, Scott has helped to develop a number of 
key legislative initiatives, and his intellect and maturity have 
allowed me to entrust him with sensitive foreign policy matters as 
well. Major projects have included my work to expand broadband access 
to rural communities, and our ongoing efforts to make sure that 
homeowners are protected from an unexpected tax bill when they work to 
reduce water use. Finally, he has worked on the tribal policy portfolio 
that is a priority in my office, helping to devise several complex and 
meaningful bills for the tribal members I represent.
  For six years I have had the benefit of Scott's good work, and I am 
deeply appreciative. Along with my family and my staff, I wish Scott 
the best of luck as he moves on the next phase of his career.
