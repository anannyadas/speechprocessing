  Mr. POCAN. Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record the following 
Proclamation in honor of the 175th Anniversary of Foley & Lardner LLP:
  Whereas, Foley & Lardner LLP is celebrating its 175th anniversary and 
has made a distinct impact in the state of Wisconsin through economic 
investment and community engagement; and
  Whereas, Foley & Lardner traces its roots in Wisconsin to 1842 when 
Asahel Finch and William Pitt Lynde opened the doors to their law firm 
in Milwaukee six years prior to Wisconsin gaining its statehood; and
  Whereas, the firm, from its humble beginnings, has grown along with 
the state of Wisconsin, expanding to the city of Madison, and becoming 
the state's largest law firm; and
  Whereas, Foley & Lardner opened an office in Washington, DC, in 1971, 
becoming the first Wisconsin law firm to open an office outside the 
state;
  Whereas, the firm has since expanded to include 19 offices in the 
United States, Belgium, and Japan; and
  Whereas, Foley & Lardner attorneys and staff have helped Wisconsin 
industries grow and thrive locally, nationally, and internationally; 
and
  Whereas, the firm's attorneys have served the state and its 
communities by providing leadership in elected offices and helping 
shape public policy; and
  Whereas, Foley & Lardner has played a significant role at critical 
times in our nation's history, including during the Civil War, the 
Great Depression, the New Deal; and
  Whereas, Foley & Lardner attorneys and staff are a pillar in the 
community, providing many hours of pro bono and volunteer efforts; now, 
therefore, I, U.S. Representative Mark Pocan, do hereby proclaim Foley 
& Lardner on this special 175th anniversary, a leading Wisconsin 
business, as well as a keystone to the ongoing growth and development 
in our congressional district.
  On behalf of the Second Congressional District of Wisconsin, I wish 
Foley & Lardner continued growth and success in the years ahead.

                          ____________________
