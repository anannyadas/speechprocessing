                          HONORING MOISES LOZA

                                 ______
                                 

                        HON. BENNIE G. THOMPSON

                             of mississippi

                    in the house of representatives

                       Thursday, November 2, 2017

  Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the 
retirement of Moises Loza.
  Moises Loza grew up in South Texas in a migrant farmworker family. 
During his childhood, he traveled with his family throughout the South, 
Midwest and West coast in search of farm-work. His first-hand 
experience of how hard families work to survive in this country is the 
perfect example of the families residing in Mississippi's Second 
Congressional District.
  In fact, while Loza served as Executive Director of the Housing 
Assistance Council--a national nonprofit corporation that works to 
increase the availability of decent housing for rural low-income 
people--he ensured the organization provided technical assistance, 
training and research to assist with housing development for low-income 
and hard-working families residing in the lower Mississippi Delta. Loza 
also serves in leadership roles on many housing related organizations.
  Currently, he serves as chairman of the Rural Development Leadership 
Network and treasurer of the National Low Income Housing Coalition. He 
also serves on the board of directors for the National Community 
Reinvestment Coalition, the National Housing Conference, the National 
Rural Housing Coalition, and the Morgan Stanley Advisory Committee.
  His selfless work to provide housing opportunities for families in 
need is something that we all should celebrate.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing a great 
public servant, Moises Loza, for his work to provide equal and fair 
housing.
