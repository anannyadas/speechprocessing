                             HON. DON BACON

                              of nebraska

                    in the house of representatives

                      Wednesday, November 1, 2017

  Mr. BACON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today with my colleagues in the 
Climate Solutions Caucus in recognition of a problem that concerns many 
of us--climate change.
  It is hard to deny that our climate is changing. Whether caused by 
cyclical weather changes or impacted by man's role, it is clear we are 
seeing changes in the polar ice and a rise in temperatures. It is one 
of my goals in Congress to keep the momentum we have seen in previous 
decades of continuing improvement in our environment. We all want to 
leave our planet cleaner for our children and grandchildren.
  It is my hope to advance the dialogue and advocate for more renewable 
and diverse energy sources. Top defense authorities, such as Secretary 
Mattis, have been vocal on how climate change has affected the DoD's 
threat assessments, resources, and operation readiness, but Congress 
must do more to combat this threat.
  As an incoming freshman in the 115th Congress, I have made it my 
mission to get things accomplished. I have joined the Bipartisan 
Climate Solutions Caucus, and have advocated for an incremental 
improvements approach to address climate change, while recognizing that 
the issue is a matter of national security. During the FY18 National 
Defense Authorization Act debate, I as well as some of my other House 
colleagues, led the charge to ensure adoption of Section 336, which 
recognizes climate change as a national security issue, and allows the 
DOD to assess its risks and determine next steps to mitigate such 
threats. This section ensures that the Armed Forces are prepared to 
handle the effects of a changing climate as it relates to military 
operations. By conducting studies within the Services and Combat 
Commands, DoD will be able to better understand the problem. Congress 
has a duty to ensure that the DoD is resilient and prepared for 
anything that may threaten its mission and operations and I hope to see 
the text of Section 336 in the final NDAA bill.
  It is in America's best interest to improve clean energy technology 
and expand production of renewable energies. Environmental practices do 
not need to come at the expense of economic growth though. We must 
encourage greater environmental stewardship amongst the private sector 
and foster economic success. Omaha now has 30 percent of energy from 
wind and it's growing. I support continued use of solar, ethanol, and 
sources of hydrothermal.
  As members of the Bipartisan Climate Solutions Caucus, we proactively 
seek pragmatic

solutions to address environmental concerns. It is a priority of mine 
to have all members recognize the impacts of climate change and our 
role to leave a cleaner planet for our children and grandchildren. I am 
committed to ensuring energy independence for our country and North 
America and ensuring that the use of renewable energy gains a larger 
share of our overall energy production.
