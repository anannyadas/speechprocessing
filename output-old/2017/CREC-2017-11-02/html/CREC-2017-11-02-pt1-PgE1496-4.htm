                    in the house of representatives

                       Thursday, November 2, 2017

  Mr. YOUNG of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and 
congratulate Bob Kaldenberg of Winterset, Iowa for being named the 
Rotarian of the Year by the Winterset Rotary Club.
  Bob has been a member of Rotary for 29 years. He worked hard to 
increase club membership in the early 1990's and many current members 
are active in the club and community because of his encouragement. He 
has been instrumental in the success of the Rotary youth exchange and 
has served as president twice.
  Mr. Speaker, I'm proud to represent community leaders like Bob in the 
United States Congress and it is with great pride that I recognize him 
today. I ask that my colleagues in the United States House of 
Representatives join me in congratulating Bob for this outstanding 
achievement and in wishing him nothing but the best.

                          ____________________
