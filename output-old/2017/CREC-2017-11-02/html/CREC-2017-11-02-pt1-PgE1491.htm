                       Thursday, November 2, 2017

  Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Jeannie Klever, 
who has an extensive record of service in Sutter County, California, 
which she has called home for the past 27 years. Jeannie embodies the 
qualities of a community activist and public servant, and we are proud 
to honor her today. Growing up in the 60's, Jeannie experienced a 
mixture of gender and racial inequalities which influenced and shaped 
her career choices. Her activism began at an early age when during 
school she protested an end to the Vietnam War. She also advocated for 
more on-site tutors for students of color and when met with opposition, 
Jeannie volunteered as a tutor through the rest of her school years. 
She strongly believes education was and remains the path out of 
poverty.
   Jeannie's desire to help families with special needs children was 
due to the challenges her family endured after her brother was 
diagnosed with severe autism. She operated a Family Resource Center 
that delivered support services and resources to families of low income 
and special needs adults and children. She taught self-advocacy for the 
local school's individualized education programs and medical service 
needs students.
   Jeannie's community and public service involvement is extensive. 
Jeannie has been a member of and continues to support several nonprofit 
organizations. For the past 15 years, she has sponsored an annual Art 
Contest for Sutter Union High School students. In 2008, Jeannie joined 
the local Democratic Party's central committee as a way to increase 
community engagement where she served three terms. In 2013, Jeannie 
joined the U.S. House of Representatives as my district representative 
serving Yuba and Sutter counties until her recent retirement.
   Jeannie continues to volunteer in the community and helps families 
in need when she can. Jeannie has learned to appreciate the art culture 
and enjoys mixed media arts as a way to relax. She and her husband Dale 
are enjoying family time with their children and two grandchildren.
