  Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Ms. Jody Samons 
of Willows, California, who has dedicated over 37 years to serving her 
community of Glenn County. She has touched the lives of countless 
people through her work and volunteer activities. In her current 
position as Glenn County's Community Development Director, Ms. Samons 
has secured over $200,000 in grants and worked with numerous companies 
to create over 200 new jobs in the area. Her overwhelming success in 
this role has had, and will continue to have, an undeniably positive 
impact on her community.
   In her volunteer capacities, Ms. Samons has worked to support the 
youth of her community by creating opportunities and guiding them to 
success. Ms. Samons was instrumental in the creation of the Orland High 
School Booster club which helped support youth athletic programs in her 
community. She has also spent many years supporting youth in FFA or 4-H 
programs in any way she could. Ms. Samons served for many years on the 
Glenn County Junior Livestock Auction Committee and went on to found a 
non-profit organization to support the program when its future was in 
jeopardy. She also served for 7 years on the Glenn County Fair Board 
and worked tirelessly to ensure its continued success. Ms. Samons has 
spent many years supporting the youth in her community and never passed 
up an opportunity to help out.
