  Mr. KELLY of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, today I rise in memory of 
fallen Mississippi soldier Army First Lieutenant (1LT) Robert Charles 
Oneto-Sikorski who gave his life while in service to our great nation 
on October 31, 2005, during Operation Iraqi Freedom. 1LT Oneto-Sikorski 
was killed when an improvised explosive device detonated near his 
dismounted patrol in Iskandariyah, Iraq. 1LT Oneto-Sikorski was 
assigned to the 1st Battalion, 155th Infantry, Mississippi Army 
National Guard, Biloxi, Mississippi.
  1LT Oneto-Sikorski was born on September I, 1972, in New Orleans, 
Louisiana, but called Bay St. Louis his home. According to the 
Associated Press, while 1LT Oneto-Sikorski was serving in Iraq, his 
home was flooded from the

storm surge caused by Hurricane Katrina. Despite his loss, Elaine 
Oneto, 1LT Oneto-Sikorski's mother, said her son looked to the future 
and talked about his homecoming which would have been in December 2005. 
``He was devoted to his children. He is so much more than any of us 
could say,'' Mrs. Oneto said. ``He was a wonderful man who loved 
everyone and his loss is going to devastate this whole community.''
  Patrick Rager, 1LT Oneto-Sikorski's son, recently said he will always 
be remembered for his service and sacrifice. ``I am proud of his 
service, and to this day, I strive to make him proud through hard work 
and getting good grades in school,'' Patrick said. ``Many people go 
through this life and have little to no impact. Because of his 
sacrifice, he will not be forgotten.''
  1LT Oneto-Sikorski was remembered by a fellow soldier on a memorial 
website. ``I was serving with Ski in Iraq. He was my XO and my close 
friend,'' SFC Gene Dufrene said. ``Ski was by far the best officer that 
anyone could serve with. He was what we NCOs called a real soldiers' 
officer. He would break his neck to take care of us. He took care of 
each and every soldier under his command. We all miss our brother and 
we will always remember Ski for the man he was to each of us 
soldiers.''
  1LT Oneto-Sikorski was employed at Northrop Grumman's Ingalls 
Shipyard in Pascagoula, Mississippi, where he worked in the engineering 
department.
  1LT Oneto-Sikorski was buried with full honors at the Biloxi National 
Cemetery.
  1LT Oneto-Sikorski is survived by his parents, Elaine Marie Oneto and 
Robert Charles Sikorski, II; his wife, Kristine Seamans Sikorski; his 
three children, Robert Charles Sikorski, II, Patrick Rager, and Hannah 
Rager; the mother of his children, Clare Rager; and his two sisters, 
Shawn Durfey, and Kathleen Sherlock.
  1LT Oneto-Sikorski demonstrated courage and bravery protecting the 
freedoms we all enjoy. His service and sacrifice for America will not 
be forgotten.
