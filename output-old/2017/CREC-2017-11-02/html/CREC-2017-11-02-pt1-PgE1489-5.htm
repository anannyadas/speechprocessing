                        REMEMBERING MR. GIDCUMB

                                 ______
                                 

                            HON. JAMES COMER

                              of kentucky

                    in the house of representatives

                       Thursday, November 2, 2017

  Mr. COMER. Mr. Speaker, I would like to recognize the passing of a 
very special individual and true patriot: Mr. Edward Earl Gidcumb. Mr. 
Gidcumb was 92 at the time of his passing on October 25, 2017. He was 
born in Harrisburg, KY, and raised by his maternal grandparents, 
Broughton Temple and Nancy Ann Cummins.
  Mr. Gidcumb attended Harrisburg Township High School, graduating in 
1943. And in 1965, he received his business degree from Paducah Junior 
College. During World War II, he served our nation honorably as a 
member of the U.S. Navy, holding rank of storekeeper second class. He 
was assigned to two different ships, the USS Indianapolis and USS 
Bottineau. He received an honorable discharge from the Navy in February 
1946.
  Mr. Gidcumb served in the Illinois National Guard for two years as a 
sergeant and squad Leader, was a member of the American Legion, and 
received several honors throughout his life, including being named Duke 
of Paducah, Honorary Patriot Guard Rider, and Honorary Mustang. In his 
military endeavors, he was also awarded six battle stars, an honor one 
should be immensely proud of. Mr. Gidcumb was truly an outstanding 
leader and contributor in both his military and civilian life.
  After his time in the military, Mr. Gidcumb retired as a purchasing 
manager at Westvaco. He also served as president of the National 
Association of Purchasing Managers. A participant and supporter of the 
Kentucky Veteran and Patriot Museum, many people from across the 
country had the opportunity to learn about his service to the U.S. But 
beyond his military and career accomplishments, many will remember Mr. 
Gidcumb as an avid golfer and also a professional trumpeter. He 
directed his own Big Band dance band, ``The Townsmen,'' for 30 years. 
The band played at numerous community events and regularly at First 
Baptist Church of Wickliffe. He enjoyed sharing his joy of golf with 
his friends, especially at Ballard County Country Club.
  I am honored to recognize the memory of an individual whose life 
represented such patriotism, civic engagement, joy and compassion. Mr. 
Gidcumb will not soon be forgotten, as his remarkable life of 
accomplishments, skills and experiences will live on.
