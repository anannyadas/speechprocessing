                                of texas

                    in the house of representatives

                       Thursday, November 2, 2017

  Mr. CARTER of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Sergeant 
Larry Bush, United States Marine Corps. SGT Bush's extraordinary 
commitment to his country, his community of Jarrell, Texas, and his 
service in the Marine Corps reflects the best values of Central Texas. 
He is a fitting recipient of a Congressional Veteran Commendation.
  SGT Bush began his career in the Marine Corps by serving in the 
Vietnam War in 1969. His deep commitment to serving his country can be 
seen through his extensive list of medals and awards, including the 
National Defense Service Medal, Vietnam Campaign Medal, Vietnam Service 
Medal, and the Rifle Expert Badge.
  After leaving the Marines in 1975, SGT Bush lived his life for the 
betterment of Jarrell and its citizens. He served his community in the 
City Council for six years, the Economic Development Board for two 
years, and as Mayor of the City of Jarrell since 2014. His commitment 
to community doesn't stop with elected office. SGT Bush is a devoted 
member of several advisory boards including water, roads and finances, 
as well as the Williamson County Road Bond Program. Committed public 
servants like him have made Jarrell a great place to live and work.
  SGT Bush deserves to be celebrated, as he is a man of intelligence, 
compassion, and integrity. With admiration and deep respect, I pay 
tribute to SGT Bush for his service to our country and the lasting 
impact he has had on his community and beyond.
