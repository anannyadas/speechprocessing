        2017 WOMAN OF THE YEAR AWARD WINNER-KATE MELLON-ANIBABA

                                 ______
                                 

                          HON. JOHN GARAMENDI

                             of california

                    in the house of representatives

                       Thursday, November 2, 2017

  Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Ms. Kate 
Mellon-Anibaba of Davis, California, who has made it her mission to 
bring people together in the name of tolerance and spread support for 
marginalized groups within her community. Following this year's attacks 
on Muslim communities throughout California, Ms. Mellon-Anibaba 
organized an event she called a ``Statement of Love.'' Her idea was to 
bring people together to show their support for Muslims in her 
community. In response to the hateful words and actions she saw 
directed at certain minorities, Ms. Mellon-Anibaba created her own 
demonstration of support, solidarity, and acceptance. She was 
determined to make a positive impact in her community, and she 
succeeded.
   Following a particularly disturbing attack on the Islamic Center 
right in her own community, she brought together over 1,000 people to 
show their support for their neighbors. She helped raise tens of 
thousands of dollars to help pay for repairs to businesses and places 
of worship targeted by hate-driven vandalism.
   Ms. Mellon-Anibaba brought people together to show their support, 
tolerance, and acceptance of a marginalized community within their 
community. Her message of peace, tolerance, and support has spread to 
surrounding communities and inspired similar demonstrations of 
solidarity. Her determination to bring her community together in the 
face of hatred is inspirational.
