 IN RECOGNITION OF THE 70TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE NEW JERSEY BROADCASTERS 
                              ASSOCIATION

                                 ______
                                 

                        HON. FRANK PALLONE, JR.

                             of new jersey

                    in the house of representatives

                       Thursday, November 2, 2017

  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the New Jersey 
Broadcasters Association (NJBA) as its members gather to celebrate its 
70th anniversary this year. This milestone and the NJBA's efforts to 
support radio and television stations in New Jersey are truly deserving 
of this body's recognition.
  Since its inception, the NJBA has represented the common interests of 
New Jersey's broadcasters. It continues to be the leading voice in 
Trenton, New Jersey and Washington, D.C. on broadcast issues and 
priorities and is an effective advocate on behalf of its member 
stations. In addition to its advocacy, the NJBA's training and 
educational programs are invaluable resources to radio and television 
stations and its understanding of compliance rules and procedures help 
its members navigate the changing broadcast landscape.
  Initiated by New Jersey radio stations, the NJBA's success is evident 
in its growth to include both radio and television stations throughout 
the state as well as several stations in New York City and 
Philadelphia. Its current President and CEO, Paul Rotella, maintains 
the NJBA's mission, while also adapting to meet the complex changes of 
technology in the broadcast field.
  Mr. Speaker, I sincerely hope that my colleagues will join me in 
marking the 70th anniversary of the New Jersey Broadcasters Association 
and recognizing its outstanding efforts to promote New Jersey's local 
broadcast stations.

                          ____________________
