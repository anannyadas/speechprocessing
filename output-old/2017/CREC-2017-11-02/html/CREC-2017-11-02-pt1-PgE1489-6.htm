  Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Mrs. Judith 
Holzapfel of Orland, California, whose leadership and civic spirit has 
no bounds. Her service to country and community began when she enlisted 
in the United States Air Force after having graduated from Marquette 
University with a degree in nursing. Following basic training, Judith 
was stationed at Beale Air Force Base where she met her husband. 
Following the birth of her son, she began her civilian career working 
in area hospitals.
   After pursuing further education, Mrs. Holzapfel eventually became 
Glenn County's school nurse and continued in that role for the next 30 
years. Her many years of work and

dedication has made a difference in health education and quality of 
life for thousands of students and their families.
   After retiring from her many years of service to Glenn County, Mrs. 
Holzapfel decided to continue her public services. She ran for a 
position on the Glenn County Board of Education, and won by an 
overwhelming majority.
   Mrs. Holzapfel is an active member of many community service 
organizations throughout the county and devotes her time to helping 
youth, veterans, and the impoverished. Above all, as a mother, 
grandmother, community activist, and veteran; Mrs. Holzapfel is 
passionate and dedicated to upholding the values of her family, and of 
her country.
