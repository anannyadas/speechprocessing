She earned this honor \nas the result of her civic leadership efforts as a language arts \nteacher at St. Cloud Technical High School.\n  But for Ayan, her work extends beyond the classroom and into the \ncommunity. She often speaks on panels or at events, and she was \nrecently a featured speaker at St. Cloud's TEDx event, where she spoke \nabout interpersonal communication.\n  We are lucky to have educators like Ayan who take their work into the \ncommunities they serve.
