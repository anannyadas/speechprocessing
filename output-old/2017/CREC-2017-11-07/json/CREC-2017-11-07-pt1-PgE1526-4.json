Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and legacy of \nSergeant La David T. Johnson, who was killed in action on Wednesday, \nOctober 4, 2017 while defending our nation as part of the 3rd Special \nForces Group in Africa. SGT Johnson was a true American hero and our \nthoughts and prayers go out to his friends and family as they mourn the \nloss of this great man.\n  Enlisting in the United States Army in January of 2014, SGT Johnson's \nlist of accomplishments runs long. After completion of Advanced \nIndividual Training, earning the Military occupational specialty 91B \nWheeled Vehicle Mechanic, he was assigned to 2nd Battalion, 3rd Special \nForces Group. He received numerous medals, including the Purple Heart \nand Meritorious Service Medal.\n  Men and women like SGT Johnson represent the best our nation has to \noffer. His selflessness allows us to enjoy the blessings of liberty \nthat have persevered for well over 200 years. When his country needed \nhim most, he stood ready to answer the call to serve our great nation.\n  Survived by a loving family, our country can never repay the debt we \nowe to SGT Johnson. He was a model citizen and soldier whose legacy \nwill live on forever. He will always be remembered and I will do \neverything in my power to honor his sacrifice.\n  Mr. Speaker, please join me today in commemorating the life of \nSergeant La David T. Johnson for his service to God and country.\n\n\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. HUDSON", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 3}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "181", "extension": true, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "E1526-E1527", "wkday": "Tuesday", "day": "7", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "IN MEMORY OF SERGEANT LA DAVID T.
