Mr. Speaker, I rise today to shed light on the appalling \nstate of our Nation's immigration detention centers.\n  Devoid of health services and basic medical standards, these ICE \nfacilities are cruel and inhumane. Suicide rates are high, children and \nfamilies are traumatized, and LGBT detainees are subject to alarming \nrates of abuse.\n  These centers are also very expensive. Daily operations cost $165 per \ndetainee, and $2 billion, annually, despite detention alternatives that \ncan cost as little as $9 a day.\n  Yet even with this track record, ICE funding has nearly doubled from \nthe Bush administration to today, and transparency has fallen by the \nwayside under the current administration, all while conditions continue \nto deteriorate.\n  Inhumane treatment of the undocumented cannot be rewarded with \nrepeated budget increases. It goes against our country's most \nfundamental values and cannot continue. We must cut ICE's budget until \nthese concerns are addressed.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. QUIGLEY", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "181", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H8532", "wkday": "Tuesday", "day": "7", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "INHUMANE TREATMENT OF THE UNDOCUMENTED CANNOT BE REWARDED", "id": "CREC-2017-11-07-pt1-PgH8532-6", "title": "INHUMANE TREATMENT OF THE UNDOCUMENTED CANNOT BE REWARDED"}
