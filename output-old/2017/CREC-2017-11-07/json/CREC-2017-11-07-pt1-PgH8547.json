Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, in response to the 2008 financial crisis, the Basel \nCommittee on Banking Supervision, an organization that, frankly, most \ncitizens might not have any idea exists, much less the effects and the \ninfluences on their banking lives, the Basel Committee on Banking \nSupervision agreed to modify internationally negotiated bank regulatory \nstandards, known as the Basel Accords. This was going to increase bank \ncapital requirements.\n  On July 9, 2013, the Federal banking regulators here in the United \nStates--including the Federal Reserve; the Federal Deposit Insurance \nCorporation, FDIC; and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, \nOCC--all issued a final rule to implement most of the so-called Basel \nIII recommendations, including modifications to capital requirements.\n  Basel III imposes new rules for high volatility commercial real \nestate, also known as HVCREs.\n  Unfortunately, we have a lot of acronyms in the Financial Services \nspace, but you will be hearing a lot about these HVCREs over the course \nof the next few minutes.\n  These HVCRE rules are those which the regulations characterize as \nloans that finance the acquisition, development, or construction of \nreal property. Loans that finance the acquisition, development, and \nconstruction of one- to four-family residential properties, projects \nthat qualify as community development investment, and loans to \nbusinesses or farms with gross revenue exceeding $1 million are exempt \nfrom this HVCRE classification.\n  In June of 2017, the Treasury Department released its first report in \nresponse to the President's February 2017 ``Core Principles for \nRegulating the United States Financial System,'' informing the \nadministration's perspective to regulate the financial system. The \nreport, entitled, ``A Financial System That Creates Economic \nOpportunities--Banks and Credit Unions,'' calls on regulators to \nsimplify and clarify the definition of these HVCRE loans to avoid the \napplication of excessively stringent postcrisis capital requirements \nand concentration limits related to such loans, but does not identify \nspecific language and changes.\n  Additionally, in September of this past year, the OCC, FDIC, and the \nFederal Reserve proposed a rule that attempted to simplify the \nregulatory capital calculations for these HVCREs. The proposal would \nchange the current definition of HVCRE and replace it with a new \ndefinition related to high volatility acquisition, development, or \nconstruction loans. HVADC is what it has been dubbed.\n  The complexity of the HVCRE definition and its uncertain application \nare making it difficult for banks to comply.\n  While we appreciate the various banking agencies' attempt at \nsimplifying the capital treatment of acquisition, development, and \nconstruction loans, their proposal actually broadens the number of \nloans subject to higher capital charge. This actually increases the \namount capital banks will be required to carry for these ADC loans--\nhardly a simplification.\n  Increases in risk weighting on these loans have had a significant \nimpact on institutions' capital ratios and, as a result, have increased \ncosts to borrowers. If a loan is classified as an HVCRE loan, the \nlender will face a lower return on its capital as a result of the \nhigher capital reserve requirement, meaning they are going to have to \nhold more capital. This will lead to increased pricing on the loan, \nincluding a higher interest rate for the borrower.\n  H.R. 2148, Clarifying Commercial Real Estate Loans, introduced by my \ncolleagues Representatives Pittenger and Scott, helps address the \nuncertainty related to the Basel capital rules and its impact on \ncertain acquisition, development, or construction loans. The bill \nclarifies the types of loans that should and should not be classified \nas HVCREs and which types of equity can be used to meet capital \nrequirements.\n  Currently, that uncertainty is creating confusion and affecting \ncommercial real estate ADC loans by increasing borrowing costs and \nreducing credit availability, which may be contributing to a slowdown \nin commercial real estate lending.\n  I commend the bipartisan works of Representatives Pittenger and Scott \non this important bill. Having passed the Financial Services Committee \nby an overwhelmingly bipartisan vote of 59-1, there is no reason that \nwe shouldn't have the same overwhelming bipartisan support for H.R. \n2148 today.\n  Mr. Speaker, I encourage all of my colleagues to vote in favor of \nH.R. 2148, and I reserve the balance of my time.\n\n", "turn": 4, "speaker": "Mr. HUIZENGA", "itemno": 12}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "K000380", "text": "  Mr. KILDEE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I also rise today to support H.R. 2148, and I want to \nstart by thanking the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. David Scott) and the \ngentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Pittenger) for their work on this \nbipartisan legislation, a bill that deals with capital rules for \ncommercial real estate loans, including acquisition, development, or \nconstruction loans.\n  It is critical that Federal bank regulators maintain the strong \ncapital rules that have been implemented after the enactment of Dodd-\nFrank. These rules have made the U.S. financial system much safer, \nwhile protecting consumers, investors, and taxpayers in promoting \nstable economic growth.\n  Unlike some proposals that have been introduced that would gut the \nregulatory framework of Dodd-Frank, I am pleased that this bill \nreasonably seeks to resolve a valid concern raised by community banks \nthat certain capital rules relating to high volatility commercial real \nestate, or HVCRE, loans are far too complex. This is an issue that \nfinancial regulators like the FDIC have also acknowledged must be \naddressed and must be fixed.\n  The problem, in fact, was highlighted in their Economic Growth and \nRegulatory Paperwork Reduction Act report, which was published earlier \nthis year.\n  In September, financial regulators released a proposal to revise the \ncapital rules to make the calculations more straightforward. This is a \ngood step in resolving this issue.\n  Although I am supportive of H.R. 2148, there are some concerns that I \nhave heard and that I can appreciate, including that it could provide \nfor more rigid definitions relating to capital rules.\n  The highly technical standards are important, though, to demonstrate \ncongressional intent. But Congress may not need to act, if bank \nregulators correct the problem on their own.\n  In addition, according to the FDIC Inspector General, commercial real \nestate loans generally account for more than one-third of community \nbank lending. The GAO found that failure of many small banks in the \nlast crisis were ``driven by credit losses on CRE\n\n\nloans, particularly loans secured by real estate to finance land \ndevelopment and construction.'' We have to be cautious, and we should \nbe sensitive to these risks.\n  Notwithstanding all of those legitimate concerns that we should keep \nin mind, I support this legislation and hope that it will send a clear \nsignal to the regulators that they should consider and address any \ncomments on their proposed rule without delay that is fully sensitive \nto the risks that I have discussed.\n  Importantly, in committee, Congresswoman Maloney offered an amendment \nthat I was pleased was adopted. This amendment better aligns this bill \nwith the regulators' proposed rule to fix this issue.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, H.R. \n2148, and I reserve the balance of my time.", "turn": 5, "speaker": "Mr. KILDEE", "itemno": 13}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "H001058", "text": "  Mr. HUIZENGA.

Mr. Speaker, I thank the \ngentleman for yielding and for his leadership on this and so many \nissues.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today to support H.R. 2148, which clarifies and \nsimplifies the capital rules for commercial real estate loans.\n  This bill addresses an important issue, which is that the capital \nrequirements for commercial real estate loans are overly complex for \nbanks and unnecessarily punish certain types of commercial real estate \nloans and, thereby, the overall economy.\n  I have had many community bankers and real estate developers complain \nto me about this, and I think that they have a point. Even the \nregulators agree that these rules are overly complicated and need to be \nsimplified, so there is broad consensus that this is a longtime, \nlegitimate problem that needs to be fixed.\n  I thank Chairman Hensarling and Ranking Member Waters for all their \nhard work on this issue. I also want to thank Mr. Pittenger and Mr. \nScott for working with me during this markup on an amendment to \nstrengthen the bill.\n\n  The current capital rules punish commercial real estate loans that \nare considered high volatility, by requiring banks to hold additional \ncapital against them. They have to hold capital worth 150 percent for \nthese high volatility loans, as opposed to the normal 100 percent for \nother commercial real estate loans.\n  These high volatility commercial real estate loans, or HVCRE loans, \nare usually made so that a borrower can purchase vacant or undeveloped \nland, which they then will build on or hold for a later time.\n  But the capital rules for these HVCRE loans were extremely complex \nand led to a great deal of confusion about which loans were considered \nhigh volatility and which were not.\n  The regulators finally did propose a rule to simplify the treatment \nof high volatility commercial real estate loans just a few weeks ago. \nThis bill addresses the same issue as the regulators' proposed rule by \nsimplifying the capital rules for commercial real estate loans.\n  I offered an amendment in committee that further aligned the bill \nwith the best parts of the regulators' proposed rule, which I think \nultimately strengthened and improved the bill. The bill would simplify \nthe capital rules by removing the so-called contributed capital \nrequirement, which requires very complicated calculations and forces \nbanks to project the value of the property years into the future, which \nis extremely difficult, if not impossible, to do.\n  Even the regulators have concluded that this entire contributed \ncapital requirement is unnecessarily burdensome and does not add \nprotection at all. Removing it will streamline the capital rules for \nbanks and make it easier to finance job-creating projects. The \nregulators have proposed to remove this entire requirement, and I \nagree.\n  Under current law, banks have to hold more capital when the property \nis vacant and not producing any income. So the bill clarifies that when \na property does start to produce sufficient income to cover the debt \nservice payments to the bank, then the loan is much safer, and thus is \neligible for capital relief, removing the 150 percent surcharge and \ngoing back down to 100 percent.\n  I think this bill is a very good, commonsense bill that fixes a \nlegitimate problem, and I urge my colleagues to support the bill. I \nbelieve it will make access to capital more fair and will get it out \ninto the community, creating jobs.\n  I congratulate all of my colleagues who were part of this process, \nand I support the bill.", "turn": 9, "speaker": "Mrs. CAROLYN B.
