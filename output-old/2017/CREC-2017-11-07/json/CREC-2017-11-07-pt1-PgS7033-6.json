Mr. President, on another matter, our complex Tax Code \nis in desperate need of reform, and we now have a once-in-a-generation \nopportunity to overhaul it. We all want an economy that reaches for its \nfull potential again. We all want to support small businesses and the \nmiddle class. Tax reform represents the single most important action we \ncan take today to advance goals such as these.\n  I have heard from many Kentuckians calling out for relief from our \noutdated and burdensome Tax Code. Listen to this small business owner \nfrom Murray, KY, who wrote to my office about his struggles under our \ncurrent Tax Code. This is what he said:\n\n\n\n\n\n       I am writing to stress the importance of tax reform for \n     small businesses. As a small business owner, I have been \n     saddle[d] with tax burdens since I began my business over 8 \n     years ago. Tax reform for small business and families need[s] \n     to be done immediately [so] we can have some economic hope \n     once again.\n\n  Small businesses just like this one are calling out for relief. So \nare families. So are middle-class workers all across our country. \nInstead of better opportunities, our Tax Code gives them a complicated \nweb of schedules, deductions, and regulations, a byzantine system that \nis easy for the wealthy and well-connected to exploit and impossible \nfor almost anyone else to understand. It is time for a system that \nactually helps the middle class succeed and actually encourages small \nbusinesses to grow, invest, and hire.\n  We want to help families plan for their future. We want to get the \neconomy going again and growing again. Most of all, we want to take \nmore money out of Washington's pockets and put more money in the \npockets of the middle class. To accomplish these goals, both the House \nand the Senate are continuing to move forward to deliver tax reform. \nYesterday, the House Ways and Means Committee completed its first day \nof discussing the House legislative proposal unveiled last week. That \nbill, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, builds upon the unified tax reform \nframework and reflects goals shared by President Trump, Republicans in \nthe House, and our conference here in the Senate--priorities shared by \nAmericans of both parties all across our country.\n  Later this morning, a group of Senators, administration officials, \nand tax reform advocates will highlight the benefits of relief for \nfamilies, small businesses, and the American economy. They will share \ntheir constituents' calls for tax reform.\n  As they do, the Senate Finance Committee will continue its work on \nthis important issue as well. Chairman Hatch will continue to lead the \ncommittee through an open process, giving members the opportunity to \nprovide their input, offer amendments, and work together to take \nanother big step forward.\n  I am grateful for the work of both Chairman Brady and Chairman Hatch \nto get us to this point. We still have a lot of work to do, but we are \ncommitted to passing tax reform to help our Nation's economy reach its \nfull potential.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. McCONNELL", "itemno": 0}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 1}], "header": {"chamber": "Senate", "num": "181", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "S7033-S7034", "wkday": "Tuesday", "day": "7", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "TAX REFORM", "id": "CREC-2017-11-07-pt1-PgS7033-6", "title": "TAX REFORM"}
