Mr. President, our EPA Administrator, Scott Pruitt, \nhas a little problem. You see, the Supreme Court has ruled that \ngreenhouse gases are pollutants under the Clean Air Act. Therefore, \nunder the Clean Air Act, the Environmental Protection Agency, which \nPruitt leads, is legally obligated to regulate greenhouse gases. They \nmust do this as a matter of law.\n  Moreover, the EPA has determined that greenhouse gas emissions \nendanger the public health and welfare of current and future \ngenerations, and Scott Pruitt has said he will not contest that \nendangerment finding. He is stuck with it. Why? Because he knows it is \na contest he would lose by a landslide. The climate denial nonsense he \nespouses has never passed peer review, it is not real science, and it \nwould get buried in any forum where facts and truth matter.\n  That is also likely why the White House released the Climate Science \nSpecial Report, part of the National Climate Assessment we mandated by \nlaw without significant alteration. Scientists had prudently disclosed \nwhat they sent to the White House so everyone could compare what went \ninto the White House with what came back out of the White House. That \nput the White House in a box, and caught in that box, the White House \nwent ahead and released the report without alteration.\n  The Climate Science Special Report affirms that climate change is \ndriven almost entirely by human action. It warns of a worst-case \nscenario, where seas could rise as high as 8 feet by the year 2100, \nwhich is the scenario our home State planners are looking at for Rhode \nIsland and which I know has occasioned dire forecasts for the Presiding \nOfficer's home State of Florida. The report details a wide array of \nclimate-related damage already unfolding across the United States. Here \nis what the report says: ``It is extremely likely that human influence \nhas been the dominant cause of the observed warming since the mid-20th \ncentury.'' The document reports: ``For the warming over the last \ncentury, there is no convincing alternative explanation supported by \nthe extent of the observational evidence.''\n  No convincing alternative explanation. Well, we actually knew that \nbecause climate denial has all along been bogus, phony propaganda \ncreated by the fossil fuel industry and pushed out through its array of \nphony front groups. Nobody but the ignorant would seriously believe \ntheir nonsense, least of all in Congress, except for the fact that the \npropaganda is backed up by ferocious political artillery and an \nimplacable fossil fuel industry position to deny, deny, deny as the \nship goes down.\n  This will be a disgrace whose odor will last a long time as history \nlooks back and recounts a Congress so subservient to the fossil fuel \nindustry that it would ignore unanimous real science and go instead \nwith the flagrant, self-serving falsehoods of the industry with the \nworld's biggest conflict of interest--an obvious plain conflict of \ninterest. It is a sickening display of what our Founding Fathers would \nplainly describe as corruption, and we are supposed to act as if things \nare normal around here. Things are not normal around here--not since \nCitizens United, for sure.\n  Things are also not normal at EPA. That Agency of the U.S. Government \nhas been corrupted. There is no straighter way to say it. The EPA now \nanswers not to the public interest but to the special interest of the \nfossil fuel industry through its new Administrator, Scott Pruitt, whose \nentire history is one long exercise in subservience to the fossil fuel \nindustry. If he is not bad enough, check out the creepy coterie of \nfossil fuel lackeys he is surrounding himself with. It is another \ndisgrace, but given the fossil\n\n\nfuel's control over Congress, the legislative branch is compliant and \ncomplicit in the industry takeover, and this body has yet to utter a \npeep of dissent as our national EPA sinks into banana republic status.\n  Last week, I talked about the phony tricks Pruitt is using to undo \nthe Clean Power Plan. The Clean Power Plan is an annoyance to certain \nfolks in the fossil fuel industry that has long underwritten Pruitt's \npolitical ambitions. So for their sake, something had to be done. Well, \ngiven the Climate Science Special Report that the White House just \nreleased, they couldn't really mess with the science--at least not \nwithout it blowing up in their faces--so they reverted to some tricks.\n  One trick was to recount the cost-benefit calculations of climate \nchange and count only domestic effects of an international danger. Now, \nthe Climate Science Special Report the White House just released says: \n``The climate of the United States is strongly connected to the \nchanging global climate.''\n  Nevertheless, Pruitt made the decision to count only the domestic \neffects of domestic emissions. That trick neatly wipes a major fraction \nof the harm the fossil fuel industry is causing right off the books. It \ndoesn't affect the actual harm, just the accounting of the harm. In my \nexample, it wiped two-thirds of the harm off the books in a neat feat \nof accounting trickery.\n  Of course, that still leaves one-third of the harm to account for so \nthey took another whack at that, and their trick there was to juice the \ndiscount rate. In years to come, prompt action now on climate change \nwould prevent things like sea level rise washing over our coastal \ninfrastructure, unprecedented wildfire seasons burning our forests, and \ndisruptions in agricultural yields from drought and flood extremes. The \nClean Power Plan would achieve between $14 billion and $34 billion in \nfuture health benefits, also, like prevented illnesses and deaths, but \nall those things happen in the future, which brings in this matter of \nthe discount rate.\n  The discount rate discounts the present value of things that happen \nin the future based on a percentage. Here is a simple example. If you \nassume a discount rate of 5 percent, that means anything 1 year from \nnow is worth 5 percent less than it would be right now. So $10,000 of \nsomething in 10 years would be worth $6,000 today. If you assume a \ndiscount rate of 10 percent, that means $10,000 of something in 10 \nyears is only worth $4,000 today. You can jiggle the discount rate to \nlower the present value. The higher the discount rate, the lower the \npresent value of future harms.\n  A report this year from the National Academies of Science confirms \nthis: ``The rate at which future benefits and costs are discounted can \nsignificantly alter the estimated present value of the net benefits of \nthat rule.''\n  Now, the George W. Bush administration recognized that ``[s]pecial \nethical considerations arise when comparing benefits and costs across \ngenerations.'' The Bush administration guidance urged lower discount \nrates when a rule is expected to harm future generations. I will quote \nthem again. ``If your rule will have important intergenerational \nbenefits or costs, you might consider a further sensitivity analysis \nusing a lower but positive discount rate,'' wrote the Office of \nPersonnel Management at the time.\n  That describes exactly what we face with climate change. Our carbon \npollution today will hurt generations far off in the future as, for \ninstance, temperatures and sea levels inexorably rise decade after \ndecade and properties and land are lost to the sea.\n  In 2015, the Federal Government settled on a 3-percent discount rate \nto estimate the out-year costs of carbon pollution to society. That was \nthe recommendation of leading economists, the top researchers from top \nuniversities putting forward credible analysis from the scientific \ncommunity.\n  In our new, industry-friendly Pruitt analysis, they jacked that rate \nfrom 3 percent up to 7 percent. They more than double it. There is \nlittle actual analysis. They just picked a higher rate and what a \npayoff for Pruitt's fossil fuel friends. At 7 percent, future harms, \ninjuries, and losses count for far less. Indeed, with this trick, \nPruitt wiped away nearly $18 billion in predicted harm from carbon \npollution. Remember, again, nothing changes in the real world. The harm \nto future generations is unchanged. That is a given in either scenario, \nbut like that domestic-harm-only trick, this is an accounting trick to \nhelp the fossil fuel industry dodge accountability for its pollution. \nIt doesn't change the situation on the field; it just changes the score \non the scoreboard.\n  Contrast the Pruitt fossil fuel-friendly nonsense with real, peer-\nreviewed science. In real, peer-reviewed science, we can now calculate \nnot only the harm of carbon pollution but how much individual fossil \nfuel companies have contributed to that harm. A peer-reviewed study in \nthe scientific journal Climatic Change tells us that a few major fossil \nfuel producers are responsible for as much as half of the recorded \nglobal surface temperature increase, and the study demonstrates a \nmethod for attributing their corporate share of the harm to Chevron, \nExxonMobil, ConocoPhillips, Peabody Energy, Arch Coal, Devon Energy, \namong about 50, investor-owned carbon producers. You can take the \nemissions data from that climatic change study and factor in well-\nestablished social cost of carbon estimates and approximate individual \ncorporations' responsibility for climate damages. Those companies ought \nto be taking a hard look at what they are reporting to their \nshareholders about this because they are under strong legal obligations \nto report out-year risks to their shareholders.\n  The National Climate Assessment Climate Science Special Report that \nwe first talked about was developed by dozens of leading scientists, \nfrom 13 different Federal agencies, detailing the extent of climate \nchange driven by manmade greenhouse gas emissions and the urgent need \nto address it. That report is as solid as it gets. The report is stark. \nTemperatures are climbing. Seas are rising. Ocean waters are becoming \nmore acidic. Fires are more frequent and more severe, and fire seasons \nare longer. Storms are stronger and more frequent, as we have seen \nparticularly menacing coastal America.\n  Downwind States like Rhode Island cope with air that carries more \nparticulate matter, nitrogen oxide, and other lung-constricting \npollution.\n  Fishermen haul in foreign catches full of fish their fathers and \ngrandfathers would hardly recognize. Woodsmen harvest in distressed and \nchanging forests. Farmers till land subject to extremes of both more \nfrequent drought and more severe flood.\n  The inescapable science is compiled by the top experts from \nthroughout the Federal Government and is concurred in, I believe, by \nevery single State university in this country, which not only \nunderstand climate change, but they teach climate change. There is \nevery single National Lab in this country--the Labs we fund and trust--\nthe armed services, and our national intelligence assessments. It is \nvirtually impossible to find anyone not on the payroll of the fossil \nfuel industry who disputes this. It shows that climate change touches \nevery corner of the country already, not later.\n  Up against that study, up against that unanimity of legitimate \nscience, Pruitt puts a bunch of accounting tricks cooked up for him, I \nbelieve, by a conflicted and corrupting industry.\n  We cannot let fossil fuel hacks like Pruitt and his merry crew \nprevent America from responding to the reality around us.\n  This week it has been reported that Nicaragua and Syria have joined \nthe Paris climate agreement. They were the two outliers. That was the \ncompany the United States was in with President Trump's decision to \nremove us from the Paris climate agreement--Nicaragua, Syria, and the \nUnited States of America. That is some company. Now, even Nicaragua \nand, just today, Syria have joined. At some point our national \nreputation is put at hazard. Our national reputation is put on the line \nwhen we can't do what is obviously right because we can't tell one \ngreedy industry: You have had enough--no more.\n  It is time we treated this issue honestly. When we can't do that, \ndon't tell me history will forget. It seriously is time to wake up. \nThis is corruption in plain view.\n  I yield the floor.", "turn": 4, "speaker": "Mr. WHITEHOUSE", "itemno": 4}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
