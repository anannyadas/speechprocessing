Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize \nNancy and Gary Stewart, the owners of Sandwich Depot in my hometown of \nConcord, New Hampshire. Through hard work and dedication, Nancy and \nGary, along with their employees, created a truly special place in our \ncommunity.\n  Sandwich Depot opened for business over 28 years ago. In the time \nsince, they have turned an inconspicuous building on the side of Hall \nStreet into one of the best sandwich shops in the state. Over the \nyears, a lot has changed in Concord, but one thing has remained the \nsame: if you want a world-class breakfast or lunch, you can find it at \nthe Sandwich Depot. Gary has an uncanny ability to remember customers' \nnames, and his warm smile and humor make any visitor feel welcome. \nNancy cooks and assembles sandwiches that leave everyone full and \nsatisfied. The shop is covered in historic pictures of Concord and \nlocal antique signs, which add to the sense that the Depot is a \nuniquely Concord institution.\n  My family, friends, and staff--as well as everyone in the Concord \ncommunity--will all miss the Sandwich Depot, but we are confident that \nNancy and Gary will continue to make wonderful contributions to the \nConcord area in the years to come.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Ms. KUSTER of New Hampshire", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 3}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "181", "extension": true, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "E1526", "wkday": "Tuesday", "day": "7", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "IN RECOGNITION OF NANCY AND GARY STEWART, AND THEIR SHOP, SANDWICH DEPOT, A CONCORD INSTITUTION", "id": "CREC-2017-11-07-pt1-PgE1526", "title": "IN RECOGNITION OF NANCY AND GARY STEWART, AND THEIR SHOP, SANDWICH  DEPOT, A CONCORD INSTITUTION"}
