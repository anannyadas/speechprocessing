Mr. Speaker, I rise today to share the amazing story of \nRick Corman, the hardworking, hard-charging founder of R.J. Corman \nRailroad Group in Nicholasville, Kentucky, in my district. Rick's life \nstory is an example of the American Dream, and his tireless spirit, \ngrit, determination, and generosity benefited not only the employees of \nR.J. Corman, but an entire community.\n  Unfortunately, because of America's broken Tax Code, the abilities of \nentrepreneurs like Rick are compromised, and the estate tax, in \nparticular, threatens the future ability of the R.J. Corman Railroad \nGroup to continue to drive economic growth, employment, and charitable \ngiving in Kentucky.\n  This story is timely. As Congress takes on the task of reforming our \nbroken Tax Code over the next few weeks, critics will undoubtedly \nprotest that this plan is a tax cut for the rich, and they will cite \nour changes to the estate tax as an example. But as the story of Rick \nCorman reveals, the estate tax is not a tax on the wealthy as much as \nit is an unfair penalty on hard work, jobs, charity, upward mobility, \nand the American Dream.\n  In 1973, after growing up in a low-income, five-room house with no \ninterior bathroom, Rick Corman started his company immediately \nfollowing high school graduation with nothing more than a dump truck, a \nbackhoe, and a tenacious spirit. Driven by his remarkable operator \nskills, and then by his commitment to safe and reliable service, Rick \nwas able to become a trusted provider in the railroad industry.\n  But his success would not have been possible without the assistance \nearly in his career from Luther Deaton, a community banker for what is \nnow called Central Bank in Kentucky. As Rick grew his company, he faced \ndebts and cash flow problems. He struggled to get a loan. As Luther \nsaid: He had a good company; he just faced a cash crunch.\n  But Rick invited Luther to the site of a coal train derailment inside \na tunnel in the middle of the night to show his work; and Rick, \nrecalling the episode, laughed because he had gotten his banker filthy \nand covered in coal dust. But after that experience and seeing how hard \nRick worked, Luther knew that this man would not fail. So Rick was then \nable to secure character-based loans that allowed his company to thrive \nbecause his community banker was willing to take a risk on him based on \nwhat he knew about his business and Rick's drive to succeed.\n  Today, this type of loan would never be allowed under the overly \nrestricted Dodd-Frank law, but those loans proved to be essential for \nthe growth of Rick's company and ultimately highly profitable for the \nbank.\n  Without access to capital, today's entrepreneurs are prohibited from \ndoing what Rick Corman did. Over 40 years he grew his company into what \nis today known as R.J. Corman Railroad Group, continuously investing \nprofits back into his business, into its workers, and into the \nsurrounding community.\n  Today, R.J. Corman has field offices in 23 States. The company serves \nall seven class I railroads, many regional and short line railroads, as \nwell as various rail-served industries.\n  Rick grew the company into what it is today by treating all of his \nworkers well, working alongside them, and never asking them to do a job \nthat Rick himself was unable or incapable of doing himself. The \ncompany's diversity and investment in people gave it the ability to \nservice all aspects of the freight railroad industry at any scale. The \ncompany has been critical to restoring service when class I railroads \nare devastated by flooding or storms like Hurricanes Katrina, Harvey, \nor Irma.\n  But now the future success of this company is threatened by the \nestate tax, also known as the death tax. In 2013, Rick Corman passed \naway after a heroic 12-year battle with cancer. It resulted in the \ntransfer of his life's work to a living trust. More than anything, Rick \nhad an intense appreciation for the hard work and loyalty of his \nemployees who had been and continue to be an integral part of the \ncompany's success, and he wanted to ensure that he protected their jobs \ninto the future.\n  Since Rick's passing, the trust has continued to reinvest cash into \nthe company, as he intended, and the company continues to operate and \nhelp those who have benefited from it. The company has invested nearly \n$110 million in capital assets, and employment has grown by 53 percent, \nnearly 450 jobs. The company has donated more than $2.5 million to \ncharitable causes since Rick's passing.\n  But due to the estate tax, the company has yet to feel the full \nimpact of the tax. But starting in 2019, nearly 30 percent of its \nannual cash flow will be pulled from the company as a result. This will \nsignificantly impact R.J. Corman's ability to create jobs, \npurchase equipment, and donate to charity. The leadership of the \ncompany now tells me that the government will actually lose revenue \nbecause the company will not be able to grow and create jobs that would \nproduce more revenue than the estate tax will produce.\n\n  This is an example of why it is so important we end this unfair tax. \nThe death tax destroys intergenerational small businesses and family \nfarms throughout the Nation owned by people who started with literally \nnothing and worked their entire life to build a successful company and \njobs.\n  So as we look at the estate tax and tax reform in the coming weeks, I \nhope my colleagues will remember the story of Rick Corman. These \nfamilies and these businesses should not have to fear triple taxation \nfrom Washington just because someone passes away.\n  Our bill immediately delivers relief from this tax, and I hope that \nwe will pass a repeal of the estate tax to honor entrepreneurs, job \ncreators, and philanthropists like Rick Corman.\n", "turn": 1, "speaker": "Mr. BARR", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "181", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H8531", "wkday": "Tuesday", "day": "7", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "THE ESTATE TAX", "id": "CREC-2017-11-07-pt1-PgH8531", "title": "THE ESTATE TAX"}
