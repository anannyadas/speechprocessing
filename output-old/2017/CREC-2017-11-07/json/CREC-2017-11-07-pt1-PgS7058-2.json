Mr. President, today, I wish to recognize and honor the \nextraordinary service of retired U.S. Army COL Roger Peterman, a \nGreenwood, IN, resident and dedicated veteran and public servant who \nserved his country with honor.\n  In 1967, Roger Peterman enlisted in the Army National Guard. He \nserved in the field artillery in both enlisted and officer positions. \nHe eventually moved through the ranks and rose to command two artillery \nbatteries, an artillery battalion, the 38th Division Artillery, and \nheld numerous staff assignments before retiring in March 2000.\n  Colonel Peterman's Army service was one of distinction, as evidenced \nby his numerous awards and decorations, including the Legion of Merit; \nMeritorious Service Medal with two oakleaf clusters; Army Commendation; \nArmy Achievement Medal; and the Army Reserve Component Achievement \nMedal with a silver oakleaf cluster and two bronze oakleaf clusters. In \n2012, he was presented the Office of the Secretary of Defense Medal, \nand in 2014, the National Guard Association of the United States \nawarded him the Distinguished Service Medal. In addition, Colonel \nPeterman was recognized with the Ancient Order of Saint Barbara Medal \nby the U.S. Field Artillery Association.\n  Colonel Peterman has distinguished himself beyond his military \nservice. The transition from the military to civilian life can be a \ndifficult one for our veterans. We are grateful for Roger's post-\nmilitary service mission to help veterans and military families through \nthat transition with his work as a transition assistance adviser with \nthe Indiana National Guard. Roger is also chairman of the Board for \nOperation: Job Ready Veterans, which aims to prepare our veterans for \nsuccess in civilian employment; the Indianapolis Veterans Court \nAdvisory Board; the Indiana National Guard Relief Fund; the American \nLegion; and AMVETS. Roger also serves on the board of directors for the \nIndiana chapter of the Association of the United States Army and is on \nthe executive board of Indiana Blue Star. As Roger enters his \n``second'' retirement, we thank him for his dedication and service to \nhelping Indiana's veterans.\n  Colonel Peterman's life has set an example not just for his two \nchildren and six grandchildren but for all Hoosiers. His commitment to \ndefending our country and supporting our veterans is commendable. His \nintegrity and tireless efforts have helped to make Indiana and this \ncountry a better place to live, work, and raise a family. We thank \nRoger's wife Carolyn, children, and grandchildren for sharing him with \nour country. We wish Roger well in retirement.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. DONNELLY", "itemno": 0}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 1}], "header": {"chamber": "Senate", "num": "181", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "S7058", "wkday": "Tuesday", "day": "7", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "TRIBUTE TO COLONEL ROGER PETERMAN", "id": "CREC-2017-11-07-pt1-PgS7058-2", "title": "TRIBUTE TO COLONEL ROGER PETERMAN"}
