Mr. Speaker, I rise today to share the story of Marco, \na DREAMer in Portland, Oregon, and to continue to urge Speaker Ryan to \nput forth a clean Dream Act bill.\n  In 1995, Marco was brought to the United States when he was only 3 \nyears old. As a teenager with dreams of going to college, Marco \nrealized he didn't qualify for financial aid because of his immigration \nstatus, but he did not allow this to deter him. Instead, Marco worked \nhard in various minimum wage jobs, allowing him the ability to attend \ncollege part-time.\n  In 2012, after applying for DACA, Marco was granted a work permit, \nmaking it possible for him to earn a job with a law firm in Portland, \nwhere he worked his way up from the mailroom to be a legal assistant. \nHis salary from the law firm enabled him to enroll in more classes and \nfinally complete his bachelor's degree in accounting.\n  Marco now works as an accountant for an Oregon nonprofit that helps \nbenefit youth.\n  This President claims to want only the best. I have news for him: we \nalready have the best and brightest, and it is time we stopped treating \nthem like second class citizens.\n  Mr. Speaker, we need to pass a clean Dream Act bill.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. SCHRADER", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 3}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "181", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H8583", "wkday": "Tuesday", "day": "7", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "WE NEED TO PASS A CLEAN DREAM ACT NOW", "id": "CREC-2017-11-07-pt1-PgH8583-2", "title": null}
