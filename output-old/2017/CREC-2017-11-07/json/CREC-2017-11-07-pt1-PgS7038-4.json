Mr. President, in recent months, the United States and \ncoalition forces have achieved major gains against Iraq and Syria. \nBuilding upon the retaking of Mosul in July, U.S. coalition partners \nhave liberated ISIS's former capital of Raqqa in Syria, the pocket of \nHawija in northern Iraq, and, just days ago, the border town of al-Qaim \nin western Iraq. The so-called caliphate that terrorists claimed would \noverrun the Middle East is now a shadow of its former self--a shrinking \nswathe on a map once defined by an open reign of terror.\n  Unfortunately, however, our challenges in the region remain daunting \ndespite these hard-fought tactical victories. Our relentless focus on \ndestroying ISIS, which is, of course, essential, has obscured a \ntroubling reality: The United States lacks a clear comprehensive \nstrategy that addresses the Middle East in all of its complexity.\n  This is part of the unfortunate legacy the Obama administration left \nfor its successor, but nearly 1 year into the Trump administration, we \nlack clarity on essential questions about our Nation's role, and we are \nleft to observe as bystanders the intensifying symptoms of a collapsing \nregional order. While in some cases we are bystanders who take action, \nwe do so with unclear and often unstated objectives.\n  The United States has committed to the sale of over $100 billion of \nweapons to Saudi Arabia. We have announced an outline of strategy to \ncounter Iran while providing only minimal detail. We remain \nconspicuously silent on the future of our role in Iraq and Syria beyond \neliminating ISIS, as the Assad regime and its partners consolidate \npower.\n  Our power and influence is diminishing in the Middle East as a result \nof our lack of direction, and the vacuum has been filled by forces \nworking contrary to American interests. Consider the events that have \nswept the region in recent months.\n  In Iraq, Iranian forces are working to sow discord as we recently saw \nin Kirkuk, where the presence of the Quds Force commander, Qassem \nSoleimani, exacerbated tensions among the Kurds and the government in \nBaghdad. Iranian-backed militias continue to gain power and aim to turn \nnext year's election into a setback that drives American influence out \nof Iraq. Meanwhile, the scourge of ISIS remains despite recent military \nsuccesses. The terrorist attack last week in Manhattan shows its \npersistent appeal. Its rise in the wake of U.S. withdrawal years ago \ndemonstrates the danger of leaving before winning the peace.\n  Across the border in Syria, the Assad regime, backed by Russia, Iran, \nHezbollah, and an array of militias, has retaken most of the country, \nincluding many eastern areas that are strategically important. The \nconsequences of the resulting humanitarian crisis have spilled beyond \nits border for years, destabilizing nations far beyond Syria and paving \nthe way for radicalization. Forces that are hostile to both our \ninterests and our values are shaping the future on the ground while we \nremain silent, focused on the immediate defeat of ISIS.\n  I want to emphasize, we want to defeat ISIS. We are defeating ISIS, \nbut that is not our only goal in the Middle East.\n  On Saturday, the Lebanese Prime Minister, Mr. Hariri, resigned, \nclaiming that he faced death threats from Iran, leaving the United \nStates with one less valuable partner in a divided government in which \nHezbollah plays a major role. I happen to have become friends with Mr. \nHariri over the years. He is a good, pro-democratic, outstanding \nindividual who basically was forced out of office.\n  A web of Iranian proxies and allies are spreading from the Levant to \nthe Arabian Peninsula, threatening stability, freedom of navigation, \nand the\n\n\nterritory of our partners and allies, including with advanced \nconventional weapons. Iran itself continues to menace its neighbors, \nuse its sanctions relief windfall to harmful ends, test ballistic \nmissiles, and spread weapons throughout the region.\n\n  According to our allies and partners, just days ago, Houthi rebels in \nYemen launched an Iranian-provided missile at the airport in Riyadh. \nMeanwhile, our Arab allies are embroiled in infighting and diplomatic \ndisputes that weaken regional cooperation and coalition efforts in the \nface of these pressing threats.\n  Saudi Arabia itself is in the midst of monumental change. The recent \nappointment of a new Crown Prince, the arrest over the weekend of a \nnumber of prominent Saudi citizens, and the Kingdom's ongoing war in \nYemen, which has spawned a humanitarian crisis of its own, indicate a \nforcefulness that promises progress but also raises concern about \ninternal stability and regional conflict. Ultimately, it could serve to \nstrengthen Saudi rivals.\n  In Turkey, President Erdogan continues to consolidate power, abuse \nhuman rights and the rule of law, and stifle democracy, while growing \ncloser to Russia and straining the relationship with NATO. Meanwhile, \nVladimir Putin's Russia casts a long shadow throughout the region as it \nreestablishes itself as a power broker hostile to American interests \nand wholly unconcerned about human rights.\n  These challenges are daunting, confusing, and complex, borne of years \nof neglect, punctuated by crises and aggravated by weeks filled with \nthe events of decades.\n  The questions a comprehensive strategy must address are formidable: \nWhat are our political and military objectives in the region? How \nshould we prioritize our pursuit of objectives given the numerous \nregional challenges, and how should we measure our success? What roles \nand responsibilities should our allies and partners play, and what \nsupport will they need to do so? What should be the size, roles, \nmissions, and capabilities of U.S. forces in the region, whether in \nIraq, Turkey, the Persian Gulf, or elsewhere? How will the United \nStates facilitate humanitarian relief, stabilization, reconstruction, \nand political reconciliation where possible?\n  These questions--many of which we require the President and \nDepartment of Defense to answer in the National Defense Authorization \nAct--are not academic.\n  The United States is not involved in the Middle East because we labor \nunder the illusion that our presence will solve every problem but \nbecause the stability of the region is vital to our national interests \nand international security alike. Middle Eastern instability tends to \ntravel far beyond its borders. The region's importance to the global \neconomy that Americans benefit from and depend upon cannot be \nunderestimated, but if we keep sleepwalking on our current trajectory, \nwe could wake up in the near future and find that American influence \nhas been pushed out of one of the most important parts of the world, \nand that we cannot abide.\n  The world faces an unprecedented array of challenges, of which \ninstability in the Middle East is only one. Most importantly, the \nUnited States faces growing threats from Russia and China, both of \nwhich are eager to tilt the balance of power in Europe and Asia toward \nthem rather than toward us and the majority of the world that favors \ngreater freedom and openness.\n  We need to prioritize these critical challenges by rebuilding \nmilitary readiness, reorienting our force structure, investing in \nneeded capabilities to deter near-peer competitors, and strengthening \nour alliances with like-minded partners and allies.\n  If we neglect to consolidate our gains against ISIS and address the \nthreats to American interests throughout the Middle East, our gains \nwill easily be overtaken. As my friend and former Secretary of State \nGeorge Schultz once observed, ``If you have a garden and want to see it \nflourish, you have to tend to it.'' We could find ourselves enmeshed in \nconflicts far more costly in lives, power, and opportunity if we \nneglect to care for a particularly frustrating part of the world.\n  Our elected leaders must articulate a comprehensive strategy that \nreflects these judgments with specificity and detail rather than \npiecemeal offerings and tactical victories. Congress, with our \nconstitutional role as a coequal branch of government, and, more \nimportantly, the American people, deserve no less.", "turn": 3, "speaker": "Mr. McCAIN", "itemno": 4}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, today the Senate will confirm Steven \nEngel to serve as Assistant Attorney General for the Office of Legal \nCounsel.\n  The Office of Legal Counsel, which we refer to as the OLC in the \nJudiciary Committee, functions as legal advisor to the President and \nexecutive branch agencies, providing advice on complex questions of \nconstitutional and statutory interpretation. The OLC essentially serves \nas the general counsel to the executive branch.\n  Mr. Engel is well equipped to lead that office, both from the \nstandpoint of academics and from the standpoint of background. Mr. \nEngel received his undergraduate degree from Harvard, his master's of \nphilosophy from Cambridge University, and his law degree from Yale Law \nSchool.\n  Following his graduation, Mr. Engel clerked for Judge Kozinski of the \nNinth Circuit Court of Appeals and for Justice Kennedy on the Supreme \nCourt. Mr. Engel joined the law firm of Kirkland & Ellis after clerking \nfor Justice Kennedy. Mr. Engel's practice focused on appellate and \ncommercial litigation matters.\n  In 2006, Mr. Engel joined the OLC as counsel to the Assistant \nAttorney General at that time and was later promoted to Deputy \nAssistant Attorney General. There he provided legal advice to the \nAttorney General, to the White House counsel, and other executive \nbranch clients on a variety of legal matters.\n  In 2009, Mr. Engel joined the law firm of Dechert as a partner in the \nwhite collar and securities litigation group and later in that same \nfirm as a member of the complex commercial litigation group.\n  Mr. Engel's nomination has broad support across the legal community. \nThe Senate Judiciary Committee received a number of letters in support \nof his nomination. One such letter is signed by former Attorneys \nGeneral Mukasey and Gonzales, as well as former Deputy Attorneys \nGeneral Filip, Morford, and McNulty. Other letters of support were \nreceived from his coclerks on the Supreme Court, a group of Mr. Engel's \nformer colleagues, Yale Law School classmates, and Harvard Law \nProfessor Jack Goldsmith. Mr. Engel also received an endorsement from \nthe Patrolmen's Benevolent Association of the city of New York, which \nis the largest police union in New York City.\n  Another letter from former senior government officials and legal \nofficers of the executive branch, including Kenneth Wainstein and \nMichael Hayden, noted their ``enthusiastic support'' for Mr. Engel's \nnomination. Wainstein and Hayden wrote: ``We are confident that as head \nof OLC, Steve will render legal opinions with the highest level of \nprofessional integrity and according to his best understanding of what \nthe law and the Constitution require.''\n  Mr. Engel and I met this summer, and we discussed the importance of \ncongressional oversight and the essential role played by Members of \nthis body and the House of Representatives. He assured me that he \nagreed that each Member, whether or not a chairman of a committee, is a \nconstitutional officer entitled to the respect and best efforts of the \nexecutive branch to respond to his or her requests for information. \nFurther, he committed to review the May 1, 2017, OLC opinion on this \nvery issue and to consider whether a more complete analysis of the \nissue is necessary.\n  You may remember that my interest in this whole thing goes back to \nearly in this new administration, when people working for the President \nand presumably speaking for the President said that the only oversight \nletters that would be responded to would be those from chairmen of \ncommittees. Now, you can imagine that leaves out\n\n\nat least 30-some Republicans that would never get answers to their \noversight letters, and it would leave out 48 Democrats that would never \nget answers to their letters. Consequently, most of Congress would not \nbe able to do their constitutional role of oversight, making sure that \nthe executive branch is in enforcing the laws and spending the money \naccording to what we require. So I raised that issue through a 7-page \nletter to the White House, and they came and visited with me about it.\n  I think they had some misunderstanding of what oversight was all \nabout. They wrote a letter that said they are going to respond to every \nMember of Congress on oversight issues, which satisfies me from the \nstandpoint of their intent.\n  As I just said in my remarks here, Mr. Engel committed to review that \nMay 1, 2017, OLC opinion on this issue and to consider whether a more \ncomplete analysis of the issue is necessary because every Member of \nCongress should be able to do oversight, and every Member of Congress \nought to expect an answer to their letters from the executive branch of \nthe government, whether they are a chairman or not, whether they are a \nRepublican or not, whether they are a Member of the House or a Member \nof the Senate. I want to make sure that we follow through on this, \nalthough I will give this administration credit for almost totally \nreversing an opinion that they issued way back in May.\n  The head of OLC is a highly important role at the Department of \nJustice, and it is a role whose importance is felt throughout the \nFederal Government. Just to show you how it is felt throughout the \nentire government, let me tell you that they issued an opinion in the \nprevious administration on something to do with the work of inspectors \ngeneral throughout the government, previously, or maybe originally, \nintended to say what the inspectors general could demand or not demand. \nWe understand that the law passed in 1979 says that an inspector \ngeneral can be entitled to any information he wants from that \ndepartment, but they issued an opinion--the OLC person at that time--\nalong the lines of, well, there are some areas that maybe the head of \nthe agency has to review, which means that the 1979 law isn't being \ncarried out in the spirit. That is kind of an example because that \nopinion from the Justice Department was used by general counsels \nthroughout the administration of Obama to keep Congress from doing its \noversight work. That is how important the person who is the head of the \nOffice of Legal Counsel is in determining what goes on in the executive \nbranch of government--enough to stifle the oversight work of the \nCongress of the United States or the work of the inspectors general of \neach department.\n  So I see Mr. Engel as a person who is going to be a friend of \ncongressional oversight and, if he isn't, I am going to be very, very \ndisappointed. He has satisfied me through his testimony before our \ncommittee and through the promises he made in letters to me and in the \nprivacy of my office that he is going to do that. So we are ending up \nwith a Mr. Engel who is, as you can see, very well qualified to take on \nsuch a role as Assistant Attorney General of the Office of Legal \nCounsel.\n  I urge my colleagues to support Mr. Engel's nomination and confirm \nhim to this important position.\n  I yield the floor.", "turn": 5, "speaker": "Mr. GRASSLEY", "itemno": 6}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "D000563", "text": "  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the nomination of \nSteven Engel to head the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel.\n  On many occasions, President Donald Trump has made clear that he does \nnot appropriately respect the rule of law in America. We have seen this \nmany times over the last few years, from his bigoted and disdainful \ncomments about Federal judges, to his firing of FBI Director Comey \nbecause of what the President called ``this Russia thing,'' to his \nshameful pardon of Joe Arpaio, a man convicted of criminal contempt for \nrefusing to stop violating the Constitution, to his efforts last week \nto badger the FBI and Federal prosecutors into doing his bidding.\n  As Republican Senator Bob Corker said last Friday:\n\n       President Trump's pressuring of the Justice Department and \n     FBI to pursue cases against his adversaries and calling for \n     punishment before trials take place are totally inappropriate \n     and not only undermine our justice system but erode the \n     American people's confidence in our institutions.\n\n  If my Republican colleagues want to restore confidence in our \ninstitutions of justice, they can start by making sure that only \nsomeone truly independent of Donald Trump serves in the vital position \nof Assistant Attorney General for the Office of Legal Counsel.\n  The Office of Legal Counsel, or OLC, is not well known, but it is a \ncritical part of the Federal government. OLC exercises statutory \nauthority to provide legal advice that is binding on the executive \nbranch. In addition to giving legal advice to the President and \nexecutive branch officials, OLC reviews all proposed Executive orders \nand Attorney General orders for form and legality. Essentially, OLC \nserves as a check to make sure that the President and his \nadministration are faithfully executing the laws.\n  There have been shameful moments in our history when OLC's leaders \nhave lacked the independence and judgment to stand up for the rule of \nlaw. For example, in 2002, under Assistant Attorney General Jay Bybee, \nOLC produced the infamous torture memo that approved the CIA's use of \ntorture techniques like waterboarding. When this memo became public in \n2004, the Justice Department was forced to withdraw it. Jack Goldsmith, \na prominent conservative legal scholar who was acting head of OLC at \nthe time said he was ``astonished'' by the memo's ``deeply flawed'' and \n``sloppily reasoned'' legal analysis.\n  Then, in May 2005, OLC had a new leader--Steven Bradbury--and he \nsecretly issued three new torture memos approving the use of \nwaterboarding and other abusive interrogation techniques. Then-Deputy \nAttorney General Jim Comey strongly objected, saying the United States \nwould be ashamed when the memos came to light, but Attorney General \nAlberto Gonzales overruled him.\n  Already, we have seen troubling signs at OLC under President Trump. \nIn January, OLC signed off on President Trump's travel ban Executive \norder, a decision that was kept secret from then-acting Attorney \nGeneral Sally Yates. According to Ms. Yates, this was the first time \never that OLC hid its actions from the Attorney General, which it did \neven though OLC reports to the Attorney General. This Executive order \nwas blocked by multiple Federal courts before it was withdrawn. OLC \nissued an opinion on Inauguration Day to allow President Trump to \nemploy family members in the White House. This was a reversal of OLC's \nlongstanding position on antinepotism laws.\n  OLC is likely to face many critical legal issues in the coming months \nand years. We need OLC to serve as an independent check on this \nadministration, especially since President Trump has shown an eagerness \nto denigrate the justice system and to criticize those whose views on \nthe law differ from his own. Unfortunately, Steven Engel, the \nPresident's nominee to head OLC, has not demonstrated the independence \nand judgment that our country needs for this vital position.\n  Mr. Engel has been a law firm partner since 2009. Previously, he \nworked at OLC under President George W. Bush from 2006 to 2009, rising \nto the level of Deputy Assistant Attorney General. Mr. Engel admitted \nthat, while he was at OLC, he ``reviewed and commented upon'' a July \n2007 memo to the CIA Acting General Counsel which concluded that six \nCIA enhanced interrogation techniques were legal. These techniques \nincluded, for example, extended sleep deprivation by shackling \ndetainees in a standing position while wearing a diaper for days at a \ntime. The OLC opinion said that these techniques did not constitute \ncruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment. The Justice Department's Office \nof Professional Responsibility concluded that this 2007 memo was \ninconsistent with the plain meaning and commonly held understandings of \nCommon Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions. The OLC opinion was \nwithdrawn in 2009.\n  While at OLC, Mr. Engel also helped draft legislation that would \nbecome the Military Commissions Act of 2006. This law included a \nprovision that suspended habeas corpus rights for Guantanamo Bay \ndetainees, a provision that the Supreme Court struck down as \nunconstitutional in the Boumediene case.\n\n\n  Additionally, Mr. Engel worked on President Trump's transition and \nJustice Department landing team, but, he would not tell the Judiciary \nCommittee what matters he worked on, which is troubling.\n  I asked Mr. Engel to provide reassurance that, if he is confirmed, \nOLC will operate independently from President Trump. His response? He \nsaid he was deeply committed to the independence of OLC and said, ``I \ndemonstrated that commitment in my prior service in the Office, as well \nas in my activities in private practice and my volunteer work for the \nTrump transition team.'' It is hard for me to understand how Mr. \nEngel's work for the Trump transition--work that he would not even \ndiscuss with the committee--is supposed to reassure us about his \nindependence from President Trump. To the contrary, I fear that by \nrefusing to discuss his transition work, Mr. Engel has already started \ncovering for Mr. Trump.\n  Perhaps the most telling response Mr. Engel provided when it comes to \ndemonstrating independence from President Trump is this. I asked him \nthis question in writing:\n\n       According to news reports, in a January 27th dinner, \n     President Trump asked then-FBI Director James Comey if Comey \n     would pledge his loyalty to President Trump. Do you believe \n     it is appropriate for a President to ask a Director of the \n     FBI to pledge loyalty to the President?\n\n  His response? ``I do not have any knowledge concerning the \ncommunications between President Trump and former FBI Director Comey.'' \nThis is not a hard question. I wasn't asking Mr. Engel about the \nspecific conversation between President Trump and the FBI Director. \nHere is the easy answer that he should have given: It is wrong and \nunethical for a President to ask an FBI Director--or any Justice \nDepartment or FBI official--to make a personal loyalty pledge. If Mr. \nEngel can't get the easy questions right, what will he say when \nchallenging questions come before OLC?\n  For example, what if President Trump asks OLC to revise the 1974 OLC \nmemo concluding that a President cannot pardon himself? Would Mr. Engel \ncave to the President's whims? Or what if President Trump asks OLC to \njustify some pretext for the firing of Special Counsel Mueller? Are my \nRepublican colleagues confident that Mr. Engel would stand strong?\n  Here is the bottom line. Many of my Republican colleagues talk and \ntweet about their concerns when President Trump disrespects the rule of \nlaw, but talk and tweets are cheap. If they are truly concerned about \nPresident Trump's actions, they need to vote in a way that serves as a \nmeaningful check on President Trump. Our Nation needs the Office of \nLegal Counsel to serve as a check on the President's worst impulses. We \nneed them to stand strong when the President berates the Justice \nDepartment and urges it to ignore legal norms and processes.\n  I am concerned that Mr. Engel has not demonstrated the independence \nand judgment we need from the head of this critical office. Therefore, \nI cannot support his nomination.", "turn": 6, "speaker": "Mr. DURBIN", "itemno": 7}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, we are getting close to making tax relief \nfor Americans a reality. Last week the House released its tax reform \nbill, and this week we expect the Senate Finance Committee to release \nour version. In the coming days, the tax committees in both Houses will \nreview the bills, and then we will debate them on the floor and develop \na final version.\n  After years of economic stagnation, Americans are ready for relief. \nThey are ready to keep more of their hard-earned money. They are ready \nto finally see a real pay increase, and they are ready for access to \nmore economic opportunity. That is what our tax reform bill is going to \nprovide.\n  To start with, our bill is going to put more money in Americans' \npockets by lowering their tax rates and doubling their standard \ndeduction. Under our bill, a family making $24,000 a year or less will \nnot be paying any taxes, and families making more than $24,000 a year \nwill be paying significantly less than they are paying today. We are \nalso going to help families by substantially increasing the child tax \ncredit, and we are going to simplify and streamline the Tax Code so \nthat it is easier for Americans to figure out what benefits they \nqualify for so they don't have to spend a lot of time and money filing \ntheir taxes.\n  But that is only the beginning. Americans don't just want to keep \nmore of their hard-earned money. They also want to be making more of \nit, but Americans have had a hard time doing that lately. Wages have \nbeen stagnant for years, and new opportunities have been hard to find.\n  So in addition to reforming the individual side of the Tax Code, we \nare going to reform the business side so that we can give Americans \naccess to the kinds of jobs, wages, and opportunities that will set \nthem up for a secure future. In order for individual Americans to \nthrive economically, we need American businesses to thrive.\n  Thriving businesses create jobs, they provide opportunities, and they \nincrease wages and invest in their workers. Right now, though, our Tax \nCode is not helping businesses thrive. Instead, it is strangling both \nlarge and small businesses with high tax rates. Small businesses are \nincredibly important for new job creation. They play a huge role in the \neconomy in my home State of South Dakota and other States all across \nthe country, but the high tax rates that too many small businesses \ncurrently face can make it difficult for them to even survive, much \nless thrive and expand their operations.\n  So we are going to lower taxes for small businesses so that they can \ngrow and hire new workers. We are also going to allow small businesses \nto recover their capital invested in things like inventory and \nmachinery more quickly, which will free up capital so they can use that \nto expand and create jobs. Right now it can take small businesses \nyears, or in some cases even decades, to recover the cost of their \ninvestments in equipment and facilities. That can leave them extremely \ncash poor in the meantime, and, needless to say, cash poor businesses \nhave a hard time expanding, hiring new workers, or increasing wages. \nAllowing small businesses to recover their investments more quickly \nwill mean more jobs and more opportunities for American workers.\n  In addition to high tax rates on small and large businesses, another \nthing that is decreasing jobs and opportunities for American workers is \nour outdated worldwide tax system, which is discouraging American \ncompanies from investing their profits here at home in American jobs \nand American workers. Having a worldwide tax system means that American \ncompanies pay U.S. taxes on the profit they make here at home as well \nas on part of the profit they make abroad once they bring that money \nback to the United States. The problem with this is that American \ncompanies are already paying taxes to foreign governments on the money \nthey make abroad. Then, when they bring that money home, they too often \nend up having to pay taxes again on part of those profits and, I might \nadd, at the highest tax rate in the industrialized world. It is no \nsurprise that this discourages businesses from bringing their profits \nback to the United States to invest in their domestic operations, in \nnew jobs, and in increased wages.\n  Between 1982 and 2003, when the U.S. tax rate was much more \ncompetitive with those other countries, there were 29 corporate \ninversions where U.S. companies moved abroad. Between 2003 and 2014, \nwhen other countries were dropping their corporate tax rates and \nshifting to territorial tax systems, there were 47 such inversions.\n  Our tax plan addresses this drag on our economy by moving from our \noutdated worldwide tax system to a territorial tax system. What does \nthat mean? By shifting to a territorial tax system here in the United \nStates--a move, I might add, that is supported by Members of both \npolitical parties--we will eliminate the double taxation that \nencourages companies to send their investments and operations overseas. \nCombine that with a reduction in our high corporate tax rate, and we \ncan provide a strong incentive for U.S. companies to invest their \nprofits at home in American jobs and American workers instead of \nabroad.\n  Business tax reform is essential to reversing the economic stagnation \nthat we have seen in recent years. The White House Council of Economic \nAdvisers estimates that the tax reform framework that Republicans have \npresented will boost economic growth by\n\n\nbetween 3 and 5 percent. That is good news for the economy. More \nspecifically, however, it is good news for American workers, who can \nexpect to see their incomes rise as a result. A study from the White \nHouse Council of Economic Advisers estimates that reducing the \ncorporate tax rate from 35 percent, where it is today--the highest, as \nI said, in the industrialized world--down to 20 percent, which is more \ncompetitive with our competitors around the world, would increase \naverage household income by $4,000 annually. Think about that. Reducing \nthe tax on businesses in this country would increase average household \nincome for families in America by $4,000.\n  A Boston University professor and public finance expert, Larry \nKotlikoff, found that lowering the corporate tax rate to 20 percent \nwould increase household income by $3,500 per year on average. This was \nmost recently confirmed by Martin Feldstein, a Harvard professor and \nformer Chair of the Council of Economic Advisers, who noted in the Wall \nStreet Journal this week that corporate tax reform is likely to boost \nhousehold income by $3,500 per year.\n  There are lots of analysts, lots of experts who are looking at these \nproposed changes to the Tax Code and the tax reform that we are \nattempting to get through the Congress this year and onto the \nPresident's desk, and they have concluded that not only will it reduce \ntaxes--the tax burden, the amount of tax that is paid by middle-income \nfamilies in this country--but the reduction in the rates on businesses \nwill also increase the number of opportunities for better paying jobs \nand higher wages and it will raise that annual income--that average \nhousehold income--that is so desperately in need of a boost.\n  It has been a rough few years for the American economy and for \nAmerican workers. I think all you have to do is to look at the numbers \nand you know that most Americans haven't seen a pay raise in almost the \nlast decade. But with comprehensive tax reform, the next few years--and \nthe next few decades, for that matter--can look very, very different.\n  Republicans' tax reform legislation is going to provide direct relief \nto hard-working Americans, and it is going to create the kind of \neconomy that will give workers access to more jobs, to better \nopportunities, and to higher wages, not just for the near term but for \nthe long term.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues on the Senate Finance \nCommittee, under the leadership of Chairman Hatch, to put the final \ntouches on our bill and to take it up in the committee next week. Then, \nI hope we can bring that bill to the floor of the Senate and have an \nopen debate, process amendments, and pass something through the Senate \nthat we can conference with the House of Representatives, put it on the \nPresident's desk, and move our economy in a direction that will provide \na brighter and more prosperous future for American workers and American \nfamilies.\n  It is time to give the American people some relief.\n  I yield the floor.", "turn": 8, "speaker": "Mr. THUNE", "itemno": 9}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to strongly oppose the \nlegislation that has emerged from the House of Representatives that \npretends to provide tax relief to middle-class Americans, but if you \ntake a look at it and you look at the analyses that have already come \nout, what it really is, is another big tax giveaway to millionaires, \nbillionaires, and big, multinational corporations.\n  I believe we should do tax reform. We should take our Tax Code and \nclean up a lot of the junk that has gotten into our Tax Code that is \nnot there for good public policy reasons and is there because someone \nhad a high-powered lobbyist. We need to clean up our Tax Code, we need \nto reform our Tax Code, and we need to do it in a way that helps the \nmiddle class and doesn't add more big breaks for big corporations.\n  Unfortunately, this Republican plan does the opposite of tax reform. \nWhat it does is doubles down on big tax breaks for big corporations and \nthe superwealthy.\n  There is a headline today based on the analysis. The New York Times \nlooked at it. ``Republican Plan Would Raise Taxes on Millions'' of \nmiddle-class families. I can tell you that is very true in my State of \nMaryland. In fact, it is going to be true in States throughout the \nUnited States of America. We are going to see millions of middle-class \nfamilies paying more under this plan. In fact, this analysis that is \ndiscussed in the Times found that 45 percent of middle-class families \nwill see a tax increase under this plan once it is fully implemented. \nThat means that families making between roughly $50,000 a year and \n$160,000 a year--about half of them are going to end up paying higher \ntaxes under the Republican plan.\n  Here is one of the double standards that you see continuing \nthroughout the Republican tax plan: Big corporations not only get big \ntax cuts--$1.5 trillion--but they are going to go on forever. In \nmiddle-class families, many people will see an immediate tax increase. \nOthers will initially see a little tax cut. But for individuals and \nfamilies, it is the great disappearing tax cut--a little sweetener to \nmake the bill look good in the early years, but the bill takes away all \nthose tax cuts for middle-class families, on average, and then actually \nincreases the burden on a family of four making $59,000 under the plan.\n  For corporations, a $1.5 trillion tax cut over 10 years--permanent. \nFor folks in the middle, many will see an immediate tax increase, and \nthe tax increase will stay in place. Others will see a little tax \ndecrease, but as the years go by, many of those are going to see their \ntaxes go up. It is a major corporate tax cut financed in large part by \nmillions of middle-class families paying higher taxes.\n  Just to give a sense of how well the folks at the very top will do, \nthere is a headline from the Wall Street Journal--this is not a \nDemocratic-leaning newspaper--``Banks Sidestep a Big Tax-Plan \nPitfall.'' Right here in the second paragraph of the Wall Street \nJournal article, it says this: At a 20-percent corporate tax rate, \nbanks stand to be among the biggest winners from tax reform. That is \naccording to S&P Global Market Intelligence. The five biggest \ndiversified banks alone might have had tax savings of $11.5 billion in \n2016 at that rate--the biggest sum for any subindustry group tracked by \nS&P. The biggest banks do just great under this Republican plan. \nMiddle-class families are left paying the bill.\n  If you look at this on the individual side, the top 1 percent \nwealthiest Americans in this country are going to get an average tax \ncut of $65,000--that is per person, on average. If you are in that top \n1 percent, an average family will get a $65,000 tax cut. That means \nthat 48 percent of the benefit of all the tax cuts in this Republican \nplan goes to the top 1 percent. Let me say that again and just flip it \naround. The top 1 percent wealthiest households are going to get 48 \npercent of the dollar benefit of this tax cut. That doesn't sound like \na plan focused on improving the situation of middle-class taxpayers. \nThey are the ones who are going to have to finance many of those tax \ncuts for the very wealthy and big corporations.\n\n  I know our Republican colleagues recognize what a vulnerability this \nis because our colleague, Senate majority leader Mr. McConnell, said \nabout the tax bill in an interview last Saturday: ``At the end of the \nday, nobody in the middle class is going to get a tax increase.'' To \nunderstand what that means, he is saying that not a single middle-class \nhousehold out there in the country is going to see their taxes go up. \nWell, I don't know what tax plan he is talking about, but it is \ncertainly one that hasn't seen the light of day yet because the bill \nthat has come out of the House will raise taxes on millions of middle-\nclass families, and that is a fact.\n  Just the other day, in an interview on FOX News, Speaker Ryan said: \n``We are making sure every middle income taxpayer is a winner here.'' \nEvery middle-class taxpayer is a winner here. Well, that is certainly \nnot true of the plan that was just marked up in the Ways and Means \nCommittee of the House because there are a whole lot of families in the \nmiddle class who are big losers under the Republican plan--in fact, \nmillions of them around the country.\n\n\n  I don't know what plan they are talking about. I am looking forward \nto seeing the Republican plan that doesn't raise taxes on any middle-\nclass family in the United States. That should be our policy. We should \nnot be increasing the burden on middle-class families in order to \nfinance a $1.5 trillion tax cut for big, multinational corporations, \nbut that is the way it is right now.\n  Homeowners are going to be especially hard hit under this Republican \nplan because a lot fewer homeowners will utilize the mortgage interest \ndeduction, and the Republican plan also slashes the deduction for State \nand local taxes. In fact, they eliminate your option to deduct State \nand local income taxes. The result is going to be that a lot of middle-\nclass homeowners are going to pay a lot more. That is why the Realtors \noppose this bill. These are the folks in our neighborhoods who are \nbuying and selling homes. They are folks who have their ears to the \nground in our communities.\n  Here is what the president of the National Association of Realtors \nsaid about this bill: It ``threatens home values and takes money \nstraight from the pockets of homeowners.''\n  In fact, they had a study done by PricewaterhouseCoopers that said \nthat if you are a homeowner and your income is between $50,000 and \n$200,000, adjusted gross income, you will see an average tax increase. \nThey also predicted that home values across the board could drop by 10 \npercent, and it is not clear when they would recover their value.\n  The National Association of Home Builders is also opposed to this \nlegislation because of the impact it will have on home ownership and \nthe prices and value of people's homes around the country. They said:\n\n       The House Republican tax reform plan abandons middle-class \n     taxpayers in favor of high-income Americans and wealthy \n     corporations. The bill eviscerates existing housing tax \n     benefits by drastically reducing the number of homeowners who \n     can take advantage of mortgage interest and property tax \n     incentives.\n\n  I think all of us know that this is not some left-leaning group. We \nare talking about the National Association of Home Builders finding \nthat the Republican plan abandons middle-class taxpayers in favor of \nhigh-income Americans and wealthy corporations. That is their finding \nbased on their analysis of the bill.\n  Here is the catch. It is that double standard again. Just as I said \nearlier, you have the tax cuts for big corporations going on forever, \nbut there is much less tax relief for some middle-income taxpayers, and \nit takes effect early but then phases out. You also have a situation \nwhere, if you are a big corporation, you get to deduct all of your \nState and local taxes. In fact, if you are a multinational corporation \nand you are in China, you get to deduct taxes you pay to the Government \nof China. But if you are a household in Maryland or any of our States, \nyou don't get to deduct the taxes you pay to your State and local \ngovernments. So you are paying taxes twice on that dollar--once to the \nState government and again to Uncle Sam out of the same dollar.\n  Fitch Ratings looked at this and concluded that it will put dramatic \nstrains on State and local budgets since people in those States are not \ngoing to be able to take those tax deductions. Either you are going to \nsee dramatic cuts to school funding or healthcare, or you are going to \nsee State and local governments raise the property taxes in those \nStates. So you get hit coming and going if you are a middle-class \nhomeowner.\n  This also damages our economic development efforts in many parts of \nour country. It repeals the new markets tax credit. While it doesn't \nget rid of what President Trump said was a huge giveaway, the hedge \nfund loopholes--I can't remember how many times during the Presidential \ncampaign Candidate Trump talked about how the hedge fund tax break was \na total giveaway. That is not eliminated in this Republican bill. They \nkeep the big hedge fund loopholes, but here is what they get rid of. \nThey get rid of the ability of people with high medical expenses to \ndeduct those expenses from their taxes.\n  They even take away the additional standard deduction that currently \napplies to taxpayers who are at least 65 years of age or who are blind. \nThere are many folks who are in that category who are also going to see \ntheir taxes go up. Seniors are going to see their taxes go up, which is \nwhy the AARP has raised the alarm about that provision and others.\n  While they keep the big hedge fund loopholes, they get rid of the \nability of families who adopt children to take a tax credit to help \ncover the costs of adoption.\n  They get rid of provisions of the Tax Code that help students and \nteachers and schools. If you are a teacher who has been spending money \nto buy textbooks and other materials for your class, you used to be \nable to deduct the costs of what you are buying to help your kids. They \ntake that away in the same bill that they give big corporations a big \n$1.5 trillion tax break. If you are a student who has been struggling \nto afford college bills, you no longer get to deduct the interest on \nyour student loans.\n\n  If you are an employer who is currently receiving an incentive to \nemploy veterans who have served our country, sorry, that is gone too.\n  So I want to get this straight. You are going to take away the \nability of people with high medical expenses to take a deduction. You \nare going to take away the ability of college graduates to take a \ndeduction so that their expenses are more affordable. You are going to \ntake away the ability of people to get the adoption tax credit. And you \nare going to take away incentives for people to hire our veterans. But \nyou are going to keep the hedge fund loophole and you are going to give \na $1.5 trillion tax cut to big corporations. That is what this bill is \nall about.\n  Finally--and I am going to talk about this at greater length some \nother time--look at the international tax provisions in this Republican \nbill and how they are structured. I really urge my colleagues to take a \nlook at this. They actually increase the incentives for U.S.-based \nbusinesses and companies to move their operations overseas. That is for \ntwo reasons. No. 1 is that when you reduce the international tax \nrates--when you say, essentially, that a U.S. corporation that moves \nits jobs overseas now just pays the tax in that country and has no U.S. \ntax obligation; we, under this bill, are at 20 percent--you still have \nan incentive, obviously, to move your operations to a very low tax \nplace like the Cayman Islands.\n  But, then, there is an effort to address that issue in this bill. The \nproblem is the effort to address that provision doesn't work at all. \nHere is the current situation: A lot of corporations try to park what \nare known as their intangible assets in the Cayman Islands or other tax \nhavens. These are things like the value of patents. You make a great \ndiscovery, and you get a patent from the U.S. Patent Office, and you \nmake royalties off of that patent. Then, you have a lot of good \nlawyers, and essentially you park that patent in the Cayman Islands. \nThat really has no tax obligations, so all the profits that derive from \nthat patent are not subject to any tax--or maybe 1 or 2 percent tax.\n  So in this Republican bill, there is an effort to try to address that \nissue--at least it pretends to address the issue--but the problem is \nthat it doesn't.\n  Here is what they say. They say: Well, we are going to catch you if \nyou park your money in a place like the Cayman Islands because we are \ngoing to have a tax of 10 percent--a foreign high-return tax is what \nthey call it. The way they determine whether you are making an excess \nprofit is you look at your tangible assets in that country and you \ndetermine whether the profit you have made is over 8 percent. That is \nthe way it approximately adds up under this bill. But here is the \nproblem: It is an average international minimum tax, not a per-country \nminimum tax.\n  So let me tell my colleagues what a company that wants to reduce its \ntax obligation does. They move their company offshore. They take a \ncompany, say in Baltimore, MD, that is worth $100 million, and they are \nmaking a $5 million profit today here in the United States and they \nwill be taxed at 20 percent, and then they have this profit from the \nCayman Islands at $2 million. Under that previous provision I talked \nabout--this effort in the Republican bill to protect against what they \ncall\n\n\nhigh-return tax areas--they would normally have captured some of the \nincome generated from profits in the Cayman Islands. But when I move my \ncompany from Baltimore to, say, the United Kingdom, I actually then \nescape having to pay that tax on my monies in the tax haven.\n  So the bottom line is that this Republican bill, because it has this \naverage 10 percent minimum tax provision, is going to encourage \nAmerican businesses and companies to move overseas. If that is not what \nthe intention is, I urge my Republican colleagues to fix this right \naway. It hasn't been talked about much.\n  There have been a couple articles recently about it. Gene Sperling, \nKim Clausing, and others have gone through the economics of this, and \nit would make the situation a lot worse compared even to today in terms \nof these incentives.\n  The bottom line is, in addition to this being a $1.5 trillion tax \nbreak for big, multinational corporations, paid for and financed by \nfolks in the middle--which, even after you see the middle-class \nfamilies pay more, results in a $1.5 trillion addition to the debt, but \neven after all of that--after the big tax giveaway to big corporations, \nit has an incentive to add insult to injury for them to move their \nbusinesses and factories offshore.\n  I hope we will take a big step back and stop rushing a bill through \nas a matter of political imperative. We need to get this right. We \nshould have hearings. We should have folks from all different walks of \nlife and folks who will be impacted by this bill in many different ways \ncome and testify to Congress about this bill. Then, let's get together \non a bipartisan basis and actually do something that works for the \nAmerican people, not something that is going to clobber the middle \nclass and provide this huge windfall tax break to big multinational \ncorporations, while encouraging them to suck jobs and factories from \nthe United States overseas.\n  We need to start again on this. I urge my colleagues to do that.\n  I yield the floor.", "turn": 11, "speaker": "Mr. VAN HOLLEN", "itemno": 12}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hoeven).

Mr. President, I don't know where to begin. I want to \nspeak about the tax reform proposal but will start by responding to my \ncolleague from Maryland--and he is a colleague and friend--to say that \nhe must be talking about a different tax reform proposal than we are \ntalking about because, frankly, so much of what he said is not \nconsistent with the legislation that I have seen the House proposing \nand certainly not consistent with the legislation we are talking about \nhere in the Senate.\n  Let me start with his claim that there is a $1.5 trillion tax cut for \nbig corporations. That is simply not true. You can look at the House \nproposal because it is now out. You can see the fact that it does have \ntax relief, and it has tax relief targeted at middle-class families. He \nis right about the fact that it has a lower rate for our multinational \nbusinesses, but he also knows that our current system is absolutely \nbroken, and what is occurring is precisely what he is suggesting might \noccur if we were to change the code, which is companies and jobs and \ninvestment are going overseas.\n  He talked about the fact that we haven't had hearings. Since I got \nelected to the Senate in 2010, we have had 70 hearings in the committee \nI serve on, which is the Finance Committee. I would encourage people to \nlook at what we did 2 years ago. We set up five bipartisan task forces \non tax reform. I cochaired one of them. It was actually on the very \ntopic my colleague was talking about.\n  I would encourage him to look at the working group paper on \ninternational tax reform and the need for us to go to a lower rate--20 \npercent--to be competitive, to get just below the other industrialized \ncountries, and then to have the opportunity to go to a new type of tax \nsystem that enables us to bring back the money that is locked out \noverseas. Unbelievably, there is $2.5 trillion to $3 trillion of \nearnings that are overseas. Much of that could be brought back, and \nthat is what this tax proposal does.\n  Significantly, that report my colleagues will see was coauthored by \ntwo Members of this body, one Republican and one Democrat, because all \nof these task forces, these working groups, were bipartisan. My \ncolleague in that effort was a Senator from New York by the name of \nChuck Schumer, who now happens to be the Democratic leader.\n  So I think there is a consensus, at least in the real world, about \nthe fact that our current Tax Code is hopelessly broken and we have to \nfix it. And if you are against helping our companies to stay American \ncompanies, that must mean that you believe that they ought to become \nforeign companies, which is exactly what is happening. To me, it is an \noutrage that the U.S. Congress is allowing this to happen.\n  Ernst & Young, which is a public accounting firm, recently came out \nwith a study showing that 4,700 companies that have become foreign \ncompanies over the past 13 years would still be American companies if \nwe had the kind of tax reform proposal that we are proposing. In other \nwords, if you had this 20 percent rate I talked about, this competitive \ninternational system, you would have 4,700 more American companies \nhere, providing jobs, making investments, contributing to their \ncommunities.\n  It does matter that a company is headquartered here versus \nheadquartered overseas. We have done an analysis of this. We have done \nan investigation of this. We have determined that when companies leave, \nthey don't just change their headquarters, they take investment and \njobs with them.\n  I would refer my colleagues to the work of the Permanent Subcommittee \non Investigations; again, bipartisan work about the fact that we have \nto fix this broken Tax Code.\n  The Congressional Budget Office, which is the nonpartisan group here \non Capitol Hill that gives us advice on the impact of tax reform on the \neconomy, on deficits, on revenues, has a report which says that if you \ndo lower the business tax rate to make these companies competitive--\nagain, the alternative is going overseas--the benefit of that goes to \nshareholders, goes to workers. They say in their analysis that 70 \npercent of the benefit goes to higher wages and more benefits for \nworkers.\n  Think about it. That makes sense. If a company is not competitive, \nthey can't pay the kinds of wages we want them to pay. We want to get \nwages up. They can't pay the kinds of benefits we want them to pay. We \nwant to get benefits up.\n  So although I hope that we can have a spirited debate about aspects \nof this legislation, we should stick to the facts. We should not \nattempt to make this yet another partisan issue in this town, where we \nare attacking something not so much on the merits but because the other \nside thought about it.\n  I will tell you, when you look back historically, it isn't just the \nworking group that Senator Schumer and I cochaired on this \ninternational front where we have to get this rate down. We have to \nbecome competitive. We have to save our jobs here. But look at another \nbipartisan effort that is talked about a lot and is not agreed to by \nall Democrats or all Republicans; that is, the Simpson-Bowles proposal. \nThis was several years ago. They looked at the tax policy and deficit \nissues. Simpson-Bowles--totally bipartisan, supported by a bipartisan \ngroup of U.S. Senators who, at the time, were on that commission--said \nthat we ought to go to this lower rate and territorial system. This is \nnot a partisan issue or at least it hasn't been until now. Let's not \nmake it one.\n  Yes, it is true that there is tax relief in this proposal. The \nproposal the House has proposed--the proposal the Senate is likely to \npropose later this week--does have tax relief, and we believe that tax \nrelief is appropriate.\n  We believe we have to give middle-class families in my home State of \nOhio and around the country a little break right now. Why? Because they \nare seeing their expenses go up, especially healthcare, but also other \nexpenses. I say ``especially healthcare'' because that is the single \nlargest increase in expenses; it is in the healthcare area--\ndeductibles, copays, premiums--but also on food, housing, and other \ncosts, including tuition if you are trying to send your kids to school. \nThese expenses have skyrocketed, yet wages are flat, meaning people are \nfacing this middle-class squeeze.\n\n\n  We hear a lot of discussion on both sides of the aisle about the fact \nthat we want to help the middle class. One way to help is to help the \nfamily budget, to get a little relief to these families so they can \nmake ends meet and not just live paycheck to paycheck.\n  It will also help the economy. It will help get more money into the \neconomy to buy that car, to buy that appliance, to help move the \neconomy forward. It is part of this reform bill--yes, it is--and we are \nproud of it.\n  We also provide some tax relief on the business side to help small \nbusinesses. These are the so-called passthrough companies. About 90 \npercent of the businesses in America don't pay their taxes as \ncompanies. They are not corporations in that sense. They pay their \ntaxes through their individual tax return. They are called passthrough \ncompanies. Some call them LLCs, subchapter S, or sole proprietors or \npartnerships. These companies tend to be smaller companies, they tend \nto be family-owned. They need a little help too. So the proposal does \nprovide significant relief for those small businesses. In the House \nproposal and the Senate proposal, it is hundreds of billions of dollars \nout of the $1.5 trillion tax relief. We think that is appropriate.\n  Finally, again, on the business side, it will help make companies \ncompetitive to get the rate down so they can attract investment into \nAmerica rather than having that investment and jobs going out of \nAmerica, which is what is happening now. There are 4,700 companies that \nwould be American companies today if we had this tax proposal in place \nover the last 13 years, but we didn't, and we should learn from that. \nIt is Congress's responsibility to act to keep that from happening in \nthe future.\n  That is what this tax reform is about. It is about three things. It \nis about a middle-class tax cut allowing people to keep more of their \nhard-earned money. We think that is appropriate in these times.\n  It is about helping to make our companies more competitive because we \nwant more jobs and higher wages. Part of dealing with the middle-class \nsqueeze is to provide a little help with the family budget with tax \nrelief. Part is to get wages up. When people look at this tax reform \nproposal--right, left, or center--they are going to say the same thing: \nThis is going to incentivize more investment. Some think more, some \nthink less, but that investment in a tight labor market, as we have \nright now, is going to result in more competition for these workers, \ntherefore, pushing wages up. That is what we want. That is what this is \nabout. It is exciting.\n  Third is to level the playing field internationally so American \ncompanies will not be going overseas. That is the whole point. We are \nnot doing this tax reform proposal to encourage companies to go \noverseas. We are doing this tax reform proposal to incentivize them to \nstay in America and to attract more foreign investment here in this \ncountry so an American company can pay that premium for a foreign \nsubsidiary, rather than the other way around now, where American \ncompanies are not just inverting. We have heard this word \n``inversions,'' going overseas and buying a foreign company. They are \nactually being taken over by foreign companies.\n  That is the reality. We can't let it continue. We have to stand up \nand be counted, stand up for the middle class, stand up for our workers \nwho are now competing with one hand tied behind their back, whether it \nis a big auto company like in my home State of Ohio--I toured five of \nthese auto factories over the last couple of weeks, talked to them \nabout the tax reform proposal and how it would work. They gave me their \ninput. It is going to help. By the way, it is going to help whether you \nare a U.S. company or a foreign company. If you are a foreign automaker \nhere in America or you have other foreign investments, a lower rate and \nimmediate expensing--in other words, being able to write off your \ninvestments and equipment as you make them--that is all good for you \ntoo. So it will have both, the desired effect of helping American \ncompanies be competitive but, also, if you have foreign direct \ninvestment in your State and your community, they should be encouraged \nto put more money in America rather than somewhere else. If you are a \nJapanese automaker and you are looking around the world asking: Do I \nput that next investment in China, do I put it in Tokyo, do I put it in \nEurope and Germany, or do I put it in America, you will like this \nproposal because you will want to invest and be part of this too. That \nwill help us give this economy a needed shot in the arm.\n  There has been a lot of talk--and I heard it again today on the \nfloor--that this is going to be bad for the deficit. I think there will \nbe about $44 trillion of new revenue coming in, estimated, over the \nnext 10 years. Yes, out of that amount of money, we are suggesting a \n$1.5 trillion tax cut relative to the score--the budget--we have to \nuse.\n  What does that mean? About $500 billion of that is simply saying, the \nBudget Office says the existing tax policy in place is only temporary. \nSome of it is only temporary. These are the so-called extenders. We \nknow that is unlikely because we have always pretty much made these \npermanent, including a big one called bonus depreciation, which is most \nof that. Right away we think the way it is scored is not fair so we get \ndown to about $1 trillion in tax relief over 10 years, again, with $44 \ntrillion coming in.\n  What does that mean? It means you have to have a little more economic \ngrowth than is projected in order to not have a deficit and actually \npay down the deficit through more revenue coming in. I think that will \nhappen. Why do I say that? Because the projections we have to use are \nvery conservative. The Congressional Budget Office is what we are \nusing, and we are obliged to do that, which is fine. It is a \nnonpartisan group. They are saying economic growth over the next 10 \nyears will average about 1.9 percent of growth. The average over the \npast 30 years is about 2.5 percent. So they are saying our economy is \nnot going to grow as fast as it has in the last 30 years. We will see. \nIn the last two quarters, the economy grew at 3 percent and 3.1 percent \nso they don't seem to be on track with where the economy is going right \nnow.\n  More importantly to me, these proposals are pro-growth proposals--\nwhether it is help with regard to the business rate, which gets it \nbelow the rate of other industrialized countries rather than the \nhighest rate in the entire industrialized world, which is where we are \nnow. We have the highest rate in the industrialized world, and we are \ngetting it below the average. That will increase investment and \neconomic activity and jobs and, therefore, revenue.\n  If it is the immediate expensing,--again, where you can write down \nyour investments right away--that will increase investment in jobs, \naccording to all the economists who look at that. They may differ on \nhow much.\n  If you look at the international side, where we are going to bring \nback some of that $2.5 trillion to $3 trillion that is stuck overseas, \nthat certainly is going to be invested here in this country and help \nwith regard to economic growth.\n  There are a number of provisions. I talked about the small business \nprovisions earlier which will help small businesses to be able to \ninnovate, to be entrepreneurial, which is what we need more of--more \nnew starts. That is going to help.\n  All of that together is going to help with economic growth. How much? \nInstead of the 1.9 percent conservative estimate they have made for the \nnext 10 years, let's say it grows 0.4 percent more than projected. I \nwould attribute at least that much to this tax reform proposal because \nof what we just talked about, but if you believe it is going to grow at \n0.4 percent more than projected; in other words, instead of 1.9 \npercent, 2.3 percent--2.3 percent growth would be below the average \nover the last 30 years--then you will actually see the deficit start to \ncome down because of this tax reform proposal because the revenue will \nbe there, not just to make it revenue neutral, but beyond that we will \nactually pay down the deficit. We haven't done that in a while.\n  Back in 1997, 1998, 1999, 2000, we went through this before. We began \nto reduce the deficit annually. Do you know how it happened? \nConstraining spending helped, and that is part of our challenge in the \nCongress--how do we get our hands around the spending--but second is \ngrowing the economy. In that\n\n\ncase, the capital gains rate of taxation was reduced. Then, suddenly, \nin the late 1990s, about $100 billion of revenue that nobody expected \nshowed up in the coffers. That is how we got to a so-called balanced \nbudget a few years early because tax revenues were greater than \nexpected.\n  I believe this will happen again. I believe that when you look at \nthis proposal, it is conservative in the sense that it says: Yes, let's \nprovide needed middle-class tax relief. Let's also do these things to \ngrow the economy. Let's assume that because of all this, we are going \nto be able to improve the economic performance that is projected.\n  It is a pretty disappointing projection. Let's face it, 1.9 percent \ngrowth isn't great for any of us. It isn't great to deal with the \nissues of poverty. It isn't great to deal with the issues of \nentrepreneurship and innovation. It isn't going to help us to afford \nthe entitlements that are growing. We need better growth than that, we \nwant more growth, and I think tax relief is the single-most important \nthing we can do right now.\n  Yes, we should have more regulatory relief. Yes, we should do better \nin terms of getting the cost of healthcare under control. People are \nconcerned about costs rising so fast, and we haven't been able to \ngrapple with that issue. Yes, we should do more on worker training. We \nhave a skills gap in this country. We have jobs available, and yet we \ndon't have the skilled workforce to take those jobs. Yes, we can do \nmore in terms of helping grow the economy through education and other \nthings, but the one policy area that is crying out for reform is our \ntax system. It is antiquated. It is out of date. It is driving jobs \noverseas. It makes no sense. It can be simplified, and this simplifies \nthe Tax Code. It can be made more fair, and this makes it more fair by \nhelping the middle class more. It can encourage economic growth, and it \ndoes so through small business relief and relief for our multinational \ncompanies. It can help bring back trillions of dollars stuck overseas. \nThat is what this does. That is the whole idea here.\n  I am excited about this opportunity. The House of Representatives is \nworking on their legislation now in committee. Next week, that will \nshift to the Senate and the Senate Committee on Finance. We will have \nthe opportunity for an open process. As I noted, we have already had 70 \nhearings in the Finance Committee just over the past 7 years since I \nhave been in this Chamber. We have had working groups, including the \nbipartisan one I mentioned earlier, the five bipartisan working groups \nof that committee.\n  We will have the opportunity at our hearing next week to have an open \nprocess--anybody can offer an amendment--and open discussion. We will \nhave an interesting debate. It will be spirited. As we saw here today, \nwe have some differences of opinion, but let's stick to the facts. \nLet's not make this partisan. Let's stick to the merits. Let's try to \nhelp the American people and our economy.\n  Then we will come to the floor of the U.S. Senate, and the same thing \nwill happen--an open process. Every desk you see in here represents a \nSenator who will have the opportunity, should he or she wish, to offer \nan amendment, to have a debate, to discuss the issue. It will be \nspirited at times, but, again, I hope it will lead to a result that \nactually helps do the things we were elected to do: to give our \nconstituents--the people we represent--the chance to have a better \nlife; to give middle-class families a little relief as they are facing \nthis middle-class squeeze; to help grow this economy from the middle \nout, from the bottom up, from everywhere; to give us the ability to \nsay, once again, that America is that shining example, that beacon of \nhope and opportunity for the rest of the world. That is what this is \nabout.\n  Let's not blow this opportunity. Let's get it done, let's get it to \nthe President's desk for his signature before the end of this year, and \nlet's make good on the commitments we have made to our constituents to \nhelp create a better economy and a better future.\n  I yield the floor.", "turn": 13, "speaker": "Mr. PORTMAN", "itemno": 14}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I come to the floor today to call \nattention to the tragedies that have been caused by gun violence across \nour country, including the most recent attack, which left at least 26 \ndead after a lone gunman opened fire at a church in Texas on Sunday. I \njoin my colleagues in mourning for the victims and their families. Our \nthoughts are with them and all those affected by what happened in \nTexas.\n  At the same time, we remember that these heartbreaking events came \njust 35 days after the deadliest mass shooting in our Nation's history, \nwhen 58 were killed and hundreds were wounded in Las Vegas last month. \nBut as we look ahead, we cannot escape the fact that we can, and must, \ndo more to keep our communities safer. While no one policy will prevent \nevery tragedy, we need to come together on commonsense proposals that \nwould save lives.\n  I appreciate the words of my colleagues about mental illness and \nfunding for mental illness. I think that is very important. I come from \nMinnesota, where Paul Wellstone was one of the leaders in making sure \nthat mental illnesses got covered by insurance, and I think we need to \ndo that and more.\n  Another area where we have found some consensus in this Chamber is \nimproving background checks. My colleagues Senator Manchin and Senator \nToomey have made that clear, and I supported their background check \nlegislation in 2013. But the fact remains that we didn't pass that bill \nin the Senate. We fell short, and it was a disheartening day.\n  I remember having the parents of some of the Sandy Hook victims in my \noffice that morning. Yet what happened that day--you have to contrast \nit with where the American people are. Consistently, whether it is with \npublic opinion polls or whether it is when you talk to people you meet \nwhen you are at home, we have seen that Americans from across the \npolitical spectrum support commonsense proposals to require background \nchecks, such as requiring background checks at gun shows. And they \nsupport that by wide margins.\n  By the way, I look at this from a State that has a lot of households \nthat have guns. We are a proud hunting State. And with every proposal I \nlook at, I always think of my Uncle Dick and how he used to love \nhunting and sitting in his deer stand. I think: Does this hurt my Uncle \nDick and his deer stand? And I don't think that the Manchin-Toomey bill \nwould in any way. When I look at these things, I have to evaluate them \nthat way because I know how many proud and law-abiding gun owners we \nhave in our State. But I don't see that closing this gun show loophole \nby doing something more about background checks would hurt that hunting \ntradition in any way.\n  When I talk to law enforcement around Minnesota, they stress the \nimportance of having effective background checks to stop felons, \ndomestic abusers, and people who are prohibited from having easy access \nto guns from having that access. If you remember, part of the Manchin-\nToomey proposal was to do more on sharing data and getting the data out \nthere. These efforts should not and do not have to infringe on \nAmericans' rights to own guns.\n  Another sensible measure that came out of the tragedy in Las Vegas, \nwhich\n\n\nwe should take action on, is Senator Feinstein's legislation to close a \nloophole that allows bump stock devices to convert semiautomatic \nfirearms into weapons that work like fully automatic guns. Law \nenforcement recovered 12 of these devices from the hotel room of the \nshooter in Las Vegas last month.\n  I hope we can find some common ground. Some of our colleagues across \nthe aisle have voiced some interest in this, and I hope we can do \nsomething when we know that would have been helpful in that shooting.\n  Another area where we can find common ground is in taking action to \nprotect those who are at risk of gun violence from domestic abusers. We \nwere reminded of how important this is again this week, as reports have \nrevealed that the gunman in the Texas shooting had a history of \ndomestic violence, having been court-martialed for assaulting his wife \nand child in 2012. He was sentenced to 12 months of confinement and \nreceived a bad-conduct discharge from the Air Force. There are also \nreports of ex-girlfriends and others who reported similar conduct.\n  I am sure the facts will be unveiled, but what I do know, regardless \nof what the facts show right now, is that this connection between \ndomestic violence, stalking--those kinds of activities--and some kind \nof homicidal behavior is something that has been well established. \nAccording to recent research, more than half of mass shootings between \n2009 and 2016--that is 54 percent--involved some kind of domestic or \nfamily violence.\n  Before I came to the Senate, I spent 8 years as the top prosecutor \nfor Minnesota's largest county, so I have seen that connection. And I \nhave seen the connection between a history of domestic violence or \nstalking that later leads to a more serious crime. That is why it is so \nimportant that we have protection orders, and that is why it is so \nimportant--as I look at the record of the shooter--that these cases be \ntaken seriously, so you actually get that misdemeanor conviction on the \nrecord or you actually get a felony conviction or you do something \nabout the stalking behavior when it is reported to law enforcement.\n\n  When I was the county attorney in Hennepin County, we would have \ncases we would sometimes pursue when a victim had reported it and the \npolice had gathered evidence--even if the victim later backed away and \nwas afraid to testify--because we knew it had happened, we had the \noriginal testimony, and we had the evidence at the scene. We trained \nthe police on getting the evidence at the scene so that we were able to \nactually make those cases. And you think about, in that instant, making \nthose cases; no matter how hard it can be sometimes when you have a \nscared victim, it is really important.\n  When I was in the county attorney's office, I made prosecuting felons \nin possession of firearms one of my top priorities. They weren't \nsupposed to have guns, and when they did have guns, we had to take it \nseriously. I will tell you, some of the most disturbing cases that we \nsaw involved people with a documented history of harassment--of \nstalking, of domestic violence--because you would see it building and \nbuilding, and sometimes it would be against one victim, but often we \nwould find out that there were others and that it was a pattern of \nbehavior, and one horrible case would erupt into homicidal violence.\n  There was one case I had heard of where a woman was shot to death by \nher boyfriend. He killed her and then killed himself while both of his \nkids were still in the house. It was ultimately his 12-year-old \ndaughter who went to the neighbors for help. The worst part of the \nstory is that it could have been prevented. In the 2 years leading up \nto the murder-suicide, the police had been called to the boyfriend's \nresidence at least five times to resolve domestic disputes. Yet somehow \nthe man, with a history of violence like this, was able to have a gun \nin his hand on the day he killed his girlfriend.\n  I wish I could say that it was a rare tragedy, but the truth is, \nstudies have shown that more than three women per day lose their lives \nat the hands of their partners, and over half--this is an average--of \nthe women murdered by intimate partners in the country are killed with \nguns. Many times these tragedies begin with incidents of stalking.\n  Research has shown that one in six women has experienced stalking \nsometime during her lifetime, and 76 percent of women murdered by \nintimate partners were first stalked by their partner. It is for this \nreason that a number of years ago I introduced a bill called the \nProtecting Domestic Violence and Stalking Victims Act to close some of \nthese loopholes in our existing laws. My bill would make sure that \nthose who are convicted of misdemeanor crimes of stalking are not able \nto buy guns. It would also expand the definition of a domestic abuser \nto include dating partners. The second part--when we had a hearing on \nthis bill on these issues in the Judiciary Committee, even the \nRepublican witnesses who were called supported the dating partner idea \nbecause so many States have started to do that.\n  I introduced the legislation this time. It has been bipartisan in the \npast, but the Republican Senator on the bill is no longer in the \nSenate, although it is bipartisan in the House. But this time I \nintroduced it with Senator Hirono and Senator Feinstein, the only other \ntwo women on the Judiciary Committee of 20 members. Congresswoman \nDebbie Dingell from Michigan is leading the same bill in the House, and \nher bill, as I noted, is bipartisan.\n  In 2014, we had a hearing on my bill. As I said, even the Republican \nwitnesses agreed that a major portion of the bill was a good idea. At \nthat hearing, we heard from Sheriff Christopher Schmaling of Racine \nCounty in Wisconsin. He testified about the connection between stalking \nand guns being used in violence against women. In his testimony, he \ntold the story of one woman from Wisconsin who, he said, had changed \nhis career. This woman had endured 3 years of a violently abusive \nmarriage before divorcing her husband. She then took out multiple \nrestraining orders against him over several years. That horrible day in \n2004, he threatened her with a handgun, beat her with a baseball bat, \nbound and gagged her, and left her in a storage unit to die. Through \nwhat he described as some good breaks and some great luck, the Sheriff \nand his partner rescued Teri before she died. As a result of the \nordeal, she had a miscarriage and had to have her toes surgically \nremoved. In his testimony, the Sheriff talked about the importance of \nmy bill's provision to extend the protections in current law to include \ndating partners so that abusers would not be able to buy a gun if they \nare convicted of beating up their girlfriend or boyfriend, regardless \nof whether they lived together or had a child.\n  As the sheriff said, ``Dangerous boyfriends can be just as scary as \ndangerous husbands; they hit just as hard, and they fire their guns \nwith the same deadly force.''\n  This is a simple point that you would think we could all agree on. \nSadly, we still have not been able to pass this bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the sheriff's written \ntestimony be printed in the Record.", "turn": 21, "speaker": "Ms. KLOBUCHAR", "itemno": 23}, {"kind": "recorder", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in ", "turn": -1, "speaker": "The RECORDER", "itemno": 24}, {"kind": "recorder", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "the Record, as follows:\n\n\nwritten testimony of sheriff christopher schmaling--judiciary committee \nhearing: ``vawa next steps: protecting women from gun violence''--july \n                                30, 2014\n\n       Chairman Whitehouse, Senator Grassley, Senator Leahy, \n     members of the Committee, thank you for hosting this hearing \n     today, and thank you for the opportunity to testify.\n       My name is Christopher Schmaling. I am the sheriff of \n     Racine County, Wisconsin and have been a law enforcement \n     officer for 19 years. I am a conservative Republican, and I'm \n     here today to ask you to pass two laws that will protect our \n     sisters, our mothers, and our daughters by keeping guns out \n     of the hands of domestic abusers. The first bill is the \n     Protecting Domestic Violence and Stalking Victims Act of \n     2013, which will block abusive boyfriends and convicted \n     stalkers from possessing guns. The second is a bill that \n     would require criminal background checks for gun sales by \n     unlicensed sellers.\n       More than half of the women murdered each year are killed \n     by intimate partners or family members. That's 48 women \n     killed by husbands and boyfriends each and every month. We \n     know that people with a history of committing domestic \n     violence are more likely to become killers--and we know the \n     role that firearms play: When a gun is present in a domestic \n     violence incident, the chances that a woman will be killed \n     increase by 500 percent.\n\n\n       These numbers are tragic. As the top law enforcement \n     officer in Racine County and over my two decades on the \n     force, I've seen far too many of these tragic incidents \n     firsthand.\n       I want to tell you about one such domestic violence \n     incident, a tragedy that changed my career. In 2004, Teri \n     Jendusa-Nicolai was violently abused and left for dead by her \n     ex-husband. Teri had endured three years of a violently \n     abusive marriage before divorcing him, and had then taken out \n     multiple restraining orders against him over several years.\n       That horrible day in 2004, he threatened her with a .38 \n     caliber handgun, beat her with a baseball bat, bound and \n     gagged her, and left her in a storage unit to die. My partner \n     and I were the lead investigators on the case, and through \n     some good breaks and some great luck, we rescued Teri before \n     she died. As a result of the ordeal, Teri had a miscarriage \n     and had to have her toes surgically removed.\n       Teri is one of the most wonderful people I've ever known, \n     and has been a tremendous advocate for victims of abuse in \n     the decade since she was nearly killed at gunpoint. We've \n     become very close since then, and my eyes have been opened to \n     the reality of domestic violence and gun violence. I've also \n     become close with Elvin Daniel, who is sitting here beside me \n     today, and have been moved by his sister Zina's story.\n       I'm proud to say we are the first county in the State of \n     Wisconsin to have a full-time domestic violence specialist. \n     We work closely with victims to figure out how best to \n     protect them. We've made this very intimate and very deadly \n     area a top priority for our department. So much of the crime \n     we face in Racine County is intimate partner abuse, and any \n     cop will tell you that domestic violence calls are the most \n     dangerous calls. The last thing a victim needs, and the last \n     thing my officers need, is for these dangerous abusers to be \n     armed with illegal guns.\n       We respond to domestic violence incidents differently than \n     other calls, because these are ``heightened risk'' calls--we \n     send more officers, we go ahead and assume that guns will be \n     involved, because they are so often involved. Abusers \n     routinely threaten to shoot my deputies and I upon arrival at \n     domestic violence calls. In fact, according to FBI data, over \n     150 law enforcement officers have been killed in action while \n     responding to domestic disturbances.\n       I'm proud to have worked on a great domestic violence bill \n     in Wisconsin in 2014 known as ``The Safe Act,'' a bill that \n     ensures guns are kept out of the hands of domestic abusers. \n     This bill was passed by a bipartisan majority and signed by \n     our Republican governor Scott Walker. This year alone, \n     similar bills were passed with bipartisan support in New \n     Hampshire, Minnesota, Vermont, and Washington. And in \n     Louisiana, where another Republican governor--Bobby Jindal--\n     signed the bill into law.\n       The first bill I'm asking you to pass today is the \n     Protecting Domestic Violence and Stalking Victims Act of \n     2013, S. 1290, introduced by Senator Klobuchar. This bill \n     would close a loophole that allows abusive dating partners to \n     buy and have guns--simply because they are not married to \n     their victims. And it would also block people with stalking \n     convictions from having guns.\n       Why is this bill so important? I can tell you firsthand \n     that domestic violence is horrific, whether or not the abuser \n     and victim are married. When we send our police into danger \n     to respond to domestic violence calls, we send the same folks \n     regardless of the couple's marital status. Dangerous \n     boyfriends can be just as scary as dangerous husbands; they \n     hit just as hard and they fire their guns with the same \n     deadly force. In fact, according to FBI data, more women are \n     killed in America by their abusive boyfriends than by their \n     abusive husbands.\n       This past March, just a couple hours from Racine County, \n     Cheryl Gilberg was killed by her ex-boyfriend in a domestic \n     dispute. The killer apparently shot Cheryl with her own gun, \n     after a struggle. According to news reports, she had been \n     seeking a restraining order at the time of the killing. But \n     in cases like Cheryl's, a restraining order isn't good \n     enough. If you've never been married to your abuser, federal \n     law likely will not stop him from buying a gun.\n       If Congress passes this bill, federal law will be catching \n     up with the states. Among the 22 states that prohibit gun \n     possession by domestic abusers subject to restraining orders, \n     19 of those states already include abusive dating partners. \n     And 42 of our states have recognized that dating partner \n     abuse is a form of domestic abuse by allowing victims to take \n     out domestic violence restraining orders against their \n     boyfriends.\n       The second bill I'm asking you to pass today would require \n     criminal background checks for gun buyers who shop with \n     unlicensed sellers. Current federal law prohibits many \n     abusers from buying guns, but only requires them to pass a \n     background check if they buy a gun from a licensed dealer. \n     This is a gaping hole in the law: It means a convicted wife-\n     beater can slip through the cracks and get a gun simply by \n     finding a seller who does not have his own gun store.\n       This is exactly what happened in Dane County: Tyrone Adair \n     was a domestic abuser who had been convicted of battery \n     twice, and was legally prohibited from owning a gun because \n     of a restraining order. So instead of going to a gun store--\n     where he would have had to pass a background check--he found \n     an ad for a 9mm Glock in a local paper, and met the seller at \n     a hardware store. There was no background check, though the \n     seller did ask, and I quote, ``You're not going to go out and \n     kill someone, are you?'' Tyrone Adair used that gun on a \n     horrific murder spree, killing his two daughters--ages 1 and \n     2--and killing their two mothers.\n       Background checks work. Sixteen states and DC already \n     require background checks for all handgun sales, and about 40 \n     percent fewer women are shot to death by their husbands and \n     boyfriends in those states. And background checks save law \n     enforcement lives as well: about 40 percent fewer cops are \n     killed with handguns in those states, as well.\n       These are the cops that risk their lives when they respond \n     to domestic violence calls, rushing into the middle of very \n     dangerous and very intimate situations. We see the terror \n     that abusers can create when they are armed. We see the \n     impact on their wives and girlfriends, and on their children. \n     We're major proponents of community policing in Racine \n     County, and if I have my officers on the street, working \n     closely with our residents, I want to know that our laws are \n     doing everything they can to keep guns out of abusive hands.\n       So I'm here to speak for victims of abuse and to speak for \n     my cops. I've made it a priority to talk to victims. I've \n     seen the escalation over the years, from yelling, to battery, \n     to homicide. When an abuser has a gun, the victims say to me, \n     ``Sheriff, is not a question of if he'll use the gun to abuse \n     me; it's a question of when.'' And I recognize the value of \n     preventing even one gun from winding up in the hands of an \n     abuser: one gun may translate into one more lives saved.\n       So today, I'm asking you to pass S. 1290, which will apply \n     the same rules to all abusers, regardless of whether they are \n     married to their victims or not--and will prohibit convicted \n     stalkers from having guns.\n       And I'm asking you to require criminal background checks \n     for gun sales by unlicensed sellers, and ensure that abusers \n     don't get a free pass when they buy guns from them--often \n     strangers they meet online, at gun shows, or through \n     classified ads. The bipartisan bill introduced last year by \n     Senators Joe Manchin and Pat Toomey would do just that, and \n     it has already received the support of 55 senators.\n       I'm asking you today to stand up against abuse by fixing \n     our out-of-date laws and passing this common-sense \n     legislation. Thank you for your time and I look forward to \n     answering your questions.\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "The RECORDER", "itemno": 25}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "K000367", "text": "  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. I also note that a justice from the Supreme Court of \nPennsylvania also testified on that day as the Republicans' witness. \nEven though he did not agree with everything in the bill, he also said: \nI absolutely agree that we should have boyfriends, dating partners as a \npart. We have it in Pennsylvania, OK? It is important. As the sheriff \nsaid, they can shoot, and they can beat up people just like anybody \nelse.\n  He was, actually, the Republicans' witness at the hearing. That is \nwhy I am happy that in the House of Representatives it is a bipartisan \nbill, but I would like to see it as a bipartisan bill here in the \nSenate. Maybe they will reconsider this now. Just as the NRA has said \nthat it was looking at the bump stock issue, maybe they would be \nwilling to look at this issue because they wrote kind of a fast memo on \nthis--it is only a page long--back when we had the hearing and when we \nwere gaining support for the bill. Remember that this is very narrow \nlegislation that is focused on making sure that dating partners are \ncovered and also people who are not charged but convicted of stalking. \nThey wrote that the legislation ``manipulates emotionally compelling \nissues such as `domestic violence' and `stalking' simply to cast as \nwide a net as possible. . . .''\n  I want to make this very clear--and I have never addressed this on \nthe floor before--that this was really focused narrowly so that we \ncould gain Republican support. I didn't really think the NRA would \nsupport it, but I thought that maybe they would be neutral, and, sure \nenough, their witnesses at the hearing supported it. We have had \nRepublican Senators support it in the past, and we have also had \nRepublican House Members support it. In going after the bill by saying \nthat it manipulates emotionally compelling issues, well, I would agree \nin that I am sure that a lot of people shed tears when watching what \nhappened in Texas, and I am sure that they have shed a lot of tears \nwhen they have heard the stories from people in their own communities \nof the victims, of the women who had died at the hands of domestic \nabusers after years of abuse. So if they want to call that emotionally \ncompelling and manipulative, that is up to them, but I call it the \ntruth.\n  The other thing they said about this bill--and this was even more \ninteresting--is the part about the stalking,\n\n\nwhich is a major part of the legislation as well. That part of the \nbill, as I mentioned, just takes what we know as a signal for trouble \nin the future and violence in the future, and you would actually have \nto be convicted of stalking to have the gun protections apply.\n  The example they used--as I said, it did not make any sense to \ninclude this, and it is the only example they used--was of two men of \nequal size, strength, and domestic status, joined by a civil union or \nmerely engaged or formally engaged in an intimate social relationship, \nbeing subject to this prohibition for conviction of simple assault \narising from a single shoving match.\n  Actually, this part applies to the domestic partners. I think they \nare really taking this in a way that has surprised me since whom we are \ntalking about are boyfriends and girlfriends and domestic violence, but \nthey have changed it into a shoving match in a bar with people who \nmight have some kind of social relationship. I just do not think this \nis a valid reason for my Republican colleagues to oppose this bill, and \nI am going to keep bringing this up because it does not make sense to \nme.\n  They end by saying that, whatever the case may have been 30 years \nago, domestic violence is now taken seriously by the legal and criminal \njustice systems.\n  That was the reason they gave for opposing the bill. Really? Look at \nwhat we just found that happened in the last week when this was not \njust a minor example of domestic assault but was a felony. The person \nwas court-martialed, and the person was, basically, detained for a \nyear. Yet, somehow, this was not taken seriously enough through our \nentire system to show up on a record check. How about all of the \nreports that had been made by previous girlfriends and other people \nabout his behavior, and nothing had seemed to come up then?\n  As I mentioned, of the many cases that we had had in our office, even \nwhen the victim had gotten scared and decided that she had not wanted \nto pursue anything, we had felt that we had an obligation to her and to \nthe other women we knew would come after her to pursue those cases, \nand, many times, we had done that if the police had been trained and \nthey had been able to get the evidence at the scene. Sometimes there \nhad been child witnesses and others, and we had been able to pursue \nthose cases and win them, and we did.\n  So to say that you don't want to support my bill because you think \nthis system is so great, is working so well, and is being taken \nseriously by the legal and criminal justice systems after you saw what \njust happened in Texas, I do not think is true. This memo was written 2 \nyears ago. So I hope they will look at this again and consider \nsupporting my bill.\n  I conclude my remarks by sharing another story about yet another \ntragic shooting from my State. In this one I truly got to know the \nwidow. She is the widow of a police officer in Lake City, MN. This was \na case in which the officer, who was a wonderful man in a small town \npolice department, responded to a domestic violence call from a 17-\nyear-old girl who was being abused by her ex-boyfriend. He went to the \nscene in the middle of the winter. He had a bulletproof vest on and \neverything because the domestic violence cases can be much more \ndangerous than people think, and officers know this. He was shot in the \nhead, and he was killed. The 17-year-old girl lived. This officer \nliterally gave his life to save another.\n  There was a big funeral, and there were law enforcement people there \nfrom all over our State. I will never forget that funeral. I was \nsitting there in the aisle, and I had learned that the last time that \nofficer had been in that church was to see his own kids--three young \nchildren, two boys and a girl--in a Nativity play. He had been sitting \nright in the front row of that same church, so proud of them at \nChristmas. Shortly after that, he was shot. At his funeral, there were \nthose three children walking down the church aisle--the two young boys \nand the little girl in a blue dress that was covered with stars. I \nalways think about that little girl in that blue dress that was covered \nin stars. This was domestic violence gone bad. He was a police officer \nwho had shown up at the scene.\n  When you look at these cases--we can look at the numbers; we can look \nat the stories; we can look at what has gone on on TV--you see this \nconnection between domestic violence and stalking and then, later, \neither mass shootings or violence against one person, which happens \nmuch more often. It is not a coincidence. It is something that has been \nwell documented.\n  As we extend our sympathies and prayers to all of those who were \naffected by that tragedy in Texas and, of course, not too long ago in \nLas Vegas and in so many other communities and to all of those, of \ncourse, who were also victims of that act of terror in New York--we \nthink of all of them--we also think: What can we do to make this \nbetter? In this case, when it comes to domestic violence and this \nspecific issue that I know a lot about from my past job, we can do \nsomething.

Mr. President, whenever a Higher Power is looking down on \nus as we move through our daily lives, I imagine that He probably \ndoesn't see political borders. I imagine He probably doesn't care much \nabout the distinctions that we create to tell the difference between us \nand others. He probably doesn't care much about walls and fences. He \ncares about us as people. He looks at us, at how we conduct ourselves, \nand at how we treat others.\n  We spend a lot of time here talking about the arbitrary divisions \nbetween us, but in the end, when we face our Maker, it probably is just \nabout how we treated those around us, whether we tried to make their \nlives a little bit better.\n  So I am on the floor this afternoon to talk about a handful of my \nconstituents who need our help, young people who we have labeled with \nthe term Dreamers, who came to this country not by their decision but \nby the decision of their parents, when they were very, very young. They \nare Americans in every sense of the word. They are beautiful, beautiful \nyoung men and women, and they want us to see them as the beautiful \nindividuals they are. They don't want to be labeled. They don't want to \nbe put into the middle of a divisive political dialogue. They just want \nour help.\n\n  We all hear from them because there is no State that doesn't have \nthese kids. There are 800,000 who have officially registered under the \nexisting law that provides them with protection. They are in every \nsingle congressional district.\n  I thought it would be useful for my colleagues to hear from just a \nfew of them today because they can tell the story of why we need to \ngive citizenship, permanent protection, to these kids at the very \nleast, if not their parents and others who have been waiting for a long \ntime for comprehensive immigration reform. They can tell this story \nbetter than I can.\n  Vania from Willimantic is a student at Eastern Connecticut State \nUniversity. I want to read what she wrote to me. She said:\n\n       I was born in Mexico, and I was brought to the United \n     States at the age of 3 and have been living in Willimantic \n     since. I am 19 now. I grew up in Willimantic, Connecticut, \n     and I consider it my home. It's where I grew up, where I went \n     to school, where I made friends, and where all my memories \n     are.\n       As an undocumented student in the United States, you are \n     constantly unsure of what your future may hold, but not \n     because you're indecisive or unsure of what you are going to \n     do, but rather because you don't ultimately have power of \n     your own future. At a young age I always knew I wanted to go \n     to college; however, I also knew that because of my status, I \n     might have not been able to carry out that goal. However, I \n     didn't let it discourage me. I like many other undocumented \n     students did the best we could and constantly strived to be \n     the best at anything we did, and now, thanks to DACA, all \n     that hard work has finally begun to pay off.\n       See, DACA is more than just a legal status; it is the \n     puzzle piece that many of us have been missing in order to \n     reach our goals. It has allowed me to get a Social Security \n     number, a driver's license, but more importantly, a higher \n     education.\n\n\n       Growing up, I constantly had all my teachers say to me: Do \n     good in school, try your best at anything you do, stay out of \n     trouble, and you are guaranteed to go far in life.\n\n  Let me step out of her comments for a second. Boy, if that is not an \nencapsulation of the American dream--``do good in school, try your best \nat anything you do, stay out of trouble, and you are guaranteed to go \nfar in life''--I don't think I could find a better way to encapsulate \nwhat we hope is the story for every single child in this country.\n  Vania said:\n\n       So that is exactly what I did. Most other DACA recipients \n     did the exact same, but it currently doesn't seem enough for \n     this government. There is no longer a fight for a work permit \n     but rather a fight for my human rights. I am just as worthy \n     to live here and carry out my goals as any other natural born \n     citizenship. I have done my best, consistently contributed to \n     society in a positive way. This is my home. I deserve to feel \n     safe here, and I will continue to fight for that until I do.\n\n  Mirka is from Wallingford, CT, and she is a Southern Connecticut \nState University student. She said:\n\n       I came here from Mexico sixteen years ago. I am currently a \n     senior at Southern Connecticut State University, studying \n     bilingual education.\n       We need more good people in bilingual education.\n       I just started student teaching last week, but all that is \n     in danger. Besides being able to get a license and work \n     permit, DACA has allowed me to follow through on my passion \n     of becoming a teacher. It has given me hope that I have a \n     future career in education and that I can live my life \n     without fear of deportation.\n\n  An in-need profession--bilingual educators. Somebody willing to \ndevote their life to our kids needs our help.\n  Faye in Norwalk says:\n\n       I am one of the more than 800,000 DACA recipients in the \n     United States. I am from Trinidad and Tobago and have been in \n     the United States almost 19 years. I live in Norwalk, CT, and \n     I have lived there for about 16 years. It is home to me.\n\n  You hear that over and over again: It is home to me.\n\n       I am currently a Lead Radiology Scheduler, and I have a \n     second job working at Ulta, both of which I enjoy. My goal in \n     working both jobs is to purchase my first home.\n\n  That is another very critical component of the American dream--home \nownership.\n\n       Growing up, I wanted to be a homeowner. I wanted a place \n     that I could call mine, and with DACA I saw that as a \n     possibility. Now I'm not sure when or if that would come \n     through, but I still will continue to work hard because in my \n     heart I know God is bigger than even this moment, and I know \n     that we will be victorious. Even in a land that would not \n     allow me to claim it as my home, I want to buy a house of my \n     own to call my home. One day I will be called American not \n     just among my undocumented community but by a Nation.\n\n  I mean, listen, we have some very articulate people in this body, \nRepublicans and Democrats. I am not sure that any of us could write \nsomething that poignant, that beautiful, and that compelling: I am not \nsure if any of that will come through, but I am going to continue to \nwork hard because in my heart I know that God is bigger than even this \nmoment, and I know that we will be victorious. Even in a land that \nwould not allow me to claim it as my home, I want to buy a house to \ncall it my home. One day I will be called an American not just among my \ncommunity but by my Nation.\n  There are 4,900 DACA recipients in just my State alone. I have met a \nlot of them. Frankly, maybe not everyone is as beautifully articulate \nas Faye, but, boy, they have done some very impressive things with \ntheir lives, maybe in part because they always knew that their status \nhere was in jeopardy and they had to make the most of their time in the \nUnited States, not knowing when it would end, knowing that they had \nopportunities here in the United States that they simply would not and \ncould not have if they ever went home, especially those kids who came \nhere when they were 3 years old, going back home to a place where they \nmight not even speak the language--they certainly know no one--a place \nwhere opportunity is farther off even for those who were born there. \nThey worked hard, and they hustled a little bit more, knowing that they \nmight be at risk of some day being pushed out of this country.\n  They are Americans. Every single one of these students, these \nDreamers, use the phrase ``This is home.'' And they want our help.\n  I think this is a moral issue, first and foremost. It is how we treat \neach other. These people are our neighbors. They are our coworkers.\n  Eight hundred business leaders--CEOs from companies such as Walmart, \nTarget, Facebook, Pepsi, Kaiser--want them to stay here because they \nare their employees. They know how much they add to the economic bounty \nof this country. They wrote to us and asked for us to provide permanent \nprotection for these kids.\n  Seventy-five national colleges and universities, including all the \nones in my State--Yale, Trinity, Connecticut College, the State \nuniversities--said the same thing. They want to educate these kids. \nThey see them. They see what stellar students they are, and they just \ncan't imagine the United States deciding to send 800,000 of these \nincredibly capable kids away.\n  One hundred eighty-six civil and human rights groups running the \ngamut say: This is a moral and civil rights issue. Let these kids stay.\n  Because of President Trump's decision to telegraph the end of the \ntemporary protection for these students, the burden is now on us, \nRepublicans and Democrats, to do something and do something soon. It is \nhard to describe the psychological toll on these kids right now. I \nmean, it was bad enough when they were pushed into the shadows. It got \na little bit better when they got temporary protection. But now that we \nhave put a clock on, now that they have revealed themselves to the \nworld and put themselves on a list that can allow them to be targeted, \nthere is a little bit of their soul that atrophies every day as they \nwonder whether we are going to come together and do the right thing. \nPart of the reason part of them is crumbling inside is because they see \nthemselves as being made political pawns in a bigger game here.\n  It would be so easy for us to decide to protect these kids. Just do \nit now. Don't wait until the end of the year. Don't wait until this \nissue is mixed together with all sorts of other must-pass legislation. \nJust come together right now and step up and give these kids some \ndegree of confidence that they can be here.\n  I have heard so many of my Republican colleagues say they want to do \nthat. Why wait? Why push this up until the last minute? Do it right \nnow. It is the right thing to do.\n  In the end, whoever is up there does not look at borders. He looks at \nus. He looks into our soul. He thinks about how we treat those who need \nour help and our protection. And no one needs our help and protection \nmore than these kids right now--5,000 of them in my State and 800,000 \nof them across the country.\n  So my plea is simple, Mr. President: Let's do this and do this now. \nLet's give permanent protection, citizenship, pathways to citizenship, \nto these beautiful boys and girls, men and women. Don't make this issue \nabout politics. Don't make it about parties. Don't make these kids a \nbargaining chip in a bigger game. Just do the right thing. I promise \nyou, if you do, you won't regret it.\n  I yield the floor.", "turn": 26, "speaker": "Mr. MURPHY", "itemno": 32}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, climate disruption is the seminal \nchallenge of our generation. We have seen the impacts occurring all \naround the world. We see it in the disappearing Arctic ice. We see it \nin the melting permafrost. We see it in the change of carbon dioxide \nand methane being emitted from peat bogs, disappearing glaciers, dying \ncoral reefs, and certainly more powerful storms and raging fires.\n  It is the responsibility of those of us in this generation, in this \ntime, to take action. Indeed, communities across the globe are taking \naction. They are increasing the energy efficiency of buildings, \nvehicles, and appliances, and they are replacing carbon-polluting \nfossil fuel energy with renewable energy. This is such an important \nissue.\n  How much do you know about the changes underway? Well, let's find \nout. Welcome to episode 7 of the Senate Climate Disruption Quiz.\n  Our first question is, Since the year 2000, the rate of global carbon \ndioxide pollution has decreased dramatically, decreased slightly, \nstayed the same, or increased substantially? Lock in your answers.\n\n\n  The answer is D, increased substantially. Many folks think that \nbecause of the actions being taken at the local level and by the \ncommunity of nations and the Paris Agreement, that, in fact, global \nCO2 pollution has decreased dramatically, but it has not. \nThe rate at which the pollution is occurring is increasing. So it isn't \njust the total level. For example, in 1990, we had 354 parts per \nmillion; 10 years later, in 2000, we were up to 369.64 parts per \nmillion; and in 2017, we were up to 408.8 parts per million. The levels \nare climbing, but the speed is increasing as well. In that period \naround 1990, we were increasing about 1\\1/2\\ parts per million per \nyear; by 2000, it was about 2 parts per million per year; and now we \nare at 2\\1/2\\ parts per million per year. So this increase is \nsubstantial.\n  As a community of nations, we have to not only proceed to decrease \ntotal carbon pollution, but first we have to get the rate of increase \nunder control.\n  This brings us to the second question: In September of this year, how \nmany miles did a Proterra bus drive on a single charge? Did this bus \nset a record by going 270 miles, the distance between L.A. and Las \nVegas, or did it set a record by going 600 miles, equivalent from New \nYork City to Columbia, SC? Did it travel over 1,100 miles, the \nequivalent distance from Arizona to Arkansas? Did it manage to go 2,092 \nmiles, the shortest distance from the east coast to the west coast in \nAmerica? Lock in your answers.\n  The correct answer is C. It went 1,100 miles. The electric bus \ntraveled 1,100 miles. This bus was a new version of the Catalyst E2. It \nis called the Catalyst E2 Max. It is produced by Proterra. It has a \nbattery that is 50 percent larger than the previous version that is \nbeing sold commercially--that is the Catalyst E2. That Proterra that is \ncurrently being sold has a functional range for the transit agencies \nthat are buying it of over 350 miles, about 350 miles. That is pretty \nimpressive. But by having a battery that is 50 percent lighter and \nmoving quite slowly, driving it slowly, they managed to go 1,100 miles. \nIt is really an indication of the rapid transformation of this \nparticular type of electric vehicle.\n  Question No. 3: Warmer weather is contributing to what problem in \nmajor American cities? Is the problem caused by warmer weather transit \ndelays? Is it exploding rat populations? Is warmer weather contributing \nto larger potholes or to longer tourist seasons?\n  Well, the dramatic answer here is that the warmer weather is \ncontributing to exploding rat populations. Rat breeding usually slows \nin winter, but if you have a mild winter, that doesn't happen.\n\n  Since 2013, the pest control company Orkin has reported significant \ngrowth in its services--61 percent growth in Chicago, 67 percent in \nBoston, 174 percent in San Francisco, 129 percent in New York City, and \n57 percent in Washington, DC, right here where the Capitol is located. \nThis is a major economic and health problem. Rats caused $19 billion in \neconomic damage in 2000 from, among other things, eating away at \nbuildings and infrastructure, and, of course, they are carriers of \nrodent-borne diseases like E. coli and salmonella. Plus, we just simply \ndon't like having them in our cities.\n  Let's turn to the next question, question No. 4. As of today, how \nmany nations in the world are rejecting the Paris Agreement that \naddresses climate disruption? Is the answer 25 out of the roughly 200 \nnations in the world or 12 or 3 nations or 1 nation? Lock in your \nanswers.\n  The answer is not 25 nor 12, and it is not 3. It is now just one \nnation that is rejecting the Paris Agreement. Now, until recently there \nwere three nations. You had two nations that had not signed up and one \nnation that had said it was going to withdraw. The two that had not \nsigned up were Nicaragua and Syria, and the one that said it was going \nto withdraw was the United States of America. President Trump made that \nannouncement. But a short time ago, Nicaragua announced it was going to \nratify the treaty, and today Syria announced it was going to ratify the \ntreaty. That leaves the United States standing alone as the only Nation \nthat is saying it is going to reject the Paris Agreement.\n  Of course, this has a big impact on American leadership in the world, \nsince we worked very hard to bring nations together to craft this \nagreement. The nations were so impressed that all of them in the world \nare now participating except us--except the United States.\n  Let's go to question No. 5. Better management of our lands and \nforests could help reach what percent of the goals laid out in the \nParis Agreement? Could better management of lands and forests \ncontribute to reaching 5 percent, or one-twentieth of the goal; or 12 \npercent, roughly one-eighth; or 25 percent, roughly one-quarter of the \ngoal; or 37 percent, more than one-third of the goal laid out in Paris? \nLock in your answers.\n  The correct answer to this is D, 37 percent, or more than one-third, \na surprisingly high number. An international study released last month \nsaid the natural climate solutions in guarding the management of our \nlands and our forests could help us reach more than a third of the \ngoals laid out in the Paris Agreement. The paper looked at 20 \nconservation and improved land management actions that help increase \ncarbon storage or avoid greenhouse gas emissions in a cost-effective \nmanner. The single most important factor among them is reforestation.\n  Years ago I heard an individual say: Wouldn't it be great if we could \njust invent something that could pull carbon dioxide out of the air. \nWell, we actually have that already. It is called a tree. Growing trees \nis a very effective strategy in addressing carbon pollution.\n  Of course, there are issues related to how we manage our forests and \nmaking them more resilient to forest fires, where they are less likely \nto burn and emit carbon. Certainly, there is how we farm and how we \ntake care of other types of lands, including peat restoration and \ncoastal restoration.\n  Those are our five questions for this edition, episode 7, of the \nSenate Climate Disruption Quiz. These questions were ripped from the \nheadlines in regard to the biggest test facing human kind on this \nplanet. It is up to us in this generation to act.\n  We are the first generation to experience this enormous range of \nimpacts from carbon pollution and a warming planet, and we are the only \ngeneration that is able to head off disaster ahead by acting quickly \nnow. We are racing the clock. There is no time to spare. So stay \nengaged and do all you can to help take this on.\n  Meanwhile, as we learn more about technology and about the planet, \nall in the near future, I will bring you Climate Disruption Quiz \nEpisode 8.", "turn": 28, "speaker": "Mr. MERKLEY", "itemno": 34}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Johnson).

Mr. President, we are here in the wake of yet another \nsenseless mass shooting. Again, we continue to watch in horror a \ncommunity torn apart and families seeking solace and comfort, loved \nones deprived of people close to them forever. We know about that \nfeeling in Connecticut because we had been through it in Sandy Hook \njust 5 years ago, almost to the month. Next month will be the fifth \nanniversary.\n  Every day in America in communities across this great country, there \nare senseless similar acts of violence one by one, person by person. \nEvery day there is a mass instance of people dying of gun violence. The \ndanger is that this kind of incident will become a normal way of life \nin America. We cannot allow ourselves to become desensitized. We cannot \nlose hope that action is possible. We cannot allow ourselves to succumb \nto this supposed normal. We cannot surrender to fear or complacency or \nhopelessness.\n  Our hearts and prayers are with the brave souls who are enduring this \nunspeakable grief and pain. Again, we know about it in Connecticut \nbecause I remember well that afternoon at Sandy Hook and the days that \nfollowed when families hoped for numbness. They hoped that the rawness \nand unimaginable pain of that loss would leave. For some, it has \nlessened, but it will never go away for them or for the families in \nTexas or Orlando or San Bernardino or Virginia Tech. The list is a long \none, and it should include those families in Hartford, New Haven, \nStamford, Bridgeport and in other communities--not necessarily urban, \nbut suburban and rural--around Connecticut and around the country that \nhave endured this same grief.\n\n\n  Numbness is not the answer. Action is the answer--honoring those \nvictims by action. That honor is never too soon. That sense of grief \nwill never go away. As much as our hearts and prayers go out to those \nfamilies, we must also honor them with action.\n  Our reaction is not necessarily aimed at the last shooting or the \nlast death by gun violence. It should prevent the future ones. The trap \nof the gun lobbyists is to say: Well, what you are proposing wouldn't \nhave prevented what happened last Sunday in Sutherland Springs, TX. But \nwe do know that 26 people might be alive today if the U.S. Air Force \nhad done its job. Twenty-six people might be alive today if the U.S. \nAir Force had reported this conviction by court-martial of the shooter \nto the NICS background system. Twenty-six people might be alive today \nif the U.S. Air Force had followed the law.\n  There is a law that requires this reporting. It was passed in 2007. \nIt requires all courts and all jurisdictions to make that reporting.\n  The law here is also clear that the shooter never should have had \naccess to firearms. There are laws on the books right now specifically \ndesigned to help prevent dangerous individuals with criminal records of \nexactly this kind from getting their hands on guns, and that includes \nanyone who has a domestic violence conviction in any court, including \nmilitary court.\n  As the author of that legislation, Frank Lautenberg, said at the \ntime: It is a very simple principle. Wife beaters and child abusers \nshould not have guns. The statistics bear out that principle now more \nthan they did ever before. The mix of guns and domestic violence is a \ntoxic one. Fifty-five percent of all homicides against women occur \nduring domestic violence disputes, and a woman is five times more \nlikely to die during a domestic violence dispute if there are guns in \nthe house.\n  The law also prohibits anyone who has been dishonorably discharged \nfrom the military or convicted of an offense carrying a sentence of \nmore than 1 year from buying a firearm.\n  The Department of Defense has a clear legal obligation to have made \nthat report. By the way, that obligation includes military court \nindictments as well as convictions, because they may disqualify someone \nfrom obtaining guns.\n  We know today that the shooter in Sutherland Springs, TX, also was \ninvoluntarily committed to a mental health facility after sneaking guns \nonto an Air Force base and trying to kill his military superiors. That \nperson should never have been anywhere near a firearm, let alone having \nthe ability to buy one from a licensed firearm dealer, as apparently \noccurred.\n  The Air Force's lapse is shocking and inexcusable. It is a lapse that \nmay have contributed to, if not directly caused, that shooting because, \notherwise, that shooter would have completely lacked access to the \nfirearms he used so lethally.\n  The American people deserve to know why the gunman's conviction was \nnot reported in the background check database. The American people also \ndeserve to know what immediate steps the Department of Defense will \ntake to ensure that every court-martial indictment or conviction is \nreported to the FBI when they disqualify someone from accessing guns.\n  The American people deserve action. So I have written to the Defense \nSecretary James Mattis urging him to take immediate action to ensure \nthat guns are prevented from falling into the wrong hands. That means \ntaking specific, concrete steps to identify an individual whose \nconvictions and court-martial disqualify them from obtaining a gun and \nmaking sure those records are submitted to the FBI. I want to know what \nsystem there will be for identifying those convictions.\n  I am also planning to introduce legislation because enforcement of \nthat law should be done and reemphasized and reinforced so that there \nis no question in any mind of anyone in the military about their \nobligation. They must ensure that people who are convicted of \ndisqualifying offenses in military courts are reported to the national \nbackground check database so they are prevented from having access to \nthese firearms by purchasing them from licensed firearms dealers.\n  As of now, the background check law applies only to those licensed \ndealers. We need to extend it to include all firearms sales. We need \nother commonsense measures to prevent and stop gun violence, but at \nleast the military can be compelled to honor this obligation. I know \nits heart is in the right place, and I know they will diligently reform \nwhat they need to do largely on their own because they recognize that \nobligation.\n  We have an obligation, as well, to enforce all of these laws more \ndiligently. As a law enforcement person, one who was the State attorney \ngeneral for 20 years and the U.S. attorney before then, I am proud of \nthe State of Connecticut for classifying domestic offenses so they can \nbe disqualifying under the law. Connecticut is only one of a handful--\nperhaps three States--that have that disqualifying classification, so \nthe States need to do better as well.\n  The simple, commonsense fixes to help enforce laws that are already \non the books to keep America safe will enable the law to be real and \neffective. If it is unenforced, it is dead letter. It must be enforced. \nWe need better enforcement, and we also need better laws.\n  I hope my colleagues on both sides of the aisle will join in this \neffort, and I hope this new legislation will be bipartisan, just as we \ngrieve together regardless of party.\n  Thank you.\n  I yield the floor.", "turn": 30, "speaker": "Mr. BLUMENTHAL", "itemno": 36}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.", "turn": 31, "speaker": "The PRESIDING OFFICER", "itemno": 37}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "S000770", "text": "  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I first wish to thank my friend, the \ndistinguished Senator from Connecticut, for his very important words.\n\n\n                        Nomination of Peter Robb\n\n  Mr. President, I rise at this point to say a few words about one of \nPresident Trump's nominees whom we will be voting on in a few minutes.\n  The National Labor Relations Board is a crucial tool for protecting \nworking men and women in Michigan and across the country. The right to \ncollectively bargain, the freedom to be able to bargain for fair wages, \ngood benefits, retirement security, safe and fair workplaces--all of \nthese things depend on a National Labor Relations Board that works--\nthat works for people.\n  Perhaps no person at the NLRB is more critical to protecting these \nrights than is the NLRB's General Counsel. When a worker believes that \nthe law has been violated and brings their concern to the National \nLabor Relations Board, it is the General Counsel who investigates. If \nthe employee is found to have violated the law or the freedoms and \nrights of working men and women, it is the General Counsel who takes \naction to make things right.\n  Unfortunately, while President Trump talks a lot about having our \nworkers' backs--he certainly said that a lot in Michigan--his actions \nspeak much louder than his words. That is certainly true in the case of \nhis choice for General Counsel, Peter Robb.\n  Mr. Robb was voted out of the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions \nCommittee in October without any Democratic support--and there was a \nreason for that. The reason is that during his career, he has shown so \nlittle support for working men and women across our country.\n  When Dominion Energy's workers at the Millstone Power Station in \nConnecticut attempted to use their freedom to organize--one of the \nfreedoms in America is to be able to come together, to be able to \norganize, to be able to collectively bargain on behalf of yourself and \nothers to make sure you are able to get fair pay and a pension and safe \nworking conditions. But when the people at the Millstone Power Station \nin Connecticut attempted to do that, Mr. Robb, who represented \nDominion, delayed the election for more than 2 years. Not only that, he \nbragged about it on his law firm's website--making people who wanted to \nexercise their freedom to collectively bargain and to organize wait for \n2 years.\n  Mr. Robb also was lead counsel on the case that led to 11,000 air \ntraffic controllers being fired--people, again, who were part of a \nunion and could collectively bargain for safe conditions and good pay \nand pensions. They were fired and barred from Federal service. It was a \nwatershed case in the history of union suppression, in taking away \npeople's freedoms.\n  While he worked for a Reagan-appointed NLRB member, longstanding\n\n\npolicies changed to weaken the government's ability to enforce the \nrights and freedoms of working men and women.\n\n  With stagnant wages and rising healthcare costs and worries about \npension cuts and workplace discrimination, frankly, I know working men \nand women in Michigan and across the country have enough to worry \nabout. They shouldn't have to worry that the person who is supposed to \nhave their back is, instead, looking for ways to strip away their \nfreedom to organize on the job.\n  That is why I will vote no on Peter Robb, and I encourage my \ncolleagues to do the same.\n\n\n                               Healthcare\n\n  Mr. President, I wish to turn now to another very important topic. I \nhave been speaking about workers, and now I wish to speak about our \nchildren and standing up for our children.\n  Every year, 9 million children receive health insurance through a \nvery successful program called the Children's Health Insurance Program. \nChildren from low- and middle-income families who do not qualify for \nMedicaid--working families--are able to receive healthcare through \nCHIP, and every year, 25 million people, including 300,000 veterans and \n7.5 million children, receive medical care from community health \ncenters in cities and towns and rural communities all across Michigan \nand across the country. That is 9 million children who can see a doctor \nwhen they get sick or hurt, and that is millions of parents who don't \nhave to lie awake at night, worrying about what will happen the next \ntime their child falls, breaks an arm, gets strep throat, or something \neven worse.\n  Thanks to Republican inaction, these millions of parents do now have \nto worry.\n  It has been 38 days since the Republican leadership let funding \nexpire for the Children's Health Insurance Program and community health \ncenters--38 days and counting--38 days when we could have been working \ntogether to fund these important programs. Yet that didn't happen, even \nthough they have bipartisan support. That is 38 days of telling \nchildren and hard-working families who use these programs that they \ndon't matter as much as other things we are doing.\n  For the longest time, the Children's Health Insurance Program and \ncommunity health centers have received strong bipartisan support, and \nthat is true today. If these programs--a bill that came out of the \nFinance Committee and a bill that Senator Roy Blunt and I have \nintroduced--were brought to the floor, they would get strong bipartisan \nsupport--if we could get them on the floor.\n  We are hearing from more than 1,000 organizations, including the \nAmerican Academy of Pediatrics, the American Heart Association, the \nMarch of Dimes, and the National Association of Counties, all urging us \nto take up the CHIP bill and to pass it--the 5-year extension, which is \nso critical.\n  Senator Hatch on the Finance Committee, of which I am proud to be a \nmember, has worked with Senator Wyden, with me, and with others to put \ntogether a good bill, a 5-year reauthorization of CHIP, on a bipartisan \nbasis, and 70 Members of this body, led by Senator Roy Blunt and \nmyself, have signed a letter of support for continuing funding for \ncommunity health centers. Senator Blunt and I, with eight other \nDemocrats and eight Republicans, have put in a bill to do that.\n  We know the support is there. The problem is, we cannot get it \nbrought up on the floor as a priority for the Senate.\n  As I mentioned, this crucial funding expired 38 days ago--more than a \nmonth ago. Over those 38 days, the Senate has taken up 54 record \nrollcall votes, Republicans passed their budget, and we have considered \n16 nominees. But we haven't considered over the past 38 days the 9 \nmillion children who depend on the Children's Health Insurance Program \nto stay healthy and the 25 million patients who use community health \ncenters.\n  We might be 38 days late, but there is no time like today to make \nchildren and families a top priority. These programs are a big deal in \nmy State. Before CHIP, too many hard-working families in Michigan \ncouldn't afford to take their children to the doctor. Now, 97 percent \nof our children in Michigan can go to the doctor. Moms and dads can \ntake their children to the doctor because of what has been put together \naround health insurance, making health insurance available in \nMichigan--the highest percentage ever--97 percent.\n  Last year, Michigan's community health centers treated more than \n680,000 patients, including 12,710 veterans.\n  Having access to health insurance and healthcare we know is life-\nchanging and even lifesaving.\n  Just ask Jan of Davison, MI, whose daughter Suzi was covered by \nMIChild--what we call CHIP, actually MIChild--in Michigan. Suzi was \ndiagnosed with ADHD as a child and later with bipolar disorder. In \nJan's words:\n\n       Without having access to quality health care, we would have \n     been lost. And thanks to MIChild coverage, we are able to \n     afford the help she so desperately needed.\n\n  Today, Suzi is a high school graduate and plans to go to community \ncollege.\n  Albert, a resident of Owosso, MI, knows the value of community health \ncenters. He had graduated from high school and was taking college \nclasses. He had a great full-time job with health benefits. He said \nthat it was like a dream come true--until it stopped. Work dried up. In \na matter of months, Albert lost his job, his insurance, and his home.\n  He fell into a deep depression--and many of us would have done the \nsame. But Albert was lucky. A friend noticed that he was struggling and \nurged him to visit Great Lakes Bay Health Centers. Within 2 weeks, he \nhad a medical appointment; 3 days after that, he was speaking with a \ncommunity health center counselor. As Albert said, ``It happened so \nfast, there was no time for me to fall through the cracks.''\n  Today he is running a local business and has his confidence back. He \nhas lost 50 pounds and stopped drinking. He has rebuilt his \nrelationships with his family. And he is now giving back to the very \nclinic that changed his life, serving on the board of Great Lakes Bay \nHealth Centers.\n  All of the children and the people who receive coverage and care from \nCHIP and community health centers can tell their stories.", "turn": 32, "speaker": "Ms. STABENOW", "itemno": 38}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
