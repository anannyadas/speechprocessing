Mr. Speaker, since its inception, public broadcasting \nhas truly remained both a national and local institution offering \neducational programming for youth, emergency communications, cultural \nprograms, and providing for the unique broadcasting needs of rural and \nsmall towns. In fact, more than 170 million Americans rely on public \nbroadcasting every month.\n  Fifty years ago, the enactment of the Public Broadcasting Act created \nthe Corporation for Public Broadcasting and led to the establishment of \nthe Public Broadcasting Service and National Public Radio. Today, I \ncommemorate this law's 50th anniversary signing and celebrate the \ncritical services public broadcasting continues to provide as America's \nmost trusted source of news and information.\n  It's no surprise that an overwhelming majority of Americans want to \nmaintain or even increase the federal contribution. That's why \nCongress, time and time again, has committed to funding public \nbroadcasting through the appropriations process. Each federal dollar \ndedicated to public broadcasting leverages six private dollars, usually \nvoluntary contributions.\n  My colleague, Ryan Costello, and I founded the bipartisan \nCongressional Public Broadcasting Caucus to unite Members of Congress \nwho understand that public broadcasting's mission is alive, well, and \ndeserving of our support. We'll continue working to highlight the \nimportance of the service, the needed federal support, and the valuable \ncontributions to our citizenry.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. BLUMENAUER", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 3}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "181", "extension": true, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "E1527", "wkday": "Tuesday", "day": "7", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "COMMEMORATING THE 50TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE PUBLIC BROADCASTING ACT", "id": "CREC-2017-11-07-pt1-PgE1527-3", "title": "COMMEMORATING THE 50TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE PUBLIC BROADCASTING ACT"}
