Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 3441, the Save \nLocal Business Act.\n  Mr. Speaker, the premise of this legislation is simple. It is about \nprotecting the ability of entrepreneurs in this country to start and \nrun their own business, and it is about ensuring opportunities within \nreach for all Americans.\n  Every day, men and women across the country work hard to earn a \npaycheck and provide for their families, and every day, local \nbusinessowners work hard to keep their doors open and hire employees.\n  Meanwhile, bureaucrats in Washington are busy setting policies that \nhave a widespread impact on every workplace in the country. As we \nlearned during the Obama administration and from rulings made by the \nprevious National Labor Relations Board, too often these policies do \nfar more harm than good.\n  When it comes to rules and policies governing our Nation's workforce, \nthere has never been a greater need for Congress to clarify areas of \nthe law that shouldn't be left up to boards and Federal agencies to \ndecide. That is especially true regarding the joint employer issue. In \n2015, when the Obama administration's NLRB unilaterally redefined what \nit means to be a joint employer, the result was massive confusion and \nuncertainty.\n  The Committee on Education and the Workforce has heard from countless \nindividuals on how the vague and unworkable new joint employer standard \nthreatens job creation, creates new roadblocks for entrepreneurs, and \nupends successful business models and relationships.\n  H.R. 3441, the Save Local Business Act, will deliver much-needed \nrelief by providing legal clarity under the National Labor Relations \nAct and the Fair Labor Standards Act. The legislation simply restores a \ncommonsense joint employer standard, and it does so in a way that \nupholds vital worker protections and ensures all employers know their \nresponsibilities to their employees.\n  I want to thank my colleague, Representative Byrne, for introducing \nand tirelessly championing this proposal, along with the Democratic \ncosponsors.\n  I urge all Members to vote in favor of H.R. 3441 so we can protect \nlocal jobs, opportunity, and entrepreneurship.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.", "turn": 5, "speaker": "Ms. FOXX", "itemno": 11}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "S000185", "text": "  Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.R. 3441, the so-called Save \nLocal Business Act. Mr. Speaker, in recent years, employers have \nincreasingly moved away from direct hiring of employees to the use of \npermatemps and subcontracting to reduce labor costs\n\n\nand liability. For many workers, the name on the door of the building \nwhere they work may not be the name of the company that technically \nsigns their paycheck.\n  In situations like these, where more than one entity controls or has \nthe contractual right to control the terms and conditions of \nemployment, the National Labor Relations Act and the Fair Labor \nStandards Act hold both entities responsible for violations as joint \nemployers. The joint employment standard under the NLRA ensures that \nworkers can negotiate with all parties that control the terms and \nconditions of employment. Similarly, the joint employment standard \nunder the FLSA ensures the appropriate companies can be held \naccountable for wage theft, equal pay, overtime pay, and child labor \nviolations.\n  H.R. 3441 rewrites both the NLRA and the FLSA by establishing a \nnarrow definition of joint employer that effectively eliminates \naccountability for some of the entities that are actually calling the \nshots. Under this bill, an entity may be a joint employer only if it \n``directly, actually, and immediately'' exercises control over nine \nessential terms and conditions of employment, such as hiring, firing, \ndetermining rates of pay, and scheduling.\n  However, an entity could have control over all nine of the essential \nterms, and if it indirectly exercises control through an intermediary, \nsuch as a subcontractor, then the entity would not be an employer \nbecause its control is not direct. This loophole would allow joint \nemployers to evade liability for child labor or wage theft and \nundermine workers' ability to bring all of the entities to the \nbargaining table that actually control the terms and conditions of \nemployment.\n  Alternatively, if an entity controls only eight of these nine \nessential terms and outsources the ninth, then it may also not be \ndeemed a joint employer under this legislation. That is just a \nloophole.\n  Under this legislation, an employee could have no employer liable for \na violation. This would arise when each of the joint employers raises a \ndefense that they are not liable because they are not an employer, \nbecause they don't control all nine of the essential terms and \nconditions of employment.\n  This bill provides no guidance over how many of the essential terms \nthe joint employer must control. Do they have to control two? a \nmajority? all nine?\n  The consequence is that a court could find an employee is owed \novertime, but nobody owes the money because nobody qualifies as an \nemployer under the definition of the bill. This bill opens the door for \npotential chaos. And one thing for sure, H.R. 3441 does not provide the \nclarity that its proponents advertise.\n  Today, we are debating legislation that is based on a misplaced \ncriticism of the National Labor Relations Board's 2015 decision in \nBrowning-Ferris Industries, where the NLRB held that the client \nemployer, BFI, and its staffing agency, Leadpoint, were joint employers \nat a recycling facility and, therefore, jointly had the duty to bargain \nwith the union.\n  BFI capped wages that Leadpoint could pay and set scheduling, \nreserved the right to overrule Leadpoint's hiring decisions, and, if \nthe NLRB had certified the union with only the staffing agency, \nLeadpoint, as the employer, then collective bargaining would have been \na waste of time because Leadpoint was contractually limited in its \nability to bargain without BFI's permission.\n  The BFI decision reinstated the common law definition of an employer, \na precedent that had been in place at the NLRB for decades prior to \n1984. Critics contend that the BFI case threatens the independence of \nfranchisees.\n\n\n  Well, first, the BFI decision states that it does not cover \nfranchising. Second, there are no decisions where a franchisor has ever \nbeen held to be a joint employer with its franchisees under either law.\n  Despite claims that H.R. 3441 would protect the independence of \nfranchisees, legal experts point out that, under this bill, the bill \nactually insulates franchisors from liability, which leaves the \nfranchisors free to exercise greater control over their franchisees' \nemployee relations without liability.\n  Under this bill, if a franchisor directs actions that could violate \nwage or labor laws, then the franchisee is forced to accept this shared \ncontrol, without shared responsibility. For example, suppose the \nfranchisor directs the franchisee to designate all of the employees as \nmanagers and refuse to pay them overtime and the court comes in and \nsays overtime was owed, then the franchisee is stuck with the bill \nbecause the franchisor is not an employer under this bill. That is not \nfair to small businesses and it is not fair to franchisees.\n  This legislation also creates perverse incentives by rewarding low-\nroad construction contractors who compete by outsourcing entities that \ndrive down costs by stealing wages, not paying overtime, and other \nviolations. A national coalition of construction contractors is warned \nthat H.R. 3441 would ``further tilt the field of competition against \nhonest, ethical businesses.''\n  For those reasons, Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``no'' vote, and I reserve \nthe balance of my time.", "turn": 6, "speaker": "Mr. SCOTT of Virginia", "itemno": 12}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "F000450", "text": "  Ms. FOXX.

Today is an opportunity for this \nHouse to stand up for our Nation's workers and to protect the small \nlocal businesses, which form the backbone of the American economy. \nToday is about restoring decades-old labor law. Ultimately, today is \nabout giving clarity to workers and job creators all across our \ncountry.\n  I have heard from our friends across the aisle that somehow someone \ncan be an employee without there being an employer. I call that the \nimmaculately conceived employee. There is no such thing under the law, \nnor has there ever been.\n  This bill does not change the definition of employer. It simply takes \nthe definition of joint employer back to the way it was a few years \nago.\n  It is a shame that we are even having to have this bill. But the \nactivist National Labor Relations Board in 2015 issued a decision that \nfundamentally upended labor law as we knew it. This change didn't come \nthrough the democratically elected Congress, but, instead, from a panel \nof unelected bureaucrats.\n  The NLRB's decision and the resulting regulatory agenda have caused \ndeep uncertainty among job creators. For workers, they are left to \nwonder who their boss really is. That is an incredibly confusing \nsituation to be in.\n  Under the new joint employer standard, what does it mean to have \n``indirect'' or ``potential'' control over an employee?\n  I have practiced labor and employment law for decades and I do not \nknow what that means, so I can only imagine the confusion Main Street \nbusinesses are facing due to this standard.\n  Currently, there are at least nine different legal tests nationwide \nto determine joint employer status under the Fair Labor Standards Act, \nand more to come. This patchwork of standards creates regulatory \nuncertainty, especially for job creators doing businesses in multiple \nStates.\n  So, despite what some on the other side want to believe, this is not \nan abstract issue. I have visited numerous local businesses in my \ndistrict, and they are very worried about this scheme. I have heard \nfrom workers who want to remain an employee of a locally owned business \nwith an owner who knows them, instead of becoming just another employee \nin some large corporation.\n  Clearly, I am not the only one who heard these concerns. This \nlegislation is cosponsored by 123 of my colleagues, including Members \nfrom both sides of the aisle. This is a bipartisan issue because it \nisn't about politics. Instead, it is about saving jobs and supporting \nlocally owned businesses.\n  Let me make something crystal clear: this bill does not remove a \nsingle protection for today's workforce. Despite the scare tactics \nbeing used by big labor bosses and their trial lawyer friends, the same \nimportant protections exist under this legislation, and any \nirresponsible employer can be held accountable.\n\n\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to take the side of our \nlocally owned businesses, to take the side of our small business job \ncreators, and to take the side of American workers.\n  Let's end the confusion and let's pass the Save Local Business Act.", "turn": 8, "speaker": "Mr. BYRNE", "itemno": 14}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "S000185", "text": "  Mr. SCOTT of Virginia.

Scott,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on Education & the Workforce, House \n         of Representatives.\n       Dear Chairwoman Foxx and Ranking Member Scott: On behalf of \n     the Economic Policy Institute Policy Center, we write to \n     express our strong opposition the H.R. 3441, the so-called \n     ``Save Local Business Act,'' which would do nothing to \n     protect small business owners or their workers. The Economic \n     Policy Institute is a nonprofit, nonpartisan think tank \n     founded in 1986, and our labor policy unit assesses actions \n     by Congress and federal agencies that impact workers and the \n     economy. We urge you to oppose this legislation.\n       The so-called ``Save Local Business Act'' (H.R. 3441) would \n     roll back the joint employer standards under both the \n     National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) and the Fair Labor \n     Standards Act (FLSA). It has nothing to do with protecting \n     small businesses. In fact, the bill would ensure that small \n     businesses are left with sole responsibility for business \n     practices often mandated by large corporations like \n     franchisors. It would establish a joint employer standard \n     that lets big corporations avoid liability for labor and \n     employment violations and leaves small businesses on the \n     hook.\n       Given the realities of the modern workplace, in which \n     employees often find themselves subject to more than one \n     employer, working people deserve a joint employer standard \n     that guarantees their rights and protections under basic \n     labor and employment laws. Instead, this bill would establish \n     a standard that makes it nearly impossible for workers whose \n     wages are stolen or who are fired for supporting a union to \n     get justice. By limiting employer responsibility to only \n     those firms who ``directly, actually, and immediately'' \n     exercise significant control over the essential terms and \n     conditions of employment, the bill would enable large firms \n     that contract for services to evade responsibility under both \n     the NLRA and the FLSA.\n       When two or more businesses co-determine or share control \n     over a worker's pay, schedule, or job duties, then both of \n     those businesses should be considered employers. A weak joint \n     employer standard robs workers of their rights, making it \n     impossible for them to effectively collectively bargain or \n     litigate workplace disputes--and it leaves small businesses \n     holding the bag when the large corporations that control \n     their business practices and set their employees' schedules \n     violate labor law and refuse to come to the bargaining table. \n     If this committee wishes to support small businesses and the \n     workers they employ, then it should support a strong joint \n     employer standard rather than this legislation.\n       Since the NLRB narrowed its joint employer standard in \n     1984, contingent and alternative workforce arrangements--\n     including reliance on temporary staffing firms and \n     contractors to outsource services traditionally performed by \n     in-house workers--have grown dramatically. Recent estimates \n     find that 15.8 percent of workers were engaged in alternative \n     work arrangements in late 2015, or around 24 million workers \n     in today's labor market.\n       The NLRB's 2015 decision in Browning-Ferris Industries \n     addressed this issue, requiring all firms that control the \n     terms and conditions of employment to come to the bargaining \n     table, ensuring that workers are again able to engage in \n     their right to collective bargaining. Employers already face \n     only narrow liability under Browning-Ferris, and the Board \n     would examine the specific circumstances of each case before \n     making a determination. Nothing in the decision implies that \n     all employers in a specific industry will be found to be \n     joint employers under the NLRA.\n       Similarly, the Wage & Hour Division's Administrator's \n     Interpretation on the joint employer standard under the FLSA \n     did not create any new policy; rather, it simply sought to \n     make clear for employers their responsibilities under \n     existing court law and opinion, and to provide the exact kind \n     of clarity and guidance to employers and the regulated \n     community that proponents of the H.R. 3441 purport to seek. \n     And yet, earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Labor \n     rescinded that Administrator's Interpretation, hiding it from \n     view.\n       In spite of its title, H.R. 3441 does nothing to save local \n     businesses. Instead, it saves large corporations from any \n     responsibility for violations of the FLSA and NLRA. The \n     legislation leaves small businesses and their workers without \n     meaningful recourse. We urge you, your fellow Committee \n     members, and all Members of the House of Representatives to \n     oppose this bill.\n           Sincerely,\n     Celine McNicholas,\n       Labor Counsel, Economic Policy Institute Policy Center.\n     Heidi Shierholz,\n       Senior Economist and Director of Policy, Economic Policy \n     Institute Policy Center.", "turn": 10, "speaker": "Ms. FUDGE", "itemno": 16}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                                  ____\n\n                                         International Brotherhood\n\n\n                                                 of Teamsters,\n\n                                  Washington, DC, October 3, 2017.\n     House of Representatives,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Representative: On behalf of the 1.4 million members \n     of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, I am writing \n     to express our vigorous opposition to H.R. 3441, the Save \n     Local Business Act. I strongly urge you to reject this \n     legislation.\n       H.R. 3441 seeks to legislate around a century of consistent \n     case law and established joint employer standards in labor \n     and employment law. The bill redefines the term ``employer'' \n     so narrowly that many workers will have no remedy when their \n     employers violate wage laws or their rights to organize and \n     bargain collectively. We believe the legislation will \n     encourage ``gaming the system'' so that no one exercises \n     enough control to be liable as an employer.\n       The legislation would overturn the National Labor Relations \n     Board (NLRB) Browning-Ferris decision and leave worker \n     protections weaker than they were prior to Congress adopting \n     the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) in 1935. On August \n     27, 2015, the NLRB, in its Browning Ferris Industries (BFI) \n     decision, affirmed the basic principle that two or more \n     employers are joint employers of the same employees if they \n     are both employers under common law and they ``share or co-\n     determine those matters governing the essential terms and \n     conditions of employment.'' H.R. 3441 would overturn this \n     decision and allow employers to evade their responsibility to \n     engage in meaningful collective bargaining.\n       The BFI case involves a labor-only, cost-plus staffing \n     contract under which BFI has subcontracted the employment \n     relationship only to a staffing agency, Leadpoint. BFI owns \n     the facility and equipment on which Leadpoint's employees \n     work; it directs the quality and quantity of work performed \n     by Leadpoint workers.\n       BFI oversees operations with its own personnel and retains \n     authority to approve or reject Leadpoint's workers. Leadpoint \n     can only pay its workers amounts that comply with its \n     staffing agreement with BFI. As the NLRB noted, the Union \n     ``assert(ed) that absent a change in the joint-employer \n     standard, a putative employer, like BFI, that is a necessary \n     party to meaningful collective bargaining will continue to \n     insulate itself by the `calculated restructuring of \n     employment and insertion of a contractor to insulate itself \n     from the basic legal obligation to recognize and bargain with \n     employees' representative.''\n       The NLRB joint employer decision is not a dramatic \n     departure from existing law. It does not upend business as we \n     know it, nor does it undermine the franchise business model, \n     as many have claimed. Current law balances the interests of \n     workers and employers by requiring a fact specific inquiry to \n     determine whether or not there is a joint\n\n\n     employer relationship. The NLRB joint employer decision in \n     the BFI case is fact specific and clarifies the joint \n     employment standard.\n       Workers at BFI/Leadpoint chose to exercise their right to \n     determine whether they wanted to organize and bargain \n     collectively. Workers voted and the ballots from that \n     election were impounded pending a decision in the BFI case. \n     After the NLRB issued its decision, the ballots were counted. \n     The BFI/Leadpoint workers decisively declared their desire to \n     bargain collectively by voting 4-1 in favor of Teamster \n     representation. The NLRB ruling will allow these (and other) \n     workers to negotiate with and hold accountable the employer \n     which actually controls the terms and conditions of their \n     jobs. This legislation will deny them the ability to do so.\n       Not only would H.R. 3441 overturn the BFI decision, the \n     bill would also drastically change the definition of \n     employment relationships under the Fair Labor Standards Act \n     (FLSA). The FLSA currently recognizes that more than one \n     business can be an employer. Thus, an employer cannot hide \n     behind labor contractors, brokers, or others. For example, \n     while there are many responsible employers in the \n     construction industry, it is well known that abusive schemes \n     are far too prevalent in this industry as well as others. \n     Contractors use subcontractors or labor brokers who \n     intentionally misclassify workers as independent contractors \n     or pay them ``off the books'' to the disadvantage of \n     responsible employers. We believe this legislation will serve \n     as an incentive for worker misclassification to defeat \n     employment and labor law, as well as facilitate tax \n     avoidance.\n       Because the Migrant and Seasonal Agricultural Workers \n     Protection Act (MSAWPA) refers to the definition of \n     ``employ'' in the FLSA, H.R. 3441 will have an adverse effect \n     on the ability of workers covered by the MSAWPA to \n     effectively enforce child labor laws, and seek redress for \n     wage theft and other employment abuses.\n       Again, H.R. 3441 would leave worker protections weaker than \n     when Congress adopted the FLSA in 1938.\n       This legislation will fuel a race to the bottom for \n     workers' rights, wages, benefits and workings conditions. \n     Working men and women have fought long and hard for the \n     rights and protections they now have under the National Labor \n     Relations Act and the Fair Labor Standards Act. H.R. 3441 is \n     another in a series of intensifying attacks by those who want \n     to return to the era when working men and women were without \n     rights, protections, and a voice in the workplace.\n       You will fail these workers if you do not reject H.R. 3441. \n     I hope I can tell our members that you stood with them and \n     other workers in their efforts to achieve and maintain \n     meaningful worker rights and protections. The Teamsters Union \n     urges you to vote no on H.R. 3441.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   James P.

This relationship is \nparamount to every worker's success. It is a relationship that impacts \ntheir paycheck, their schedule, their benefits, and the future of their \ncareer.\n  Unfortunately, under the Obama administration, we repeatedly saw \ngovernment bureaucrats pursue regulatory policies that harmed workers \nand small businesses. The National Labor Relations Board's decision in \nBrowning-Ferris is a prime example.\n  In that decision, the Board placed itself squarely in the middle of \nthe employer-employee relationship by redefining what it means to be a \njoint employer.\n  The Education and the Workforce Committee has been fighting to roll \nback this extreme joint employer scheme since it first took effect, and \nfor good reason. It discarded settled labor policy and blurred the \nlines of responsibility for decisions affecting the daily operations of \nlocal businesses across this country. Quite simply, the scheme is a \nthreat to jobs, entrepreneurship, and local employers across the \ncountry.\n  I have heard from small businesses and franchises across my district \nabout how the new joint employer scheme will upend small businesses, \nundermine their independence, and put jobs, livelihoods, and dreams at \nrisk.\n  It is time to settle once and for all what constitutes a joint \nemployer, not through arbitrary and misguided NLRB decisions and \nrulings by activist judges, but through legislation. The Save Local \nBusiness Act will roll back this unworkable scheme and restore the same \nstraightforward joint employer test that workers and job creators \nrelied on for decades.\n  The Save Local Business Act is about providing certainty for job \ncreators in each and every one of our districts.

As \nmy colleagues have highlighted, there are numerous unintended \nconsequences presented by this bill.\n  I want to highlight the impact on an often overlooked segment of our \nworkforce: our Nation's farmworkers.\n  Farmworkers are among our Nation's most vulnerable workers. \nFarmworkers work long hours in poor conditions for low pay. Many \nfarmworkers are undocumented and subject to severe abuse. The Migrant \nand Seasonal Agricultural Worker Protection Act is the principal labor \nstatute protecting agriculture workers and establishes wage, health, \nsafety, and recordkeeping standards for both seasonal and temporary \nfarmworkers. Joint employment standards under this law and the Fair \nLabor Standards Act are vital to protecting the rights and protections \nafforded to these workers.\n  Oftentimes, farmworkers are recruited, hired, supervised, or \ntransported by intermediaries, sometimes referred to as farm labor \ncontractors. Farm operators utilizing farm labor contractors maintain \ncontrol over working conditions seeking to ensure the financial success \nof their operation.\n  Despite this shared responsibility, farm operators may argue that the \nfarm labor contractors they engage are the farmworkers' sole employer \nresponsible for compliance. Farm labor contractors are often thinly \ncapitalized. This means if a farmworker seeks redress for a violation, \nhe or she may not be able to collect from the farm labor contractors. \nUnder the Migrant and Seasonal Agricultural Worker Protection Act, \njoint employer liability helps ensure covered workers can also hold \nliability from farm operators that share responsibility.", "turn": 15, "speaker": "Mr. ESPAILLAT", "itemno": 22}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

By amending the Fair Labor Standards Act's broad \ndefinition of ``employ'' and creating a new extremely narrow definition \nof ``joint employer,'' H.R. 3441 upends the Fair Labor Standards Act's \njoint employer framework upon which we rely on.\n  Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a statement from Farmworker \nJustice in opposition to this bill.\n\nStatememt on ``Save Local Business Act,'' House Education and Workforce \n Committee--Bruce Goldstein, President, Farmworker Justice, October 2, \n                                  2017\n\n       Farmworker Justice appreciates the opportunity to submit \n     this statement to the House Committee on Education and the \n     Workforce. Farmworker Justice, a national advocacy, education \n     and litigation organization for farmworkers founded in 1981 \n     and based in Washington, D.C. Farmworker Justice has played a \n     leading role in advocacy, education and litigation regarding \n     the joint employer concept to remedy and prevent labor \n     abuses. I am President of Farmworker Justice and have 37 \n     years of experience as an attorney, including at the National \n     Labor Relations Board, Legal Services, in private practice \n     and at this organization.\n       Farmworker Justice opposes the ``Save Local Business Act,'' \n     HR 3441 because it would remove an important mechanism to \n     protect farmworkers and other low-wage workers from suffering \n     violations of the minimum wage and child labor requirements. \n     The bill would make it extremely difficult to hold two \n     businesses jointly liable as ``joint employers'' of the same \n     worker or group of workers. This bill, if enacted, would \n     result in massive violations of the minimum wage and other \n     labor abuses that would harm farmworkers and harm the \n     reputation of the entire agricultural sector.\n       This bill, if enacted, would reverse more than 130 years of \n     knowledge developed in the\n\n\n     quest to eradicate sweatshops. The Fair Labor Standards Act \n     of 1938, which sets minimum wage, overtime, and child labor \n     standards, adopted a definition of employment relationships \n     based on 50 years of experience under state laws that evolved \n     to address employers' efforts to evade child labor and other \n     labor laws.\n       During the mid- to late-1800's states adopted laws to \n     regulate and limit the hours of employment of children and \n     quickly confronted employers' efforts to evade the laws. \n     Business owners that operated a manufacturing plant would \n     claim that the children in the plant were employed solely by \n     a subcontractor within the plant or had been brought to the \n     plant by a parent or sibling and therefore should not be \n     considered to have ``employed'' the child. Even if the \n     subcontractor or parent were punished, in the absence of \n     liability on the part of the plant operator it would suffer \n     no adverse impact and would be free to find another \n     subcontractor or parent to bring children to do the work. In \n     addition, often a labor contractor lack sufficient assets to \n     pay a court judgement, leaving workers remedy-less.\n       One of the responses of state legislatures was to adopt a \n     broad definition of employment relationships that imposed \n     employer status on the larger business owner even where there \n     existed a labor intermediary. Numerous states adopted \n     language defining employment relationships that later became \n     the model for the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938.\n       The state laws and the FLSA defined employers as entities \n     that directly or indirectly employed a worker and defined the \n     word ``employ'' as including not just the restrictive common \n     law definition's ``right to control test'' but also as ``to \n     suffer or permit to work.'' 29 USC Sec. 203(g). To ``suffer'' \n     in this context means to acquiesce in, passively allow or to \n     fail to prevent the worker's work.\n       This broad definition imposed liability on a company that \n     had the power to prevent the work of the worker from \n     happening and denied the business the ability to hide its \n     head in the sand about what was happening in its business, \n     including where it utilized labor contractors or other \n     intermediaries which were considered employers of those \n     workers. See Goldstein et al., ``Enforcing Fair Labor \n     Standards in the Modern American Sweatshop: Rediscovering the \n     Statutory Definition of Employment,'' 46 UCLA Law Review 983 \n     (1999). The purpose of establishing joint responsibility is \n     also reflected in FLSA's definition of ``employer,'' 29 USC \n     Sec. 203(d), `` 'Employer' includes any person acting \n     directly or indirectly in the interest of an employer in \n     relation to an employee.''\n       The facts in the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in \n     Rutherford Food Corp. v. McComb, 331 U.S. 722 (1947) \n     illustrate the concept. A slaughterhouse company retained a \n     contractor to assemble a crew of workers to de-bone meat in a \n     special room within the slaughterhouse. The Department of \n     Labor sued the defendant company for recordkeeping and \n     overtime violations. The company denied that it employed the \n     meat de-boners, arguing that the contractor was their sole \n     employer. The Court found that the definition of employment \n     relationships in the FLSA imposed liability on the \n     slaughterhouse.\n       The Save Local Business Act would alter the longstanding \n     meaning of employment relationships under the FLSA and the \n     National Labor Relations Act. The NLRA excludes agricultural \n     workers from its protections, so I will focus on the FLSA. \n     The FLSA's minimum wage applies to farmworkers on most (but \n     not all) larger farms; small farms generally are excluded \n     from the minimum wage. 29 USC 213(a)(6). Agricultural workers \n     are excluded from overtime pay. 29 USC Sec. 213(b)(13)-(16). \n     FLSA prohibits certain types of child labor although it \n     allows large agricultural employers, as well as small family \n     farms, to employ children at younger ages than is allowed in \n     other occupations. Id. at (c)(1)-(2).\n       The bill would set criteria so onerous that it would be \n     rare for two businesses that shared responsibilities \n     regarding workers to be held to be joint employers; just one \n     business would be held to be an employer. Because the Migrant \n     and Seasonal Agricultural Worker Protection Act (AWPA) refers \n     to the definition of ``employ'' in the Fair Labor Standards \n     Act, the proposed law may also apply to AWPA. 29 USC \n     Sec. 1802(5). AWPA is the principal federal employment law \n     for farmworkers, regulating employment contracts and the use \n     of farm labor contractors.\n       Many agricultural workers suffer violations of the Fair \n     Labor Standards Act's minimum wage and other basic labor \n     protections. Often, when such workers try to remedy illegal \n     employment practices, they run into a problem: the farm \n     operator that really determines their job terms and has the \n     capacity to prevent abuses, denies that it is their \n     ``employer'' for purposes of the minimum wage and other labor \n     protections. Instead, the farm operator claims that a ``farm \n     labor contractor'' or other intermediary is the sole \n     ``employer'' of the farmworkers on its farm. Often a labor \n     contractor competes for business by promising low labor costs \n     and when sued by victimized workers cannot afford to pay a \n     court judgment.\n       In most such cases, the definition of employment \n     relationships in the FLSA enables courts and the Department \n     of Labor to ensure compliance with the law by considering the \n     farm operator and the farm labor contractor to be ``joint \n     employers'' and jointly responsible for meeting FLSA's \n     obligations. This issue has been the subject of numerous \n     lawsuits in which farm operators have been held to be joint \n     employers with their farm labor contractors.\n       This Committee played a historic role in addressing abuses \n     of migrant workers at the hands of farm operators and their \n     labor contractors and recognized the importance of the joint \n     employer concept in ensuring a law-abiding, prosperous \n     agricultural sector. The Farm Labor Contractor Registration \n     Act of 1964 was passed in part in response to the powerful \n     documentary by Edward R. Murrow, ``Harvest of Shame'' that \n     aired during Thanksgiving weekend in 1960. Congress revised \n     its provisions and replaced it with the Migrant and Seasonal \n     Agricultural Worker Protection Act of 1983, 29 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 1801 et seq. At the heart of this Committee's motivation \n     was ensuring joint employer responsibility.\n       ``This broad scope of joint employment--and joint employer \n     liability--is one of the AWPA's most important features. The \n     AWPA's legislative history indicates that Congress considered \n     the joint employer doctrine ``a central foundation'' of this \n     new law. 29 C.F.R. Sec. 500.20(h)(5)(ii); citing House \n     Report, n.2 at 4552. It is the ``indivisible hinge'' that \n     allows workers to hold accountable all those responsible for \n     violating the AWPA's protections. Id, citing H.R. Rep. 97-\n     885, 97th Cong., 2d Sess.1, reprinted in 1982 U.S.C.C.A.N. \n     4547, 4552 (1982) (``House Report'').\n       The economic reality is that few farm operators will risk \n     their profitability and the survival of their business by \n     delegating all responsibility to a labor contractor. Most \n     farm operators who engage labor intermediaries exercise \n     substantial decision-making regarding the impact of \n     subcontracted workers on their business. If strawberries or \n     grapes are harvested when they are over-ripe or under-ripe, \n     are subjected to pathogens transmitted on the footwear or \n     hands of farmworkers, or are not handled carefully to prevent \n     bruising, huge financial losses could result. A farm operator \n     generally makes these and other major decisions to ensure its \n     profitability, even if it uses a farm labor contractor, \n     instead of its own supervisor, to ensure that its decisions \n     are carried out. Such farm operators should not be able to \n     avoid complying with the minimum wage or child labor \n     requirements by blaming a labor contractor as the sole \n     employer. In most cases, there is shared responsibility among \n     the farm operator and the labor contractor so that the \n     workers on the farm ensure the profitability of that \n     business. That shared responsibility means shared liability \n     is appropriate.\n       The joint employer concept does not deprive farms or other \n     businesses of the ability or right to engage labor \n     contractors or other intermediaries such as staffing \n     agencies. Nor does it prevent businesses from entering into \n     agreements that require labor contractors to comply with all \n     employment-law obligations, purchase liability insurance \n     against employment-law claims and hold the larger business \n     harmless for any litigation and liability that may result.\n       Joint employer liability creates an incentive to ensure \n     that a business selects its labor contractors, as well as its \n     directly-hired supervisors, wisely and ensures compliance \n     with employment laws. In addition to ensuring protections for \n     workers, joint employer liability helps protect law-abiding \n     businesses from unfair competition by unscrupulous employers \n     that keep their labor costs low by using labor contractors \n     that violate employment-related obligations. The joint \n     employer concept is an important, longstanding approach to \n     minimizing sweatshops and its elimination would result in a \n     return to an era in which sweatshops are more prevalent.\n       The joint employer concept also helps create consumer \n     confidence regarding their purchases. People want to feel \n     good about the food they eat. Agriculture has a reputation \n     for poor treatment of farmworkers that would be exacerbated \n     by the increases in abuses that would flow from this \n     legislation.\n       Congress should reject the Save Local Business Act because \n     it contradicts 130 years of experience in preventing \n     sweatshops in factories and at least 50 years of consensus \n     regarding policies needed to remedy and prevent abuses of the \n     people who labor on our farms and ranches to produce our \n     food.\n", "turn": 18, "speaker": "Mr. ESPAILLAT", "itemno": 25}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "F000450", "text": "  Ms. FOXX.

For \ndecades, a joint employer relationship existed when one company \nexercised ``direct and immediate'' control over another company's \nworkforce.\n  However, as you know, under the case Browning-Ferris Industries, the \nNLRB departed from many years of legal precedent in August of 2015 by \nestablishing a new, expanded joint employer standard. This standard \ncould trigger employer liability by a company exercising vaguely \ndefined indirect control over an employee.\n  We have heard from local businesses from my district and across the \nState of Texas, and it is clear that this decision is causing them \nsignificant confusion.\n  In my district--let's say in Laredo, Texas, there is a local \nrestaurant owner who says that his restaurant currently employs close \nto 1,000 local employees.\n\n\n  This expanded joint employer standard has limited his investment in \nhis business and the number of workers that he has.

Paul Ryan,\n     House of Representatives,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Nancy Pelosi,\n     House of Representatives,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon.

Scott,\n     House of Representatives,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Speaker Ryan, Leader Pelosi, Chairwoman Foxx and \n     Ranking Member Scott: The undersigned organizations write in \n     opposition to H.R. 3441, the so-called Save Local Business \n     Act, which would amend the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) \n     and the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) to prevent \n     workers from holding more than one employer jointly \n     accountable for wage theft, child labor, equal pay \n     violations, or unfair labor practices even when the employers \n     jointly exercise and share control over working conditions.\n       Under our nation's long-standing laws dating back as far as \n     the late 1800s, employers who share control with their \n     subcontractors over working conditions may also share \n     accountability as joint employers for violations of workers' \n     rights so that they will provide better oversight of working \n     conditions, and in so doing, ensure broader compliance with \n     basic labor and employment laws.\n       H.R. 3441 seeks to dramatically narrow the long-standing \n     definitions of ``employer'' in the FLSA and NLRA and it is \n     neither good for workers nor for law-abiding businesses.\n\n\n H.R. 3441 opens the door to widespread wage theft and worker harms in \n   occupations across the economy, including in our nation's growth \n                               industries\n\n       The bill would undermine protections for millions of \n     workers across the economy, especially in low-wage sectors \n     where subcontracting is common: construction, agriculture, \n     garment, janitorial, home care, delivery and logistics, \n     warehousing, retail, temp and staffing, and manufacturing, \n     just to name a few.\n       Wage theft and other workplace dangers are prevalent in \n     many of these jobs, and even under current law, millions of \n     workers today are no longer sure who their boss is--and \n     indeed, have no way to navigate the intricacies of companies' \n     contracting relationships to ascertain who is responsible for \n     workplace violations. When there's no clear line of \n     accountability, work conditions are more likely to \n     deteriorate: pay declines, wage theft increases, and \n     workplace injuries rise. In addition, outsourced jobs pay \n     less--sometimes as much as 30 percent less--than in-house \n     jobs, likely due to a lack of worker and subcontractor \n     bargaining power. In today's economy, we should be looking \n     for ways to increase workers' pay and economic security, not \n     laying the groundwork for more sweatshops.\n       When a subcontractor cannot pay, joint employer standards \n     ensure that workers have remedies against the contracting \n     company for the legal violations. Workers should be able to \n     recover when cheated out of wages, exposed to dangerous \n     working conditions, or otherwise treated unlawfully.\n        This bill would also impede workers from bringing equal \n     pay claims to close the gender pay gap. Because the Equal Pay \n     Act is a part of the FLSA, and uses the FLSA's definition of \n     an employer, H.R. 3441 would make it harder for subcontracted \n     workers to hold their employers accountable for gender-based \n     pay discrimination.\n\n\n    The bill actually hurts, not helps, law-abiding small businesses\n\n       Although framed as a bill to help protect the independence \n     of small businesses, including those that operate as \n     franchisees, the bill would in fact insulate corporations, \n     including franchisors, from liability. Unscrupulous \n     businesses that employ abusive labor contractors to cheat \n     workers would gain a competitive advantage over law-abiding \n     businesses. In addition, franchisees whose business practices \n     are all but dictated to them by larger corporations will be \n     hung out to dry for decisions that aren't their own, without \n     any indemnification from the entity that often all but forces \n     labor and employment violations on them.\n       Corporations that engage low-road contractors and then look \n     the other way gain an unfair advantage over companies that \n     play by the rules, resulting in a race to the bottom that \n     rewards cheaters. It's one reason why the job quality of what \n     were formerly middle-class jobs in America is suffering \n     today. Working people struggle enough in today's economy.\n       Don't let Congress make this worse by legislatively rigging \n     the system in favor of corporations that don't care about the \n     workers who build their businesses. Oppose H.R. 3441.\n           Sincerely,\n         9to5 Colorado; 9to5 Wisconsin; 9to5, National Assoc of \n           Working Women; A Better Balance; Advocates for Basic \n           Legal Equality, Inc.; AFL-CIO; American Federation of \n           State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME); \n           American Federation of Teachers, AFL-CIO; Arizona \n           Employment Lawyers Association; Asian American Legal \n           Defense and Education Fund; Barkan Meizlish LLP; \n           Bricklayers & Allied Craftsmen Local 3 MA/ME/NH/RI; \n           California Employment Lawyers Association; Center for \n           Law and Social Policy (CLASP); Center for Popular \n           Democracy; Center for Worker Justice of Eastern Iowa.\n         Centro de los Derechos del Migrante, Inc.

Contractors use subcontractors or labor \n     brokers that either pay their employees off the books or \n     intentionally misclassify them as 1099 subcontractors.

Robert C. Scott,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on Education and the Workforce, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chair Foxx and Ranking Member Scott: I write to \n     respectfully express our opposition to HR 3441, the Save \n     Local Business Act, because it will provide a safe haven for \n     unscrupulous contractors in the construction industry who use \n     a system of subcontractors to deliberately shield themselves \n     from liability for abusing workers and stealing jobs away \n     from law-abiding businesses, even as they knowingly profit \n     from it.\n       Regrettably, while most companies in the construction \n     industry are legitimate, responsible employers, we are also \n     home to many who excel in illegal employment practices. This \n     fact is well known and widely acknowledged. The trend is for \n     contractors to use subcontractors or labor brokers who either \n     intentionally misclassify employees as independent \n     contractors or, more often, pay employees off the books. They \n     find two benefits in their schemes. First, through violating \n     wage, tax, immigration, workers' compensation and other \n     employment laws, they can shave up to 30 percent off of their \n     labor costs and underbid law-abiding businesses. Second, if \n     laws are enforced, contractors use the subcontract \n     relationship as a shield against liability and replace \n     offending subcontractors or labor brokers with others that \n     will do the same.\n       There is one vulnerability to their schemes. Under the Fair \n     Labor Standards Act (FLSA) and National Labor Relations Act \n     (NLRA) these contractors are frequently joint employers with \n     their subcontractors or labor brokers. The contractors keep \n     time, supply building materials, discharge workers, provide \n     training and daily supervision.\n       H.R. 3441 closes that door by making it exceedingly \n     difficult to find joint-employer liability. Under the bill, \n     businesses cannot be joint employers unless they have direct, \n     actual and immediate control over the essential terms and \n     conditions of employment--a remarkable reversal of decades of \n     law. Moreover, a contractor and labor broker need only split \n     up responsibility over essential terms, and joint employment \n     is defeated. Indeed, it is arguable that under such an \n     arrangement there may be no employer at all.\n       It cannot be forgotten that construction contractors that \n     scheme to cheat workers out of overtime, wages and the right \n     to collective action also fail to comply with federal and \n     state employment tax laws. In Texas alone federal tax losses \n     from cheating contractors has been estimated to cost the \n     federal government over 81 billion.\n       This is not to suggest that legitimate, law-abiding \n     contractors should not use subcontractors, or that there are \n     not thousands of legitimate, law-abiding contractors and \n     independent contractors across this country. But it must be \n     recognized that abusive subcontracting schemes as described \n     above are also prevalent in our industry and that this bill \n     would make it even harder to crack down on these illegal \n     practices.\n       Despite its name, HR 3441 is a blue print to violate the \n     law and drive law-abiding employers out of business and make \n     it more difficult for working men and women to reach the \n     middle class. The law needs to protect workers and \n     responsible businesses--not put them in jeopardy.\n           Very truly yours,\n                                              Douglas J.

This \nbill lets corporations keep wages low by subcontracting out their work. \nThey are subcontracting their conscience to put profits over people.\n  This bill makes it nearly impossible for workers to hold temporary \nstaffing agencies responsible for unfair labor practices or wage theft. \nIt denies employees a voice in the workplace. It prevents workers from \njoining unions, collective bargaining, which go ultimately to help \nraise wages.\n  We should be lifting workers' wages up, not trying to crush them.\n  I will remind our colleagues that, from 1930 to 1984, the courts were \nthe ones who were making these joint employer decisions, and it was \nRonald Reagan's administration who first made this change. It was the \nReagan administration who first made this change.\n  The Obama administration brought it back to where it was, yet, \napparently, people are forgetting those very important facts.\n  Mr. Speaker, that is why I urge my colleagues to vote against this \ncrush local workers act.", "turn": 28, "speaker": "Mr. NORCROSS", "itemno": 37}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "F000450", "text": "  Ms. FOXX.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. \n3441, the Save Local Business Act.\n  Mr. Speaker, this debate boils down to whether we want local \nentrepreneurship and community engagement through the franchise model \nor a one-size-fits-all, top-down model.\n  When I served as chairman of the HELP Subcommittee, we heard \ntestimony about the effect of this new joint employer standard from Mr. \nEd Braddy, who owns a Burger King in inner-city Baltimore. Many of the \nmen Mr. Braddy hires to work at his store have had a run-in with the \ncriminal justice system, and several of the women he hires has been on \nsome form of government assistance.\n  He hires people to give them an opportunity at a better life, as he \ndescribed it.\n  If the new joint employer standard proceeds, the Burger King \ncorporation will be liable for many of the hiring decisions that are \nmade by Mr. Braddy. Why would we expect any corporation to know a \ncommunity better than someone like Mr. Braddy, who grew up there? \nShouldn't we expect that a corporate entity would be more risk averse \nand less likely to give people a second chance?\n  Think about the incredible story Mr. Braddy has to tell. He dropped \nout of high school in the 11th grade before returning when his life was \nheaded in the wrong direction, according to him. He joined the \nBaltimore Police Department, and then he began working in a Burger \nKing.

Take a stand for equal pay, \nfor equal work.\n  Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from our labor leaders \nrejecting H.R. 3441.\n\n                                                    July 28, 2017.\n       Dear Representative: We, the undersigned unions \n     representing millions of American workers, are writing to \n     urge you to not support H.R. 3441, the joint employer bill \n     introduced by Representatives Bradley Byrne and Chairwoman \n     Virginia Foxx of the House Committee on Education and the \n     Workforce, which would eliminate the National Labor Relation \n     Board's (NLRB) decision in Browning-Ferris, and greatly \n     restrict the definition of employer under the Fair Labor \n     Standards Act. Congress should be working to strengthen the \n     rights of working people and raise wages. The legislation \n     would accomplish the opposite.\n       Over the past few decades, the middle class has been \n     struggling to stay afloat. As wages have often been stagnant \n     or declining, more and more companies have used middlemen \n     from staffing agencies, labor contractors and to \n     subcontractors to maintain low wages, avoid accountability \n     and prevent a large percentage of workers from organizing. It \n     is important that when workers try to remedy illegal \n     employment practices or organize to join a union that the \n     party calling the shots is at the table and part of the \n     remedy. And indeed, the current state of the law under both \n     under the National Labor Relations Act and the FSLA balances \n     the interests of workers and employers by requiring a fact \n     specific inquiry to determine whether or not there is a joint \n     employer relationship.\n       This bill seeks to legislate around a century of consistent \n     case law and established joint employer standards in labor \n     and employment law. It redefines the term 'employer' so \n     narrowly that many workers will have no remedy when their \n     employers violate their union rights or wage laws.\n       The legislation would overturn the Browning Ferris NLRB \n     decision, a case which found a joint employer relationship \n     between Browning Ferris and Leadpoint their subcontractor. In \n     this case, Browning-Ferris, Inc. (BFI), the employer, \n     controlled the speed of the conveyor belt where employees of \n     contractor Leadpoint sorted materials, prohibited Leadpoint \n     from raising wages above a specified cap without BFI's \n     permission, and determined the shift times and the number of \n     people on shifts. Since Leadpoint was unable to negotiate \n     these employment terms among others without BFI approval, the \n     NLRB found BFI must be at the bargaining table along with its \n     subcontractor in order for the union to negotiate a \n     meaningful collective bargaining agreement. The decision was \n     fact specific and in keeping with the realities of today's \n     workplace.\n       Further, the bill would drastically change the definition \n     of employment relationships under the FLSA which recognizes \n     that more than one business can be an employer. Currently, \n     under the FLSA employers cannot hide behind labor contractors \n     or franchisees, when they set critical conditions of \n     employment. Because the Migrant and Seasonal Agricultural \n     Worker Protection Act refers to the definition of ``employ'' \n     in the FLSA, this bill will also impact farm workers seeking \n     to redress wage theft and other employment abuses. It is the \n     FLSA definition of employ that has allowed workers to \n     effectively enforce child labor and other laws and to \n     effectively address sweatshops for decades. Today, it is this \n     definition that offers workers hope that when they organize \n     for a union and better wages that the party that can actually \n     effectuate change is at the table.\n       We urge you to weigh the interests of workers and stand \n     with them in opposing legislation that would rollback the \n     NLRB's decision and restrict workers' rights under the law.\n           Sincerely,\n     International Brotherhood of Teamsters (IBT).\n     Service Employees International Union (SEIU).\n     United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement \n     Workers of America (UAW).\n     United Farm Workers of\n\n\n     America (UFW).\n     United Food & Commercial Workers International Union (UFCW).\n     United Steelworkers (USW).\n", "turn": 38, "speaker": "Ms. DeLAURO", "itemno": 47}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "F000450", "text": "  Ms. FOXX.

This ill-conceived bill would \n     make it more difficult for workers to join together and \n     collectively bargain to improve working conditions and raise \n     living standards. This is a bad bill for working people \n     because it would make it even easier for businesses to \n     replace full time jobs with precarious temporary employment.\n       H.R. 3441 overturns long established case law and joint \n     employer standards found in labor and employment law. It does \n     this by redefining the term `employer' in a way that would \n     make it nearly impossible for workers to hold their employers \n     accountable when their rights are violated.\n       Disturbingly, businesses and large corporations throughout \n     our economy have avoided responsibility to their employees by \n     hiding behind staffing agencies to claim they are not \n     technically their employer. The net result for working people \n     has been lower wages and fewer job protections. For example, \n     within the auto parts manufacturing sector, the National \n     Employment Law Project (NELP) estimates that temporary \n     workers earn, on average, 29% less than direct employees of \n     manufacturers. We have seen how, in the automotive sector, \n     multinational corporations often hire temporary workers, who \n     work side by side, doing the same job, for years, with full \n     time workers and earning significantly less.\n       H.R. 3441 would also overturn the National Labor Relations \n     Board's (NLRB) in Browning-Ferris. The Browning-Ferris \n     decision was good for working families because it established \n     that workers could negotiate with their true employer under \n     fact specific circumstances. In that case, a subcontractor \n     for Browning-Ferris Industries (BFI), Leadpoint, was unable \n     to negotiate several basic employment terms without \n     permission from BFI. The NLRB sensibly found that BFI must be \n     at the bargaining table along with its subcontractor \n     Leadpoint. Under the terms of this bill, that would not be \n     the case when similar disputes arise in the future.\n       Economic inequality and a shortage of good paying jobs has \n     hurt working people and our economy for decades. \n     Unfortunately, H.R. 3441 would make a bad situation worse. \n     Congress should reject this bill and instead work to create \n     more jobs you can sustain a family on.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Josh Nassar,\n                                             Legislative Director.\n", "turn": 46, "speaker": "Ms. KAPTUR", "itemno": 55}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "K000009", "text": "  Ms. KAPTUR.

In fact, \n     H.R. 3441 rolls back worker protections so they are weaker \n     than when Congress adopted the National Labor Relations Act \n     in 1935 and the Fair Labor Standards Act in 1938. It is \n     harmful legislation that will undermine workers' pay and \n     protections on the job.\n       Browning Ferris concerned a group of workers on a recycling \n     line at a facility owned and operated by Browning Ferris. The \n     workers were supplied by a staffing agency--Leadpoint. \n     Browning Ferris controlled the facility, set the hours of \n     operation, dictated the speed of the recycling line, \n     indirectly supervised the line workers, and had authority \n     over numerous other conditions of employment. In order to \n     ensure that the employees' right to form a union and bargain \n     over workplace issues was protected, the NLRB held that \n     Browning Ferris was a joint employer of the line workers \n     along with Leadpoint. This fact-intensive decision reflected \n     the realities of the arrangement at Browning Ferris and was \n     rightly decided in order for the line workers to have a \n     meaningful right to bargain over their terms and conditions \n     of employment.\n       Before the ink was dry on the Browning-Ferris decision, \n     business groups and Republicans in Congress began attacking \n     the decision, claiming it dramatically changed the law and \n     undermined the franchise business model. (Browning Ferris is \n     not a franchise case, a fact specifically noted by the NLRB \n     in its decision).\n       In our view, these attacks on the Browning Ferris decision \n     are overblown and misguided. In today's fragmented \n     workplaces, with perma-temps, contracted workers, agency \n     employees, and subcontracting becoming ever more prevalent, \n     it is more important than ever to make sure our laws protect \n     workers and ensure they receive the wages they are due and \n     that their right to join with their co-workers to bargain for \n     improvements on the job is protected.\n       H.R. 3441 takes the law in the opposite direction, \n     radically changing both the National Labor Relations Act and \n     the Fair Labor Standards Act by instituting a new test for \n     finding employers to be joint employers that is more \n     restrictive than any agency or court has ever adopted. As a \n     practical matter, the legislation eliminates joint employment \n     from the NLRA and the Fair Labor Standards Act, meaning that \n     many workers in subcontracting or staffing agency \n     arrangements will be left without recourse for wage theft and \n     will have no meaningful bargaining rights. The bill weakens \n     worker protections and allows corporations to evade their \n     responsibilities under the law.\n       We urge you to reject this harmful and misguided proposal.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                               William Samuel,\n\n                                                         Director,\n                                    Government Affairs Department.\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 64}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "F000450", "text": "  Ms. FOXX.

Paul Ryan,\n     Speaker of the House,\n     House of Representatives, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Nancy Pelosi,\n     Minority Leader,\n     House of Representatives, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Speaker and Leader Pelosi: I am writing on behalf \n     of the Signatory Wall and Ceiling Contractors Alliance \n     (SWACCA) to express our strong opposition to H.R. 3441, the \n     ``Save Local Business Act.'' This legislation will not \n     benefit honest small businesses that create good jobs with \n     family-sustaining wages and benefits. It will actually place \n     such employers at a permanent competitive disadvantage to \n     unscrupulous companies that seek to thrive solely at the \n     expense of their workers and taxpayer-funded social safety-\n     net programs.\n       SWACCA is a national alliance of wall and ceiling \n     contractors committed to working in partnership with our \n     workers and our customers to provide the highest-quality, \n     most efficient construction services. Through the superior \n     training, skill, and efficiency of our workers SWACCA \n     contractors are able to provide both cost-effective \n     construction services and middle class jobs with health and \n     retirement benefits. Our organization prides itself on \n     representing companies that accept responsibility for paying \n     fair wages, abiding by health and safety standards, workers \n     compensation laws, and unemployment insurance requirements.\n       Unfortunately, however, we increasingly find ourselves \n     bidding against companies that seek to compete solely on the \n     basis of labor costs. They do so by relieving themselves of \n     the traditional obligations associated with being an \n     employer. The news is littered with examples of contractors \n     who have sought to reduce costs by willfully violating the \n     laws governing minimum wage, overtime, workers compensation \n     unemployment insurance, and workplace safety protections. The \n     key to this disturbing business model is a cadre of labor \n     brokers who claim to provide a company with an entire \n     workforce that follows them to job after job. It is a \n     workforce that the actual wall or ceiling contractor controls \n     as a practical matter, but for which it takes no legal \n     responsibility. In this model workers receive no benefits, \n     are rarely covered by workers compensation or unemployment \n     insurance, and are frequently not paid\n\n\n     in compliance with federal and state wage laws. The joint \n     employment doctrine is an important means for forcing these \n     unscrupulous contractors to compete on a level playing field \n     and to be held accountable for the unlawful treatment of the \n     workers they utilize.\n       As an association representing large, medium, and small \n     businesses, we oppose H.R. 3441 because it proposes a \n     radical, unprecedented re-definition of joint employment \n     under both the FLSA and the NLRA that goes far beyond \n     reversing the standard articulated by the NLRB in Browning-\n     Ferris or returning to any concept of joint employment that \n     has ever existed under the FLSA since the Act's passage. H.R. \n     3441's radical and unprecedented redefinition of joint \n     employment would proliferate the use of fly-by-night labor \n     brokers by ensuring that no contractor using a workforce \n     provided by a labor broker would ever be deemed a joint \n     employer. This is because the bill precludes a finding of \n     joint employment unless a company controls each ``of the \n     essential terms and conditions of employment (including \n     hiring employees, discharging employees, determining \n     individual employee rates of pay and benefits, day-to-day \n     supervision of employees, assigning individual work \n     schedules, positions and tasks, and administering employee \n     discipline)''. H.R. 3441 goes further by expressly \n     countenancing a company using labor brokers retaining control \n     of the essential aspects of the workers' employment in a \n     ``limited and routine manner'' without facing any risk of \n     being a joint employer.\n       Simply put, H.R. 3441 would create a standard that would \n     surely accelerate a race to the bottom in the construction \n     industry and many other sectors of the economy. It would \n     further tilt the field of competition against honest, ethical \n     businesses. Any concerns about the prior administration's \n     recently-rescinded interpretative guidance on joint \n     employment under the FLSA or the NLRB's joint employment \n     doctrine enunciated in Browning-Ferris can be addressed in a \n     far more responsible manner. Make no mistake, H.R. 3441 does \n     not return the law to any prior precedents or standards. It \n     creates a radical, new standard. This standard will help \n     unethical employers get rich not by creating more value, but \n     instead by ensuring their ability to treat American workers \n     as a permanent pool of low-wage, subcontracted labor that has \n     neither benefits nor any meaningful recourse against them \n     under our nation's labor and employment laws.\n       On behalf of the membership of SWACCA, thank you in advance \n     for your attention to our concerns about this legislation. \n     Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any \n     questions or require additional information.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Timothy J.

Mr. Speaker, this is the final amendment to the bill. \nIt will not kill the bill or send it back to committee. If adopted, the \nbill will immediately proceed to final passage, as amended.\n  Mr. Speaker, the bill we are debating today is another assault on \nhardworking Americans who are desperately trying to put food on the \ntable for their families, scrape together enough money to pay for child \ncare, and have a roof over their heads.\n  My colleagues on the other side of the aisle are saying that they \nneed this bill to save local businesses. We all support local \nbusinesses in our community. But my colleagues suggest that unless they \npass this law, franchisors will become joint employers. Well, if they \nact like franchisors and control brands and standards, and they don't \ndo things like hire, fire, and supervise the franchisees' employees, \nthey won't be. In other words, if they act like a franchisor and not an \nemployer, they won't be considered a joint employer.\n  In fact, this bill could actually harm franchisees and take away \ntheir independence because it would allow franchisors to indirectly \ncontrol the labor relations of its franchisees, but be insulated from \nliability for violations that might arise from that control.\n  Now, my amendment would require that if a franchisor directs a \nfranchisee to take an unlawful action that would violate labor laws, \nthen the franchisor shall be considered a joint employer for the \npurpose of the violation.\n  In other words, if a franchisor acts like an employer, then they \nshould be held accountable for their actions as an employer. Workers \nmust be able to get their hard-earned overtime pay and the wages they \nare owed. This is common sense.\n  This motion would protect small businesses, promote the independence \nof franchisees, and, importantly, cure the defect in the bill that \ninsulates franchisors from liability for exercising control over their \nfranchisees' labor or employment relations.\n  Mr. Speaker, this legislation currently is an attack on workers' \nrights.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to adopt my amendment, and I yield \nback the balance of my time.", "turn": 91, "speaker": "Ms. BONAMICI", "itemno": 102}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "F000450", "text": "  Ms. FOXX.
