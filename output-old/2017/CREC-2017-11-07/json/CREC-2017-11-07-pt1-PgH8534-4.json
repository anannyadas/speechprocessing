Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Diwali, known \nas the Festival of Lights, and to recognize the Hindu New Year.\n  The Hindu community comes together wearing their finest clothing to \ncelebrate this occasion. Families prepare for Goddess Lakshmi's arrival \nweeks in advance by decorating their porches with colorful designs, or \nrangoli; preparing sweets and savories; and lighting divos. On the \nnight before Diwali, they light divos, symbolically asking Bhagwan to \nexpel their ignorance and enlighten their souls. Lights, candles, and \nfireworks are an integral part of the festivities.\n  I was honored to be able to attend multiple celebrations at the BAPS \nmandirs in my district in Levittown, Warrington, and Souderton. As I \ntraveled from celebration to celebration, I got to share in the \nabsolute joy of my constituents as they celebrated with friends and \nwith family. I was moved to be asked to participate in the lighting \nceremonies, and I was in awe of the beauty of the festivals.\n  Mr. Speaker, I am proud to represent a district that is so diverse \nand so rich in its culture.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. FITZPATRICK", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "181", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H8534", "wkday": "Tuesday", "day": "7", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "RECOGNIZING DIWALI AND HINDU NEW YEAR", "id": "CREC-2017-11-07-pt1-PgH8534-4", "title": "RECOGNIZING DIWALI AND HINDU NEW YEAR"}
