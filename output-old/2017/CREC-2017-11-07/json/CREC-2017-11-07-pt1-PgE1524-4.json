Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the career \nachievements of Carlos G. Mendoza, the U.S. Small Business \nAdministration's Fresno District Director. Mr. Mendoza retired on Nov. \n3, 2017 after more than 40 years of federal service. He has worked \ntirelessly in his career for small businesses and community \ndevelopment.\n  Mr. Mendoza began his federal civil service career in 1975 as an \narchitect at the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard. He is a graduate of the \nUniversity of California, Berkeley and has advanced degrees from \nPrinceton University and California State University, East Bay. After \nsuccessfully completing several assignments for the U.S. Navy, he \ntransferred to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development and \nquickly rose into the managerial ranks.\n  In 1992, Mr. Mendoza began his term with the U.S. Small Business \nAdministration, becoming the Deputy District Director of the Los \nAngeles District office before serving as District Director in El Paso \nand Fresno. As District Director in Fresno, he was responsible for \nsmall business development in Central California and the Central Coast. \nHe expanded resources in the Central Valley, bringing in the Emerging \nLeaders mini MBA program, several PRIME grants, a Women's Business \nCenter and the Small Business Development Center.\n  Mr. Mendoza is known for his passion to make a difference. His work \nhas received recognition from the Environmental Protection Agency, the \nSmall Business Administration, the Department of Housing and Urban \nDevelopment, the Chambers of Commerce and the North American \nDevelopment Bank. For example, during The Great Recession in 2008, he \nwas the first person in the country to offer a dedicated technical \nassistance phone line to respond to small business owner's needs. This \naccomplishment helped shift the focus from the lack of loans to an \nemphasis on ``small business survival skills.''\n  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing the career \nachievements of Carlos G. Mendoza. I congratulate Mr. Mendoza for his \nmany accomplishments throughout his career and ask that you join me in \nwishing him and his wife Lydia, continued success and happiness.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. COSTA", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 3}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "181", "extension": true, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "E1524", "wkday": "Tuesday", "day": "7", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "HONORING THE CAREER OF CARLOS MENDOZA", "id": "CREC-2017-11-07-pt1-PgE1524-4", "title": "HONORING THE CAREER OF CARLOS MENDOZA"}
