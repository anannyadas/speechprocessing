Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 3634, the Securing \nElectronic Records for Veterans' Ease Act of 2017, or SERVE Act.\n  Under the post-9/11 GI Bill, eligible servicemembers, veterans, and \ntheir dependents are provided a monthly allowance that is based on the \ncost of living where they are taking the majority of their classes at \nthe E-5 with dependents rate.\n  For many students, this living stipend payment can be their only \nsource of income, and proving that they will receive this payment while \nin school is important for them to show income for the purposes of \nrenting an apartment or home while they are in school. It makes sense.\n  The SERVE Act would help address this problem and would require the \nSecretary to electronically provide documentation that verifies the \namount of the monthly housing stipend an individual receives under the \nGI Bill. This would allow beneficiaries to use this documentation as \nproof of income when applying for housing.\n  Mr. Speaker, this is a commonsense, bipartisan bill that will help \nstudent veterans secure housing and would eliminate roadblocks to a \nstudent veteran's academic success. I thank Mr. Jim Himes of \nConnecticut for introducing this particular bill. It has my support.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.", "turn": 4, "speaker": "Mr. BILIRAKIS", "itemno": 12}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "W000799", "text": "  Mr. WALZ.

Once again, I want to thank Mr. Himes, whom we are going to \nhear from in just a moment, for responding to constituents, responding \nto a need, and crafting a piece of legislation that makes sure--as \ncurrently the VA does not provide sufficient information about the \nexact amount of housing stipend that a beneficiary receives under GI \nBill benefits.\n  Many veterans rely on their housing stipend to pay for their housing \nwhile they are attending school; and, therefore, it can be necessary \nfor them to show proof of their housing allowance as proof of income. \nWithout this proof of income, veterans are often finding themselves \nunable to secure housing before the start of a school term.\n  This is--once again, it is being used a lot today, but this is a case \nthat I would concur--a commonsense piece of legislation that asks for \ndocumentation that the VA can electronically provide to allow all of \nour veterans to more easily use their earned benefits.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge support, and I reserve the balance of my time.", "turn": 5, "speaker": "Mr. WALZ", "itemno": 13}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "B001257", "text": "  Mr. BILIRAKIS.

Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Minnesota for \nyielding.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the Securing Electronic \nRecords for Veterans' Ease Act, the SERVE Act, because we all know and \nfeel that veterans and their families face very real challenges when \nthey transition to civilian life. We all know that we have an important \nresponsibility to do what we can to help. Finding housing or a roof \nover their heads should not be an ordeal, especially if it is caused by \ndifficulties in showing the stipend that student veterans get from \nUncle Sam.\n  In conversations with student veterans throughout my district, proof \nof income for housing kept coming up as a big challenge. In fact, Nick \nQuinzi, a marine and founder of the Veteran's Student Association at \nSacred Heart University in Fairfield, Connecticut, told my office that \nif he had a wish list of things to make his veteran experience better, \nthe number one item would be fixing the lack of verification for the \nmonthly housing stipend and, therefore, giving him better access to \nhousing.\n  The fact that Nick and many veterans like him have no proof of income \nthat a property manager or landlord could consider when weighing \ncreditworthiness and income qualifications is the definition of an \nunnecessary burden.\n\n  Mr. Speaker, this bipartisan legislation would help veterans obtain \nproof of income for the housing allowance\n\n\nthey receive while utilizing the post-9/11 GI Bill. This is, as we have \nall said, a commonsense fix to this problem. It requires the VA to make \ndocumentation for the post-9/11 GI Bill monthly housing stipend \naccessible and available online. That is it.\n  Student veterans will use this documentation to provide needed \nverification to housing agents, apartment managers, and potential \nlandlords. This bill would provide a permanent solution to the \ninadequacy of the statement of benefits that is currently available--an \nofficial form, accessible online, that verifies the housing benefit is \nnecessary and builds upon existing website functionality. The VA's \neBenefits site already provides access to certification letters for VA \ncompensation and pension benefits.\n  Mr. Speaker, this fix could have a big effect. There are close to 1.1 \nmillion student veterans using the post-9/11 GI Bill who would be \neligible to benefit from this.\n  Mr. Speaker, our veterans have earned this benefit. We, as elected \nofficials, feel a responsibility to make sure that they do not face \nbureaucratic hurdles that prevent them from taking advantage of all of \nthe benefits that they have earned.\n  I would like to close by thanking Dr. Roe and Ranking Member Walz for \ntheir role in bringing this bill to the floor and for their work on \nbehalf of all of our Nation's veterans.", "turn": 8, "speaker": "Mr. HIMES", "itemno": 16}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "W000799", "text": "  Mr. WALZ.
