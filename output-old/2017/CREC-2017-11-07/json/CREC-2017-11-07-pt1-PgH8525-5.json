Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to the \ndangerous tax plan that is currently being considered by the House Ways \nand Means Committee. House Republicans wrote this proposal behind \nclosed doors and then presented it to Congress and the public just last \nweek.\n  This is not the kind of bipartisan tax plan we need to help lift up \nworking families, grow our economy, and lead to a better future for our \nconstituents. In fact, under this proposed plan, about 80 percent of \nthe benefits will go to the wealthiest 1 percent. While helping out \nwealthy individuals and corporations, the proposal hurts many working \nfamilies by getting rid of deductions for\n\n\nState and local taxes and medical expenses, for example.\n  Mr. Speaker, there is another place where this bill will hurt working \nfamilies. Mr. Speaker, Benjamin Franklin said: ``an investment in \nknowledge pays the best interest.'' When it comes to education, this \nplan is an inexcusable lost opportunity.\n  Education is one of the smartest investments we can make, and tax \npolicy is a place where there is tremendous potential to do great \nthings. Unfortunately, this tax proposal shortchanges America's \nschools, students, and teachers.\n\n  Ninety percent of students attend public schools, yet this tax plan \nstarves public education by making changes to the property tax \ndeduction and reducing funding sources for the bipartisan Every Student \nSucceeds Act.\n  On top of that, the plan would turn 529 college savings plans into a \nTrump-DeVos private school voucher scheme that will primarily aid \nwealthy families and will further undermine our public education \nsystem.\n  This tax plan doesn't just hurt our students, it also hurts teachers. \nRight now, across the country, teachers pay an average of $500 a year \nout of their pockets to help stock their classrooms with supplies like \npencils, notebooks, and materials to enhance learning, and that has \nbeen offset by a $250 classroom supplies deduction, which is the least \nwe could do to help those hardworking, underpaid teachers, but this \nbill eliminates that deduction for classroom supplies.\n  We should all also be deeply concerned about the consequences of this \nGOP tax plan for families who invest in higher education. The bill \neliminates the student loan interest deduction, making it harder, \nrather than easier, for millions of Americans who are working to pay \noff their student loans.\n  On top of that, the bill repeals the lifetime learning credit and the \nHope scholarship credit, has major reductions in tax credits for \ntuition, and will make employer-paid tuition count as income.\n  That is the wrong direction. We need a tax proposal that helps, not \nhurts, students and working families.\n  This proposal takes away important investments in education, and at \nthe same time will add about $1.5 trillion to the deficit, leaving our \nchildren and grandchildren to pay the bill.\n  Mr. Speaker, this plan will limit opportunities for people to get \nahead. That is wrong. We should come back to the table and craft a plan \nthat works for all Americans, not a plan that strongly and wrongly \nfavors those at the top.\n", "turn": 1, "speaker": "Ms. BONAMICI", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "181", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H8525-H8526", "wkday": "Tuesday", "day": "7", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "TAX BILL", "id": "CREC-2017-11-07-pt1-PgH8525-5", "title": "TAX BILL"}
