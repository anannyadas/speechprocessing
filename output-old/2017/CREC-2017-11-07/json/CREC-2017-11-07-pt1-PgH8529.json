Mr. Speaker, it is always an honor to stand in \nthe well of the House and have the opportunity to speak to not only the \nMembers of Congress, but to the American people.\n  Today, Mr. Speaker, I rise because I am in opposition to a tax plan \nthat has been said to eliminate loopholes, but has not done so.\n  Let me explain, Mr. Speaker. I will address but one loophole. I will \naddress the loophole that allowed a person who made $3 billion one \nyear--by the way, I don't begrudge him for making $3 billion. I like to \nsee people make as much as they can make in this country, but I also \nthink that every person ought to pay for his or her fair taxes on \nwhatever they earn. This person made $3 billion.\n  How much is $3 billion?\n  Well, let me explain. Mr. Speaker, $3 billion, it would take a \nminimum-wage worker working full time, Mr. Speaker, 198,000 years to \nmake $3 billion; 198,000 years. I don't begrudge a person for making \nit, but here is the point: if you make it, you ought to pay your fair \nshare of taxes on it.\n  This country makes it possible for us to do great things. This \ncountry makes it possible for us to succeed. So if you have succeeded \nin this country, you ought to contribute to the country itself. He made \n$3 billion and paid taxes that were called carried interest. He did not \npay ordinary income taxes. In fact, he paid less than half of what a \nperson making much less--persons who may have worked for him, maybe a \nsecretary, maybe somebody who was making money at a much lower level in \nthat company--paid less than half in taxes in terms of the amount to be \npaid, the percentage of the earnings; less than half of the ordinary \nincome tax.\n  It is called carried interest. Well, the commitment was that you were \ngoing to close loopholes. You haven't closed that loophole. You haven't \neliminated that loophole. I know that there is talk about reducing the \nsize of a big loophole and making it a little less big, but that is not \nwhat you promised. You said you were going to eliminate the loopholes. \nThis loophole sends a signal to ordinary Americans who are working hard \nevery day. It says to them that you are willing to allow the rich to \nhave more to do more, but you believe that those who work hard every \nday can do more with less.\n  Mr. Speaker, I refuse that philosophy. I reject it. I believe that if \nyou are working hard every day, if you are earning middle class wages, \nyou ought to be able to get the tax break promised. I don't think that \nthe tax break should go to the person who can make $3 billion and pay \nless than half of ordinary income tax on it.\n  Carried interest was a commitment that was made. The elimination of \ncarried interest has not taken place. You have not kept your word. \nThere are many other aspects of it. You can't talk about all of them in \none message. But you can do this: you can make it clear to working \nclass people, to middle-income people, that this tax plan is for those \nwho are going to make the carried interest kind of money, the $3 \nbillion, the money that will allow them to go on and do great things, \nbut won't cause them to have to pay their fair share of taxes.\n  Mr. Speaker, I believe in fairness for all, and that includes the \nvery, very rich.\n", "turn": 1, "speaker": "Mr. AL GREEN of Texas", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "181", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H8529", "wkday": "Tuesday", "day": "7", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "TAX PLAN DOES NOT ELIMINATE LOOPHOLES", "id": "CREC-2017-11-07-pt1-PgH8529", "title": "TAX PLAN DOES NOT ELIMINATE LOOPHOLES"}
