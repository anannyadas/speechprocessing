{"title": "PETITIONS AND MEMORIALS", "content": [{"text": "  The following petition or memorial was laid before the Senate and was \nreferred or ordered to lie on the table as indicated:\n\n       POM-133. A resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the Commonwealth of Kentucky urging the \n     United States Congress to pass the Miners Protection Act; to \n     the Committee on Finance.\n\n                        House Resolution No. 136\n\n       Whereas, in 1946, faced with the prospect of a long strike \n     that could hamper post-war economic recovery, President Harry \n     Truman issued an Executive Order directing the Secretary of \n     the Interior to take possession of all bituminous coal mines \n     in the United States and to negotiate with the United Mine \n     Workers of America ``appropriate changes in the terms and \n     conditions of employment''; and\n       Whereas, after a week of negotiations, the historic Krug-\n     Lewis agreement was announced and signed in the White House \n     with President Truman as a witness; and\n       Whereas, the agreement created a welfare and retirement \n     fund that guaranteed lifetime payments to miners and their \n     dependents and survivors in cases of sickness, permanent \n     disability, death or retirement; and\n       Whereas, the agreement also created a separate medical and \n     hospital fund; and\n       Whereas, in 1947, the government returned control of the \n     mines back to their owners and a new collective bargaining \n     agreement was reached with the companies that guaranteed \n     retirement benefits to miners and their dependents and \n     survivors for life; and\n       Whereas, for the next 70 years, miners bargained for money \n     to be dedicated to their health care in retirement, because \n     they knew when they retired they would be sicker than the \n     average senior citizen, with more nagging injuries and a \n     greater risk of black lung or some other cardio-pulmonary \n     disease; and\n       Whereas, the federal government has repeatedly confirmed \n     its role in guaranteeing retirement benefits for coal miners; \n     and\n       Whereas, in 1992 Congress passed and President George H.W. \n     Bush signed into law the Coal Act, which established an \n     industry-funded mechanism for paying for the health care of \n     retirees whose companies had gone out of business; and\n       Whereas, in 2006, Congress and President George W. Bush \n     amended the Coal Act to expand the financial resources \n     available to the fund; and\n       Whereas, a depression reigns in America's coalfields today, \n     with tens of thousands of jobs eliminated; and\n       Whereas, multiple companies have filed for bankruptcy and \n     received approval from bankruptcy courts to shed their \n     retiree obligations, leaving more than 26,000 retirees \n     confronting the loss of their health care benefits; and\n       Whereas, like many other multiemployer pension funds, the \n     United Mine Workers of America 1974 Pension Fund lost a \n     significant portion of its value in the recession of 2008 \n     through 2009, and, due to the devastation of the coal \n     industry, will not receive enough contributions from the \n     employers to make up the shortfall, leading the fund to \n     likely become insolvent by 2022; and\n       Whereas, on December 9, 2016, Congress passed a Continuing \n     Resolution to continue funding for federal programs and \n     services until April 28, 2017, including a provision \n     providing $45 million for continued health care benefits for \n     these retirees and their families until April 30, 2017; and\n       Whereas, Senators Joe Manchin and Shelley Moore Capito of \n     West Virginia have introduced legislation co-sponsored by \n     Republicans and Democrats, the Miners Protection Act, that \n     would amend the Coal Act to allow retirees from recently \n     bankrupt companies to get health care coverage from the \n     United Mine Workers of America Health and Retirement Funds \n     and would repurpose the balance of an existing appropriation \n     to provide funding to shore up the pension plan; and\n       Whereas, Representative David McKinley of West Virginia has \n     also introduced the Miners Protection Act in the House of \n     Representatives, and it is also co-sponsored by both \n     Republicans and Democrats; and\n       Whereas, America's coal miners have sacrificed much for our \n     nation, with more than 105,000 killed on the job in the last \n     century and more than 100,000 having died from coal workers' \n     pneumoconiosis, also known as black lung; and\n       Whereas, knowing those risks, miners have continued to go \n     to work every day to provide for their families, build secure \n     futures for themselves, and produce the fuel that has allowed \n     America to become the most powerful nation on earth; and\n       Whereas, America has an obligation to our retired coal \n     miners for the sacrifices they have made for our nation: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives of the General \n     Assembly of the Commonwealth of Kentucky:\n       Section 1. The Kentucky House of Representatives urges the \n     United States Congress to pass the Miners Protection Act as \n     soon as possible and provide the full measure of benefits \n     these retirees were promised and have earned.\n       Section 2. The Clerk of the House of Representatives shall \n     send a copy of this Resolution and notification of its \n     adoption to the President and Vice President of the United \n     States, the Speaker of the United States House of \n     Representatives, the Minority Leader of the United States \n     House of Representatives, the Majority Leader of the United \n     States Senate, the Minority Leader of the United States \n     Senate, and each member of Kentucky's delegation to the \n     United States Congress.\n", "kind": "Unknown", "speaker": "Unknown", "itemno": 0, "turn": -1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 1}], "header": {"chamber": "Senate", "num": "181", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "S7061", "wkday": "Tuesday", "day": "7", "month": "November"}, "related_bills": [{"type": "HRES", "context": "HEADERLINE", "congress": "115", "number": "136"}, {"type": "HRES", "context": "OTHER", "congress": "115", "number": "136"}], "doc_title": "PETITIONS AND MEMORIALS", "id": "CREC-2017-11-07-pt1-PgS7061"}
