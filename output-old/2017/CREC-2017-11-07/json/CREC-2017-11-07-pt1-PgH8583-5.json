Mr. Speaker, I rise to highlight the continuing urgency of \nproviding relief and recovery aid for Puerto Rico and the Virgin \nIslands, which were devastated by Hurricanes Irma and Maria. While U.S. \nefforts have ramped up after a failed initial response, we can and must \ndo more.\n  In Puerto Rico, some 70 shelters remain open, access to safe drinking \nwater is a problem, and there are dozens of waterborne disease deaths. \nNearly a third of hospitals are still running off generators, bridges \nremain destroyed, and many roads remain impassable. Nearly 60 percent \nof the island is without power.\n  The news is not better for the Virgin Islands, where many still lack \naccess to cell service, power, and clean water. Officials estimate $5.5 \nbillion is needed for the most essential needs there.\n  Mr. Speaker, there are less than 20 legislative days left on the \nHouse calendar. How can we be prioritizing tax cuts for the wealthy? \nLet's put together fair and strong hurricane relief packages for \ncommunities ravaged by these hurricanes, including those in Puerto Rico \nand the Virgin Islands.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Ms. MOORE", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "181", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H8583", "wkday": "Tuesday", "day": "7", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "WE NEED FAIR AND STRONG HURRICANE RELIEF PACKAGES", "id": "CREC-2017-11-07-pt1-PgH8583-5", "title": "WE NEED FAIR AND STRONG HURRICANE RELIEF PACKAGES"}
