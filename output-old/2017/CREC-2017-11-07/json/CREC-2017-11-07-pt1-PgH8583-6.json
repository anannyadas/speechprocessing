Mr. Speaker, I stand tonight with a number of my \ncolleagues to shed light and ask questions and discuss the conflicts of \ninterest of Mr. Mueller and several others in the previous \nadministration.\n  As I recall the events of the past 2 years, it becomes clearer than \never that Mr. Mueller should resign. If he does not resign, then he \nshould be fired.\n  I believe he has conflicts of interest that do not allow him to \nproceed with his investigation in an unbiased, independent manner. \nFurther, he has broadened the scope of his investigation far beyond his \ncharge to examine Russian interference in the 2016 Presidential \nelection. In the process, he is helping to attack the integrity, \nperception, and credibility of the American justice and electoral \nsystem.\n  Mr. Speaker, my constituents want answers. Congress has sought \nanswers from the previous administration for many years. Without \nexception, the Obama administration stonewalled these attempts.\n  Hillary Clinton and the Clinton Foundation are the subject of many of \nthese questions and subsequent investigations.\n  Ms. Clinton did not become President. Some say that, because of this, \nwe should not complete our investigations into multiple allegations of \nmisconduct, but this is misguided.\n  No American is above the law. Losing an election does not grant \nimmunity for misconduct. Whether Ms. Clinton is Secretary of State, \nPresident of the United States, or a citizen of Chappaqua, New York, \nshe should be held to the same standard as everyone else.\n  I am pleased that the House Judiciary and Oversight Committees share \nthis sentiment. Our committees will soon be launching a joint \ninvestigation into the unanswered questions surrounding the allegations \nthat we have mentioned. We intend to get truthful answers to these \nquestions.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Gaetz).", "turn": 3, "speaker": "Mr. BIGGS", "itemno": 4}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "G000578", "text": "  Mr. GAETZ. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  Mr. Speaker, we are at risk of a coup d'etat in this country if we \nallow an unaccountable person with no oversight to undermine the duly-\nelected President of the United States, and I would offer that is \nprecisely what is happening right now with the indisputable conflicts \nof interest that are present with Mr. Mueller and others at the \nDepartment of Justice.\n  I join my colleague, the gentleman from Arizona, in calling for Mr. \nMueller's resignation or his firing.\n  Moreover, we absolutely have to see the Department of Justice appoint \na special counsel to look into the Clinton Foundation, the Uranium One \ndeal, and the Fusion GPS dossier that I will now have the opportunity \nto discuss.\n  I really don't know who is investigating the Uranium One deal right \nnow. I know that, in July, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, \nalong with 20 members of the Judiciary Committee, sent a letter to \nAttorney General Sessions asking who would be looking into these \ncritical questions, demanding that a special counsel be appointed to \nconduct a thorough review. It is extremely disappointing that the \nchairman of the Judiciary Committee and my fellow members have received \nno response from the Department of Justice as to that letter.\n\n  I don't know whether the Attorney General's recusal on matters \nrelated to Russia impacts, influences, or, in any way, covers the \nFusion GPS challenge and the incredible threat to national security \nraised by the Uranium One deal.\n  I do know that there is no world in which Mr. Mueller could \npotentially investigate these matters. It is Federal law that even the \nappearance of a conflict of interest means that someone cannot engage \nin prosecutorial duties regarding allegations and investigations. That \nconflict of interest is absolutely present.\n  As early as 2009, the FBI knew that we had informants alleging \ncorruption into United States uranium assets. There were allegations of \nbribery, kickbacks, extortion. Even in 2010, Members of Congress were \nraising these questions and asking the Obama administration to provide \nanswers that were never given.\n  I don't think it is a coincidence that at the same time we were \nhearing from sources that there was bribery to influence our uranium \nassets, you had former President Bill Clinton getting paid $500,000 by \na bunch of Russians to go give a speech. It must have been one hell of \na speech. It is deeply troubling to me that these circumstances seem to \nbe ripe for corruption and seem to demonstrate an ecosystem of \ncorruption that must be thoroughly investigated.\n  Now, why can't Mr. Mueller and Mr. Rosenstein conduct this \ninvestigation? First of all, Mr. Mueller was the head of the FBI in \n2009. He potentially had a role to play in these questions. At the very \nleast, the fact that the FBI never prosecuted any case, never raised \nobjections, never allowed Congress to be able to look into these \nmatters, that would be an act of omission.\n  So at best, there is an omission that creates a conflict for Mr. \nMueller; at worst, there might have been actual malfeasance or active \nnegligence. And in those circumstances, we need fresh eyes and clear \neyes to give the American people confidence that our justice system is, \nin fact, working for them.\n  It is not only the Uranium One deal that gives us a great deal to \nquestion. We also have this Fusion GPS dossier, which we have now \nlearned that the Democratic Party was paying for. The Democratic Party \nwas out paying people to stir up this salacious and inaccurate dirt on \nPresident Trump both before and after he was elected.\n  In his own testimony before the Congress, Mr. Comey said that these \nallegations were salacious and could not be relied upon. So it begs the \nquestion, what was the Fusion GPS dossier relied upon for? Was it \nrelied upon so that there would be FISA warrants issued to go and spy \non the President and members of his team? We don't know, but until we \nhave a special counsel, we will never get those answers, because \nMueller and Rosenstein are conflicted.\n  Why did Congress never hear from these informants? Well, it is no \nsurprise to me. You actually have Mr. Rosenstein's name on the \nsignature block of the pleadings that sealed the information that could \nhave shed light on this entire scandal, but we didn't have that \nopportunity.\n  Now, it may very well be that these were simply acts of negligence, \nacts of omission or oversight. If that is the case, let's get someone \nin who can give us the answers, because certainly the people who are \nthere now cannot give us answers, and they have these tragic conflicts \nof interest.\n  The American people are well aware that the Clinton Foundation \nfunctioned largely as a money laundering organization to influence the \nState Department and to ensure that there were special people with \nspecial access and special relationships to the Clintons who got \nspecial treatment. That is not an America that abides to the rule of \nlaw.\n  As a member of the Judiciary Committee, we have to see the rule of \nlaw held up and cherished. We are a model for the world, but if we have \ncircumstances where our President, who was elected, is undermined as a \nconsequence of these things, if we do not replace Bob Mueller with \nsomeone who can come in absent of association with the individuals who \nmay be implicated, then I fear this great, special place that we hold \nin the world may be diminished.\n  So I have introduced legislation. I am very pleased that my \ncolleagues have joined me in sponsoring that legislation, calling for \nMr. Mueller to resign. I have also called for a special counsel to be \nappointed.\n  To my colleagues on the other side who say, well, hey, you know, \nthere were a variety of agencies that were involved in approving the \nUranium One deal, there were eight or nine groups that could have said \nno.\n\n\n\n\n\n  Are Members of Congress really taking the position that the Clintons \ndon't have their tentacles in just about every agency of government?\n  How ludicrous. You are talking about the former President of the \nUnited States and, at the time, the lady who was serving as our \nSecretary of State.\n  The fact that this was a multiagency process only underscores the \nconflicts of interest that lie with Rosenstein and Mueller.\n  I am calling on the Attorney General to appoint a special counsel to \npreserve the rule of law and to help us save this great country from \nthose who are trying to undermine us and undermine our President.", "turn": 4, "speaker": "Mr. GAETZ", "itemno": 5}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "B001302", "text": "  Mr. BIGGS.

Mr. Speaker, why, in 2016, would James Comey call the \nClinton investigation a matter, not an investigation?\n  Last time I checked, he wasn't director of the Federal bureau of \nmatters.\n  Why, in 2016, would then-Attorney General Loretta Lynch, one day \nbefore the Benghazi report is due to come out, 5 days before Secretary \nClinton is scheduled to be interviewed by the FBI, meet with former \nPresident Bill Clinton on a tarmac in Phoenix? Why would that happen in \n2016?\n  Why, in the days just following that meeting with the former \nPresident, would Attorney General Loretta Lynch, when corresponding \nwith the public relations people at the Justice Department via email, \nnot use her real name and, instead, use the name Elizabeth Carlisle?\n  Again, it seems to me if you are just talking about grandkids and \ngolf, you could probably use your real name.\n  Why, as we have learned recently, reported in The Federalist, why \nwould the FBI be reimbursing Christopher Steele, the author of the \ndossier? Why would that be happening all in 2016?\n  You know, as the previous speakers have talked about, we have had \nthis focus the last several months on potential Russia, Trump campaign \ncollusion and influence, Russian influence on the election.\n  It seems to me we know something pretty clearly. The Obama \nadministration Justice Department certainly tried to influence the \nelection. I mean, I think we can see that without a doubt.\n  What did we learn today? The gentleman from Florida was talking about \nthe dossier. What did we learn today?\n  It was reported today that the cofounder of Fusion GPS, Glenn \nSimpson, was meeting with the now famous Russian lawyer, Natalia \nVeselnitskaya, both before the meeting that she had with Donald Trump, \nJr., and after the meeting she had with Donald Trump, Jr. I find that \ninteresting. The story keeps getting better.\n  When James Comey is fired, he then leaks a government document, \nthrough a friend, to The New York Times. And what was his objective? \nWhat did he tell us?\n  Under oath, he told us this: Trying to create momentum for a special \ncounsel.\n  Of course, it can't just be any special counsel. Who is that special \ncounsel going to be?\n  Bob Mueller, his friend, his predecessor, his mentor and, maybe most \nimportantly, as my good friend from Florida just pointed out, the guy \nwho was running the FBI when the whole Uranium One deal was going down.\n  I mean, this is amazing. All we are asking for is for the Attorney \nGeneral to name a special counsel to look into all these questions.\n  Why was it so critical that James Comey call the matter not an \ninvestigation?\n  Why was it so important that Loretta Lynch not use her real name when \nshe is talking about the meeting she had with Bill Clinton on the \ntarmac?\n  Why was it so important that we get a special counsel, and that \nspecial counsel be Bob Mueller; so important that James Comey can leak \na document, through a friend, to The New York Times, a government \ndocument? Why was all this so important?\n  All we are asking for is to name a special counsel to look into this; \nand we first asked for this 3\\1/2\\ months ago. Twenty members of the \nJudiciary Committee sent the Attorney General a letter on July 27, \nlaying out all these questions and saying: Name a special counsel to \nlook into it.\n  After all, the taxpayers, the American people, would like the \nanswers. I know the ones in the Fourth District of Ohio would. I talk \nto them all the time.\n  For 2 months we heard nothing. So five of us went and met with the \nAttorney General asking about the July 27 letter, and would they \nappoint a special counsel. To date, we have got no answer, no response.\n  So I appreciate the gentleman from Arizona for organizing this \nSpecial Order. I appreciate my good friend from Florida, the gentleman \nfrom North Carolina, the gentleman from Pennsylvania, and the gentleman \nfrom Arizona who are going to join us as well this evening.\n  It is time for a special counsel to be named to get the answers for \nthe American people on these fundamental questions. We haven't said \nthem all. There are lots of other questions, but these are the \nfundamental ones. It is time we had a special counsel get to the bottom \nof this. That is what we have called for. That is what we want to see \nhappen.

Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Arizona for his \nleadership; and, obviously, for the eloquent words of my colleagues \nfrom Florida and from Ohio.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today to join my colleagues in, really, \naddressing a serious matter of transparency that has left the American \npeople with questions that deserve honest answers.\n  You know, for the past year, as our government has been mired in a \nfruitless, aimless, and sometimes laborious investigation on \naccusations of collusion between the Russian Government and the 2016 \nPresidential campaign, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle \nhave insisted that Congress follow where the evidence leads in this \ninvestigation.\n\n  Mr. Speaker, I am here to tell you today that I agree wholeheartedly. \nCongress should follow the facts where they lead. However, they are \nleading in a very different direction than many of the mainstream media \nnarratives might suggest.\n  You see, in the process of this investigation, we have learned a fact \npattern surrounding the Clinton campaign and potentially the Obama \nadministration's involvement in a targeted campaign using information \nfrom foreign intelligence officials against then-candidate Donald \nTrump.\n  Now, as we know from the recent New York Times report, the \nPresidential campaign of Hillary Clinton and the Democratic National \nCommittee paid for research that was included in the now infamous \nRussian dossier that was made public in January of this year by \nBuzzfeed and reported on by CNN.\n  Now we know that the Clinton campaign and the DNC paid an ex-British \nintelligence officer, Christopher Steele, to compile this dossier with \nthe research provided from Russian intelligence officials.\n  Now, much of this dossier contains claims that have either not been \nverified or have been directly refuted. So, Mr. Speaker, it is \nsuspicious enough that the Clinton campaign and the DNC paid \nintelligence officials in Russia for this type of material and false \ninformation on President Trump.\n  But we were also beginning to see evidence that raises questions \nabout the very way that the Obama Justice Department may have \ninappropriately involved themselves into this project, both before and \nafter the 2016 Presidential campaign.\n  Mr. Speaker, now, if you would, consider the timeline that we are \nworking with here. In April of 2016, the Clinton campaign used the law \nfirm of Perkins Coie to retain Fusion GPS, the firm behind the Russian \ndossier.\n  Now, that very same month, in April of 2016, President Obama's \ncampaign began paying more than $900,000 to what law firm?\n  Perkins Coie, the very same firm used by the Clinton campaign in the \ncreation of the dossier.\n\n\n  Now, we also know that in the weeks prior to the 2016 election, \nPresident Obama's FBI tried to reach an agreement with Christopher \nSteele to pay for the Russian dossier, and the FBI actually ended up \nreimbursing some of the dossier expenses.\n  Now, to be clear, the FBI attempted to pay, and then reimbursed, the \ncosts of the Russian dossier that was being orchestrated by Hillary \nClinton's Presidential campaign. Now, the FBI has refused to answer \nquestions and resisted any transparency on this issue.\n  So going a step further, we now know that on January 6, President \nObama's intelligence officials, led by then-Director of the FBI, James \nComey, briefed President-elect Trump on the contents of the dossier.\n  Now, following that January 6 briefing, there are reports that the \nObama administration's intelligence officials leaked to CNN the fact \nthat the President-elect was briefed on the dossier. Four days later, \non January 10, the dossier ended up being published by Buzzfeed.\n  Now, keep in mind, several media outlets had the dossier in hand \nprior to January 10, but none of them had printed it since the claims \ncould not be verified.\n  Now, this timeline leaves us with a myriad of extremely concerning \nquestions, Mr. Speaker, but they can be boiled down into a few \nspecifics: Why did President Obama's campaign begin paying almost $1 \nmillion to the very same firm that the Clinton campaign used to fund \nthe dossier in the very same month that the Clinton campaign began \npaying for the dossier?\n  The second question: Why did President Obama's FBI attempt to pay \nChristopher Steele for the Russian dossier? Why was President Obama's \nFBI involved in paying for a project that the Clinton campaign started \nand was orchestrating?\n  Again, the FBI has refused to answer these questions and has resisted \ntransparency on this issue.\n  And why brief the President at all on the dossier if much of the \ndossier could not be verified?\n  Or, I would suggest, if President Obama's intelligence officials had \nreason to treat the dossier seriously, then why did they wait 2 months \nafter the election to disclose the information on January 6? Why wait?\n  And why was the President's meeting with President-elect Trump leaked \nto CNN 4 days after the briefing, if, again, the dossier could not be \nverified?\n  Mr. Speaker, the intention of all of this is not to spread theories \nor to speculate as to what might have happened. The point is to \nrecognize that there are legitimate, unanswered questions about whether \nthe Obama Justice Department involved themselves in a political project \ntargeting then-candidate Donald Trump, a suggestion that has far more \nevidence behind it than the directionless investigation into the Trump-\nRussian collusion.\n  The American people deserve an answer to those questions. They demand \nanswers to those questions, and it is our government's responsibility \nto find them.", "turn": 8, "speaker": "Mr. MEADOWS", "itemno": 9}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "B001302", "text": "  Mr. BIGGS.

Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from \nArizona. He and I hold a deep, common conviction that Arizona is the \nmost important and best State in the Union, and I don't think anyone \nhere would debate that.\n  Mr. Speaker, last Monday, October 30, we were delivered the over-\nhyped ``bombshell'' story that Special Counsel Robert Mueller would \nintroduce some damning evidence about President Trump's collusion with \nRussia via indictments.\n\n  On Friday, October 27, someone involved in the grand jury \ninvestigation--now, don't forget, Mr. Speaker, that the purpose of a \ngrand jury is secrecy, but someone in that organization leaked \ninformation to the press, specifically CNN, with no reasonable person \nbeing able to count as a friend to the President of the United States; \nand it caused every political pundit in the country to begin surmising \nwho would be the first to fall.\n  Reporters were assigned the story, revisiting campaign notes and \ncombing through stacks of research and fact sheets about so-called \nevidence of Russia collusion.\n  Then the big reveal: Paul Manafort and Rick Gates were indicted for \ncrimes related to their business dealings with a Ukrainian politician \nclinging to power in a country undergoing a revolution, back in 2014. \nThe FBI had been trying to indict them ever since. There was no mention \nof the Trump campaign, not any whatsoever in the 12-count indictment.\n  In other words, Mr. Speaker the announcement amounted to what many \nhave called a ``nothing burger.''\n  Mainstream media members, who had spent all weekend promising the \nviewers and their readers some new damning evidence about Trump, were \naghast.\n\n\n  Mueller had let them down. How could they face their audience now \nwith nothing to show? But wait, another indictment snuck in in the last \nfew hours, only a few hours later, right in the nick of time. George \nPapadopoulos--now, here is our guy. This is the guy. He actually went \nto Russia, and he proposed Trump meet with Putin. We have got him now.\n  Well, no. It turns out Papadopoulos was an unpaid intern who \npossessed a background in researching Russia. When he suggested Trump \nmeet with the Russians, he was shot down quickly and firmly. The \nindictment against Papadopoulos didn't even have to do with his work on \nthe campaign. He was indicted because he had lied to the FBI--again, no \ncollusion with the Trump campaign found whatsoever.\n  But that didn't stop the media from sensationalizing the news. After \nall, they have a job to do. But the American people didn't fall for it, \nMr. Speaker. The New Yorker's legal writer, Jeffrey Toobin, and the \nliberal vox.com have suggested Mueller seems to be conducting his \ninvestigation like he is going after a mafia mob boss.\n  The problem with treating the Trump campaign as an organized crime \norganization, clearly, is it presumes Trump's guilt. No matter how \nwell-intentioned and full of integrity Mr. Mueller might be, if he is \ntreating Trump like Al Capone, his tactics are wrong.\n  When trying to pursue charges on a mafia boss, the FBI pulls in the \nstreet guys, threatens them with life in jail or some other steep \ncharge, unless they spill the beans on their superior. Once they crack, \nthey bring in the next level, all the way to the top. This is a well-\nknown tactic, and it incentivizes those arrested to invent some \nspurious testimony against their superiors.\n  Could Mr. Mueller be acting with vengeance or to vindicate his good \nfriend and colleague, James Comey, who had a very public feud with the \nPresident? Well, we don't know, Mr. Speaker, but it is hard to take any \ncharges with this investigation seriously when they are going about it \nin this fashion.\n  The main point is this, Mr. Speaker: at least James Comey, the media, \nand the Democrats desperately want collusion to exist between Trump and \nRussia. And when you want something that bad, you might even begin to \nbelieve it is true, even if it is not.\n  But there is good news. Anyone sincerely looking for the drama of \nAmerican officials actually colluding with the Kremlin, need look no \nfurther now than the emerging scandal concerning the sale of American \nuranium reserves to Russia during Hillary Clinton's time at the State \nDepartment.\n  The FBI, in 2009, under the Obama administration, began investigating \nRussia's use of bribery, kickbacks, and extortion to gain a bigger \nfoothold in the American atomic energy industry. They knew this was \nhappening. The record is clear. Of course, Mr. Speaker, American \nnuclear resources are a critical component of America's national \nsecurity. So any detail between Russian companies and U.S. atomic \nenergy resources would require a signoff from the State Department.\n  After all, Russia is a hostile foreign government. Correct? Democrats \ncertainly seem to believe so now, even though, in past years, most of \nthem couldn't find Russia on a map.\n  So when Rosatom, a Russian energy group, took control of the Canadian \nUranium One, which had control of mining and uranium stakes stretching\n\n\nfrom Central Asia to the American West, that deal needed U.S. State \nDepartment approval. After all, this meant that Russia, a hostile \nforeign power, would control 20 percent of America's uranium industry. \nAnd, of course, as Obama's FBI was investigating Russia for bribes and \nextortion related to atomic energy, this deal should have raised a red \nflag for the State Department.\n  Vladimir Putin really wanted the deal to go through because, per The \nNew York Times, it would allow him to realize his goal of becoming one \nof the world's major atomic energy players. The only thing standing in \nhis way was Hillary Clinton's State Department. The month the deal was \napproved by Hillary Clinton's State Department, Bill Clinton received \n$500,000 from a Russian investment bank with ties to the Kremlin for a \n``speaking engagement'' in Moscow. Then, Mr. Speaker, Uranium One's \nchairman used his family foundation to make a series of donations to \nthe Clinton Foundation, totaling $2.35 million.\n  Now, being under agreement to disclose all of their foundation \ncontributions publicly, the Clintons neglected still to reveal the \nUranium One donations. That is pretty convenient, Mr. Speaker. Are we \npaying attention here?\n  Now, since the media seems to have an insatiable appetite for Russian \ncollusion, let's take a look at the Uranium One deal. That is a story \nworth looking into, Mr. Speaker. And I would bet the biggest stake in \nWashington, with anyone in this place, that if a special counsel was \nappointed to look into it, that investigation would bring some truly \nlegitimate results.", "turn": 10, "speaker": "Mr. FRANKS of Arizona", "itemno": 11}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "B001302", "text": "  Mr. BIGGS.

Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Arizona.\n  Mr. Speaker, we have been entreated to claims of collusion with our \ngovernment, people high in our government with Russia for over a year \nnow; since the last election happening this very day a year ago, we \nhave been entreated to this.\n  So I thought I would bring some sense to this confusion about what we \nknow as the Uranium One deal. Even I didn't know a whole lot about it, \nso I did a little research to understand the timeline and what exactly \nhappened here. I want to talk to you about that this evening.\n  On June 8 of 2010, the Russian State Atomic Energy Corporation, also \nknown as Rosatom--the Russian state, not some private organization. It \nbelongs to Vladimir Putin. Make no mistake about it--announced plans to \npurchase a 51.4 percent stake in the Canadian company Uranium One.\n  Now, why do we care? Well, we care because this announcement had \nsignificant strategic implications for the United States since Uranium \nOne's international assets included 20 percent of the United States' \nuranium reserves.\n  Now, due to uranium status as a strategic commodity, the $1.3 billion \ndeal was subject to the approval of the Committee on Foreign Investment \nin the United States, known as CFIUS; CFIUS, the Committee on Foreign \nInvestment in the United States. And they care because uranium is \nimportant. Do you know why? We make nuclear bombs out of it--that is \nwhy it is important--and so do other countries. And maybe so do \nterrorists if they get their hands on it. So we care.\n  Now, the CFIUS panel is made up of nine department heads and \nagencies, including, at that time, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. \nOkay, fair enough. Now, CFIUS went through the approval process at what \nwe would consider an unusually rapid pace, approving the sale of one-\nfifth of our uranium reserves, the United States' reserves, to a \nRussian, Vladimir Putin, state-owned enterprise in less than 5 months. \nFive months. I mean, they did that in 5 months. We have been \ninvestigating allegations of President Trump and Russia for about 12 \nmonths now. In earnest, less than 12 months, but, certainly, the claims \nhave been made since the night of the election, yet they got this done \nin 5 months. Okay, that is good.\n  CFIUS proceeded at this pace despite national security concerns \nraised by Congress--people right here said: Hey, 20 percent of our \nuranium shouldn't go to Vladimir Putin. That doesn't make sense to us.\n  The FBI had extensive concerns, tying Rosatom's main executive to a \nU.S. racketeering scheme. My colleague has already talked about \nbribery, extortion, racketeering. Right. Both Secretary of State \nClinton and Attorney General Eric Holder--whose FBI, by the way, \nproduced the evidence--voted in favor of the deal. Interestingly \nenough, who was in charge of the FBI at the time? Our friend, Robert \nMueller. It just is a little too coincidental for me. I am sorry, it is \njust a little too coincidental.\n  After the sale, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, the United States \nNuclear Regulatory Commission, assured both Congress and the public \nthat the uranium sold could not be exported because neither Uranium One \nnor Rosatom, Vladimir Putin's organization, had an NRC export license. \nSo even though we had control of 20 percent, he could never do anything \nwith the 20 percent except leave it in the United States.\n  And, by the way, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission still hasn't \ngranted a license to export any of that material to Rosatom or to \nUranium One to this day.\n  But despite the public statements, somehow it got exported because an \nNRC memo showed the agency approved the shipment of yellowcake uranium \nfrom the Uranium One mines in the United States to Canada through a \nthird party. Additional shipments of the uranium were made to Europe, \nand they were authorized as well by the NRC. And where they went from \nEurope, who knows. The NRC doesn't know. At least if they know, they \naren't telling us. We have asked. We certainly don't know. Maybe \nRosatom knows.\n  The question you should have is: Why? Why would the United States do \nthis? What was in our interest to sell 20 percent of our uranium? Was \nit that we needed $1.3 billion? I suspect not.\n  In an attempt to avoid congressional scrutiny, the NRC did not \nprovide a direct export license to Uranium One, but, instead, it \namended an existing license for a logistics company to allow it to \nexport Uranium One's uranium, which was, in effect, the United States' \nuranium, our uranium.\n  The NRC was able to amend this export license because of two policy \nchanges resulting from the Russian reset orchestrated by Secretary \nClinton. Again, look, it might be innocent. It might be completely \ninnocent, but it deserves more scrutiny, certainly.\n  The two things--the two policy changes were: the Obama administration \nreinstated the U.S.-Russian civilian nuclear energy cooperation \nagreement in May of 2010. Shortly thereafter, in 2011, the Commerce \nDepartment removed Rosatom from a list of restricted companies that \ncould not export nuclear or other sensitive materials or technologies. \nThey still didn't have a license, but they were removed from the list.\n  Nine months after the Commerce Department did that, the removal of \nRosatom from the list, the NRC issued the license amendment to the \nthird party allowing for uranium of the United States to be exported \nfrom Uranium One mines through Canada, and eventually on to Europe, and \nwho knows where from there. The license amendment stipulated that the \nexported uranium must be returned to the U.S. Now, this did not occur. \nInstead, the Department of Energy approved the movement of uranium from \nCanada to Europe, and that was it. It is gone, folks. It is just gone.\n  It is now clear that the previous administration took every \nconceivable action to clear the path for Rosatom to purchase Uranium \nOne and to enable the export of that uranium. The Russians got it. \nVladimir Putin got the uranium.\n  In taking these extraordinary measures in support of Russian state-\nowned enterprise, the Obama administration, with the aid of former \nSecretary of State Hillary Clinton and former Attorney General Eric \nHolder, put our national security at risk.\n  Mr. Speaker, it is far past time to thoroughly--marginally, how about \nto marginally investigate this deal--the Obama administration's actions \nand the Clinton family's role and their foundation's role. You only \nneed to ask\n\n\none question about all this: Why? Why would we do this? Why would the \nUnited States agree to this? Why did this deal happen the way it did \nhappen? No other deals happened that way. Why did this one happen this \nway? Why is there no independent investigation into these matters at \nthis point? Why? And why is there no special counsel?\n  We are here tonight to call for a special counsel so that we know the \ntruth, so if there is Russian involvement in the United States' \nnational security, whether it is our election, or whether it is our \nuranium that they could use to make an atomic bomb, the American people \nneed to know. They should know. They should have all of the evidence.\n\n  Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.", "turn": 12, "speaker": "Mr. PERRY", "itemno": 13}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "B001302", "text": "  Mr. BIGGS.

Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend, Mr. Biggs. I appreciate \nyour hosting this hour because this is critical stuff here. This is the \nkind of thing that makes or breaks an experiment in self-government \nbecause there is an attempted coup taking place.\n  We have heard over and over about, oh, gee, Mr. Mueller will come to \na fair and just conclusion. Well, the only fair and just conclusion \nthat Bob Mueller could come to would be that he should never have \naccepted the position of special counsel, that he had conflicts so deep \nthat accepting the role of special counsel could not be ethical and \nappropriate. You wonder, why would he take it?\n  Well, when you find out that, as FBI Director, he and U.S. Attorney \nRod Rosenstein were involved in the deep cover investigation into \nRussia's effort to corner the market using American uranium, and that \nHillary Clinton and Eric Holder and others in the administration \napproved the sale to a group, the stockholders of which donated, as I \nunderstand, $145 million or so to the Clinton Foundation, in effect, \nthe Clintons hit the Russian megalottery--the megamillions lottery from \nRussia.\n\n\n  As I understand, $145 million or so to the Clinton Foundation, in \neffect, the Clintons hit the Russian mega lottery; the megamillions \nlottery from Russia, and just a little tease was the half-a-million-\ndollar fee for just giving one little, short speech by Bill Clinton.\n  But if we look back at what has gone on, just look at some of the \nfacts, it was shocking that FBI Director Comey did not have Cheryl \nMills interviewed. She was Clinton's former Chief of Staff at the State \nDepartment. Now we are finding out, well, I guess, gee, if Comey was \ngoing to draft a statement saying that there was not sufficient \nevidence to prosecute Hillary Clinton before he ever talked to Cheryl \nMills or talked to Hillary Clinton or followed up on the most critical \nevidence, then clearly it makes sense why Director Comey would not want \nto make Cheryl Mills' interview recorded, and would make an agreement \nwith Cheryl Mills and the other potential defendants in the case that, \ngee, if they just got a look at their laptops, they promised they \nwouldn't use anything in the laptop to prosecute them, and the FBI \nwould then, under Comey's direction, would actually participate in the \nobstruction and destruction of evidence so that nobody could ever use \nit against any of them.\n  Now, originally, we thought that might only be Hillary Clinton. But \nas we find out, gee, Mr. Mueller, Mr. Comey, and Mr. Rosenstein were in \nthis up to their eyeballs when it came to the Russian investigation \nregarding uranium. If they were doing their jobs, they should never, \never have allowed that sale of American uranium to go to a company that \nthey knew would end up in Russian hands.\n  So if you look at Cheryl Mills, Heather Samuelson, John Bentel, Bryan \nPagliano, and Paul Combetta, these are people who were potential \ntargets. And what does Director Comey do?\n  He makes sure that they walk. Because if they were properly \ninterviewed, like good prosecutors or good investigators normally do, \nyou start there and you say: You help us with what happened and what \nyou were told by the person above you, and then we won't prosecute you \nto the full extent of the law.\n  That is how deals are made. That is how you get to a Mr. Big in a \nracketeer organized confederation.\n  Mr. Comey and the FBI apparently relied on the Fusion GPS \ninvestigation knowing where it came from and knowing who paid for it. \nThis is incredible.\n  If you go back to the Washingtonian article of 2013, it makes pretty \nclear that Comey and Mueller were basically joined at the hip.\n  In fact, a quote back in 2013 says: ``The stressed Comey had few \npeople he could turn to for advice; almost no one was allowed to know \nthe program existed, and disclosing the program's existence to someone \noutside that circle could send him to prison. In fact, there was only \none person in government whom he could confide in and trust: Bob \nMueller.''\n  ``Comey thought, `A freight train is heading down the tracks, about \nto derail me, my family, and my career.' He glanced to his left at his \nfellow passenger, thinking, `At least Bob Mueller will be standing on \nthe tracks with me.' ''\n  ``The crisis over, Comey and Mueller shared a dark laugh.''\n  Well, it is not quite so amusing when you look at the stakes and \nwhether or not this little experiment in self-government will continue. \nFor example, we know that Comey admitted in testimony before Congress \nbefore the Senate that he had leaked information in order to get a \nspecial counsel appointed. That was his dear friend who would stand \nbeside him through thick and thin, Bob Mueller. This brought memories \nof when Mr. Comey urged his boss, John Ashcroft, to recuse himself and \nlet them appoint a special counsel. So Ashcroft trusted Comey. He \nprobably shouldn't have, but he did.\n  Then Comey saw to it that his child's godfather, Patrick Fitzgerald, \nwould be the prosecutor. Much like Mueller, he got massive amounts of \nmoney and a great powerful staff so they could go after Karl Rove and \nVice President Cheney. They were embarrassed there was no case there, \nso they made up one on Scooter Libby, and he became the fall guy.\n  But we know from the leak that Comey admitted that he used an ex-U.S. \nAttorney, identified as Columbia University professor Daniel Richman, \nto leak to The New York Times the contents of the memo Comey wrote.\n  If you look at the FBI contract with agents and with people employed \nby the FBI, it makes it very clear that memo that Comey prepared about \nhis conversation with the President was not supposed to ever be \nprovided to the press. That is FBI property, and he violated the law in \nleaking it.\n  But if you look, then-professor Daniel Richman got that to The New \nYork Times author Michael Schmidt, who later wrote the Comey memo story \nin which Comey told Congress he directed Richman to leak.\n  Well, if you go back through and you start looking for this common \nthread, Michael Schmidt writing stories for The New York Times about \nleaks, then you find a number of cases where it appears likely. Whether \nit is March 1, March 4, March 5, March 6, it appears likely that this \nwas James Comey leaking again.\n  The only question is: Did he commit a crime in one or all of those \nevents?\n  The answer is: We will never know as long as Bob Mueller is special \ncounsel. He needs to have the decency to say that it was a mistake for \nme to take this on, it was a mistake when Comey testified there was no \nevidence of any collusion between Donald Trump and the Russians, it was \na mistake for him to leak out that night that now he is investigating \nthe President for obstruction of justice.\n  Why would he do that?\n  So he wouldn't get fired, because there was no purpose in his \ninvestigation.\n  Why would he indict people when he did?\n  Because even The Wall Street Journal and others around this town \nbegan to say: Do you know what? Mueller really should resign.\n  He had to get those indictments out quick so people would not keep \ncalling for his resignation. Well, some of us are. We have got to clean \nthis town up, and it will start with the resignation of Mr. Mueller and \na proper investigation of all of this underlying case involving Comey, \nLynch, the Clintons, Russia, and Rod Rosenstein who oversaw the Russia \ncase before he decided to seal it.\n\n\n", "turn": 14, "speaker": "Mr. GOHMERT", "itemno": 15}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "B001302", "text": "  Mr. BIGGS.

Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Biggs for putting this very \nimportant hearing together. I am going to cut mine a little bit \nshorter.\n  After the previous election, a lot of people were angry. They came to \nour office demanding special investigations into the Trump campaign and \nthe Russia probe. I forewarned them then, and I will make this \nprediction now: that if it goes there and it leads to the previous \nadministration or Hillary Clinton, are you willing to go down that \nrabbit hole?\n  Here we are today. I think we need to follow this because it has led \nto that.\n  Without going too much into all the stuff that has already been said, \nwe can talk about how the Obama administration approved the sale of the \nCanadian mining company with significant U.S. uranium reserves to a \nfirm owned by a Russian Government. The NRC, the Nuclear Regulatory \nCommission, assured Congress and the public the new owners could not \nexport any raw nuclear material from the American shores. No uranium \nproduced at either facility may be exported, the NRC declared November \n2010 in a press release. We found out that is not true.\n  As has been brought up, over 20 percent of our uranium is going into \nthe hands of Russia. Beyond the mines in Kazakhstan, which are among \nthe most lucrative in the world, the sale gave Russia control of one-\nfifth of all uranium production capacity in the U.S.\n  Since uranium is considered a strategic asset with implications for \nnational security, the deal had to be approved by a committee composed \nof representatives from a number of United States Government agencies. \nAmong those agencies that eventually signed off was the State \nDepartment, then headed by Mrs. Clinton. Frank Giustra, a mining \nfinancier, has donated $31.3 million to the foundation run by former \nPresident Bill Clinton.\n  As the Russians gradually assumed control of the Uranium One in three \nseparate transactions from 2009 to 2013, Canadian records show how a \nflow of cash made its way into the Clinton Foundation. We could go on \nand on about this.\n  Shortly after the Russians announced their intention to acquire the \nmajority stake in Uranium One, Mr. Clinton received $500,000 from a \nMoscow speech from a Russian investment bank with links to the Kremlin \nthat was promoting Uranium One stock. Very interesting. I remember when \nPresident Clinton was asked about his high speaking fees. He kind of \nbrushed it off with a laugh and said: Well, there are people who like \nto hear me speak.\n  Fordham University professor Zephyr Teachout, a highly regarded law \nprofessor who has written extensively about political corruption--and \nshe is a Democrat--said:\n\n       As a Democrat, I am concerned about Hillary Clinton as a \n     general election candidate. These questions aren't going \n     away. There is a pattern of foreign donations and speaking \n     fees that the Clinton Foundation and her husband have found \n     their ways to the Clinton Foundation.\n       Bill Clinton made 13 speeches between 2001 and 2012 in \n     which he was paid $500,000 or more. The interesting part is \n     11 of those speeches were made after Hillary Clinton became \n     Secretary of State--pay to play.\n       Why did the Clinton Foundation change its name to the Bill, \n     Hillary, and Chelsea Clinton Foundation?\n       It is surmised that it was because the public and large \n     corporation donors backed away from the questionable, if not \n     unethical, and possibly illegal activities.\n\n  I just want to speak as an American. We come up here from different \nbackgrounds. I see people who are here tonight who spoke tonight all \nfrom different backgrounds. The thing we hear about over and over again \nis that we want transparency and accountability. We demand that, but we \nnever see it. So as these investigations go forward, my hope is that \nthere is a conclusion to an investigation and that the people who broke \nthe law are held accountable so that we don't have to talk about \nanother investigation that spends the American taxpayers' money without \nsomebody paying the price for misrepresenting the American people and \nturning over strategic products of this country--uranium in this case--\nto a foreign entity that doesn't want the best for America.\n  Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman from Arizona for putting this \non and leading this.", "turn": 18, "speaker": "Mr. YOHO", "itemno": 19}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "B001302", "text": "  Mr. BIGGS.

HICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank my \ngood friend from Arizona for holding this Special Order. What an \nincredibly important issue.\n  Over the past year, we have heard nearly on a daily basis accusations \nof what Russia tries to do to undermine the United States. I think most \nof my colleagues would agree that Russia's actions over the past 2 \nyears, which include everything from cyber attacks to supporting \nAssad's bloody regime in Syria, all of it demonstrates that their \nintention is to disrupt the stability both of the United States and the \nentire world.\n\n\n  But here is the deal: none of this happened overnight. No one in \nRussia flipped a switch on their foreign policy and it suddenly changed \nfrom being friendly to the United States to trying to cause us harm.\n  The fact is the United States did not remain vigilant. Our foreign \npolicy suffered. We ignored the fact that Russian interests and goals \nare not our interests and goals. Nothing demonstrates this more than \nthe Uranium One case.\n  In 2010, the Committee on Foreign Investments of the United States \napproved a partial sale, as you have heard this evening, of a Canadian \ncompany to the Russian-owned nuclear giant Rosatom. We have heard about \nall of this. One-fifth of our uranium capacity gone.\n  In the United States, we have been long aware of the fact that the \nRussian Government's request is, among other things, to control the \nproduction of energy, both at home and in other nations, and then use \nthat energy as a source of leverage during conflicts.\n  Furthermore, striking information has been uncovered that Federal \nagents used a confidential U.S. witness working inside the Russian \nnuclear industry to gather extensive evidence that showed Moscow had \ncompromised an American uranium trucking firm with bribes and \nkickbacks, all, of course, in violation of the law.\n  Rather than bringing these charges up, however, the FBI kept this \nsecret. They didn't tell anyone about it for 4 years. That is \nunacceptable. We need to know why the FBI didn't share this \ninformation. Why was this crucial information about Russia's actions in \nour nuclear energy sector not shared? This is absolutely unacceptable.\n  Then, as we have been hearing tonight, we have the cases where \nRussian officials spent millions of dollars to benefit former President \nBill Clinton's charitable family foundation while Hillary was Secretary \nof State.\n  These are all extremely serious allegations, and it is absolutely our \nresponsibility to investigate them. There was a fundamental conflict of \ninterest here, and I think you would have to be blind not to recognize \nthat. Our Secretary of State was making decisions that impacted the \nentire world while, at the same time, receiving massive amounts of \nmoney from foreign donations.\n  As the Russians assumed control of Uranium One, the company's \nchairman was giving tons of money to the Clinton Foundation. Of course, \nnone of this was disclosed as it was supposed to be.\n  So from what we know, the decision to allow the Clinton Foundation to \ncontinue soliciting foreign donations was, at best, naive, if not \ncriminal. This seems to be a pattern of the previous administration. It \nis absolute cluelessness and self-interest, at best, perhaps even worse \nthan that. It is hardly surprising that Russia believed it could pull \nthe wool over our eyes with impunity and increased its malicious \nbehavior.\n  I look forward to this investigation going forward, and I thank my \nfriend\n\n\nfrom Arizona for having this Special Order.", "turn": 20, "speaker": "Mr. JODY B.
