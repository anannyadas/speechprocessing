Legislatively, we have been hard at work on everything from \nbudgets, to disaster relief, to consumer protections, to tax reform.\n  On the nominations front, we have taken strong action to strengthen \nthe judiciary, including confirming a slate of very-well-qualified \nnominees in recent days. This week, we are continuing our work to staff \nup the rest of the government as well. This is one of the Senate's most \nimportant functions and one we take seriously.\n  We are currently considering men and women who have been nominated to \nserve in many different roles at many different agencies. The one thing \nthey all share in common is this: They are ready to get to work, and \nthe sooner we confirm them, the sooner they can get on the job for our \ncountry.\n  First, we will vote to confirm John Gibson as Deputy Chief Management \nOfficer at the Department of Defense. He will be responsible for \nincreasing efficiency throughout the Department's business operations.\n  Afterward, the Senate will continue its consideration of Steven \nEngel, who will, as I discussed yesterday, serve as the Deputy Attorney \nGeneral in the Department of Justice Office of Legal Counsel.\n  The next nomination we will consider is that of Peter Robb to serve \nas the General Counsel of the National Labor Relations Board.\n  For most of its 80-year existence, the NLRB has had the important \nresponsibility of supporting stable labor relations by acting as a fair \nand impartial umpire in the resolution of labor disputes. \nUnfortunately, that changed under the previous administration, which \nwielded its Board majority as an anti-worker political cudgel at the \nbehest of special interests and union bosses. Instead of the Board's \nhistoric commitment to impartially applying the law, the NLRB's Obama-\nappointed Democratic majority put forward policies that diminished the \nrights of employees, hurt small businesses, and rewarded entrenched \npolitical elites at the expense of workers and the middle class.\n  Thankfully, this Senate recently confirmed a new majority to the NLRB \nthat is already beginning to undo the damage of the past 8 years. Now \nwe have the opportunity to build upon that good work with the \nnomination of Mr. Robb.\n  The NLRB's General Counsel is responsible for investigating cases of \nunfair labor practices and for advancing cases before the Board and its \nmembers. Mr. Robb will fulfill these duties under the aegis of a new \nBoard majority that is returning the NLRB to its true mission once \nmore.\n  Labor policy is not simply some theoretical abstraction for Mr. Robb; \nhe knows what it means to work as a hospital orderly or a construction \nworker, welder, truckdriver, forklift operator, or highway sign maker \nbecause he himself has worked in all of those jobs before. After law \nschool, Robb gained valuable experience in employment law. His previous \nleadership roles, including as an NLRB regional field attorney and \nchief counsel to a Board member, contribute to making Robb an ideal \ncandidate to serve as the Board's General Counsel.\n  I look forward to voting to advance this nomination, and I urge my \ncolleagues to join me in helping restore the NLRB to the neutral umpire \nof labor disputes it was meant to be.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. McCONNELL", "itemno": 0}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 1}], "header": {"chamber": "Senate", "num": "181", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "S7033", "wkday": "Tuesday", "day": "7", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "NOMINATIONS", "id": "CREC-2017-11-07-pt1-PgS7033-5", "title": "NOMINATIONS"}
