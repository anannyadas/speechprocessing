Inspire them to continue in their journey to \npromote the values upon which this great Nation was founded: justice, \nliberty, equality, freedom, and peace.\n  As Your blessings of goodness transcend into a dynamic of creativity, \nhelp us to see signs of hope born of pain as we often find ourselves \npresent in the midst of uncertainty and suffering.\n  May the vacuous space left by stains of catastrophic occurrences open \nthe minds and hearts of all to deeper compassion and a new level of \nhuman understanding.\n  May all that is done here today be for our American democracy while \nreflecting Your resplendent honor and glory.\n  Amen.\n", "kind": "Unknown", "speaker": "Unknown", "itemno": 0, "turn": -1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 1}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "181", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H8531-H8532", "wkday": "Tuesday", "day": "7", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "PRAYER", "id": "CREC-2017-11-07-pt1-PgH8531-4", "title": "PRAYER"}
