Mr. President, last week the Senate confirmed Kyle \nFortson to be a member of the National Mediation Board.\n  The National Mediation Board, established by the 1934 amendments to \nthe Railway Labor Act of 1926, is an independent U.S. Federal \nGovernment agency that facilitates labor-management relations within \nthe Nation's railroad and airline industries.\n  Pursuant to the Railway Labor Act, National Mediation Board programs \nhelp to resolve disputes to promote the flow of interstate commerce in \nthose industries through mediation, representation, and arbitration of \nlabor-management disputes.\n  A dedicated public servant, Kyle Fortson is eminently qualified to \nserve on the National Mediation Board. I am fortunate to say that Mrs. \nFortson currently serves on my staff as labor policy director at the \nU.S. Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions--HELP--Committee, \nafter serving in that position from 2010 to 2013 for Senator Mike Enzi. \nI have benefitted from Mrs. Fortson's experience, knowledge, and \ncounsel.\n  Mrs. Fortson previously served as labor counsel at the same committee \nfrom 2004 to 2010. Before that, she was a policy analyst at the Senate \nRepublican Policy Committee from 2003 to 2004 and served as counsel to \nSenator Tim Hutchinson from 2001 to 2003. She also served as judiciary \ncounsel to Congressman Spencer Bachus from 1999 to 2001.\n  Mrs. Fortson graduated with a B.A. in history from the University of \nColorado in 1996 and with a J.D. from George Washington University in \n1999.\n  Mrs. Fortson was nominated on June 26, 2017. On July 3, 2017, the \ncommittee received Mrs. Fortson's Office of Government Ethics \npaperwork, including her public financial disclosure and ethics \nagreement. Based on these documents, the Office of Government Ethics \nwrote to me that Kyle Fortson ``is in compliance with applicable laws \nand regulations governing conflicts of interest.'' The committee \nreceived Mrs. Fortson's HELP Committee application on July 27, 2017. \nMrs. Fortson was favorably reported out of the HELP Committee on \nOctober 18, 2017.\n  While the National Mediation Board will be very fortunate to have \nMrs. Fortson as a member, her departure will be a loss to the U.S. \nSenate and the HELP Committee. I am proud to support Kyle's nomination, \nand she will serve on the National Mediation Board with distinction.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. ALEXANDER", "itemno": 0}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 1}], "header": {"chamber": "Senate", "num": "181", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "S7056", "wkday": "Tuesday", "day": "7", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "CONFIRMATION OF KYLE FORTSON", "id": "CREC-2017-11-07-pt1-PgS7056-4", "title": "CONFIRMATION OF KYLE FORTSON"}
