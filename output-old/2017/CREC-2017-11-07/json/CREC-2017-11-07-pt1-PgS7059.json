Mr. President, with Veterans Day approaching this \nweekend, I would like to recognize and express my gratitude for the \npatriotism, selfless service, and community spirit of a small community \nin southern Montana. The town of Roberts, in Carbon County, is honoring \nmilitary veterans by lining Highway 212 with crosses and dogtags to \nrepresent servicemembers who have lived in Roberts. The crosses signify \nveterans who have passed away, while the dogtags symbolize living \nveterans.\n  The breadth of service in this scenic town north of Yellowstone Park \nis evident in the 133 dogtags on display this year. The depth of \nservice to our great county is rooted in the 308 crosses, some of which \ndate back to service in the Civil War. A total of 441 individuals, with \nservice spanning over a century and a half, is an impressive display of \npatriotism for any small community. The record of service among the \npeople of Roberts is even more awe-inspiring when you consider that, \nduring the last census, the town had just 361 residents.\n  As we gather to celebrate Veterans Day, let us be encouraged by the \nexample of the folks in Roberts and take time to remember the \naccumulated sacrifices and ongoing commitment that allow so many to \nlive in freedom. To the people of Roberts, thank you for punching above \nyour weight class for our Nation.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. DAINES", "itemno": 0}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 1}], "header": {"chamber": "Senate", "num": "181", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "S7059", "wkday": "Tuesday", "day": "7", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "RECOGNIZING ROBERTS, MONTANA", "id": "CREC-2017-11-07-pt1-PgS7059", "title": "RECOGNIZING ROBERTS, MONTANA"}
