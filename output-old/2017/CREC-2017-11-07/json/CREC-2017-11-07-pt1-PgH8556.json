Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2123, the Veterans E-\nHealth and Telemedicine Support Act of 2017.\n  I believe that telemedicine represents the future of healthcare \ndelivery, and I am proud of the fact that the Department of Veterans \nAffairs is a longtime leader in telemedicine.\n  Through VA's many different telehealth modalities, VA doctors and \nnurses have been able to better serve veterans in remote, rural, or \nmedically underserved areas and veterans with limited mobility or other \nissues that make it difficult to travel to and from the VA medical \nfacilities for needed appointments and follow-up care. Importantly, \nveterans who have had experience accessing care through telemedicine \nhave demonstrated improved healthcare outcomes, including decreases in \nhospital admissions.\n  It is my hope that all veterans would have access to VA telemedicine \nwhen and where appropriate. However, the continued expansion of \ntelemedicine across the VA healthcare system has been constrained by \nrestrictions on the ability of VA providers to practice telemedicine \nacross State lines without jeopardizing their State medical license.\n  H.R. 2123, the Veterans E-Health and Telemedicine Support Act of \n2017, would remove those constraints by authorizing the VA providers to \npractice telemedicine at a location in any State, regardless of where \nthe provider or patient is located. This would provide VA clinicians \nthe statutory protection they need to continue providing high-quality \ntelehealthcare to veteran patients across the country without fear of \npenalties imposed by the State medical licensing boards.\n  I am grateful to my friend and colleague, Representative Glenn \nThompson from the great State of Pennsylvania, for his leadership on \nthis issue and for bringing this important bill forward.\n  I am also grateful to my fellow committee member, Representative \nJulia Brownley of California, the ranking member of the Subcommittee on \nHealth, for her work and advocacy on VA telemedicine.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R. \n2123, and I reserve the balance of my time.", "turn": 4, "speaker": "Mr. BILIRAKIS", "itemno": 14}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "W000799", "text": "  Mr. WALZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as may consume.\n  I rise in strong support of H.R. 2123, the VETS Act of 2017.\n  Since its very inception, the Veterans Health Administration has been \na leader in medical advancements and the delivery of healthcare. This \nlegislation would ensure it continues this history of leadership by \nallowing VA providers to engage in the delivery of telemedicine to \nveterans all over the country, regardless of where the provider is \nlocated. These are paper barriers, these are legal barriers, not \nbarriers of technology, to allow us to deliver care.\n  Telemedicine and medicine, in general, is changing so rapidly, we \nneed to make sure that barriers are not put in place, especially for \nrural veterans, and many of us have them all over.\n  Last week, I did a field hearing in International Falls, Minnesota, \nwhich, by the way, will be 1 degree tomorrow for all of you, just so \nyou know. Those folks are veterans. They have served, but they are \nmiles from a VA facility. The technology that we have, and we know it \nworks, allows them to get that.\n  If we have veterans sitting on State borders, if we have veterans \nsitting in remote areas, it sometimes makes it difficult. It will give \nVA the tools it needs to remain a leader in the use of telehealth \ntechnology.\n  I am particularly thankful to Representatives Thompson and Brownley \nfor their leadership.

Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman and \nranking member for their support and their kind words.\n  Mr. Speaker, I do rise today in support of H.R. 2123, the Veterans E-\nHealth and Telemedicine Support Act, also known as the VETS Act.\n  Years ago, a constituent approached me to discuss the barriers to \ncare that his fellow veterans were experiencing through the VA system. \nAs an Active-Duty soldier, he told me stories of his friends coming \nhome from deployment and falling through the cracks of the system. Some \nwere suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder, TBIs, and \ndepression and required the care of specialists. Others had difficulty \ntraveling from their rural communities to VA medical centers because of \ninjuries sustained during combat. Too many of those wound up taking \ntheir own lives.\n  It broke my heart to hear the stories of this soldier's friends and \ncomrades not receiving the care that they deserve. What made it more \ndifficult was the fact that this constituent soldier was my son.\n  After numerous conversations trying to figure out how we can help our \nservicemembers when they return home, we determined that expanding \naccess to telehealth would be a great start. Many of our veterans live \nin rural areas and are unable to travel far distances. Allowing them to \nsee their healthcare provider in the comfort of their home would \nincrease their access to care. This is why Representative Julia \nBrownley and I introduced the VETS Act.\n\n  The VETS Act will allow VA-employed healthcare providers to practice \ntelehealth across State lines, no matter where the doctor or the \npatient is located. It also commissions a report to study the \neffectiveness of telemedicine programs utilized by the Department of \nVeterans Affairs.\n  While the VA has made major strides and is a leader in advancing \ntelehealth access, outdated barriers limit its\n\n\ngrowth. Currently, each State has its own licensing requirements for \nhealthcare providers to practice medicine within its borders. For \nexample, if a doctor practices in Pennsylvania and Ohio, they must hold \na license from each State.\n  VA-provider licensing requirements are different. As long as a doctor \nis licensed and in good standing with a single State, they can practice \nin-person care within the VA system in any State. This reciprocity, \nhowever, is not afforded to the practice of telehealth. VA providers \nseeking to provide telehealthcare to patients must also be licensed in \nthe State where the patient is located. These outdated regulations are \nhurting our Nation's veterans.\n  The Department of Veterans Affairs has successfully been using \ntelemedicine for quite some time. Since 2002, more than 2 million \nveterans have received telehealthcare through the VA. In 2016 alone, \nmore than 12 percent of veterans receiving VA care utilized telehealth \nin some aspect. Forty-five percent of these veterans live in rural \nareas.\n  Veterans who have accessed telehealth are overwhelmingly pleased with \nthe quality of care and access they received. Those receiving at-home \ncare, for example, through telehealth cite an 88 percent satisfaction \nrate.\n  While the VA has done a great job of expanding telehealth access to \nveterans across the country, more needs to be done. Our veterans \ndeserve the best care available to them, and this starts with the \npassage of the VETS Act.\n  I thank Representative Brownley, Committee Chairman Dr. Phil Roe, \nRanking Member Tim Walz, and Chairman Bilirakis for bringing this bill \nto the floor today.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of the bill to give our \nNation's veterans access to quality, proven healthcare.", "turn": 7, "speaker": "Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania", "itemno": 17}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "W000799", "text": "  Mr. WALZ.

However, VA providers are restricted from practicing \ntelemedicine across State lines.

One way the VA can modernize is by embracing telehealth and \nusing new technologies to provide more timely and convenient care for \nour veterans.\n  The VA has seen tremendous growth and interest in telehealth over the \npast few years, and we should continue to find innovative ways to \nconnect veterans with the providers that they need, no matter their \nphysical location.

For instance, at a field \nhearing in my district, Zachary Walker, a Navy veteran, testified about \nthe fast and efficient service that telemedicine can deliver to our \nveterans, getting him in the door to his local clinic faster than a \ntraditional appointment.\n  Our bill is a commonsense solution that will allow us to further \nexpand on these telehealth services by permitting VA providers to \nconduct telehealth treatment across state lines no matter their \nlocation, connecting more health professionals with the veterans who \nneed their care.\n  It has been my pleasure to work with Congressman Glenn `GT' Thompson, \nand Senators Joni Ernst and Mazie Hirono, to advance this bipartisan, \nbicameral bill, which has received widespread support from the Veterans \nService Organizations and the VA.
