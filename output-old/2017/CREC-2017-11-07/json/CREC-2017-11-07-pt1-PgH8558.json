This is unacceptable, in my opinion. H.R. 2601, as \namended, represents a commonsense solution. That is what we are all \nabout today: commonsense solutions for our true heroes. It would \nrequire the VA to consider whether there is a medically compelling \nreason to require a veteran to travel outside the organ procurement and \ntransplantation network region that the veteran resides in to receive a \ntransplant from a VA transplant center, or whether the veteran faces an \nunusual or excessive burden in receiving a transplant from a VA \ntransplant center before referring a veteran to a VA transplant center, \nrather than to a community transplant center.\n  This would greatly increase access to transplant care in the \ncommunity for veteran transplant patients living far from VA transplant \ncenters.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.", "turn": 4, "speaker": "Mr. BILIRAKIS", "itemno": 12}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "W000799", "text": "  Mr. WALZ.

That is common sense. It makes the case that the \ntransplant facilities at the VA are good, but, as Dr. Dunn pointed out, \na diverse society, a diverse geographic spread of veterans, certain \ncases come up that make it medically wrong to try and transport someone \nto a further facility. And for all of those reasons, this is, again, \none of those things that is just smart, all in the interest of the best \ncare for our veterans.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.", "turn": 5, "speaker": "Mr. WALZ", "itemno": 13}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "B001257", "text": "  Mr. BILIRAKIS.

Mr. Speaker, let me start by saying thank you to Vice \nChairman Bilirakis; and to our chairman, Dr. Roe; and also to the \nranking member, Sergeant Major Walz from Minnesota. It has been great \nto work with them. They have been very helpful with this bill.\n  I am honored to speak in support of my legislation, H.R. 2601, the \nVeterans Increased Choice for Transplanted Organs and Recovery, or \nVICTOR, Act.\n  America owes our veterans every advantage when it comes to receiving \nan organ or bone marrow transplant, yet the current VA transplant \npolicy often runs counter to the medical interest of the patient. There \nare only 14 facilities in the Nation where a veteran may receive a \ntransplant in the VA healthcare system, and none of these facilities \nperform all types of transplants.\n  Timely organ transplants often represent the difference between life \nand death. Unfortunately, due to government bureaucracy, our veterans \nare often forced to travel hundreds or thousands of miles repeatedly in \norder to get the chance to receive a new liver, heart, or kidney. That \ntravel alone can prove fatal.\n  Traveling to get a transplant isn't the only obstacle these patients \nface. Oftentimes, it is the program itself. The limited size and scope \nof the VA transplant program means veterans have a lower chance of \ngetting a transplant and a greater chance of dying while on the waiting \nlist.\n  The VICTOR Act allows veterans who need an organ or bone marrow \ntransplant through the VA system the ability to access a federally \ncertified transplant center close to their home if the veteran and \ntheir doctor agree that that is medically safer. It will make it easier \nfor veterans to access lifesaving medical care by allowing them a \nnumber of ways to qualify for care closer to home.\n  As a surgeon and as a veteran, I believe this is good medicine and \ngood public policy. The status quo puts roadblocks in front of veterans \nwho need lifesaving transplant care, and the VICTOR Act eliminates \nthese roadblocks and increases access to care our veterans have earned.", "turn": 7, "speaker": "Mr. DUNN", "itemno": 15}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "W000799", "text": "  Mr. WALZ.

This can ultimately prove fatal. We owe \nit to our Nation's\n\n\nheroes to provide them the best possible care, regardless of where they \nlive.\n  Mr. Speaker, I support the legislation offered by my friend and \ncolleague from Florida, Dr. Dunn, to solve this problem.
