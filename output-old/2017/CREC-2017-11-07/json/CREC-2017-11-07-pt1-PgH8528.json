Mr. Speaker, as the Nation celebrates Veterans Day \nthis week, a day we honor those who served our country, I am happy to \nreport the VA has made great strides in improving and assisting \nveterans with physical injuries. It struggled, however, to deal with \nmany of the invisible injuries plaguing our veterans, like post-\ntraumatic stress disorder.\n  These invisible injuries ravage our Nation's veteran population, with \nan average of more than 20 veterans a day committing suicide. This is \nentirely unacceptable. We must work harder to look for real solutions \nto this crisis.\n  That is why I am here today urging my colleagues to support the \nPuppies Assisting Wounded Servicemembers Act, also known as the PAWS \nAct. The PAWS Act will set up a 5-year pilot program in the VA to \nprovide post-9/11 veterans suffering from PTSD with service dogs if \nother treatments have not been successful.\n  Individuals suffering from PTSD experience emotional numbness, \nloneliness, nightmares, hypervigilance, and anxiety. However, \ntraditional VA treatments are symptoms-based and often have side \neffects or fail to address the root of these issues.\n  Service dogs, however, have no side effects. They can be used in \ntandem with other treatments. They can be\n\n\ntrained to wake their owners from nightmares, create a buffer zone in \nlarge crowds, remind their owners to take their medication, and watch \ntheir owners' back to provide a sense of security and more.\n  I have heard from veterans suffering from PTSD that sometimes the \nhardest part of the day is just getting out of bed in the morning. The \nschedule of walking, feeding, and caring for his or her service dog \noffers veterans purpose and a sense of responsibility. Ultimately, a \nservice dog and its owner better each others' lives.\n  It is important that the House pass the PAWS Act and allow the VA to \nexamine the efficiency and effectiveness of providing veterans with \nservice dogs.\n  While talking about service animals, I would also like to recognize \nEli's Fund, an initiative at Texas A&M University created in memory of \nthe late Lance Corporal Colton Rusk and Eli, his service dog, that \nprovides financial support for service animals of Active-Duty \nservicemen and -women, medically retired veterans' service animals, and \nretired military animals, to help with veterinary medical bills. It is \nimportant that military animals continue to be cared for in retirement.\n\n\n Congratulating George Gonzales and the Corpus Christi Army Depot for \n                          Outstanding Service\n", "turn": 1, "speaker": "Mr. FARENTHOLD", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "F000460", "text": "  Mr. FARENTHOLD. Mr. Speaker, I am proud to represent the Corpus \nChristi Army Depot, considered as the jewel of the Army Depot system.\n  CCAD is currently the largest rotary wing aircraft facility in the \nworld. Instead of buying new helicopters, which cost $17 million or \nmore, CCAD repairs and rehabilitates the current fleet, often at less \nthan half the cost of new helicopters. CCAD saves taxpayers millions of \ndollars, while ensuring the U.S. Army maintains a superior level of \nreadiness and reliability.\n  This would not be possible without outstanding employees like Army \nveteran George Gonzalez, who recently received the prestigious 2017 \nDonald F. Luce Depot Maintenance Artisan Award, given annually to one \nindividual who makes an outstanding contribution to Army aviation in \nthe area of depot maintenance.\n  Gonzales leads a 31-man team that reassembles UH-60 Black Hawk \nhelicopters. Under his leadership, the team has reduced the average \nbuild time from 42 to 17 days.\n  Congratulations, George, and your team, and everyone at CCAD, who are \ndoing an outstanding job ensuring our warfighters are equipped with the \naviation assets they need to keep America safe and be a force for good \naround the world.\n\n\n\n       Recognizing the Accomplishments of Commander Armando Solis\n", "turn": 2, "speaker": "Mr. FARENTHOLD", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "F000460", "text": "  Mr. FARENTHOLD. Mr. Speaker, I am here today to recognize the career \nof recently retired Flour Bluff High School Navy Junior ROTC \ninstructor, Commander Armando Solis.\n  In 1993, following completion of nearly 22 years in the United States \nNavy, Commander Solis became the inaugural Navy Junior Reserve Officer \nTraining Corps naval science instructor at Flour Bluff High School. \nOver the next 24 years, Commander Solis not only instilled his students \nwith values of citizenship, service to the United States, personal \nresponsibility, and sense of accomplishment, but he also created one of \nthe most successful JROTC programs in the Nation.\n  In his first year, the Navy selected the Flour Bluff program as the \nbest new program in Texas and, by his fourth year, the best in the \nNation. With 23 years as a distinguished honors program, 22 Texas Navy \nJROTC championships, a record 11 Navy national championship titles, and \nthe honor of being the only Navy program to win the All-Service \nNational Drill Team Championship, Commander Solis has touched the lives \nof thousands of students, instilling them with the values of \npatriotism, loyalty, and, most importantly, service.\n  Thank you, Commander Solis, for your commitment to our students and \nour Nation.
