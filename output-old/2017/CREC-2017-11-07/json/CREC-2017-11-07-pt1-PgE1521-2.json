Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the \n80th Anniversary of the Edmundite Missions at Our Lady of Queen of \nPeace Catholic Church in Selma, Alabama. For 80 years the Edmundite \nMissions has faithfully served poor and underprivileged communities \nthroughout the Deep South.\n   The Edmundite Missions, whose legal name is ``Fathers of St. Edmund \nSouthern Mission'', is rooted in the Gospel of Jesus Christ and focuses \non providing food, clothing and shelter to poor and marginalized \nchildren and families, young adults and seniors of all faith \ntraditions. Their work aims to address issues of systemic poverty in \nthe region while sharing the hope they believe only comes through \nfaith. While the Edmundite Mission in Alabama is headquartered in \nSelma, their outreach area includes the Alabama counties of Butler, \nDallas, Lowndes, Monroe, Perry and Wilcox, and New Orleans, Louisiana.\n   The inspiring story of Edmundite Missions began with a call to \naction when in 1936 Pope Pius XI appealed to the Society of St. Edmund \nto go minister to the African-Americans of the Deep South, whom the \nPope felt had been neglected by both church and state. The Edmundites \nresponded by selecting two young priests, Father Francis Casey, S.S.E. \nand Father John ``Barney'' Paro, S.S.E., to take on the assignment. \nThey wrote to Bishop Thomas J. Toolen of Mobile, who invited them to \nset up a ``colored mission'' in Selma.\n   Fathers Casey and Paro arrived in Selma on July 6, 1937, and moved \ninto a former saloon on Broad Street. They discovered thousands of \npeople living in extreme poverty, similar to that of a third world \ncountry. In response, they began their outreach by conducting door-to-\ndoor evangelization of the black community and building a small chapel, \nSt. Elizabeth's Mission. Initially, they were met with skepticism and \nresentment by both the black and white communities in Selma. But their \nservices to the poor gradually won them respect from the community.\n   The work of the Edmundite Missions helped to transform the \ncommunities of Alabama's rural Black Belt during some of the most \nturbulent times of race relations in American history. In 1940, the \nMissions welcomed the Sisters of Saint Joseph (S.S.J.) from Rochester, \nNew York, who came to Selma to provide education and social ministry. \nThe Sisters of St. Joseph started St. Elizabeth's School in 1941 and \nHoly Infant Inn (a nursing home) in 1943. In 1944, the Edmundites \npurchased Selma Good Samaritan Hospital, a rundown infirmary for \nblacks, and the Sisters set about transforming it into a modern \nfacility. They established the Good Samaritan School of Nursing, the \nfirst medical training program for African-American women in the area.\n   In 1947, Father Nelson Ziter launched the Don Bosco Boys' Club \n(1947-1966), named after the patron saint of youth work. For the next \n19 years until 1966, the club helped hundreds of black youth prepare \nand win the financial assistance needed to attend college. Father Ziter \ndevoted countless hours and days to ensuring the success of every youth \nwho came into the club.\n   On a personal note, I can attest to the transformative power of the \nDon Bosco Boys' Club. My dad, Andrew A. Sewell and many of his close \nfriends, credit the support, love and guidance of Father Ziter for \nchanging the trajectory of their lives. My dad and many of his \nteammates received athletic scholarships to historically black \ncolleges--becoming first generation college graduates. The Club and its \nministry helped to break the cycle of poverty for these African \nAmerican boys such that they became teachers, doctors, lawyers and even \npriests. The Sewell family is forever indebted to the generous support \nand assistance the Edmundite Missions has given to the communities of \nSelma and throughout the Black Belt for over 80 years.\n   The Mission has a long history of seeing beyond color, creed or \nfinancial status. Their philosophy was never more relevant than during \nthe turbulent years of the civil rights and voting rights movements. \nThe Edmundites found themselves the center of controversy during the \n1960s, when they were the only whites in Selma who openly supported the \nvoting rights movement. During the 1950s and 1960s, the Mission and its \npriest and sisters worked with Selma black and white leaders, its \nbusiness community and its white ministers to open the lines of \ncommunication between the races. They believed that progress could be \nachieved in Selma without violence or confrontations.\n   During the March from Selma to Montgomery, the Edmundites led by \nFather Ouellet, played a critical role. On March 7, 1965, the brutal \nconfrontation at the Edmund Pettus Bridge caught the attention of the \nnation. Scores of wounded marchers poured into the emergency room at \nGood Samaritan Hospital, where doctors, nurses and Sisters worked \naround the clock to address the crisis. Good Samaritan Hospital won \nnational praise for its treatment of the victims of the infamous Bloody \nSunday confrontation, including providing medical treatment to our \ncolleague, Congressman John Lewis.\n   Father Ouellet left Selma in June of 1965, on orders from Archbishop \nToolen of Mobile, who was angered by the Father's identification with \nthe marchers and wanted a quieter response. When he said goodbye to his \nweeping parishioners, Father Ouellet urged them to remain loyal to the \nChurch and to their dreams. ``All that we do we must do with love,'' he \ntold them. ``Let there be no hatred, let there be no bitterness, and \nlet there be no desire for any revenge.''\n   Reconciliation was a long time in coming, but the Missions continued \nto work quietly for reconciliation and racial progress. The ``Selma \nAccords of 1972,'' which brought about significant progress in the \ncity, was negotiated in part by Assistant Missions Director Father \nJames Robinson.\n   The incredible work done by the Edmundite Missions over the last 80 \nyears has had life-changing impacts that reach far beyond the immediate \ncommunities they support. Today the Edmundite Missions continue to work \ntirelessly to provide essential nutritional, education and healthcare \nservices and programs throughout the region. In 2016 alone, the \nMissions provided more than 300,000 meals, helped house or assisted to \nclothe more than 6,000 people, aided in the healthcare of more than \n2,000 people and participated in the education of more than 10,000 \nchildren.\n   The citizens of Selma and surrounding Black Belt counties have come \na long way since 1937, when Edmundite Missionaries began their work \nthere. For 80 years, the Edmundite Missions has partnered with \ndistressed, underserved communities to provide direct action and \nassistance to alleviate the conditions of poverty in Deep South. We are \nstronger, more inclusive and better resourced because of their efforts.\n   I ask my colleagues to join me in celebrating the 80th Anniversary \nof the Edmundite Missions and in recognizing its many contributions. \nMay the glory of Edmundite Missions continue to grow and prosper for \nyears to come.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Ms. SEWELL of Alabama", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 3}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "181", "extension": true, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "E1521", "wkday": "Tuesday", "day": "7", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "TRIBUTE HONORING THE 80TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE EDMUNDITE MISSIONS", "id": "CREC-2017-11-07-pt1-PgE1521-2", "title": "TRIBUTE HONORING THE 80TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE EDMUNDITE MISSIONS"}
