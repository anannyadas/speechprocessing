Mr. President, today I wish to shine a spotlight on the \nincreasingly dire political, security, and humanitarian crisis in the \nDemocratic Republic of the Congo. Senator Booker and I, along with \nSenators Durbin, Coons, Warren, Markey, and Brown, recently sent a \nletter to President Trump urging the administration to take immediate \naction to ensure that the United States is prepared to do our part to \nhelp stave off further violence and human suffering.\n  The Democratic Republic of the Congo, or the DRC as it is known, is a \ncountry of vast natural resource wealth. It is the largest country in \nsub-Saharan Africa by land mass, with ample arable land, a variety of \nprecious minerals, and the world's second-largest river, the Congo, \nwhich possesses substantial hydroelectric potential; yet, despite an \nabundance of natural resources--indeed, because of it--the people of \nthe DRC have endured centuries of exploitation and atrocities. In the \npostcolonial era, the country has struggled with decades of conflict, \nendemic corruption, and extreme poverty. The DRC ranks 176th out of 188 \ncountries on the Human Development Index. Life expectancy is 59 years. \nAn estimated 77 percent of the people live on less than $2 a day. More \nthan 12 percent of children do not live to see their fifth birthday. \nMothers die in childbirth in more than 7 out of every 1,000 live \nbirths. The statistics are truly alarming.\n  The 1997 to 2003 civil war involved at least seven countries in the \nregion and, by some estimates, caused 5.4 million deaths from war and \nwar-related causes. The conflict was characterized by massive human \nrights violations and introduced the world to the brutal consequences \nof the mining of conflict minerals. Eastern Congo has been referred to \nas the rape capital of the world, and sexual violence continues to be \nused as a weapon to traumatize and terrorize the population.\n  Despite the establishment of truth and reconciliation committees by \nthe Sun City Accords in 2002, the installation of a unity government in \n2003, and the deployment of the largest United Nations peacekeeping \nforce in the world, the country remains unstable. The peacekeeping \nmission in DRC plays a critical role in protecting civilians in \nconflict areas and promoting stability; yet its capabilities are \nlimited, and it is not a substitute for a political agreement respected \nand adhered to by all relevant stakeholders. Let me be clear: I fully \nsupport MONUSCO peacekeepers who seek to uphold their mandate. Though \nthe mission has come under criticism over the years for not doing \nenough to protect civilians and for controversies regarding its own \nabuses, we must ask ourselves what would have happened--and what might \nstill happen--if the UN were not present--or if the United States \nforces such significant troop reductions that the mission is rendered \nineffective, which I fear we may be perilously close to doing.\n\n\n  Despite the deployment of peacekeepers and despite the Sun City \nAccords, conflict, instability, and meddling by other countries in DRC \npersisted. It took another 10 years and the efforts of the UN and the \nAfrican Union to put the Congo on a path towards true stability in 2013 \nthrough what became known as the Framework of Hope, in which other \ngovernments pledged noninterference; yet, instead of building on this \nlandmark agreement over the past 4 years to achieve reconciliation, \nstabilization, and development, the country has become subsumed in new \nconflicts and instability due to political leaders' self-interested and \nshortsighted calculations.\n  DRC's long and as yet incomplete road to peace is a classic example \nof how pernicious longstanding conflicts require persistent, high-level \ndiplomatic engagement to untangle and address root causes. \nInternational diplomacy often isn't swift or easy, and sometimes the \nparties take two steps forward and one step back. It is often \nfrustrating. It is often exhausting, but it is always essential. The \nwork of former Special Envoy for the Great Lakes Russ Feingold, who was \nconstantly in the region engaging with heads of state, was instrumental \nin holding neighboring countries to their commitments under the \nFramework of Hope, which reduced violence and insecurity. The work of \nSenator Feingold's successor, Tom Perriello, was instrumental in \nhelping obtain a political agreement in the DRC in 2016 that held the \npromise of achieving democratic elections and an end to sweeping \ngovernment abuses against unarmed civilian protesters.\n  The current spread of violence within the DRC serves as a painful \nreminder of how critical it is that we continue to work not only to \nmaintain the gains we have made on the international front, but also \nthe fragile respect for democracy and good governance inside DRC. \nAccording to the constitution adopted in 2005, elections should have \ntaken place in November of last year, and President Joseph Kabila, \nhaving served two terms, should have stepped down. Instead, President \nKabila first tried to change the constitution and then, when that \neffort failed, he threw up obstacles--slow-rolling voter registration, \nunderfunding the electoral commission, and insisting on a unilateral \nand hurried process for the creation of new provinces--all of which \nprecipitated a political crisis late last year when it became clear \nthat the polls would not be open. While the opposition engaged in good-\nfaith negotiations with the government to come to agreement on a new \nelection timeline, Kabila has once again refused to abide by the terms. \nIn fact, elections planned for the end of this year per that December \n31 agreement--duly signed by the ruling party and the opposition--will \nnot take place until December 2018. President Kabila's decision to \nremain in power beyond his mandate and to walk away from last year's \npolitical deal has caused instability and upheaval that, if not \ndirectly responsible, appears to be feeding growing violence and unrest \nin various parts of the country, this time including in areas of the \ncountry that had been largely been stable.\n  Government forces and progovernment militia are accused of gross \nhuman rights violations in the Kasai region. Two UN investigators, \nincluding an American, were killed in the region in March as they \nattempted to look into allegations of human rights abuses by security \nforces, and multiple researchers have uncovered evidence of potential \ninvolvement by state actors in their murder. The UN has not ruled out \ninvolvement by government forces, but more investigation is needed. At \nleast 80 mass graves have been discovered. Over 5,000 people have been \nkilled since 2016, according to some reports. The lives of hundreds of \nthousands of children and their families in Greater Kasai have been \nturned upside down by this brutal violence, with nearly a million and a \nhalf people internally displaced in the Kasai alone, including 850,000 \nchildren. Just last week, the head of the World Food Program warned \nthat, if WFP did not receive funding and access to the area, hundreds \nof thousands of children would die over the next couple of months. All \ntold, nearly 4 million Congolese are internally displaced--over a \nmillion newly displaced in Kasai alone just over the last 12 months--\ngiving DRC the dubious distinction of having the most internally \ndisplaced people in Africa.\n  We have a moral obligation to pursue peace. We cannot stand by and \nallow conflict in DRC or anywhere else spiral so far out of control \nthat an untold number of women are victims of sexual violence, and \nmillions die from conflict, starvation, and preventable disease.\n  We have a moral obligation to try to halt mass atrocities wherever \nthey occur. The scale of violence perpetrated against civilians in \nCongo has been staggering.\n  We should care because the world is supporting a massive peacekeeping \noperation in the country to the tune of $1.14 billion a year, of which \nthe U.S. will pay an estimated $325 million this year. We need the \nMONUSCO mission to be efficient, we need it to be effective, and we \nneed to create conditions for it to end, but the only way for the \nmission to draw down in a responsible fashion is as peace and stability \nare progressively achieved. Therefore, the United States, a leader in \nthe international community, must do more to help facilitate a \npolitical process that will lead to a durable peace.\n  The problems in the Congo are not insurmountable, and our voice and \ndiplomatic influence could help bring about a solution if the Trump \nadministration is willing to make an effort to do so. There are several \neasy steps it could take immediately.\n  No. 1, the administration could fill critical vacancies. The \nPresident should immediately nominate an accredited Ambassador to \nKinshasa. Our last Ambassador, a highly capable career foreign service \nofficer, left his post in December. The President should nominate an \nAssistant Secretary of State for African Affairs for Senate \nconfirmation. The position has remained vacant for 9 months, with \nAmbassador Donald Yamamoto serving in the role in an acting capacity.\n  Second, on the heels of UN Ambassador Nikki Haley's visit to DRC last \nmonth--one of the first visits to the continent by a senior member of \nthe Trump administration--I urge the delegation to capitalize on the \nmomentum from that trip to push for the following: No. 1, \nimplementation of the December 31 agreement; No. 2, broader cooperation \nwith and support for the investigation into human rights abuses in \nKasai; No. 3, ensuring there is a credible international investigation \ninto the murder of the two UN investigators; and No. 4, sharing the \nassessment of the humanitarian emergency in the Kasais.\n  I understand that Gen. Thomas Waldhauser, head of U.S. Africa \nCommand, accompanied Ambassador Haley. I hope that he will share his \nassessment and any recommendations he has related to MONUSCO's \ndeployment. I urge Ambassador Haley to ask that the Security Council \nconvene an emergency meeting to discuss the findings of her trip. \nFinally, the administration should reexamine the decision in March of \nthis year to lower MONUSCO's troop ceiling, given conditions in the \ncountry and the observations of the returning delegation.\n  We must use all the tools at our disposal, such as the Atrocities \nPrevention Board, to devise concrete actions our diplomats can take to \nstave off further violence. The White House should consider tightening \nsanctions on the regime. So far, we have sanctioned six sitting or \nformer senior government and security officials, as well as a private \ncompany owned by one of them, under Executive Order 13671 issued in \n2014. Sanctions have proven effective at getting Kinshasa's attention \nand should be applied in an ever-tightening manner aimed at the highest \nlevels of government until we see demonstrable progress towards \nimplementing the December 31 agreement. The Global Magnitsky Act is \nanother tool that the administration could use to further pressure the \nregime.\n  The last conflict in DRC caused a regional conflagration that I \nconsider among the worst in the continent's recent history in terms of \nthe toll on human lives. It should never be repeated. The \nadministration can and should take the steps I have just outlined \nimmediately. While simple and straightforward, they could prevent \nfurther bloodshed. A repetition of the war is not inevitable, and I \nhope the President will take action to forestall\n\n\nan increasingly dire humanitarian and political crisis in the region.\n  (At the request of Mr. Schumer, the following statement was ordered \nto be printed in the Record.)\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. CARDIN", "itemno": 0}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 1}], "header": {"chamber": "Senate", "num": "181", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "S7056-S7058", "wkday": "Tuesday", "day": "7", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF THE CONGO", "id": "CREC-2017-11-07-pt1-PgS7056-5", "title": "DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF THE CONGO"}
