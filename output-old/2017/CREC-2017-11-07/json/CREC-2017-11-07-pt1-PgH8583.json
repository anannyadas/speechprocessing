Mr. Speaker, the Republicans are scamming America. They \nare offering a facade of lowered taxes that you probably will never see \nin exchange for massive and permanent tax cuts for the wealthiest \nAmericans and corporations.\n  And for what?\n  We are told the corporate and upper income tax cuts will result in \nmore investment and greater economic growth, which will yield more jobs \nand more revenue for the country and higher wages for the middle class.\n  But this is bunk. They have run this scam twice before. Reagan passed \nsimilar upper class tax cuts and told us the tax cuts would generate \nsuch economic growth that they would pay for themselves.\n  What happened?\n  The national debt--accumulated from George Washington through Jimmy \nCarter--went from $800 billion in 1980 to $4.3 trillion 12 years later, \nand growth was less than under President Clinton.\n  George Bush's tax cut turned an anticipated 10-year $5.65 trillion \nsurplus into a $10.63 trillion debt in 8 years.\n  And 3 or 4 years from now, Republicans will use the $1.5 trillion to \n$2 trillion deficit this scam will create to say: Look at this massive \ndeficit. We have to make savage cuts to Social Security, Medicare, \neducation, and infrastructure.\n  That is what they are building in now. The Republicans are scamming \nAmerica, and we must reject this bill.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. NADLER", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "181", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H8583", "wkday": "Tuesday", "day": "7", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "GOP TAX SCAM", "id": "CREC-2017-11-07-pt1-PgH8583", "title": "GOP TAX SCAM"}
