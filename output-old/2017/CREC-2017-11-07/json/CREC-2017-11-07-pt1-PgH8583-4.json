Mr. Speaker, I rise in honor of Veterans Day, which we \nwill observe this Saturday, November 11.\n  Each Veterans Day, we celebrate America's veterans for their \nunwavering patriotism and willingness to serve and sacrifice above \nself. How noble for liberty's cause, yet too many veterans, upon their \nreturn from service, endure long wait-times at VA health facilities.\n  That is why I have developed a bill that would reduce the VA \nphysician shortage, which is estimated to be about 5,000.\n  Our VET MD Act would address this by allowing pre-med students to \nparticipate in organized clinical observations at VA medical centers. \nFuture physicians will have exposure to the VA healthcare system, and \nthe VA will create potential medical professionals.\n  This is just one solution Congress should implement to address the VA \nphysician shortage. It will help lead to decreased wait-times, better \ncare, and healthier outcomes.\n  Our veterans dedicated their lives for our country. We owe these \nhonorable men and women better basic healthcare.\n  Mr. Speaker, on this Veterans Day, I urge my colleagues to please \njoin me. Let us affirm a commitment to action for the men and women who \nhave defended our liberty and have lived the words duty, honor, and \ncountry.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Ms. KAPTUR", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "181", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H8583", "wkday": "Tuesday", "day": "7", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "VETERANS DAY", "id": "CREC-2017-11-07-pt1-PgH8583-4", "title": "VETERANS DAY"}
