As \nthese statistics show, the Veterans Crisis Line is an incredibly \nvaluable resource for veterans. However, while the VA tracks and \nevaluates statistics such as these for quality and access metrics, it \ndoes not currently process them through any meaningful form of data \nanalytics as it relates to the effectiveness of the program.\n  So, Mr. Speaker, H.R. 4173, as amended, the Veterans Crisis Line \nStudy Act of 2017, would direct the Secretary to evaluate the efficacy \nof the VCL with respect to continuity of VA mental health services \nusing the same anonymous data points as are currently collected by the \nVCL. Research and data analysis of these anonymous data points would \nutilize the growing national availability of statistics regarding \nsuicides to better evaluate the impact of the VCL and potentially \nhighlight opportunities for outcome improvements.\n  Mr. Speaker, I believe that evaluating the VCL effectively requires a \nfocus on the full continuum of mental health services provided by VA \nonce a veteran first contacts the VCL or establishes a need for mental \nhealth services.\n  Again, it is important to note that, under this legislation, the \nprivacy of the caller is to be honored, and the VCL is directed to \ncontinue collecting data points in exactly the same manner as they \ncurrently are.\n  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to support this great bill, and I \nreserve the balance of my time.", "turn": 4, "speaker": "Mr. BILIRAKIS", "itemno": 10}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "W000799", "text": "  Mr. WALZ.

This \nis a piece of legislation very near and dear to my heart.\n  One of the first pieces of legislation I worked on when I got to this \nHouse in 2007 was the Joshua Omvig Veterans Suicide Prevention Act, \nwhich was dealing with the loss of a young warrior from Iowa. One of \nthe pieces of legislation that came out of that was the Veterans Crisis \nLine, with the idea that we needed that.\n  That was a good piece of legislation, but as time has gone by, Mr. \nBanks has pointed out ways to improve that. I am in full support. I am \ngrateful for the thought that he has put into this. I am grateful for \nthe gentleman from Florida's recognition that we may never know with \nabsolute certainty how many lives we save, but I think each of us know \nthat this has been an invaluable service.

Mr. Speaker, let me first thank the gentleman \nfrom Florida for his continued efforts to support our veterans. As a \nproud member of the House Veterans' Affairs Committee, it is great to \nwork on such a bipartisan committee with Ranking Member Walz and other \nmembers who care deeply about our American veterans.\n  Mr. Speaker, sadly, every single day 20 veterans take their own \nlives. In 1 year, the total is nearly as many people who live in my \nhometown of Columbia City, Indiana.\n  Veterans account for 18 percent of suicides, even though they are \nonly 8\\1/2\\ percent of the total population. Our female veterans are \n2\\1/2\\ times more likely to commit suicide than civilian women.\n  We can't allow this to continue. Just one veteran suicide a day is a \nhorrible tragedy, let alone 20. Our veterans were vigilant in fighting \nfor our freedoms. We must be just as vigilant in fighting for their \nneeds. Mr. Speaker, the bill before us today seeks to enable the VA's \nVeterans Crisis Line, or VCL, to be even more effective in this fight.\n  As has already been mentioned, since 2007, it has fielded nearly 2.8 \nmillion calls and 67,000 text messages. But there is no overarching \napproach to ensure the VA knows the effectiveness of the VCL in \npreventing future suicide attempts after the initial phone call or how \nwell the crisis line connects veterans to the mental healthcare \nservices of the VA. That is why, with this bill, we can harness the \npower of data analytics to improve the functionality of the VCL and the \nVA's mental healthcare services.\n  The VCL is a critical tool, and we must do everything we can to help \nit play as large a role as possible. We must ensure that our veterans \nwho seek care can access it so that they can find a long-term solution \nto their difficulties. Mr. Speaker, we must ensure our veterans know \nthey are not alone after the phone call.\n\n  I have spoken with veterans service organizations throughout this \nbill's progress. I thank them for their feedback and for looking out \nfor our veterans.\n  I would like to thank Congressman Moulton, who was my lead on the \nother side of the aisle, for his work as a partner on this bill, as \nwell, and for his dedication to our veteran population.\n  I would also like to thank the entire Indiana delegation from both \nsides of the aisle for cosponsoring this bill and showing the Hoosier \nState's strong commitment to preventing veteran suicide.\n  I ask my colleagues to support the passage of H.R. 4173.", "turn": 7, "speaker": "Mr. BANKS of Indiana", "itemno": 13}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "W000799", "text": "  Mr. WALZ.

This bill would require the VA to study the \noutcomes of the VA's Veterans Crisis Line while protecting the privacy \nand anonymity of the veteran callers.\n  As a proud cosponsor of H.R. 4173, I believe it is critical that \nCongress ensures this emergency resource for our veterans struggling \nwith PTSD or other mental health conditions is working as it should.\n  Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support the passage of H.R. \n4173.", "turn": 10, "speaker": "Mr. COFFMAN", "itemno": 16}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "W000799", "text": "  Mr. WALZ.

I know he sends his best.\n  I thank my colleague, Mr. Banks of Indiana, for making sure that we \nare always continuing with oversight of these important programs to \nhelp our veterans.\n  In 2015, the VA did an OIG report and found out that there were some \nfailures in the Veterans Crisis Line; there were informational \nfailures. Sometimes people answering the phone at the VA, who are good \npeople and want to help our veterans, didn't have all the information \nthey may need. There was a lack of timely responsiveness at some \npoints.\n  The VA Committee here in the House did some oversight and found out \nthat we needed to make sure that we fixed this. So I introduced a \nbipartisan bill with my colleagues that passed unanimously in 2016, the \nNo Veterans Crisis Line Call Should Go Unanswered Act, to work with the \nVeterans Affairs Department to make sure that we knew what they needed \nto get the job done, working in partnership across the aisle and with \nthe VA. The bill passed unanimously. President Obama signed it into \nlaw.\n  But we know that, with a stroke of a pen, it doesn't just fix things. \nYou have to have constant oversight and demand transparency and \naccountability.\n  I went down to one of the Veterans Crisis Line centers in Atlanta and \nvisited with those who ran it and those responders who picked up the \nphone every day to talk to our veterans to see how things were going.\n\n\n  Great improvements, great challenges still, but they are making \nheadway, and it is with a partnership where we can make sure that this \nworks.\n  Oversight, transparency, accountability is what this is about, but \nmost importantly, this is about keeping our promise to our veterans, \nthose who have donned the uniform to protect our rights, the rights of \nour family members, and our loved ones who keep this great Republic \ngoing.\n  So I want to thank my friend from Florida, my good friend from \nMinnesota, and Mr. Banks from Indiana.

Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.\n  Mr. Speaker, over the last 2 days, we have passed 14 bills out of \nthis committee, the House Veterans' Affairs Committee, affecting \neverything from suicide and suicide prevention to transplant, to the \ndelivery of GI bills, to the streamlining of the bureaucracy inside the \nagency, all with a bipartisan effort on what can we do as a nation to \nbest deliver on our promise of the earned benefits that we so deeply \nowe to those who served us. It is appropriate that we are doing it the \nweek of Veterans Day.\n  But I want to remind people, this is what is possible, Mr. Speaker. \nThis summer, the New York Times wrote a story, and it said, if you \nreally want to know how Congress is supposed to function, look at the \nVA Committee. They were pointing out, these are not easy things.\n  People, Mr. Speaker, may think, well, everybody supports veterans, \nbut it is hard to get policy right. It is hard to find funding. It is \nhard to agree on the best way to deliver it. But I would have to say, \nthe last 2 days are proof positive of it. We can do it. We must do it. \nWe are obligated to do it.\n  When people think of Veterans Day, ways that you can observe Veterans \nDay, I am always of the belief that the best way to honor veterans is \nto attempt to live our life in a manner that reflects the dignity and \nthe sacrifice that they gave in their service.\n  As we sat here today, it may be easy to take it for granted. The \npublic gets frustrated over what happens or what doesn't happen here. \nThe idea that there are billions of human beings on this planet who \ndon't get the chance to self-govern, who don't get the chance to openly \nand freely debate, to try and\n\n\ncraft a society we want to live in, and we do it here because of the \nsacrifice that was given to keep this Nation free.\n  So the work we do here--and it is often said, you shouldn't get a pat \non the back for doing what you are supposed to do. That is not what \nthis is about. This is about a recognition that this Nation cares \ndeeply about the daughters and sons who will serve us. This Nation \nexpects the Congress to make sure that they are cared for in a manner \nthat reflects their sacrifice, and they want us to do it in a \nbipartisan manner that celebrates the idea of self-governance.\n  So with that, I would say, Mr. Speaker, I am proud to support this \npiece of legislation as the final piece of this package. I am proud of \nthe work and to call my friend from Florida a dear friend, someone who \nI know that, between you and your father, has given decades of service \nto our Nation's veterans.\n  There are reasons to be optimistic. There are reasons to believe that \nwe can get through this.
