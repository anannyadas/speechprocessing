Mr. President, we are grieving yet again today another \nhorrific mass shooting in a church in Texas--over 25 dead, others still \nclinging to life. We were barely past our stage of grief as more than \n50 people were shot dead and 500 were injured at a country music \nconcert in Las Vegas. Of course, every single night in this country, \nparents and brothers and sisters go to bed having lost their loved \nones, and 90 people die every day from guns in this country.\n  I just think it is worth stating that this happens nowhere else other \nthan in the United States. This is not inevitable. This is not \nsomething that we should accept. We are not impotent or helpless to try \nto change the scope of tragedy that is crippling for families that have \nto go through this.\n  I want everyone to take a quick look at this pretty simple chart. The \nUnited States has more guns and more gun deaths than any other \ndeveloped country. It is not close, we are not even in the neighborhood \nof any of our other G-20 competitor nations. While the President told \nus the other day that this is a mental illness problem, one cannot \nexplain this outlier status through a story of mental illness because \nnone of these other countries have any lower rate of mental illness. \nThere are just as many people who are mentally ill in these countries \nas there are in our country.\n  We cannot explain it by the attention we pay to mental illness. We \nspend more money on treating mental illness than these countries do. \nThis isn't a mental illness problem. We have to do better in treating \npeople who have psychological disorders in this country, but the reason \nthat we are an outlier nation when it comes to the number of gun deaths \nand the epic scale of our mass tragedies is explained by something \nelse.\n  Here is a quick story. This graphic shows the States that have \nbackground check requirements on all gun sales in the private sector, \nand here are the States that have no background check laws beyond those \nthat are required in Federal law. It is a fundamentally different story \nwhen it comes to gun-related homicides. In the States that have \nbackground check laws, the average rate of homicide is substantially \nlower--substantially lower--than in States that haven't background \ncheck laws. That is because in this country, with the loosest, most lax \ngun laws in the industrialized world, private citizens are able to get \ntheir hands on weapons that are designed not for hunting and not for \nshooting for sport but to kill. These tactical assault-style weapons \nare being used over and over in these mass tragedies, and more people \nend up in harm's way.\n  Smarter gun laws--just making sure that the right people have guns, \nnot the wrong people--lead to less gun deaths. It is time for us to \nadmit that this is a uniquely American problem and that it deserves our \nattention rather than our silence, which has been our response every \nsingle session that I have been a Member of Congress.\n  This poster shows but a few of the faces that have been lost to gun \nviolence in this country. My small town of Sandy Hook is a broken \ncommunity. It is a beautiful, wonderful community, but it is a broken \ncommunity. The ripples of grief that come with losing that number of \nchildren--beautiful children--all at one time never really gets \nrepaired. That small community in Texas, Sutherland Springs, will \nsuffer that same fate. It will be a community that will not ever truly \nrepair itself, having lost so many beautiful people at one moment. You \ncan't rewind the clock.\n  It is increasingly impossible for me to continue to go back to \nNewtown, CT, and tell the people of that community that even after mass \nmurder after mass murder in this country, at a scale that occurs in no \nother Nation, our response as a body is to do nothing. It is a level of \ncallousness that is frankly unexplainable to the victims of this \nviolence, and this macabre club of families that have had to deal with \nthe consequences of gun violence is getting bigger and bigger and \nbigger.\n  Why? Because the number of people who die by guns is not going down. \nIt is not leveling off. It is exploding. Every year, more people--not \nless people--are killed by guns in this country, and it seems to be the \nonly problem in which there is zero interest in this body to solve. \nWhen a terrorist plows into civilians with a truck in New York City, \nRepublicans in this body are talking about policy change within hours, \nbut after somebody walks into a school or a church or a shopping mall, \nwe are told that there has to be a restraining order on policy debate \nfor days. It is ridiculous, and it is offensive to the families who \nhave gone through this.\n  So, let's just for a moment set aside the issues that I will admit \nare unlikely to come up for a vote in this body between now and the end \nof this session. I think it is unbelievable that universal background \nchecks, supported by 90 percent of Americans, can't get a vote here. I \ndon't think there is another issue like that in the American public, \nwhere 90 percent of Americans agree on something and Congress can't \neven conceive of getting it done.\n  The only place where background checks is controversial is in the \nCongress. Every single gun owner I talk to\n\n\nin my State wants to make sure that criminals and people who are \nseriously mentally ill can't buy guns.\n  Similarly, let's admit what is happening here. It is not a \ncoincidence that the same kind of weapon is used every single time in \nthese shootings. These are copycat shootings in which people see the \nkind of destruction that comes with an AR-15-style weapon, and they use \nit again in order to maximize the lethality.\n  Wake up. Wake up to the reality that these weapons are being used to \nmurder with speed and power, and the killers are watching what happens \nin Sandy Hook, what happens in Texas, what happens in Orlando, what \nhappens in Las Vegas, and they are repeating the process. They are \nreplicating the weapon. They shouldn't be in the hands of civilians. \nYou can have plenty of fun hunting without an AR-15 or AR-15-style \nweapon. So let's set aside universal background checks and assault \nweapons for a moment. I get the politics of this place. I understand \nthose are unlikely to pass.\n  Why, then, can't we work on the things that we know we agree on? I \nhave listened to dozens of Republicans in the House and the Senate \nclaim that they are for making real the prohibition on automatic \nweapons. People shouldn't have fully automatic weapons in this country. \nNobody should be able to do what that guy did at an upper story window \nin a hotel in Las Vegas, and the law that we all passed is being \nignored by companies that are selling these aftermarket modifications \nthat turn semiautomatic weapons into automatic weapons. The company \nthat sold the modification took it off the market, but only for a \ncouple of weeks. They are back to selling bump stocks again because we \nhave signaled that we are not going to do anything about it.\n  It is not enough to just tell the ATF to do it. Why? Because the law \nis vague. The ATF said it was vague in 2010. All we have to do is \nclarify it, but aftermarket modifications that turn semiautomatic \nweapons into automatic weapons shouldn't be legal. It seems we have \nagreement on that because I have listened to many Republicans saying \nthey are willing to take that step. Let's take it and stop talking \nabout it. Put legislation on the floor that says you cannot have an \nautomatic weapon in this country. Let's do it. We agree on it.\n\n  I didn't agree with the President yesterday when he said it is a \nmental illness problem, but similarly we could work together to make \nsure that people who are seriously mentally ill don't buy weapons. That \nis the second noncontroversial policy proposal on which we could work \ntogether. Let's just admit we are going the wrong way, not the right \nway.\n  Earlier this year, Republicans passed a piece of legislation that \nallowed for 75,000 people in this country who have serious mental \nillness to be able to get off the list of prohibited purchasers and \nstart buying guns again. These are people who were judged to be so \nmentally ill that they couldn't deposit a check. They were given \nconservator status for Social Security purposes. These are people who \nwere so mentally ill, so limited in their cognitive abilities that they \ncouldn't take a Social Security check and deposit it. Those people were \nprohibited from buying guns. This Congress passed a law earlier this \nyear to say that those people who can't deposit a check should be able \nto go buy an assault weapon.\n  If we are serious about trying to stop people with mental illness \nfrom getting weapons, let's work together on that instead of moving \nbackward.\n  Finally, it is an open secret that the existing background check \nsystem is broken. Let's not pretend we just woke up yesterday in \namazement that the records of people who are seriously mentally ill or \nhave been convicted of crimes aren't ending up on the background \nchecklist.\n  I am holding in my hand the data that is available to every single \none of us about the records that are being uploaded onto the background \ncheck system. For the Department of Defense, it is a whole bunch of \nzeros. The Army, the Navy, the Air Force--zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, \nzero, zero.\n  Similarly, States aren't doing their part either. Connecticut \nuploaded 363,000 felony records onto the NICS system over the course of \n2016. Colorado uploaded 10 felony records in 2016. New York uploaded \n57,000 domestic violence records in 2016. North Carolina uploaded 261. \nThere weren't 261 people in North Carolina who were convicted of \ndomestic violence crimes in 2016; it is just that only 261 people went \nup on the list. Many other States, like the Department of Defense, have \nzeros in all of these columns. Many States are uploading no records \nonto the system.\n  Now, admittedly, NICS tries to get those records through other means \nwhen States don't give it to them, but it is an open secret that the \nNICS system is broken. Congress at least tried to make some changes. \nAfter the Virginia Tech shooting, Congress did pass a NICS improvement \nbill, but it has not worked. It gave the Department of Justice the \npower to withhold Federal funding if States don't upload records. \nDespite the fact that there are a handful of States that have uploaded \nno records to NICS--zero--no State has been penalized under that 2007 \nlaw. That is not a Republican or a Democratic problem. The Obama \nadministration didn't penalize States, and Republican Presidents didn't \npenalize States. Why don't we work together on that?\n  A couple of years ago, the House passed additional funding to help \nStates, other jurisdictions, upload records. Why don't we find a way to \nwork together to at least make the existing background check system \nwork?\n  This feeling of helplessness that people have in this country, this \nfeeling of impotence that nothing can be done to change the trajectory \nof violence in this country, the regular scroll across the bottom of \nyour TV screen telling you news of the latest mass shootings where \nlittle kids and senior citizens are being gunned down in churches and \nschools--that sense of helplessness isn't real; it is a fiction, an \ninvention of the gun lobby designed to make this place feel as if there \nis nothing that can be done in order to make sure that they can \ncontinue to make these obscene amounts of profits. There are things we \ncan do.\n  I understand that despite the popularity of background checks with \nthe public, we are probably not going to get a vote on that, but let's \nwork together to make sure that automatic weapons can't be in the hands \nof civilians. Let's make real the very simple premise that seriously \nmentally ill people shouldn't be able to buy guns. Let's fix the \nbackground check system so that, as Republicans tell us over and over \nagain, at least we can enforce existing law. There are ways that we can \nstop this slaughter, and I don't know how we live with ourselves, how \nwe sleep at night as a body if, in the face of these massacres, we \ndon't even do the stuff we all agree on.\n  I yield the floor.", "turn": 2, "speaker": "Mr. MURPHY", "itemno": 5}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I come before this body a second day in a \nrow to talk about an event that the Senator from Connecticut has been \nreferring to that has shocked all of us. It has rattled us to the very \ncore and shocked the conscience of the entire Nation.\n  I didn't get a chance to hear everything he said about this today, \nbut I was encouraged to hear him make comments about fixing the \nbackground check system, which I think failed us terribly here, and it \nfailed, of course, the 26 people who lost their lives and the 20 more \nwho were injured in this terrible shooting in Sutherland Springs, TX, \nduring a Sunday morning church service at First Baptist Church.\n  Of course, at times like these, we need to respect the right and the \nneed of people to mourn and to grieve their loss and to express our \nsolidarity with those families who were torn apart. One woman who has \nlived in Sutherland Springs for nearly 70 years described the community \nas a place where ``everybody knew everybody.'' She said that before \nSunday, most people didn't even keep their doors locked because the \ntown never experienced any significant crime. Well, now that has \nchanged.\n  Sutherland Springs has suffered at the hands of a man whom initial \nreports have described as having a known history of violence, a man \nwhose victims included his own grandmother-in-law as well as the \nvisiting pastor of the church. No community finds it easy to deal with \nunexpected heartbreaking\n\n\nlosses like this, but the fact that this crime involved so many tightly \nknit friends and neighbors and occurred in a house of worship on a \nSunday morning and harmed so many innocent children makes the task much \nharder.\n  As each new detail emerges from what is still an ongoing \ninvestigation, we need to study the whole puzzle and ask ourselves how \nthis happened, why so many lives were lost, and what, if anything, \ncould have been done to prevent it. We know, for example, that the \ngunman was court-martialed by the Air Force and convicted of \nseriousness domestic abuse, fracturing the skull of his own son. Under \nthe relevant Federal law, the Gun Control Act of 1968, this should have \nprohibited him from ever purchasing a gun in the first place, but we \nknow it didn't in this instance. This critically important information \nfrom the suspect's criminal history was not uploaded into the relevant \nbackground check databases even though a Federal law clearly requires \nthat it be done.\n  Finally and most troublingly, we know what happened next: Mr. Kelley \nunlawfully purchased four firearms after passing Federal background \nchecks that did not turn up his Air Force convictions. Of course, the \nshooter lied on his paperwork. He was asked about these convictions--\nthat is part of the background check system--but because there was no \nrecord of it, he was able to lie his way into getting these firearms. \nThis is very clearly a problem, and the Air Force has now admitted that \nKelley's convictions should have barred him from ever purchasing or \npossessing firearms. What appears to have happened is that the records \nof the convictions were not uploaded into the National Instant Criminal \nBackground Check System. They are required to be uploaded by Federal \nlaw already.\n  There are still some questions to sift through, but I plan to \nintroduce legislation--and I would be happy to work with my colleague \nfrom Connecticut--to ensure that all Federal Departments and Agencies, \nincluding the Department of Defense, upload the required conviction \nrecords into the national database. This legislation will also \nencourage, to the greatest extent possible under the Constitution, \nState and local governments to do the same. We can make the Federal \nAgencies do it. We can only request that the States do it, as the \nSenator from Connecticut pointed out earlier, and their record of \ncompliance is lousy. It is lousy.\n  Justice Department records indicate that some Federal Agencies and \nState governments are failing to comply with the Federal law. According \nto the Department of Justice, the number of these records that are \nactually uploaded is staggeringly low. That is unacceptable, and it \nmust change.\n  What is important to note, though, is that when the dust settles, the \nappropriate answers won't necessarily be the easy ones. The fact \nremains that under existing law, this atrocity should have been \nprevented. This gunman should not have been allowed to purchase \nfirearms and should have been arrested when he tried to do so. We need \nto better understand why our existing laws didn't work in this \ninstance, and that is what my proposed legislation will do. After \nanalyzing the problem, we will try to ensure that everyone is complying \nwith the law.\n  In 2015, I introduced legislation called the Mental Health and Safe \nCommunities Act that addressed a related issue: the failure of State \nand local authorities to upload valuable mental health records into the \nNICS background check database. I hope this demonstrates my willingness \nto work together with anybody who is willing to meet these problems \nhead-on.\n  Right now, we need time and clarity. We need to know and continue to \nstudy the facts. Then, as we have already started to do, we need to \nconsider all existing laws and regulations, both State and Federal, in \nlight of this new information.\n  Mr. President, I know we are coming up on a deadline.

Mr. President, as we wait for additional details, I want \nto say a few more words about the strong community of Sutherland \nSprings, one just 35 miles from my hometown of San Antonio, TX, where I \ngrew up.\n  First Baptist Church, where the shooting occurred, has served as a \nmainstay in the town since 1926. It is the site of church services \nevery Sunday, weddings, social gatherings, and even some funerals. We \nhope the First Baptist Church can bounce back from this tragedy, and I \nam confident they can because faith, hope, and love can never be \nextinguished no matter the depravity, the evil that tries.\n  We are not sure what will happen to the building or the congregation \nitself, but no matter what, the unique spirit of this community will no \ndoubt endure. I am hopeful that the town of Sutherland Springs will \ncome back too. If people like Stephen Willeford are any indication, it \nwill. Stephen, of course, is the plumber who managed to hit the gunman \nthrough a gap in his body armor. He was joined by Johnnie Langendorff. \nIn a truck, the two chased the gunman at high speeds for 11 miles into \nneighboring Guadalupe County. What these two men displayed is that in \nthe worst circumstances, we won't let evil have its way. We won't let \nsick individuals like this shooter escape the consequences of their \ncrimes. Strangers will come together and act quickly and courageously \nto defend the communities they love and in which they live.\n  Today I join Governor Abbott, my colleagues--Senator Cruz and \nRepresentative Henry Cuellar, in whose House district this occurred--\nand so many other Texans in once again pledging my support to the \npeople of Sutherland Springs. I send my thoughts and prayers to those \nwho lost parents, children, friends, and relatives in this unbelievable \nact of evil.\n  The biggest danger, though, is that we become numb and we just simply \nmove on to other matters. We can't let that happen. As Sherry Pomeroy, \nthe wife of the pastor at First Baptist, said yesterday, ``Please don't \nforget Sutherland Springs.'' And when we hear people ask us to do \nsomething about terrible tragedies like this, let's do what we can, \nworking together in a bipartisan way, to fix the holes in what is \nalready the law, which says that people like this shooter should never \nhave gotten their hands on a firearm in the first place. But either \nthrough human error or some failure of the background check system, he \nwas able to do so. We need to fix that, and hopefully, in doing so, we \ncan bring some small sense of justice to the people who lost so much \nlast Sunday in Sutherland Springs, TX.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.", "turn": 6, "speaker": "Mr. CORNYN", "itemno": 9}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
