Mr. Speaker, I rise today to say what many in \nthis body have said: we should simplify our Tax Code. However, I am 100 \npercent opposed to you and your caucus's efforts to write this bill in \nsecret, hidden away from the public eye.\n  I am 100 percent opposed to your plan to give massive tax breaks to a \nsuperrich few and leave middle class and working families to pay the \nbill. As written, the richest 1 percent of Americans will receive one-\nthird of the overall benefits from your so-called tax reform plan in \n2018, but by 2027, this lucky superrich handful of Americans will \nreceive half of its benefits.\n  Mr. Speaker, that is just wrong. Hardworking moms and dads deserve a \ntax break, not the wealthiest.\n  So, yes, I am 100 percent opposed to limiting the State and local tax \ndeduction, a provision in the Republican tax plan that would hike taxes \non more than 40 percent of my constituents.\n  I am 100 percent opposed to limiting the student loan deduction, \nespecially\n\n\nat a time when student debt totals more than a trillion dollars. Nearly \ntwo-thirds of Illinois college graduates have debt, and their average \ndebt totals more than $28,000.\n  Mr. Speaker, I am 100 percent opposed to repealing the elder tax \ncredit, which helps families keep loved ones at home as they age.\n  I am 100 percent opposed to denying teachers, hardworking men and \nwomen who have dedicated their lives to teaching the next generation, a \ndeduction when they dip into their own pockets to purchase school \nsupplies their students need.\n  I am 100 percent opposed to repealing the work opportunity tax credit \nthat helps businesses hire our brave veterans and young people starting \ntheir careers.\n  I am 100 percent opposed to repealing the orphan drug expense credit \nthat helps find cures for terrible diseases like sickle cell anemia, \npancreatic cancer, and cerebral palsy.\n  I am 100 percent opposed to saddling my children and grandchildren \nwith an additional $1.5 trillion in national debt just so Republicans \ncan give a tax break to their donor base.\n  This is a scam. Mr. Speaker, I stand with the National Farmers Union, \nAARP, the National American Council on Adoptable Children, the National \nFederation of Independent Businesses, Fix the Debt, the American \nSociety of Civil Engineers, the National Association of Realtors, the \nMortgage Bankers Association, the Chicago Sun-Times, and the majority \nof Americans in opposing your so-called tax reform that is, frankly, \nnothing more than another attempt by the GOP to steal from the middle \nclass and give to the rich.\n  Instead of packaging tax breaks for millionaires and billionaires, \nlet's work together on a plan for all Americans.\n\n\n  Let's stop allowing one side of the aisle the ability to write \nlegislation affecting more than 300 million people, in secret, behind \nclosed doors, and away from the public eye. I am 100 percent in favor \nof bringing in some sunlight and letting the American people know \nexactly what we are doing.\n  I am 100 percent in favor of doing what we were elected to do: fix \nproblems by working together.\n  I am 100 percent in favor of real tax reform.\n  I am 100 percent in favor of giving hardworking moms and dads what \nthey need and deserve: a tax break.\n  I am 100 percent in favor of growing the earned income tax credit so \nfamilies get bigger paychecks.\n  I am 100 percent in favor of creating tax initiatives for businesses \nthat hire and train at-risk young people and underemployed people.\n  And I am 100 percent in favor of a child care tax credit that \nactually reflects the true cost of childcare in America.\n  Let's put the politics aside and give the American people real tax \nreform that supports working families and our small businesses.\n  On other note, one more thing I am 100 percent against is more \nthoughts, prayers, and moments of silence and no action toward gun \nviolence prevention. Shame on us, Mr. Speaker.\n", "turn": 1, "speaker": "Ms. KELLY of Illinois", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 3}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "181", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H8526-H8527", "wkday": "Tuesday", "day": "7", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "100 PERCENT OPPOSED TO THE GOP TAX PLAN", "id": "CREC-2017-11-07-pt1-PgH8526-2", "title": null}
