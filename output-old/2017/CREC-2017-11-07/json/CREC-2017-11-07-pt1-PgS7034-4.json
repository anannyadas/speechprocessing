{"content": [{"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "S000148", "text": "  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, later this week, the House will begin \nmarking up the Republican tax plan in record speed, with no hearings, \nno real discussion. Unfortunately, Senate Republicans are mimicking the \nHouse in trying to rush through their bill as well. It is said, the \nSenate Republicans will unveil a plan of their own, although I don't \nexpect there to be that much difference between the two.\n  What has united the Republican tax reform efforts so far in this \nCongress has been a stubborn desire to reduce taxes paid by big \ncorporations and the superrich. That is the core. The middle class ends \nup with the leftovers. Shockingly, millions in the middle class will \nactually see a tax increase, not just a handful but a large number. \nThis morning's New York Times did an analysis. According to them, one-\nthird of all middle-class families would pay more in taxes next year \nunder the House bill, and by 2026, nearly half of all middle-class \nfamilies would pay more in taxes--almost half.\n  Here is the newspaper article. This is the New York Times. They \ndefined the middle class as households between $50,000 and $160,000--\nthe backbone of America. Here is their headline. I don't know if you \ncan see it. ``Republican Plan Would Raise Taxes on Millions of Middle-\nClass Families.'' Here is the headline again printed a little larger so \neveryone here in America can see it. ``Republican Plan Would Raise \nTaxes on Millions of Middle-Class Families.''\n  That is the case. They did their analysis. By the way, you say: Well, \nthat is mainly in the coastal States. No. Even if it is not one-third, \nit is probably about 20 percent in the poorest of States. Large numbers \nof middle-class taxpayers in every State in this Union--coastal, \nnoncoastal, New York, California but also Wyoming, Utah, and Nebraska--\nwould pay a significant tax increase.\n  Looking at the House bill, you can see why. Republicans either reduce \nor eliminate several middle-class tax deductions. The elimination of \nthe personal deduction, for example, which lets families deduct roughly \n$4,150 for each person in the household, would be costly to families of \nthree or more. If you have a lot of kids, this bill is bad for you. \nTaxwise--if tax policy influences behavior--they are trying to \ndiscourage bigger families. What does that say? Ending the personal \nexemption makes the Republican tax plan an anti-large family bill.\n  In many cases, the new benefits provided to the middle class are \ninsufficient to fill the gap created by the loss of popular deductions, \nand, worse, many of the benefits are temporary, expiring after several \nyears. So while some in the middle class may get an initial tax break, \ndown the line, the break disappears, and taxes start to go up.\n  As pointed out by David Kamin, a professor of tax law at NYU--and \nthey have a great tax department, proudly from New York--Republicans \nhave reduced the value of middle-class tax breaks significantly over \ntime.\n  To meet their desires not to increase the deficit by too much--\nalthough $1.5 trillion is a heck of a lot--instead of reducing the tax \nbreaks on the biggest corporations or the very wealthiest, they reduced \nthem on the middle class. So in 5 years' time, the $300/person family \ncredit is gone. The child tax credits--unlike the personal exemptions \nthey replaced--lose value over time because they are not indexed. They \nonly increase with inflation. The Republicans use the same gimmicks to \nmake the value of middle-class deductions, like the standard deduction, \nlose value over time.\n  So while some middle-class families may see a tax decrease in the \nvery short run, a considerable number see a hidden tax increase a few \nyears later. They have front-loaded the benefits to disguise a tax hike \nin the outyears.\n  Look at this chart. Now, our Republican colleagues picked the perfect \nfamily to benefit from their tax break. This middle-class family, when \nthey proposed it, is a family making $59,000 a year. Well, the \nInstitute for Taxation and Economic Policy looked at the Republican \nplan and found over one in five taxpayers, those earning between \n$56,000 and $150,000--the heart of the middle class--would see an \naverage increase of $1,350 by 2027. Here it is. This is not a family \nwho has medical expenses or kids in college--they lose those \ndeductions--or a large mortgage or from a State with high personal \nincome and sales taxes. This is the plain-vanilla, hand-picked family \nchosen by the Republicans to highlight the benefits of their plan.\n  It is true. In the first year, they get a break around $1,100, but \nover the years, they get an increase. By 2027, even this hand-picked \nRepublican family gets a tax increase. The bottom line is, the \nRepublican tax plan is like a ticking timebomb for many hard-working, \nmiddle-class families. Working middle-class families see a tax increase \nbecause the Republican plan reduces their benefits over time.\n  Meanwhile, tax giveaways for the wealthiest Americans and huge \ncorporations get better over time. The estate tax exemption goes up \nfrom $11\n\n\nmillion to $22 million for a couple, and then it is permanently \nrepealed by 2023. The corporate rate cut and passthrough cut also stays \npermanent--a boon to wealthy shareholders. Middle-class tax deductions \nand credits expire. Deductions for corporations and the wealthiest are \npermanent or even get better.\n  As Mark Mazer, the director of the Independent Tax Policy Center, \nsaid, ``You could create a plan that just cuts taxes for middle-class \npeople. That's not what this is.'' Yet that is how Republicans are \nselling it.\n  A few days ago on Hugh Hewitt's show, my friend the majority leader \nsaid that ``at the end of the day, nobody in the middle class is going \nto get a tax increase'' under the Republican bill. Again, that was \nMitch McConnell: ``Nobody in the middle class is going to get a tax \nincrease.'' Well, if Leader McConnell was referring to the House bill, \nthat is just a bold-faced lie, and he ought to retract it, but to give \nthe Senator the benefit of the doubt, maybe he is referring to the \nSenate tax bill still under consideration. Let's see.\n  In the Republican bill, will nobody in the middle class get a tax \nincrease? We will wait and see. If past is prologue, I doubt it because \nthe House said no middle-class person would get an increase, then their \nbill walloped the middle class. One-third get an increase immediately, \nand then half get an increase over the next 10 years.\n  I would remind my Senate Republican colleagues that their House \nRepublicans sold their bill as a middle-class bill--a middle-class tax \ncut--and then put together a plan that raises taxes on millions of \nmiddle-class families, one-third of all families making between $65,000 \nand $150,000.\n  If the Senate bill follows the same path, promising universal, \nmiddle-class tax cuts but delivers smoke and mirrors and hidden tax \nincreases, it will get clobbered in the court of public opinion, as it \nwould deserve.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. SCHUMER", "itemno": 0}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
