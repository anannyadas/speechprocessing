Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the National \nCommittee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare's (NCPSSM) 35th \nanniversary on the day of its Anniversary Open House. NCPSSM has played \na critical role in protecting Social Security and Medicare for all \nAmericans.\n  With the passage of Medicare in 1965 under Title XVII of the Social \nSecurity Act, our country made a promise that seniors can age with \ndignity and security after a lifetime of hard work. As with the \nimplementation of any historic program, it's important that there are \norganizational watchdogs that ensure our government makes good on its \npromise to the American people. There has been no group more committed \nto protecting the tenets of Social Security and Medicare than NCPSSM \nover the past 35 years.\n  Founded in 1982 by Congressman James Roosevelt, NCPSSM served as \nresponse to proposed changes to Social Security and Medicare during a \ntime when 24/7 news programs did not exist and seniors needed to be \ninformed and mobilized. NCPSSM works side by side with federal, state \nand local lawmakers to protect and build on the safety net programs \nthat Americans of all ages depend on. Then, as it does now, the \nCommittee provided seniors with a way to organize and make their voices \nheard by lawmakers as well as writing highly regarded, in depth \nanalysis on Congressional legislation and Presidential Executive Orders \nregarding Social Security, Medicare, and the federal budget. These \ndocuments are invaluable in helping everyday Americans understand the \nreal impact that legislation will have on their day to day life.\n  NCPSSM's efforts have been instrumental in passing bills that better \nthe lives of seniors and that protect Social Security and Medicare. In \n2016, the Committee and its members fought hard to pass the ``Older \nAmericans Reauthorization Act of 2016'' which funds critical services \nthat keep older adults healthy and independent, including job training, \nsenior centers, benefits enrollment and caregiver support. \nAdditionally, the Committee continues to encourage Americans from all \ncorners of the country to participate in petitions, surveys and phone \nbanking, with a total of over 90 million petitions and letters sent to \nCongress and the President to date.\n  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring the National \nCommittee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare and its 35 years of \nsuccess. Their advocacy has influenced legislation that protects the \nprograms seniors and hardworking Americans depend on.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mrs. DINGELL", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 3}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "181", "extension": true, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "E1528", "wkday": "Tuesday", "day": "7", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "IN RECOGNITION OF THE ACCOMPLISHMENTS OF THE NATIONAL COMMITTEE TO PRESERVE SOCIAL SECURITY AND MEDICARE DURING ITS 35TH ANNIVERSARY", "id": "CREC-2017-11-07-pt1-PgE1528-3", "title": "IN RECOGNITION OF THE ACCOMPLISHMENTS OF THE NATIONAL COMMITTEE TO  PRESERVE SOCIAL SECURITY AND MEDICARE DURING ITS 35TH ANNIVERSARY"}
