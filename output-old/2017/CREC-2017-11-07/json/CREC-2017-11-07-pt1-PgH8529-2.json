Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate National Native \nAmerican Heritage Month by honoring a dedicated community leader and \nwarrior from Nebraska's Second Congressional District.\n  Growing up on the Umonhon Nation Reservation in Macy, Nebraska, Dr. \nRudi Mitchell was one of eight children raised by a single mother. \nRudi's mom, Mary Lieb Mitchell, was a strong woman and a major \ninfluence in the lives of her children. Her focus was education and \nensuring her children had the opportunities that she did not have.\n  It was because of her that Rudi and his siblings all went out to \npursue\n\n\nhigher education. Including nieces and nephews, 15 members of his \nfamily have earned degrees ranging from bachelor's to doctorate, to \nmedical degrees.\n  In 1964, Rudi felt the call to serve our Nation at a time of war and \nenlisted in the United States Army Medical Corps. As he will tell you, \nNative Americans consider it an honor to serve as a warrior, and he was \nproud to do so in the U.S. Army. He was a part of the Army Medical \nCorps and served a total of 3 years and 13 months of which he deployed \nto South Korea, providing medical support to troops.\n  Once his service was complete, Dr. Mitchell used the GI Bill to \nattend the University of Nebraska Omaha, and in August of 1973, he \nearned his bachelor of general studies with an emphasis on social work. \nHe then pursued and received his master of social work in August of \n1975.\n  With his degrees in hand and inspired by his mother's dreams, Dr. \nMitchell worked for the Nebraska Indian Intertribal Development \nCorporation and the Bureau of Indian Affairs for Winnebago. After that, \nhe returned to the Umonhon Nation Reservation in Macy, Nebraska, and \nwas the acting director of the outpatient mental health-social services \ndepartment at the Carl T. Curtis Health Education Center. Rudi then \nearned his doctorate of education and counseling and psychology from \nthe University of South Dakota in December of 1987.\n  Dr. Mitchell continued to serve those residing at the Macy and \nWinnebago Reservations, including as interim president of the Nebraska \nIndian Community College and, most recently, as the assistant professor \nof Native American studies at Creighton University. He is also listed \nas a qualified expert witness in Indian child welfare cases in the \ncourts of the State of Nebraska.\n  His deep compassion for the youth of the Umonhon Nation inspires him \nto continue to make an impact. With the high suicide rate and many \nsuffering from depression, Dr. Mitchell has made it a mission of his to \ninteract with the youth as a social worker and mental health therapist. \nAs an elder of the Umonhon Nation, Dr. Mitchell participates and leads \ntraditional Umonhon prayer ceremonies in welcome and graduation \nceremonies.\n  Rudi continues to preserve his native language, which his mother did \nnot allow to be spoken in his childhood home because she wanted them to \nlearn English. He also is working to revive the lost culture of his \nNation, including the importance of his Indian name. His is Sihi-duba \nof the Buffalo Clan.\n  As a direct descendant of Chief Big Elk, the last hereditary chief of \nthe Umonhon Nation, Dr. Mitchell followed his great-great-great-great-\ngrandfather's legacy of leadership, and has served as a Native American \nleader on the local, State, and national level. From 1992 to 1995, he \nwas the Tribal chairman of the Umonhon Nation and the chief elected \ngovernmental representative of his people. He presided over the elected \nTribal Council at all official meetings and represented their interests \nwith county supervisors, the Nebraska Unicameral, the United States \nCongress, State Governors, the President of the United States, and \ninternational leaders.\n  In addition, Dr. Mitchell serves on the board of directors for the \nBig Elk Native American Center, a nonprofit that is working to provide \na multitude of services to more than 8,000 Native Americans from over \n130 Tribes that reside in the Omaha area. Currently, the nonprofit \nprovides language services, teaching the Umonhon language, and \nproviding expert witnesses.\n  Dr. Mitchell is a lifetime member of the VFW Post 1581 and the \nAmerican Legion Post 1, and although he has officially retired, he \nstill serves as an elder of the Omaha Tribe. Through his lifetime of \ndedicated service, he has helped many youth and members of the Umonhon \nNation overcome depression and learn about their heritage.\n  We are proud to recognize Dr. Mitchell as a true warrior, patriot, \nand selfless servant; one that not only fought for his Nation, but also \nfor those impacted by mental health issues, and continues to keep his \nNative American culture and heritage alive for future generations.\n", "turn": 1, "speaker": "Mr. BACON", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "181", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H8529-H8530", "wkday": "Tuesday", "day": "7", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "COMMEMORATING NATIVE AMERICAN HERITAGE MONTH AND HONORING DR.
