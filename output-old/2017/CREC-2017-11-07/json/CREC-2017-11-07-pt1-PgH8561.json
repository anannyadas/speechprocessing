Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 3705, as amended, the \nVeterans Fair Debt Notice Act of 2017, introduced by Congresswoman \nPingree from Maine.\n  This bill would help ensure that beneficiaries who have received an \noverpayment from VA clearly understand why the Department believes the \nveteran owes the money.\n  Under VA's current practice, when the Department determines that a \nbeneficiary may have received an overpayment, it sends a letter to the \nbeneficiary that explains why the debt was created and how the veteran \ncan dispute or mitigate the debt. But if VA doesn't have the veteran's \ncurrent address, the veteran may miss important deadlines. For example, \nif the beneficiary intends to request a full waiver of the debt but \ndoes not request that waiver within 30 days of the date of the letter, \nVA may take action to withhold benefits until the waiver request is \nadjudicated.\n  Sound confusing?\n  It certainly is. We can't have that for our veterans.\n  Another issue is that some veterans find the language used in the \nletters to be unclear and confusing. I am sure that is true, too. It is \nonly fair that the veteran understands why the Department believes he \nor she owes the money. It is the least we can do.\n  H.R. 3705, as amended, would require VA to develop a new notification \nletter that explains in plain language how the alleged debt was created \nand what actions the veteran can take to dispute or mitigate the debt.\n  In addition, the bill would direct VA to study and report to Congress \non its current debt collection process, including how many veterans are \nnot receiving debt collection notices because of incorrect addresses. \nThe report would also describe the steps VA will take to reduce the \nnumber of incorrect addresses in the Department's databases.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.", "turn": 4, "speaker": "Mr. BILIRAKIS", "itemno": 11}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "W000799", "text": "  Mr. WALZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I feel like we are on a roll, Mr. Speaker. We should stay here all \nday. Bipartisan, commonsense legislation improving the lives of \nveterans, it kind of feels like what we came here for.\n  I rise in strong support of another one of those, H.R. 3705, as \namended, the Veterans Fair Debt Notice Act introduced by the \ngentlewoman from Maine (Ms. Pingree).\n  Again, you heard it from the vice chairman, if a veteran incurs an \noverpayment in benefits, VA sends out a series of letters notifying him \nor her of\n\n\nthis debt and the steps that can be taken to address the issue. The \nletter is time stamped when mailed and, if what VA is asking for is not \nreceived within a specific timeline, the veteran loses the ability to \ntake certain actions toward addressing or disputing the debt.\n  Many veterans come to every one of our offices reporting never \nreceiving these letters. I know all of us have heard that story. These \nare people who I know and trust. It got sent to the wrong address, \nsomething happened, and they never got it.\n  Further, the letter VA is sending is full of complicated legal terms \nand citations of public laws. We know these letters alarm and confuse \nveterans unnecessarily. I have personally had them come in, show them \nto me, and as the ranking member of the Veterans' Affairs Committee--\nand it is a VA letter--I don't understand what they are asking for in \nthis from a veteran who receives it out of nowhere.\n  The bill before us today represents a real bipartisan effort to \nensure that veterans get timely notices of overpayments or debt, and \nthat these notices are respectful, informative, helpful, and \ncollaborative.\n  It does it in three ways. First, H.R. 3705, as amended, directs the \nSecretary to develop a way veterans may elect to receive debt \nnotification letters by email in addition to receiving standard mail \nnotices. Imagine that in 2017.\n  Second, it directs VA to conduct a study of the problem of veterans \nnot receiving debt letters and to provide a description of the \nnonlegislative actions the Secretary could take to reduce the number of \nincorrect addresses, particularly by using the other VHA databases.\n  At this point in time, I would also note we are taking steps in our \ncommittee to make sure now, when you leave the service, that we are \nable to capture emails, we are able to capture alternate addresses to \nmake sure because a lot of times veterans are in transition, they are \nmoving, those types of things are happening.\n  Third and most importantly, the bill requires that, in the future, \ndebt notices provide a clear explanation in understandable language for \nwhy the debt is owed and what due process options a veteran has \navailable to her or him.\n  The CBO has estimated the cost of this measure to be insignificant.\n  The approaches in the bill are the first steps to remedying a \nlongstanding problem and will make a positive change for the thousands \nof veterans who receive overpayment notices.\n  Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Disability Assistance and Memorial \nAffairs Subcommittee Chairman Mike Bost and Ranking Member Elizabeth \nEsty for working together on this legislation, in addition to Dr. Roe. \nWe are also going to hear from the author of this piece of legislation. \nCertainly I encourage support of H.R. 3705.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentlewoman from Maine (Ms. \nPingree), who is the author of this good, smart, overdue piece of \nlegislation.\n", "turn": 5, "speaker": "Mr. WALZ", "itemno": 12}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "P000597", "text": "  Ms. PINGREE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the ranking member for yielding me \nthe time and for all those wonderful compliments. I don't know that I \nhave ever had that said about a bill that I have submitted, so I am \nvery happy to be here today and to be able to support the Veterans Fair \nDebt Notice Act.\n  Mr. Speaker, as you heard, this bill offers a commonsense fix to \nfrustrations that veterans in my district and across the country have \nexperienced with VA's debt management system.\n  Veterans in Maine have called my office shocked to find out that they \nowe VA money. Some are confused by the letters they receive. Others are \ntold by VA that they have missed important deadlines to dispute, to \nseek forgiveness, or to create a payment plan for the alleged debt.\n  Regardless of whether the debt is real or a mistake by VA, we \nshouldn't make it so hard for veterans to know their rights and \nobligations.\n  We have seen single mom veterans who can't get a home loan and newly \ntransitioned servicemembers who struggle to reintegrate with garnished \npay, recouped tax returns, and reduced disability payments, all because \nof assigned debts they knew nothing about after notifications got sent \nto the wrong place or ``lost in the mail.''\n  In response, H.R. 3705 directs VA to work with veterans service \norganizations to develop standard notification letters that are written \nin plain language. It also directs VA to explore how to inform veterans \nof debts more quickly by sending notifications electronically, like an \nemail, in addition to standard mail.\n  It requires VA to study why so many veterans have not received \nnotifications in the mail, as well as steps VA can take to improve its \naddress database and the costs using certified mail.\n  I thank Chairmen Roe and Bost and Ranking Members Walz and Esty for \nbringing this legislation to the House floor, and I urge its passage.", "turn": 6, "speaker": "Ms. PINGREE", "itemno": 13}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "W000799", "text": "  Mr. WALZ. In closing, Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Maine \nfor her remarks. This is a good piece of legislation. As I have said, \neverybody who serves in this House has received veterans in their \noffice either carrying this letter or talking about a letter they never \nreceived. This makes it much better. It gives the benefit of the doubt \nback to the veteran and makes it easier for them to get this solved in \nthe right manner.\n  Mr. Speaker, please join me in support of H.R. 3705, and I yield back \nthe balance of my time.", "turn": 7, "speaker": "Mr. WALZ", "itemno": 14}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "B001257", "text": "  Mr. BILIRAKIS.
