Mr. Speaker, I would like to take this opportunity to \nrecognize and honor Gunnery Sergeant Thomas ``Tommy'' Sullivan of the \nUnited States Marine Corps. On Thursday July 16, 2015, a gunman \nattacked a Naval Reserve Center in Chattanooga, Tennessee. During that \nsenseless act of violence, Gunnery Sergeant Sullivan made the ultimate \nsacrifice by giving his life to defend his fellow service members.\n  Tommy Sullivan was born and raised in Springfield, Massachusetts. He \ngraduated from Cathedral High School in 1994, and became a Marine three \nyears later. His friends and family all attest that Tommy was \ndetermined to serve his county since a young age. Over the course of \nnearly two decades in the military, Tommy survived two tours in Iraq, \nwas awarded two Purple Hearts, and made a lasting impression on all \nthose who served with him. Many have proudly said that he was \neverything that a Marine should be. He was a natural leader who always \nkept his composure, and who mentored less experienced Marines. Those \nwho served with him recall that after battles he always took the time \nto talk to everyone under his command, and was never afraid to crack a \njoke in order to ease the tension.\n  Tommy's bravery during the attack on that Chattanooga military \ninstallation in 2015 will forever be remembered. On that day, he helped \nmore than a dozen of his fellow servicemen escape when a gunman opened \nfire. When he turned back to help two others, he unfortunately lost his \nlife. For his valor, Tommy was posthumously awarded the Lieutenant J. \nFrank Murphy Medal of Valor--an annual award given by the Springfield \nVeterans' Activities Committee to a resident who risked their lives to \nsave others. His family was also honored with Tommy's third Purple \nHeart which was awarded to him for his heroic actions.\n  Mr. Speaker, in closing, I would like to once again honor Gunnery \nSergeant Thomas Sullivan for his courage and service to our country. He \nwas loyal to his family, his friends, and the extraordinary individuals \nof the Marine Corps and all of our nation's Armed Forces. To Tommy's \nfamily, please know that the United States of America will never forget \nhis heroism and sacrifice and we are eternally grateful.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. NEAL", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 3}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "181", "extension": true, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "E1526", "wkday": "Tuesday", "day": "7", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "IN RECOGNITION OF GUNNERY SERGEANT THOMAS J.
