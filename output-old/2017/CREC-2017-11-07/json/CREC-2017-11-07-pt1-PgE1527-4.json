Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Lemont High \nSchool for being honored with the prestigious 2017 U.S. Department of \nEducation National Blue Ribbon School Award. The award was conferred \nunder the Exemplary High Performing Schools category.\n  District Superintendent Mary Ticknor, School Principal Eric \nMichaelsen, administrative staff, and an amazing group of teachers are \ncommitted to Lemont High School's mission for all students to become \nlife-long, independent learners and productive citizens. To further the \nmission, teachers are afforded the freedom to take risks in the \nclassroom, and the school encourages project-based learning with real-\nworld applications. In this environment, students learn that success is \nopen-ended and further educational attainment requires persistent hard \nwork and self-improvement.\n  Lemont High School takes pride in preparing students for their next \nsteps in education and future careers. This past school year, Lemont \nstudents set two school records with the largest number of students \never to take at least one Advanced Placement exam for college credit \nand the highest percentage ever of those exams earning a passing score. \nLemont High School's diverse set of accomplishments, both in and out of \nthe classroom, speaks to the effort the school makes to produce well-\nrounded young women and men.\n  The U.S. Department of Education established the National Blue Ribbon \nSchools Program in 1982 to recognize public and private schools with \nhigh or significantly improved achievement. I am proud that Lemont High \nSchool has been honored as one of these exceptional schools.\n  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating Lemont \nHigh School for this impressive achievement, and recognizing the \nteachers, administrators, students, parents, and community for the hard \nwork that they have put in to earn this award.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. LIPINSKI", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 3}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "181", "extension": true, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "E1527", "wkday": "Tuesday", "day": "7", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "HONORING LEMONT HIGH SCHOOL FOR BEING NAMED A NATIONAL BLUE RIBBON SCHOOL", "id": "CREC-2017-11-07-pt1-PgE1527-4", "title": "HONORING LEMONT HIGH SCHOOL FOR BEING NAMED A NATIONAL BLUE RIBBON  SCHOOL"}
