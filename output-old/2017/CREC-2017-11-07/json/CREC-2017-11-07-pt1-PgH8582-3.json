Mr. Speaker, 1 year ago today, the United States held an \nelection for President.\n  Going into that election, there were 251 million Americans old enough \nto vote, but only 139 million people actually voted. That means that \njust 55.3 percent of the voting-age population took part in the \nselection of the person to fill our Nation's highest office.\n  Mr. Speaker, we should break down barriers to voting, not build them. \nWe should make registering to vote easier, not harder. We should ensure \nelections are competitive, not guaranteed.\n  Mr. Speaker, we must restore the Voting Rights Act. We must restore \nvoting rights for people who have served their prison sentences. We \nmust end partisan gerrymandering. We must protect the sanctity of our \nelections. We must do this before the next Federal election.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. PAYNE", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "181", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H8582", "wkday": "Tuesday", "day": "7", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "VOTING RIGHTS", "id": "CREC-2017-11-07-pt1-PgH8582-3", "title": "VOTING RIGHTS"}
