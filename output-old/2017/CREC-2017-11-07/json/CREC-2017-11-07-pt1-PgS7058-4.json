Mr. President, today we celebrate the 25th \nanniversary of high-performance computing at Oak Ridge National \nLaboratory's Leadership Computing Facility.\n  For a quarter century, Oak Ridge has led the way globally, pushing \nthe boundaries of computational performance and continually giving \nscientists more powerful platforms for simulation and discovery at \nevery scale--from the smallest building blocks of atoms to the vastness \nof galaxies--in biology, chemistry, physics, materials science, \ncosmology, industrial modeling, nuclear power, and more.\n  Using Oak Ridge's computing facility, scientists have expanded the \nscale and scope of their research, solved complex problems in less \ntime, and filled critical gaps in scientific knowledge.\n  The Oak Ridge Leadership Computing Facility has led the rapid \nevolution of scientific computing that has produced a millionfold \nincrease in computing power and has been home to both the first \nteraflop--1 trillion calculations per second--and the first petaflop--1 \nquadrillion calculations per second--systems for scientific computing. \nOak Ridge has twice placed two supercomputing systems at the top of the \ninternational TOP500 list, where supercomputers are ranked by their \nnumber-crunching performance.\n  Today computer simulation is an essential part of modern science, but \nin 1992, when Oak Ridge established its Center for Computational \nSciences, which was later renamed the Oak Ridge Leadership Computing \nFacility, not many people thought that the next great center for high-\nperformance computing would be located in east Tennessee.\n\n\n  As I have said many times, this region has one of the most formidable \nconcentrations of brainpower anywhere in our country.\n  The Department of Energy unleashed that brainpower when, later that \nyear, it selected Oak Ridge, along with its partners, three national \nlabs and seven universities, to lead one of the Office of Energy \nResearch's--now the Office of Science--new high-performance computing \nresearch centers to serve scientists from national laboratories, \nuniversities, and private industry.\n  Meanwhile, in 2002, Japan introduced its Earth Simulator, which was \nat the time five times more powerful than any other high-performance \ncomputer in the world.\n  I traveled with former Senator Jeff Bingaman to Japan, and we were \nbriefed on the significance of Japan's investment in the Earth \nSimulator.\n  Japan's development of the Earth Simulator meant that the United \nStates no longer was the clear leader in high-performance computing, \nand for the first time, American researchers were looking abroad to \nobtain access to the latest computing tools.\n  Senator Bingaman and I made it a priority to recapture the lead in \nhigh-speed computing by introducing and passing the High-End Computing \nRevitalization Act of 2004.\n  This legislation paved the way for Oak Ridge to regain the lead in \nsupercomputing. Within a few years, the Oak Ridge Leadership Computing \nFacility deployed a supercomputer called Jaguar that would break the \npetaflop barrier--a quadrillion calculations per second--in 2008 and \ntake back the top spot on the TOP500 list in 2009.\n  For the past 25 years, the Oak Ridge Leadership Computing Facility \nhas not only been home to some of the world's most powerful computers, \nbut it has also been a global leader in the development of software \napplications and tools for scientific research. That is important \nbecause it is not just about having the fastest computer, it is also \nabout having the experts who know how to program and use them.\n  Each year, the facility provides computer systems 10 to 100 times \nmore powerful than most other computers available for research for the \nlab's own scientists, as well as international teams of scientists \ntrying to make breakthroughs on the toughest science challenges.\n  Those scientists publish new science discoveries in nearly 500 \nresearch papers per year.\n  Beyond basic science, dozens of companies, from small businesses to \nFortune 500 giants, have used Oak Ridge supercomputers to accelerate \ntheir own research and development and gain a competitive advantage in \nthe global market.\n  For example, these high-performance computers have allowed companies \nto develop an add-on for long-haul trucks to optimize airflow, which \nimproves fuel mileage by up to 10 percent.\n  Other companies were able to use simulations to extend the shelf life \nof consumer products and to analyze combustion in gas turbines to \nimprove performance and lower emissions.\n  Not only does supercomputing help scientific discoveries and \ncompanies, supercomputers at our national laboratories can be used by \nFederal agencies as a ``secret weapon'' in the effort to combat issues \nlike Medicare and Medicaid waste, fraud, and abuse; to find terrorists \nand criminals; and to help the National Institutes of Health find cures \nand treatments for disease.\n  Other countries have taken notice of the Oak Ridge Leadership \nComputing Facility's success, tried to duplicate it, and now threaten \nour lead in scientific computing.\n  The United States faces a choice between falling behind competitors \nlike China or advancing technologies that can make us safer and more \ncompetitive.\n  In the June 2017 ranking of the world's most powerful supercomputers, \nChina maintained the top two places, Switzerland was third, and Titan \nat the Oak Ridge National Laboratory, which is the fastest \nsupercomputer in the United States, moved down to fourth.\n  In 2018, the Oak Ridge Leadership Computing Facility will complete \nSummit, which will be more than five times faster than Titan and will \nhelp researchers better understand materials and nuclear power and \nsupport more energy breakthroughs.\n  The fiscal year 2018 Energy and Water Development Appropriations \nbill, which I wrote with Senator Feinstein, prioritizes supercomputing \nand recommends $150 million for the Oak Ridge Leadership Computing \nFacility, as well as $381 million to support the delivery of the first \nexascale machine.\n  I am very proud of the men and women from all over the world who have \ncome to east Tennessee and Oak Ridge National Laboratory to make the \nOak Ridge Leadership Computing Facility a world-leading center for \ncomputational scientific research.\n  I thank them for 25 years of hard work and dedication, and I look \nforward to their continued success answering some of the hardest \nscientific questions.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. ALEXANDER", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "Senate", "num": "181", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "S7058-S7059", "wkday": "Tuesday", "day": "7", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS", "id": "CREC-2017-11-07-pt1-PgS7058-4", "title": "ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS"}
