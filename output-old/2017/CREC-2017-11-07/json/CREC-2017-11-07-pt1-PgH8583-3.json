BOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, this week we honor \nAmerica's veterans, a group of men and women with unparalleled courage \nand love of country.\n  We owe our veterans an eternal debt of gratitude. We made a promise \nto look out for them in exchange for their promise to defend our \nfreedom, but gratitude is not enough. That is why I am fighting to \nmaximize the care homeless veterans receive with my bill to improve \nreporting from our VA hospitals, to make sure no veteran, at any stage \nin life, falls through the cracks.\n  I also helped introduce the Patriot Employer Act, which would give \ntax incentives to American businessowners who employ veterans.\n  Mr. Speaker, on behalf of Pennsylvania's 13th Congressional District, \nI would like to thank all of our Nation's veterans for their service on \nthis Veterans Day and every day.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. BRENDAN F.
