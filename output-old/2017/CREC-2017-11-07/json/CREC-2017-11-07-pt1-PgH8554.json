We hope that doesn't happen.\n  Moreover, H.R. 1900, as amended, makes it clear that the museum and \nmemorial is not affiliated with the National Park System, and that the \nbill does not authorize Federal funds for the museum.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to join me in supporting \nH.R. 1900, as amended, and I reserve the balance of my time.", "turn": 4, "speaker": "Mr. BILIRAKIS", "itemno": 10}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "W000799", "text": "  Mr. WALZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the manager's amendment to H.R. \n1900, as amended, the National Veterans Memorial and Museum Act.\n  I would also like to say that when I came to Congress, this is how I \nthought things were supposed to work: citizens\n\n\ncome together, they come up with a great idea, they decide that they \nare going to honor our Nation's veterans, they talk to their Members of \nCongress, they bring it here, we all work together, we come up with a \nplan to put it in place, and we come to the floor to pass a piece of \nlegislation.\n\n\n  This is one of those times where that little cartoon, ``I am just a \nbill sitting on Capitol Hill,'' actually worked that way. For that, I \nam grateful for the work that has been done.\n  I would especially like to thank Chairman Roe for his willingness, as \nwe looked at this bill, to put some guardrails in place making sure \nthat before we designate the memorial and museum to U.S. veterans of \nall eras, that it truly is the National Veterans Memorial and Museum.\n  The materials provided to Members of the Veterans' Affairs Committee \nclearly demonstrate the intent to create an architecturally stunning, \nstate-of-the-art institution in the heart of the country that honors \nveterans and educates the country about those sacrifices. That is an \nincredibly noble cause.\n  Just as important to the eventual success of this effort is the \nresponsibility of the House Veterans' Affairs Committee to ensure that \nit be established and operated to the highest possible standards \nforever, as are the museums and cemeteries under its jurisdiction run \nby the National Cemetery Administration and the American Battle \nMonuments Commission. I feel the legislation we are voting on today \ndoes exactly that.\n  Mr. Speaker, I want to acknowledge the efforts of the gentlewoman \nfrom Columbus, Ohio (Mrs. Beatty). I would also like to thank the \ngentleman from Ohio (Mr. Stivers) for working with us on this. The \ngentleman truly represents the best of what it means to be a \nrepresentative. His good-faith effort to continue to improve on a piece \nof legislation, taking in the concerns that people had to make it work, \nit is, to me, incredibly encouraging. I thank the gentleman for that. \nHis work is going to ensure that this is going to be a spectacular \nmuseum and monument to our Nation's veterans.\n  Under the bill before us today, the museum will submit a report to \nCongress before it opens. The report will address the issues of budget, \ngovernance, operations, vision, and veteran outreach.\n  There is a provision we are adding as part of the manager's amendment \nthat allows Congress to remove that designation after 5 years. We will \nnot need to do that. This will be a wonderful facility. We put this in \nplace as part of our responsibility of oversight.\n  With the addition of these provisions, I believe the committee has \ndone its due diligence before recommending the House to confer this \nnational designation.\n  In addition, it has put in place the necessary guardrails to ensure \nthat this will be built in Columbus, Ohio, to the highest standards. I \nam proud to say this will be the National Veterans Memorial and Museum.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.", "turn": 5, "speaker": "Mr. WALZ", "itemno": 11}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "B001257", "text": "  Mr. BILIRAKIS.

Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Florida for \neverything he is doing to lead this bill on the floor today. I would \nlike to also thank the ranking member from Minnesota for his good-faith \neffort and his work. We worked in a collaborative way to address his \nconcerns.\n  Mr. Speaker, I would also like to thank my colleague from Columbus, \nJoyce Beatty; and my other colleague from Columbus, Pat Tiberi, for \ntheir work in a bipartisan fashion for making this bill better, helping \nthis bill pass the House. I hope we can get it passed in the Senate \nhere shortly as well.\n  Mr. Speaker, I am proud to speak today in support of the bill that \nwill designate the National Veterans Memorial and Museum being built in \nColumbus, Ohio, as America's National Veterans Memorial and Museum.\n  The National Veterans Memorial and Museum will serve as a civic \nlandmark to honor, connect, inspire, and educate all Americans about \nthe service and sacrifice of our Nation's 22 million veterans. It will \nbe the only public museum of its kind that exists for the exclusive \nrole of sharing the experiences of veterans across all eras, conflicts, \nand branches of military service.\n  You might ask: Why would we want to do this in Columbus, Ohio?\n  Well, first and foremost, Ohio has the sixth largest veterans \npopulation in the United States, and it is easily accessible to almost \nanyone in the United States. We are within a 10-hour's drive of almost \n60 percent of the veterans in the United States.\n  I believe that it is going to be a great opportunity to have not \neverything in Washington, D.C., but have it out in the rest of the \ncountry.\n  Ohio is a great place of military history. Ohio was recently selected \nto be the future home of the United States Veterans Affairs National \nArchives in Dayton, and that will make sure that military records \ndating back to the Revolutionary War are kept there.\n  Ohio is the birthplace of the Veterans of Foreign Wars, and that is \none of the earliest adopted veterans service organizations.\n  This museum will also be, and is, supported by veterans service \norganizations around the country, and we want to thank them for that.\n  A lot of veterans have worked hard to make that happen. For example, \nColonel Tom Moe, a Vietnam veteran and a POW who flew 85 missions, is \nleading Veterans' Outreach for the National Veterans Memorial and \nMuseum, and he is part of the Veterans' Advisory Committee working \nclosely with the VSOs across the country to make sure this museum is \ntruly a national reflection of veterans and their stories.\n  Additionally, the Columbus Downtown Development Corporation is \nmanaging this project. They are a 501(c)(3) that will operate, fund, \nand manage the museum, led by a national board of directors, including \nveterans, veterans service organizations, and the families of America's \nveterans. This 501(c)(3)'s mission will remain focused on ensuring that \nthe museum conveys the reverence owed to our veterans of yesterday and \ntoday, as well as tomorrow.\n\n  Mr. Speaker, I would like to take this opportunity to thank Chairman \nRoe for his leadership in this legislation and allowing this to go \nthrough regular order through the Veterans' Affairs Committee. There \nwere hearings. It was a collaborative process, and we worked to address \nsome issues from the other side of the aisle. We worked in a good-faith \neffort.\n  I think we came up with a good solution that ensures that this museum \nwill have the highest standards and will be representative of the \nnational designation in a way that we can all be proud of.\n  I am convinced that both the minority and majority staff wanted to \nmake this museum the greatest it can be, and I want to thank them for \nall their efforts.\n  We were able to hear from VSOs testifying in support of this museum \nthat included The American Legion, the VFW, the Paralyzed Veterans of \nAmerica. I believe that through their testimony and our work, there was \na lot of great information that was exchanged, and we are excited to \nmove forward with the National Veterans Memorial and Museum.\n  One last point is that this museum was funded with private donations. \nIt requires no Federal funding to open the doors. I believe that is \nanother competitive advantage.\n  Again, Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Chairman Roe, Ranking Member \nWalz, Chairman Bilirakis, the members of the Veterans' Affairs \nCommittee, and, most importantly, my co-lead and colleague on this \neffort, Joyce Beatty and Pat Tiberi from Columbus.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the legislation.", "turn": 7, "speaker": "Mr. STIVERS", "itemno": 13}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "W000799", "text": "  Mr. WALZ.
