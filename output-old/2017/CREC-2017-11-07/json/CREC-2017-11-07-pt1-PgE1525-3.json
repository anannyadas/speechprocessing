Mr. Speaker, today I honor the nearly 1200 crew \nmembers who were aboard the U.S.S. Indianapolis when it was attacked by \na Japanese submarine in the early morning of July 30, 1945. Among those \nsailors was Seaman Second Class James Smith, a resident of the First \nCongressional District now living in Blountville, Tennessee.\n  The ``Indy'' was returning from a secret trip to Tinian, carrying \ncritical parts and the enriched uranium for the atomic bomb Little Boy, \nwhen it was struck by two torpedoes that caused massive damage to the \nhull. She sank after only 12 minutes. While approximately 900 of the \ncrew members made it into the water after the attack, only a fraction \nof them survived the conditions in which they found themselves. Seaman \nSmith was one of just over 300 survivors, and had to survive for nearly \nfour days in shark-infested waters relying on few food rations before \nbeing rescued.\n  As an Army veteran myself, I extend my most sincere gratitude and \nappreciation to James and his shipmates for their service, and offer my \ncondolences to the families of the sailors lost at sea. With the \nwreckage having recently been located on August 19th of this year, it \nis yet another reminder of their incredible sacrifice, and gives us an \nopportunity to recognize them for taking on a mission that was so \nimportant to ending World War II.\n  I was proud to join Congressman Bishop last week in introducing \nlegislation that would authorize the Congressional Gold Medal to be \nawarded to the crew of the U.S.S. Indianapolis in recognition of their \nperseverance, their bravery and their service to our nation. I am \nforever grateful to the men and women who serve our great nation, \nespecially to those who make the ultimate sacrifice in order to protect \nour freedom.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. ROE of Tennessee", "itemno": 4}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 5}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "181", "extension": true, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "E1525", "wkday": "Tuesday", "day": "7", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "RECOGNIZING THE CREW OF U.S.S. ``INDIANAPOLIS'' FOR THEIR COVERT OPERATION TO BRING OVER COMPONENTS OF THE ``LITTLE BOY'' ATOMIC BOMB TO TINIAN", "id": "CREC-2017-11-07-pt1-PgE1525-3", "title": "RECOGNIZING THE CREW OF U.S.S. ``INDIANAPOLIS'' FOR THEIR COVERT"}
