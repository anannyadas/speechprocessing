Mr. Speaker, I rise to celebrate the life and honor the \nmemory of Richard Coover, a loving father and husband. Richard, who \nvaliantly served our nation during World War II in the U.S. Marine \nCorps, passed away on October 27, 2017 at the age of 92.\n  In February 1945, three U.S. Marine divisions landed on Iwo Jima, \nJapan; Richard was one of them. He not only survived the war, but he \nalso endured and bravely defended our country facing many challenges. \nHe fought right at the bottom of Mount Suribachi while bearing the \nsound of explosions that lasted all night long.\n  Richard is indeed a hero. He was just a young man, thousands of miles \naway from his home, his friends, and his family when he bravely served \nour country in Japan. His actions embody the true meaning of valor.\n  When I met Richard, I was deeply touched by his humility and spirit \nof service. He passionately expressed his love for our nation and was \nproud to have witnessed the U.S. flag being raised in Iwo Jima. His \ncourage and strength is truly an inspiration.\n  Richard's courage was displayed not only overseas, but also when \nfighting against cancer. My office had the honor to help him obtain \nmedical assistance. I even had the humbling opportunity to present him \nwith a flag that was flown over the U.S. Capitol in honor of his \nservice. Throughout the process, Richard maintained an admirable and \ngraceful presence.\n  Mr. Speaker, I am proud to recognize and honor an outstanding \nconstituent, Richard Coover. On behalf of California's 36th \nCongressional District, I extend my deepest respects and condolences to \nhis family. His years of committed service to our nation are an example \nof excellence and dedication, all should seek to emulate.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. RUIZ", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 3}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "181", "extension": true, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "E1523", "wkday": "Tuesday", "day": "7", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "HONORING RICHARD COOVER FOR HIS LEGACY AND COURAGEOUS SERVICE", "id": "CREC-2017-11-07-pt1-PgE1523-5", "title": "HONORING RICHARD COOVER FOR HIS LEGACY AND COURAGEOUS SERVICE"}
