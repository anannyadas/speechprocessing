Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the Republican tax \nplan. This bill is nothing but a giveaway to America's wealthiest and \ncorporations on the backs of middle class families.\n  The GOP tax plan gets rid of commonsense policies that the American \npeople rely upon:\n  It eliminates the student loan deduction that helps young people pay \nfor college;\n  It eliminates the medical expense deduction, which helps families \nstruggling with diseases like Alzheimer's afford care;\n  It eliminates the deduction for teachers that helps them purchase \nsupplies for the classroom; and\n  It sharply reduces the State and local tax deductions that my \nconstituents in Sacramento rely upon.\n  Meanwhile, when the national debt grows as a result of the GOP's \nunfunded tax breaks, Republicans will turn around and justify cuts to \nearned benefits like Medicare and Social Security.\n  Middle class Americans shouldn't be punished so that the megarich and \ncorporations get a break.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Ms. MATSUI", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "181", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H8533", "wkday": "Tuesday", "day": "7", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "GOP TAX PLAN", "id": "CREC-2017-11-07-pt1-PgH8533-5", "title": "GOP TAX PLAN"}
