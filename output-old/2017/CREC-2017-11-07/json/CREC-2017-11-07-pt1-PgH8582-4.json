Mr. Speaker, there are so many things that the \nAmerican people have to deal with, and I think you have heard many of \nus offer our sympathy and concern for the tragedy that happened in my \nState, and, clearly, one more thing that we don't want to deal with, \nthe shooting of those people of faith praying on their day of worship, \nwhich is what happened in Texas on Sunday.\n  So, today, I am introducing H.R. 4268, the Gun Safety Not Sorry Act \nof 2017, that addresses a 7-day waiting period for purchases or sales \nof semiautomatic firearms, silencers, armor-piercing ammunition, or \nlarge capacity ammunition magazines for purchase or transfer.\n  And let me respond to those who offered mental health. The data shows \nthat Americans have more mental health problems than do people in other \ncountries with fewer mass shootings. But it shows that it is estimated \nthat only 4 percent of American gun deaths could be attributed to \nmental health issues.\n  Let's not keep giving excuses or blaming people with mental health \nissues. I can assure you that is not the problem. As the article in the \nNew York Times says, it is all about guns--guns, guns, guns.\n  I ask my colleagues to support H.R. 4268.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Ms. JACKSON LEE", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "181", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H8582", "wkday": "Tuesday", "day": "7", "month": "November"}, "related_bills": [{"type": "HR", "context": "FIRSTPARAGRAPH", "congress": "115", "number": "4268"}, {"type": "HR", "context": "OTHER", "congress": "115", "number": "4268"}], "doc_title": "IT IS ALL ABOUT GUNS", "id": "CREC-2017-11-07-pt1-PgH8582-4"}
