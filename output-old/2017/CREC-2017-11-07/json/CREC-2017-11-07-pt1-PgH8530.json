Mr. Speaker, I rise today to share the story of \nJoshua Ryan Redner, a young man from my district in Levittown whose \ntragic story illustrates exactly why we cannot waver in our commitment \nto fighting the opioid epidemic.\n  During his final year of high school, Josh was prescribed Percocet to \ntreat the pain from a knee injury. His parents, George and Jacqui, \nnever imagined that their son, a star athlete, and an excellent student \nwho planned to attend the Coast Guard Academy could be dragged down by \naddiction.\n  But addiction can impact anyone, Mr. Speaker. Not long after the \ninitial prescription, Josh's family noticed changes in his behavior. \nThen, long after Josh's prescription had run dry, George and Jacqui \nwere still finding pills in Josh's room. Recognizing the beginning of a \nserious problem, Josh's parents sat him down and Josh committed to \ngetting clean.\n  Working to get the help he needed, Josh entered rehab. Unfortunately, \nthe treatment did not hold and thus began a cycle of relapse, followed \nby stints in rehab. George and Jacqui were shocked to learn that Josh \neventually moved from OxyContin, which was expensive and hard to find, \nto heroin, which was cheap and easily found--a transition that is all \ntoo common.\n\n  Tragedy struck the Redner family with the passing of Josh's older \nbrother, George. Devastated by the loss of his role model, Josh used \nthe power of his grief to get clean and live a life that would have \nmade his older brother proud. Josh found a good-paying job, acted as a \nrole model for his three younger brothers, and was saving money to buy \na home.\n  Mr. Speaker, it is with a broken heart that I say that this is not \nhow Josh's story ended. Josh once again relapsed. Speaking with his \nparents over the phone, Josh assured them that he would be okay and \nasked that they pick him up the next morning. Having no other options, \nGeorge and Jacqui agreed.\n  The next morning, George and Jacqui found Josh next to a picture of \nhis older brother, George, having lost his battle with addiction.\n  In closing, Mr. Speaker, I would like to share with you the words \nthat Jacqui shared with me. Her incredible strength is a testament to \nthe love she has for her sons. Jacqui said:\n\n       This heroin epidemic affects everyone it touches. It is not \n     going away. It is only getting worse. I don't want any parent \n     to have to bury their child. I should not have had to bury \n     two of mine. If we can together save one more child from \n     going down the same path as our Josh did, then our efforts \n     will be worth it.\n", "turn": 1, "speaker": "Mr. FITZPATRICK", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "181", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H8530", "wkday": "Tuesday", "day": "7", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "REMEMBERING JOSHUA RYAN REDNER", "id": "CREC-2017-11-07-pt1-PgH8530", "title": "REMEMBERING JOSHUA RYAN REDNER"}
