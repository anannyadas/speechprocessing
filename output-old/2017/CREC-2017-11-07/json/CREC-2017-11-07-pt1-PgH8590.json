Mr. Speaker, I came here to talk about tax policy, and \nI will; however, having listened for the last 60 minutes to the most \nremarkable admission that Russia is meddling in America in many, many \nways, even an admission that Russia somehow wants to influence \nAmerica's elections--in this case, America's elections for the last \nyear--I am pleased that my Republican colleagues are so adamant in \npursuing Russian influence and, perhaps, controversial influence in the \nUnited States. I am pleased that they are doing that.\n  I am also pleased that Mr. Mueller is continuing his investigations. \nI will note that there have been two indictments and one guilty plea \nthat have already come forth from his investigation having to do with \npeople that are very, very close to President Trump's administration.\n  More will come of that, and I certainly hope our Republican friends \nwill continue to focus on the fact that Russia is playing very serious \nand, quite possibly, illegal games or activities here in the United \nStates.\n  We will carry on. I firmly believe that Mr. Mueller is not about to \nresign or be fired. If he were to be fired, I would suspect that there \nwould be far more serious consequences than the kind of yapping we just \nheard for the last hour here on the floor.\n  Let me go back to my original point, which has to do with tax policy. \nAs interesting as Russia might be, tax policy is going to be far, far \nmore consequential in the long term. Whatever comes of the Russian \nsituation in the election and conspiracies or other kinds of conflicts \nwill bear themselves out over the next several years or months. Tax \npolicy, however, is something that America is going to live with for a \nlong, long time, were it to pass.\n  There are many things we could say about it. One is that, yes, the \ntop 1 percent of America's wealthiest people--you take 360 million of \nus Americans and take the top 1 percent--are going to get 50 percent of \nall of the tax cuts that are in this multitrillion-dollar tax cut \nlegislation.\n  So a trillion and a half dollars over the next 10 years to the top 1 \npercent ought to really drive up that problem that we call income \ndisparity in the United States, you know, what we used to talk about: \nthe rich get richer and the poor get poorer, or that America has a real \nproblem with the superwealthy controlling most of the wealth and the \nrest of Americans really left behind.\n  So this tax bill is going to make it even worse. Now, that is really \ngood. How does it do that?\n  Well, let's see. By eliminating the estate tax. Yes, five members of \nPresident Trump's Cabinet, including the President, would benefit in \nthe billions. You see, the estate tax would be eliminated in just 4 \nyears, about the same time they would be leaving the administration.\n  What does that mean?\n  Well, if you have a billion-dollar estate and there is a tax on that, \nyou can eliminate the first $10 million, $11 million of that, but you \nhave a 40 percent tax on the remainder. Well, that is about $400 \nmillion in estate tax.\n  Who would have a billion-dollar estate?\n  The President, Mr. Ross, the Treasury Secretary, maybe the Education \nSecretary, maybe others.\n  So who is going to benefit from this?\n  The superwealthy, to the tune of millions upon millions or hundreds \nof millions of dollars of the estate tax itself.\n  There is much more to that. American corporations would see their top \nrating from 39 down to 20. Who is going to benefit from that?\n  Well, we heard the Treasury Secretary say the American workers will.\n  Where is the evidence for that?\n  There is no evidence for that, none at all; in fact, quite the \ncontrary. The Treasury Department's own tax analysis section says that \n70 percent of the after-profit taxes now go to, guess who. Stockholders \nand executives, not to the workers.\n  It used to be that way back in the sixties and seventies. Maybe 70 \npercent went to the workers, went to increasing plants and equipment, \ninvestments in the United States. It is not that way anymore. Quite the \ncontrary. The American workers will be left behind once again by those \ntax reductions.\n  That is not to say we shouldn't reduce the nominal tax rate for \ncorporations. Yes, we should, but we should do it in a way that \nactually helps American workers. It keeps investments in the United \nStates. But, no, not this tax proposal. This one actually creates what \nis called territorial accounting for international corporations.\n  Let's suppose that you have an international corporation located in \nSilicon Valley. We have some really big ones there. Territorial taxes \nwould be that all of the earnings that that corporation has outside of \nthe United States would be beyond being taxed by the United States, \neven though it is an American corporation that can manipulate the price \nof its goods and services to actually push, overseas, its profits. \nBrilliant.\n  You want to bring jobs back to America? Don't do territorial tax \nreform. It doesn't work for the American worker. It works for the \nstockholders. Their stocks and stock prices will go up. They will be \nable to receive even more benefits.\n  That is only $3 trillion over 10 years of reduction for corporation \ntaxes.\n  Who benefits?\n  Wall Street corporate executives.\n  Who loses?\n  The American worker loses.\n  One more thing that is on my mind is that I used to hear last year, \nthe year before last, the year before that--in fact, for the last two \ndecades--a lot of talk from about more than half of the Members of this \nHouse of Representatives who would talk about the horrible impact of \nthe American deficit and that it would lead to ruin for the American \neconomy, our grandchildren would be left to pay it off, and all the \nhorrible things that the deficit would bring to the United States, \nultimately leading to the collapse of the American economy.\n\n\n  Well, there is some truth in that. The hyperbole was a little bit \nmore than necessary, but, indeed, it is a problem to see our deficit \never increasing.\n  Every now and then, we come up against the debt limit, and, oh, my \ngoodness, the debate that took place here: We have got to stop it. We \nhave got to stop deficit financing. We have got to bring our budget \nback into balance.\n  Not a bad idea. In fact, it is the right thing to do. And, by the \nway, it was actually done during the Clinton administration.\n  For 2 years, almost 3 years, the American Federal Government ran a \nsurplus, and it was estimated that in the 2000 to 2010 period, if that \nsurplus were to continue, it might lead to a significant and \ntroublesome reduction in the American debt. That is a complex question \nas to why that would be troublesome, but, nonetheless, it was said.\n\n\n  So what happened?\n  George W. Bush came in, cut taxes, decided we would go to war, first \nwar ever in America's history that was not financed by taxes but by \nborrowing, mostly from China, and the deficit began to explode. And \nthen there was the great collapse in 2008, and the deficit went right \nthrough the roof.\n  So we have been living, since that time of the George W. Bush tax \ncuts with a deficit, a structural deficit that has not been solved \ndespite all the rhetoric from the deficit hawks.\n  Now, I guess the deficit hawks, like the Canadian geese, have somehow \nmigrated to the far south of Washington, D.C., because I don't hear any \naround here today. They have migrated somewhere far away from \nWashington. But what I hear from those previous folks that called \nthemselves deficit hawks is that they want to drive up the American \ndeficit, that they have a proposal to actually increase the American \ndeficit.\n  Oh, wonderful, they say, not to worry. We can increase the deficit by \nwell over $1.5 trillion in the next decade and it will be lovely. We \nwill create more jobs.\n  I am going: Excuse me. I must have missed something in this debate. \nYou just said a year ago that those deficits would somehow create a \ncalamity for the American economy, that we would lose jobs, we would \nlose our competitiveness, that we would come to ruin, and now you are \ntelling me I shouldn't worry about a $1.5 trillion increase in the \ndeficit over the next decade?\n  Wow, how does that work? How does that happen?\n  I want to share something with you. I became--trying to understand \nwhat this was all about, how could it be 6 months ago or a year ago \nthey were deficit hawks and they had to do away with the deficit and \nnow they want to increase the deficit? What is this all about?\n  So I asked my staff: Give me some numbers. Don't we have what we know \nas a structural deficit built into the budget of the United States tax \nrevenues significantly lower than the expenditures, and therefore we \nhave this structural deficit? Show me what those numbers are.\n  So they did, and here they are.\n  Structural deficit, 2018, the structural deficit is $567 billion. \nThat is half a trillion. That is the structural deficit that exists \ntoday without any of this discussion about tax cuts.\n  Next year, 2019, it is expected to be $689 billion, two-thirds of $1 \ntrillion in 1 year--in 1 year.\n  And it goes on.\n  The structural deficit in 2020, $775 billion. That is the ongoing \nstructural deficit in the Federal budget: revenue received, \nexpenditures--expenditures $775 billion more than the revenue in 2020.\n  This isn't talking about the new tax cuts that are being discussed \nnow here in Congress.\n  And so it goes.\n  In 2022, it is $1 trillion annual structural deficit.\n  So what does this tax cut mean?\n  Oh, it is only $1.4 trillion or $1.5 trillion over a 10-year period, \nbut that is on top of the existing structural deficit.\n  So here you have it. This year, the existing structural deficit \nbefore any tax cuts, we are talking about $563 billion. Added to that, \nas a result of the Republican Ryan-McConnell-Trump tax cuts, we are \nadding $114 billion on top of $563 billion so that the structural \ndeficit, should this new tax cut ever come into place, will be $677 \nbillion--not millions, billions.\n  Over the next 10 years, by the end of the 10-year period, as that tax \ncut, this new tax cut goes into effect, with the addition adding to the \nexisting structural deficit, in the year 2027, 10 years from now, you \ncan expect a $1.6 trillion structural deficit.\n  This is a problem. It is a problem that is made even worse--even \nworse--by the fact that the benefit of the tax cut does not go to \neconomic growth, but quite the contrary. It does not go to the working \nmen and women, the middle class of America who really do need to have a \nbetter way, better wages, more money in their pockets, a better living, \na better ability to take care of their family and their children, a \nbetter education, a better opportunity, and a better infrastructure. \nNo. No. None of that will happen. Instead, what will happen as a result \nof the Republican tax cut is that the wealthy will get wealthier.\n  Remember this: 50 percent of all of the tax cut benefits--and we are \ntalking trillions here, as much as $3 trillion over a 10-year period. \nFifty percent of that will go to the top 1 percent of Americans. We are \ntalking the superwealthy here.\n  That is not a better way. That is an awful way to run a government. \nThat is an awful thing for an economy when you continue to skew the \nAmerican economy to the superwealthy and leave behind the American \nworker, the American family struggling to do better, struggling to have \na better opportunity for their children in school, a better road or a \nbetter bus or a better train on which to travel, a better \ntransportation system.\n  So here we are. Here we are in the House of Representatives debating \nin committee today how to make the deficit worse, how to increase the \nstructural deficit over the next 10 years, how to literally run this \ncountry into bankruptcy.\n  No, we are not going to go bankrupt, but what we will do, we will \nterminate key programs as we struggle to find ways of balancing the \nbudget with so little Federal revenue available to us as a result of \nthese tax cuts. I could probably go on for an hour and just work myself \ninto a rage about the lost opportunity.\n  We Democrats have proposed a better solution, a better way to deal \nwith the tax policies, one that actually provides benefits to the \nworking families of America, who, as our Republican friends like to \nsay, sit around the kitchen table and worry about their debts. Yes, \nindeed, they do. They worry about it. We have a better way of providing \nfor the infrastructure, a better way of providing for our national \nsecurity, our education, and on and on.\n\n  The architect of those programs that lay out a better way for the \nAmerican economy and the American worker and the American family is \nwith us here tonight, our minority leader, Ms. Pelosi.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Pelosi).", "turn": 1, "speaker": "Mr. GARAMENDI", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "P000197", "text": "  Ms. PELOSI. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  I accept his compliment on behalf of the House Democratic Caucus, \nwhich really developed the better deal. It sprang from our membership, \nwith consensus based on our values that keep us united for America's \nworking families. That is the unifying factor in our Democratic Caucus \nin the House.\n  Mr. Garamendi, I thank you for your diligence in always coming to the \nfloor and speaking truth about the numbers, about what they mean to \nAmerica's future, and also about making it in America. So much of that \nis violated by what the Republicans have put forth.\n  I thank you for starting with the budget, because a budget should be \na statement of national values. What is important to us as a nation \nshould be reflected in how we allocate our resources. That is how we \nDemocrats have always thought of it and acted upon it.\n  That is not what is present in the Republican budget on which these \ntaxes are predicated.\n  Would it be a statement of your values to take $1.5 trillion from \nMedicare and Medicaid and give a $1.5 trillion tax cut to corporate \nAmerica while, at\n\n\nthe same time, saying to working families you are going to have to pay \nwhat little--hit them on their deduction on SALT, the State and local \ntaxes, and rubbing salt in the wound by saying that corporations don't \nhave that deduction taken away from them and, at the same time, in this \ntax plan, making it advantageous for corporations to send jobs overseas \nby having them pay a lower tax for a factory they set up abroad than \nthey would pay in the United States?\n  It is just not right. It is just not fair.\n  You have been a champion, along with Mr. Hoyer, on making it in \nAmerica. Again, this tax proposal that the Republicans are putting \nforth does violence to all of that.\n  And thank you for pointing out the structural nature of what they are \ndoing to the budget. The Republicans, our colleagues, are supposed to \nbe deficit hawks. We agree that we must pay as you go. That has been \nour modus operandi until the Republicans came along and removed that: \nYou want something? Pay as you go.\n  Republicans contend to be deficit hawks, but that must be an \nendangered species because none of them seem to recognize or \nacknowledge the damage they are doing to our fiscal soundness as we go \nout not just in the first 10 years, which is damaging enough and \nstructurally horrible enough, but in the following 10 years. And we in \nCongress, when we make proposals that have a budget impact, have to \naccount for not only the first 10 years, but the second 10 years.\n  Mr. Speaker, in the second 10 years, the horror of what the \nRepublican tax bill does to the budget is a hemorrhaging--a \nhemorrhaging. This tax bill, when Members vote for it, if they do, will \nbe an assault on our children's future. It is not only fiscally \nunsound, it is morally ungrounded because it says to our children and, \nin my case, our grandchildren: You are going to have to pay the bill.\n  The sad part of it is it has an impact on the budget. It comes back \nand says, well, we have so much deficit and so much debt service, so \nmuch interest on the national debt, we are now going to have to make \nfurther cuts in education, in research and development, in all of the \ninitiatives that produce innovation.\n  Innovation begins in the classroom. They make an assault on the \nclassroom in this tax bill. It is going to get worse when they try to \npay for it.\n  Then, of course, it is fiscal engineering so that they can go after \nMedicare and Medicaid, Social Security once again. They have never \nreally believed in Medicare. They say it should wither on the vine, and \nin this bill, they do violence to it.\n  But let's just talk about what this does to the State of California, \nmy colleague, because our Golden State, which we are proud to \nrepresent, is a great economic resource to the Nation--to the Nation. \nIt contributes enormously to our balance in trade, whether it is \nagriculture from your area, innovation, entertainment, whatever it is. \nCalifornia is a big producer of favorable balance of trade for America.\n  Without California and without the industries that it has spread \nthroughout the country, we would be in an even worse trade situation \nthan we are now for all the giveaways that the Republicans are giving \nin the trade issue.\n  But let me just talk about this and what it means to people in their \nhomes at their kitchen table when they are trying to pay the bills, \nestablish their own priorities, make ends meet.\n  It is shocking, Mr. Speaker, it is absolutely shocking that 14 of our \ncolleagues from California voted for a budget, and now many of them are \nproposing to vote for a tax bill, that will hurt their constituents to \nthe tune of tens of thousands of their constituents.\n  Doug LaMalfa, the First District of California, around 100,000 \nhouseholds in his district claim the SALT deduction to the tune of \nthousands of dollars, and they will lose that.\n  Tom McClintock, around 100,000 or more claimed the deduction, and \nthat is 36 percent of the households in his district, and they will \nlose thousands of dollars.\n  How does Paul Cook explain to his constituents, 57,000 of them who \nhave claimed the deduction, that he is going to cost them thousands of \ndollars by increasing their tax bill?\n\n\n  Jeff Denham, he is really going to have to explain it very hard to a \nlarge percentage of his constituents as to how he is increasing their \ntax bill by thousands of dollars.\n  David Valadao, tens of thousands of his constituents will get the bad \nnews if he insists on voting for this bill, which will cost them \nthousands of dollars.\n  Devin Nunes, tens of thousands of his constituents will pay the price \nfor his lack of courage in a vote to go down the line with the \nRepublicans to give a tax break to the wealthiest corporate America at \nthe expense of their constituents, a direct expense and cost to their \nconstituents.\n  Kevin McCarthy says to corporate America: We will give you $1.5 \ntrillion tax cut, and guess who is paying for it? Around over 100,000 \nof my constituents to the tune of thousands of dollars.\n  Steve Knight: Don't worry, my constituents, we are giving the tax cut \nto corporate America, $1.5 trillion, and we are taking it out of your \npocket, you are paying more.\n  Sadly, Ed Royce has the largest number of people who will be \naffected, close to 100,000 people, and they will be spending thousands \nof dollars more in the taxes that they pay because of SALT.\n  Ken Calvert, the same thing, tens of thousands paying thousands of \ndollars more.\n  Mimi Walters, how does she explain to her constituents, tens of \nthousands of them, that they will be paying thousands of dollars more \nin taxes? Why? To give a tax break to the top 2 percent: 80 percent of \nthe tax break goes to the top 2 percent, 50 percent of it goes to the \ntop 1 percent, $1.5 trillion goes to corporate America.\n  Dana Rohrabacher, the same thing, tens of thousands of people will be \npaying thousands of dollars more.\n  Darrell Issa. Hopefully Darrell won't vote for this. Hopefully some \nof these constituents will make sure that their Member of Congress \nknows that they see what is happening. Darrell Issa, well over 100,000 \nconstituents paying thousands of dollars more.\n  Duncan Hunter, the same thing, around the same number. Well over \n100,000--well over 150,000 paying thousands of dollars more. That \nrepresents about a third of his district.\n  But, as I said before, to rub salt in the wounds, while they are \nsaying to their constituents, ``You are going to pay more because we \nare taking away your deduction,'' they are saying to corporate America, \n``Your deductions for State and local taxes you keep.'' It is just \nremarkable.", "turn": 2, "speaker": "Ms. PELOSI", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "G000559", "text": "  Mr. GARAMENDI. Madam Leader, if I might, you said SALT.

The State and localities, did you see there is a letter--I \ndon't have it right here--from the mayors of scores of cities in \nCalifornia asking the Members of Congress not to vote for this because \nof the provision that is in there that undermines their ability to \naddress the education needs of their constituents, of the people in \nthose towns and cities, the public safety issues? We had a firefighter \ncome testify as to what it means to public safety, to law enforcement, \nto meeting the needs of people so that they can learn, that they can \nwork, that they can raise their families, and to do so in a way that \neveryone pays his or her fair share. That is not the case here.\n  So, again, it is a boon to the megarich corporate special interest \nand a bust to the middle class. It also is very harmful to small \nbusiness.\n  While the Republicans will say this is good for the middle class, it \nis not. They give with one hand something and take with another, so \nthey can set the banquet table for the superrich corporate America and \nthrow some crumbs to the middle class and say:\n\n\nSucker. I am just telling it the way it is.\n  Instead, Democrats say: Let's go to the table, let's be respectful of \neach other's views, let's have a clear objective debate on putting \ngrowth in the middle table--what creates growth for our economy, \ngenerating good-paying jobs, not stagnated wages, good-paying jobs, and \nreduces the deficit, instead of taking us into a hemorrhaging state of \ndeficit in the years to come.\n  That is part of what is now.

First of all, with all due \nrespect, Mr. Speaker, one of the dumbest moves in this bill, with stiff \ncompetition, but one of the dumbest moves in this bill is the cut to \neducation. Nothing brings more money to the Treasury than investing in \neducation: early childhood, K-12, higher education, postgrad, lifetime \nlearning. And in this bill, they, of course, make an assault on \neducation.\n  For example, if you have a student loan, right now you have a $2,500 \ndeduction for your interest payment on the loan. Not in this bill. Make \nthat zero.\n  What? What did the middle class ever do to the Republicans that they \nare going to take away a deduction for interest on student loans when \nit is hard enough to save up and pay for college?\n  Next, now let's just go down to grade school. You are a teacher and \nyou bring to school supplies for the classroom because your district is \ntoo poor to afford all of the things that the children would like to \nhave. Right now, you get a tax deduction for what you bring to the \nclassroom, but not in this bill. They have to take that away so they \ncan give a tax break to the superrich so that schoolteacher isn't even \ncompensated adequately, is sacrificing her personal funds, gets a tax \nbreak, but they take it away because the top 2 percent are desperate \nfor their tax cut. But I don't think they are. I have more faith in the \npeople of our country to say: Let us pay our fair share and let's do \nwhat is right.\n  But the list goes on on the things about lifetime learning and \nemployers being able to provide for the training of workers: bye-bye.\n  Let me just tell you this one, since we are talking about education \nand children. In the bill, right now you get a tax credit to help you \nwith adopting a child.\n\n\n  Such a joy to a family. If you are adopting a child with special \nneeds, a tax credit. Not now. They have got to take that tax credit \naway from you. You don't need it anymore because\n\n\nthey have got to give it to corporate America.\n  If your employer decides that their place of business wants to help \nyou with adoption, they get a deduction for helping you with your \nadoption. Not under this bill. Say good-bye to that.\n  Tax credit to the family adopting, tax deduction to the employer all \ngone so they can give the top 1 percent of our country 50 percent of \nthis benefit at the cost of America's working families.\n  If you have medical needs, since 1944, you could deduct medical \nexpenses for extraordinary medical needs. Very important to America's \nfamilies. Not anymore. Say good-bye to that because we have got to take \ncare of the superrich, so the pressure is on you.\n  The list goes on and on, but it gets personal. For families, it makes \na difference as to whether their children can go to college. It makes a \ndifference as to whether they can make ends meet with their medical \nexpenses. It makes a difference if they don't have their State and \nlocal tax deduction. Again, this is across the country. We are speaking \nfrom our California experience.\n  It would take all night to go through the sins in this tax bill. I \njust wanted to give you a touch of some of those and how they directly \nimpact America's working families while they profess that they are \nhelping them. Not true.\n  Then they say: Oh, it is going to pay for itself.\n  Never has, never has. Don't take it from us. Bruce Bartlett, who is \npart of this supply side economics leadership as well as the trickle-\ndown economics, said: We never said it would pay for itself. Anybody \nwho says it does, it is not true. It is nonsense.\n  He even went on to say it was BS, as I am allowed to say on the floor \nof the House in its initial form.\n  These other things they say that just aren't true--oh, they take the \nname of Bill Bradley and Dick Gephardt in vain, and even President \nRonald Reagan: Oh, this is what they did.\n  No, this isn't what they did. They had over 400 people to testify, 30 \nhearings over a period of a couple of years, and worked in a bipartisan \nway to iron out so that it would have sustainability. That is the only \nway you get a good tax bill, is if it is bipartisan and sustainable.\n  So, in any event, this is a moment of truth for the American people, \nand we want the truth to be known.\n  Mr. Speaker, I thank the distinguished gentleman for calling the \nSpecial Order.", "turn": 12, "speaker": "Ms. PELOSI", "itemno": 12}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "G000559", "text": "  Mr. GARAMENDI.

You laid that out very well.\n  You also laid out very, very clearly that in that budget was the \nblueprint for the evisceration of programs that Americans depend upon. \nYou talked about Medicare and you talked about Medicaid, of which 60 \npercent of Medicaid goes to seniors in nursing homes across this \nNation, and the potential cut that would come to Medicare.\n  You also talked about how it would, as you just did, go after the \neducation system, after research that we need for medical research, and \neconomics, and all of the sciences. You talked about the \ninfrastructure.\n  You laid out that that budget bill was the template. We are now \nseeing that template come to reality on the floor of the House first \nwith this tax cut. Probably within months, should this tax bill pass, \nwe are going to see the rest of what you told us to watch out for. \nWatch out for the cuts coming to Medicare, watch out for the cuts \ncoming to Medicaid, to education, to infrastructure, to the things that \nAmericans depend upon in their daily lives, the Meals on Wheels \nprogram, and then the supplemental nutrition programs.\n  Standing right here, I remember I was in the back of the room here, \nand I heard you speak about what would happen if that budget bill \npassed the House.
