Mr. Speaker, this year marks the centennial of Merchant's \nGrocery. The store has been a cornerstone of community for Culpeper \nCounty and is worth taking the time to recognize.\n   The store was founded in 1917 and is one the few stores to make the \ntransition from a Mom and Pop grocery store to a modern food service \nmodel without losing the culture and atmosphere that has made it \ndesirable.\n   Merchant's Grocery has remained unswerving in its care for its \ncustomers and employees. Their quality of service is what has allowed \nthem to last for 100 years and has kept their customers loyal to their \nindustry.\n   Businesses such as Merchant's Grocery are a taste of an age gone by. \nThese businesses serve as a reminder of the importance of small \nbusinesses and the crucial roles they play within their communities.\n   Merchant's Grocery has been a servant to Culpeper County, Shenandoah \nValley, and the area of Central Virginia for the past 100 years and \nwill continue to be a blessing to its employees and customers alike.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. BRAT", "itemno": 3}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 4}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "181", "extension": true, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "E1527", "wkday": "Tuesday", "day": "7", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "100TH ANNIVERSARY OF MERCHANT'S GROCERY", "id": "CREC-2017-11-07-pt1-PgE1527-2", "title": null}
