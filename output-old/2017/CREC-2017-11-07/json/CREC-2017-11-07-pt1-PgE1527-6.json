Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and legacy of \nStaff Sergeant Bryan Black, who was killed in action on Wednesday, \nOctober 4, 2017 while defending our nation as part of the 3rd Special \nForces Group in Africa. SSG Black was a true American hero and our \nthoughts and prayers go out to his friends and family as they mourn the \nloss of this great man.\n  Enlisting in the United States Army in September of 2009, SSG Black's \nlist of accomplishments runs long. After attending Special Forces \nAssessment and Selection program, he earned his Green Beret and was \nassigned to 2nd Battalion, 3rd Special Forces Group. He received \nnumerous medals, including the Purple Heart and Meritorious Service \nMedal.\n  Men and women like SSG Black represent the best our nation has to \noffer. As a Special Forces Medical Sergeant, he had undergone some of \nthe most intense training our military has and emerged as a leader and \nrole model. His selflessness allows us to enjoy the blessings of \nliberty that have persevered for well over 200 years. When his country \nneeded him most, he stood ready to answer the call to serve our great \nnation.\n  Leaving behind a wife and two sons, our country can never repay the \ndebt we owe to SSG Black. He was a model citizen and soldier whose \nlegacy will live on forever. He will always be remembered and I will do \neverything in my power to honor his sacrifice.\n  Mr. Speaker, please join me today in commemorating the life of Staff \nSergeant Bryan C. Black for his service to God and country.\n\n\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. HUDSON", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 3}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "181", "extension": true, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "E1527-E1528", "wkday": "Tuesday", "day": "7", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "IN MEMORY OF STAFF SERGEANT BRYAN C.
