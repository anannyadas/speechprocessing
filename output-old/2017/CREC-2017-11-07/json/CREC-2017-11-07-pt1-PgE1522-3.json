Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Delaware Water \nGap National Recreation Area Superintendent John J. Donahue. After a \n38-year tenure with the National Park Service, Mr. Donahue has \nannounced he will retire on December 3, 2017.\n  Long before he advanced to his current position at the Delaware Water \nGap National Recreation Area in 2003, Mr. Donahue began his federal \ncareer as a gardener at Cape Cod National Seashore. From there he \nadvanced through the ranks, serving in a variety of roles that took him \nacross the continental U.S. After many years, a man who had started his \ncareer as a gardener became the Superintendent of some of our country's \nmost beautiful sites in Florida, Virginia, and Maryland.\n  As a dedicated leader, Mr. Donahue oversaw critical projects and \nbuilt relationships with elected officials, business partners, and \nlocal Native American tribes. Due to a recent stewardship land \nacquisition program, there are now hundreds of acres of connected open \nspace stretching across Pennsylvania and New Jersey. However, this is \njust a singular testament to his commitment and drive. During his \ntenure, Mr. Donahue has written legislation, regulations, policies, an \nnumerous articles.\n  The impact of Mr. Donahue's work extends beyond our country's \nborders. Recently, he led an American and international delegation to \nChina on behalf of the National Park Service. He also attended the \nWorld Parks Conference in Australia and served on a 1999 delegation to \nHaitian national parks in order to spur tourism and economic \ndevelopment.\n  Mr. Donahue's dedication to his country leaves behind a legacy which \nwill inspire future leaders and public servants. I ask my fellow \nMembers to join me in recognizing Superintendent John Donahue and his \n38 years of service.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. CARTWRIGHT", "itemno": 4}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 5}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "181", "extension": true, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "E1522", "wkday": "Tuesday", "day": "7", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "IN RECOGNITION OF SUPERINTENDENT JOHN J.
