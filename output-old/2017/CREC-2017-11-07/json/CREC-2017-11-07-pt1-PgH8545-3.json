Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, nationally recognized statistical rating organizations--\nor NRSROs, as they are known--have been heavily criticized for the role \nthat they played in facilitating the financial crisis.\n  In the years leading up to the crisis, the government adopted a \nseries of policies that had the effect of conferring a ``Good \nHousekeeping'' seal of approval on the rating agencies and on their \nproducts, including designating certain agencies as nationally \nrecognized--a label that they had put on--and hardwiring references to \ntheir ratings into numerous Federal statutes and regulations.\n  These regulatory privileges and the perception that the government \nhad placed its blessing on the rating agencies' assessments led to a \nsense of complacency among investors and a failure of private sector \ndue diligence that contributed to mispriced risk and a collapse of \nmarket confidence when ratings of certain asset-backed securities were \ncalled into question during the credit meltdown of 2007 and 2008.\n  Mr. Speaker, as a result, the Dodd-Frank Act mandated myriad \nregulatory requirements on these NRSROs that were aimed at enhancing \ntheir disclosure and transparency. While some of these provisions may \nhave been constructive, several created new barriers to entry and \nfurther entrenched a type of rating agency oligopoly that has not \nserved investors or the economy well.\n  The Dodd-Frank Act follows a ``registration, not regulation'' \napproach. While it does not require the SEC--the Securities and \nExchange Commission--to regulate or evaluate the rating agencies' \nmethodologies or models, it does seek to ensure that ratings are based \non an objective application of the methodologies and that commercial \nconsiderations do not influence ratings decisions.\n  Specifically, section 932, creates the Office of Credit Ratings at \nthe Securities and Exchange Commission, which imposes more stringent \nconflict-of-interest regulations on credit rating agencies and gives \nthe compliance officers at these rating agencies additional \nresponsibilities, including filing annual reports with the SEC.\n  While credit agencies must be held accountable, these increased \nreporting requirements have given the burden to small credit rating \nagencies and have hurt investors who bear the true cost of these rules. \nThat one-size-fits-all annual reporting requirements imposed by Dodd-\nFrank on all NRSROs placed unnecessary burdens and compliance costs on \nsmall NRSROs, who in no way were a cause of the financial crisis.\n  As a result of the annual reporting requirements, large NRSROs that \ncan absorb these compliance costs have gotten bigger; and smaller \nNRSROs, for whom these compliance costs really impose a \ndisproportionate burden, they have been prevented from entering the \nmarketplace and providing necessary competition.\n  On May 15, 2013, former Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Mary \nJo White wrote a letter on behalf of a unanimous commission to Chairman \nHensarling of the Financial Services Committee to request the \nprovisions of H.R. 3911 as a legislative proposal. She said: ``Rather \nthan focusing every year on each of the designated eight review areas, \nallowing a risk-based approach would permit the SEC staff to tailor \nexaminations. . . . As a result, staff could focus limited resources on \nthese specific risks rather than reviewing the designated eight areas, \nsome of which may not present a risk for a particular firm. . . . `'\n  Consistent with former Chair White's request, H.R. 3911, statutorily \nchanges the annual reporting requirements so that they are risk-based, \ninstead of requiring the burdensome review of all eight review areas \ncurrently mandated.\n  This approach is a commonsense balance that still ensures large \nNRSROs are regulated while smaller NRSROs are provided necessary relief \nto enter and thrive in the marketplace.\n  The legislation unanimously passed the Financial Services Committee \nlast month, and I was pleased to be a part of that.\n  At this time I would like to commend the bipartisan work of \nRepresentatives Wagner and Foster on this important bill. I encourage \nall of my colleagues to vote in favor of H.R. 3911.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.", "turn": 4, "speaker": "Mr. HUIZENGA", "itemno": 11}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "K000380", "text": "  Mr. KILDEE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I think the House should note that the Speaker and the \ntwo gentlemen controlling the time are from the greatest State, the \ngreat State of Michigan, so I think we are in good hands.\n\n\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 3911, which is offered, \nas my colleague has said, in a bipartisan fashion by Representatives \nWagner and Foster.\n  This legislation would allow the Securities and Exchange Commission \nto focus on the most high-risk areas when conducting annual \nexaminations of certain credit rating agencies known as nationally \nrecognized statistical rating organizations.\n  Credit rating agencies did, in fact, play a central role in the \nsubprime mortgage meltdowns by routinely assigning inflated credit \nratings to high-risk structured mortgage products. These ratings, which \nwere issued by agencies operating under conflicts of interests, allowed \nbanks to assume unreasonable amounts of risk and resulted in the loss \nof trillions of dollars when the mortgages underlying those risky \ninvestments began to default.\n  In the wake of the ensuing financial crisis, the Dodd-Frank Act \nstrengthened oversight of credit rating agencies, including by \ndirecting the SEC to create an Office of Credit Ratings responsible for \nconducting annual examinations of the rating organizations.\n  Currently, each rating organization examination must include a review \nof eight topic areas designed to assess the adequacy of each agency's \ninternal controls, conflicts of interests, and rating methodologies, \namong other areas.\n  This legislation, H.R. 3911, is responsive to former SEC Chair Mary \nJo White's 2013 request to the Financial Services Committee for \nlegislation that would allow the SEC staff to take a risk-based \napproach to annual rating organization examinations. Such an approach \nwould allow the SEC to focus valuable resources on the areas where \nproblematic conduct is most likely to exist.\n  H.R. 3911 is designed to strengthen regulatory efforts rather than \nprovide a basis for reduced accountability. So I do urge the SEC to use \nthe discretion afforded under H.R. 3911 in order to focus on areas that \npresent the greatest risk of misconduct.\n  It is vital that our ratings organizations are accountable, and I \nbelieve this bill is an important step to ensure that the inflated \nratings that led up to the financial crisis are not repeated.\n  Mr. Speaker, I support H.R. 3911.

Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman of the Capital \nMarkets, Securities, and Investments Subcommittee, my friend and \ncolleague, Mr. Huizenga, for his support.\n  Mr. Speaker, first, I also wish to thank the ranking member and \nCongressman Foster for his support of this issue both in the 114th \nCongress and the 115th Congress.\n\n\n  H.R. 3911, the Risk-Based Credit Examination Act, makes the criteria \nrequired in annual reporting by nationally recognized statistical \nrating organizations, or NRSROs, just that: risk based.\n  In 2008, the financial crisis taught us many lessons. It also \nhighlighted how NRSROs regularly gave high ratings to mortgage-backed \nsecurities. As we now know, these mortgage-backed securities led to one \nof the largest financial collapses, which some economists have put on \npar with the Great Depression of the 1930s.\n  In 2010, with the passage of Dodd-Frank and in an attempt to prevent \nprevious mistakes, these organizations were hit with new requirements \naimed at enhancing their disclosures and transparency. Unfortunately, \nthe one-size-fits-all annual reporting requirements mandated under \nsection 932 of Dodd-Frank placed unnecessary burdens and compliance \ncosts on small NRSROs that were in no way the cause of the financial \ncrisis.\n  Contrary to what some might believe, more regulation doesn't solve \neverything; in fact, it doesn't solve most things.\n  After the Office of Credit Ratings was created in 2012 and the new \nrequirements were put into place, smaller NRSROs found it difficult to \nenter the marketplace. Ironically, the large credit rating agencies--\nwhich, again, had a hand in the financial crisis--are getting bigger, \ndriving out small credit rating agencies and making it clear that these \nnew regulatory requirements missed their intended mark and placed \nunnecessary requirements on smaller NRSROs.\n  Mr. Speaker, a move to a risk-based model will alleviate the burden \non small NRSROs and provide competition while continuing to maintain \noversight and transparency over the industry. The marketplace needs \nthis fix. As the chairman noted in a 2013 letter, SEC Chairman Mary Jo \nWhite concurred with these conclusions.\n  Let's be clear. This bill does not eliminate reporting requirements \nfor credit rating agencies; instead, it simply makes the criteria \nrequired in annual reports risk based. Credit rating agencies will \nstill be held accountable, while allowing real competition in the \nmarket.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation that is \nboth bipartisan and commonsense, something we don't often see in \nWashington, D.C.", "turn": 7, "speaker": "Mrs. WAGNER", "itemno": 14}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "K000380", "text": "  Mr. KILDEE.
