Grant our Senators a tolerance so that they may not be quick to \ncondemn ideas that differ from their own. Lord, give them such \nintegrity so that their work may be their best whether there is anyone \nto see it or not.\n  Bless and keep us all. Shine Your wisdom upon us, doing for us more \nthan we can ask or imagine.\n  We pray in Your great Name.
