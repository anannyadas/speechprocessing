Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 50th \nanniversary of Conval, Inc., located in Somers, CT.\n  In 1962, WWII Navy veteran, Chester ``Chet'' Siver designed a line of \nhigh-pressure, forged steel valves in his basement in Longmeadow, \nMassachusetts. After a brief period overseeing Hamilton Standard's use \nof his design, Mr. Siver eventually regained the rights to his product \nand set up shop. Conval, or ``Connecticut Valve'', was founded on \nNovember 7, 1967.\n  Today Conval is the premier manufacturer of high quality, high \ntemperature, and high pressure forged steel valves in the world. Conval \nvalves are used in a variety of industries, including fossil power, \nnuclear power, pulp and paper, and water treatment.\n  As the town's largest private employer, Conval has become an \ninstitution in Somers. This family-owned and operated small business, \nnow overseen by Chet's son, Frank Siver, is an American success story \nthat has stayed true to Siver's commitment to making Conval ``a nice \nplace to work.'' For example, when it came time to expand, Conval \nelected to stay close to home to accommodate its employees and their \nfamilies. Their new facility, located in nearby Enfield, CT, is set to \nopen in February 2018.\n  Mr. Speaker, please join me in honoring Conval for their fifty-year \ncommitment to great American manufacturing and community. May they \nenjoy continued success for years to come.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. COURTNEY", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 3}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "181", "extension": true, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "E1523", "wkday": "Tuesday", "day": "7", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "RECOGNIZING THE 50TH ANNIVERSARY OF CONVAL", "id": "CREC-2017-11-07-pt1-PgE1523", "title": "RECOGNIZING THE 50TH ANNIVERSARY OF CONVAL"}
