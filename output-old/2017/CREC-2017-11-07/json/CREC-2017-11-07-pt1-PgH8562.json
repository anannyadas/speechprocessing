Mr. Speaker, today I rise in strong support of H.R. \n3949, yet another piece of bipartisan, commonsense legislation that \nwill serve our veterans.\n  In the transition from deployment to employment, apprenticeship \nprograms have proven to be extremely successful. Roughly 20,000 \nveterans are actively training or participating in these programs, and \ntheir employment outcomes are nothing short of impressive. According to \nVA's data, over 90 percent of veteran apprentices are employed after \ncompleting their programs with an average starting wage of over \n$60,000. Over their lifetime, apprentices see an increase in \ncompensation of over $300,000 as compared to their peers.\n  These programs aren't just a win for our veterans, they are a win for \ntaxpayers. Every dollar invested in apprenticeship programs sees a \nreturn in benefits of $35.\n  While it is clear to see the advantages of apprenticeship programs, \nlike in many parts of VA, this program is hampered by needless burden \nand bureaucracy. Currently, private employers who offer these programs \nin more than one State have to register with each State individually. \nBurdened by the difficulty and trail of paperwork that this creates, \nmany employers only choose to participate in a limited way or they just \ndon't offer them altogether.\n  H.R. 3949, the Veterans Apprenticeship and Labor Opportunity Reform \nAct, or the VALOR Act, authored by my good friend and colleague, \nCongressman Ro Khanna, streamlines the registration process for \nemployers, which, in turn, encourages them to participate and leads to \nmore opportunities for our veterans.\n  Given the tremendous sacrifice our veterans have made for our \ncountry, we should do everything we can to ensure that they have access \nto good jobs, and the VALOR Act does just that.\n  I would like to thank Mr. Khanna again for his hard work and his \nleadership on this legislation.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support it.", "turn": 7, "speaker": "Mr. ARRINGTON", "itemno": 17}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "W000799", "text": "  Mr. WALZ.

Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the bipartisan bill, \nH.R. 3949.\n  Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the ranking member. I was in his office \nearly on, and he really gave a freshman Member of Congress the guidance \non how to get this through. I want to thank Chairman Arrington for \ncoauthoring this legislation and for his leadership. I also thank \nCongressman Bilirakis for his kind words about the legislation.\n  The legislation is very, very simple. Right now, if you want to offer \na veteran an apprenticeship, you have to register in 50 different \nStates. As a result, small businesses or medium-sized businesses say, \n``Well, we can't do that; we can't fill out paperwork in 50 different \nStates,'' so they don't offer these apprenticeships. Our bill says, \nvery simply, the only place that you should have to register in is the \nState that you are headquartered.\n  This is the type of commonsense legislation that isn't partisan. It \nis going to give more opportunities to the people who have earned them \nby serving our country: veterans.\n  I wish to recognize a few other people who have made this possible. \nOf course, Chairman Roe, whose leadership was critical, in addition to \nChairman Arrington; Ranking Member O'Rourke; and the staff: Cathy Yu, \nKelsey Baron, and Jon Clark.\n  I also want to particularly recognize, on the Senate side, Aaron \nMurphy and Tony McClain in Senator Tester's office, and a companion \nSenate bill with Senator Tom Cotton and Senator Thom Tillis, as well as \ntheir staff, Jake Bailey and Bill Bode.\n  Finally, I realize that there is only one person more than Members of \nCongress or staff who often gets things to move in this committee, and \nthat is Dr. Joe Westcott, the legislative director of the National \nAssociation of State Approving Agencies. Joe and I have become friends. \nHe has been such a voice for innovation and for this bill.
