Mr. Speaker, House Resolution 607 provides for \nconsideration of H.R. 3043, the Hydropower Policy Modernization Act of \n2017, and H.R. 3441, the Save Local Business Act.\n  H.R. 3043 would modernize Federal regulatory permitting processes for \nthe licensing of hydropower projects. Specifically, the bill would \ndesignate the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, or FERC, as the \nlead agency for these projects.\n  I am a proud supporter of an all-of-the-above energy strategy that \nallows for not only American energy independence, but for American \nenergy dominance.\n\n\n  Hydropower should be a part of that strategy. In the Pacific \nNorthwest especially, hydropower is a clean and reliable energy source \nthat is particularly abundant. There is remarkable potential for the \nhydropower industry in this region and around the United States.\n  In 2015, hydropower accounted for approximately 6 percent of total \nU.S. electricity generation and 46 percent of electricity generation \nfrom renewable sources. However, less than 3 percent of dams in the \nU.S. produce electricity. That shows just how great the potential is \nhere.\n  Through this legislation, we can help ease regulatory burdens and \nstreamline the permitting process by naming FERC as the lead agency for \ncoordinating all Federal authorizations. This will result in balanced \nand more timely decisionmaking and reduce the current duplicative \noversight regime.\n  So how does this benefit the average American?\n  Well, having a reliable power source is essential to the world today.\n  Even more, this legislation also has the potential to lower energy \ncosts and create good-paying jobs. By doing so, we can help Americans \nput away and keep more of their hard-earned money.\n  Currently, the hydropower industry employs a workforce of \napproximately 143,000 people, and that number would certainly rise \nunder this legislation as we unlock our full potential.\n  Now, some of my colleagues have expressed concerns that this \nlegislation could hurt the environment, so I want to address that.\n  First, hydropower is an entirely clean source of renewable energy. \nIncreasing hydropower production actually helps protect the environment \nand promote better public health.\n  Second, the legislation makes clear that these permitting reforms \nshould have no effect on this Clean Water Act, the Fish and Wildlife \nCoordination Act, the Endangered Species Act, the Rivers and Harbors \nAct, and the National Historic Preservation Act. Those laws and their \nprotections will remain in place.\n  This is simply about promoting a reliable power source, lowering \nenergy costs, creating jobs, and unlocking the full potential of an \nall-of-the-above energy strategy.\n  Mr. Speaker, I will also note that this rule will provide for \nconsideration of four amendments to H.R. 3043, including one minority \nand one bipartisan amendment.\n  The other bill covered by the rule is H.R. 3441, the Save Local \nBusiness Act. As the sponsor of this legislation, I am thrilled to see \nthis body taking action to protect millions of jobs and provide clarity \nto America's workers.\n  Jesus said that no man can serve two masters, and there is real \nwisdom behind what He said as there is wisdom behind everything He \nsaid. His teachings are important every day, but that basic principle \nseems particularly important in the context of this legislation.\n  For decades, there was a commonsense legal test that determined when \ntwo or more separate businesses could be considered joint employers and \nheld jointly responsible for the same group of employees. Employers had \nto share direct and immediate control over essential terms and \nconditions of employment. As a former labor and employment attorney who \npracticed in this area for decades, I can assure you this was the \nstandard that everyone knew and appreciated.\n  Well, in 2015, the activist National Labor Relations Board issued a \nruling\n\n\nin Browning-Ferris Industries that upended this cornerstone of Federal \nlabor law and created a vague and totally unworkable new joint employer \npolicy.\n  Making matters even worse and more complicated, Federal agencies then \nincorporated the new standard in their regulatory agenda. Under this \nnew standard, two independent businesses could be considered joint \nemployers if they make a business agreement that ``indirectly'' or \n``potentially'' impacts their employees. Under some of these standards, \nyou can actually be reserved power.\n  Just think about the uncertainty and ambiguity this standard could \ncause. It is hard enough for people to even agree on what exactly those \nterms mean. Imagine how confusing it is for Main Street businesses to \nunderstand and follow that.\n  This is not some abstract issue. In fact, I have been hearing and \ntalking with job creators and workers in my district about this for \nyears. I have sat around the restaurant tables and heard real stories \nand concerns.\n  Bob Omainsky, the owner of Wintzell's Oyster House in my home \ndistrict, had this to say about the confusion caused by the new joint-\nemployer standard: ``If we hire an outside landscaping company to keep \nour lawns lush, I could be considered a joint employer if I show the \nlandscapers where to mow. Or, if I contract a food supplier for certain \ningredients, I could become part of a lawsuit if one of their workers \ncomplains about overtime pay. The uncertainty is nothing more than \ngovernmental overreach that is crippling eateries like Wintzell's and \ndiscouraging growth throughout the restaurant industry.''\n  This story and example is not unique to my district. These stories \nexist all over the country from Seattle, Washington, to Miami, Florida; \nand we heard a whole bunch of them in the hearings that we held in \ncommittee. This is why this bill has earned support from both sides of \nthe aisle. This is not a partisan issue, but instead this is about \nprotecting jobs and providing clarity to workers.\n  Workers shouldn't have to wonder who their employer is. They deserve \nbetter than a vague and confusing rule that the American Action Forum \nfound threatens 1.7 million jobs. Even the Progressive Policy Institute \nissued a statement saying the expanded standard ``may do more harm than \ngood.''\n  I also want to make one thing perfectly clear: this legislation does \nnot remove a single worker protection. All worker protections provided \nby the National Labor Relations Act, the Fair Labor Standards Act, and \nthe Equal Pay Act remain unchanged and are still available.\n\n  I also want to dispel the myth that this legislation is some \ndeparture from the norm. In fact, this legislation simply restores the \nagreed-upon legal standard that existed for decades.\n  The reality is that the new standard has created so much confusion \nand ambiguity that no one really knows what the law is. There are at \nleast nine different legal tests nationwide to determine joint employer \nstatus under the Fair Labor Standards Act, and there are more to come.\n  This patchwork of standards creates regulatory uncertainty, \nespecially for job creators doing businesses in multiple States. \nUltimately, this legislation is about providing clarity to workers and \njob creators. It is about protecting the rights of workers and ensuring \nemployers have clarity on their responsibilities to their employees, \nand it is about preserving the small businesses that are the backbone \nof our local communities.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support House Resolution 607 and \nthe underlying bills, and I reserve the balance of my time.", "turn": 5, "speaker": "Mr. BYRNE", "itemno": 8}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "M000312", "text": "  Mr. McGOVERN.

Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to this rule, \nwhich provides for consideration of two deeply flawed pieces of \nlegislation.\n  H.R. 3043, the Hydropower Policy Modernization Act of 2017, is yet \nanother attempt by this Republican majority to prioritize corporate \nprofits over ensuring people have access to safe and clean drinking \nwater.\n  This bill would not only threaten our clean water, it would also \nundermine States' rights and Tribal rights by prioritizing power \ngeneration above all else when deciding whether to grant or extend a \nlicense to operate a hydropower project.\n  Simply put, this bill puts profits ahead of the public interest. By \ngiving a rubber stamp commission more power than other expert agencies, \nthe bill rigs the process in favor of power producers at the expense of \nStates, Tribes, and our environment.\n  This bill prioritizes profits over clean water and healthy fisheries \nand should be strongly defeated. Protecting our families and our \nenvironment should always be our first priority.\n  In another giveaway to corporate interests, House Republicans are \nalso bringing to the floor this week H.R. 3441, the so-called Save \nLocal Business Act, under the false claim that it eliminates \nuncertainty for workers and protects small businesses.\n  The truth is a very different story, Mr. Speaker. Joint employment \nstandards ensure workers can hold employers accountable for violating \nwage and hour laws, child labor, or refusing to collectively bargain. \nThis bill represents a significant and dangerous break from that \nstandard and would undermine the rights of American workers.\n  This legislation rewards companies that rent employees from staffing \nagencies instead of hiring them directly, and allows them to evade \nresponsibility for upholding the rights of those employees, even though \nthey profit from their work.\n  This bill is not about helping workers or small businesses. This is \nall about giving powerful companies even more power over their \nemployees.\n  But, Mr. Speaker, what is just as troubling as the content of the \nunderlying bills is the process Speaker Ryan and his Republican \nleadership team routinely use to call up this terrible legislation.\n  Today we are considering the 49th completely closed rule of the 115th \nCongress. That is right. Today House Republicans are breaking their own \nrecord for the most closed session of Congress in history. It is \nastounding. This is something you would celebrate in Putin's Russia, \nnot here in the United States.\n  Since he first took the gavel in 2015, Speaker Ryan has continue to \nshamelessly break his promise to allow a fair and open legislative \nprocess here in this House.\n  In Speaker Ryan's first speech as Speaker in October of 2015, he \nsaid: ``We need to let every Member contribute. . . . Open up the \nprocess. Let people participate. A neglected minority will gum up the \nworks. A respected minority will work in good faith. Instead of trying \nto stop the majority, they might try to become the majority.''\n  Speaker Ryan and I disagree on a great many issues, but I strongly \nagree with what he said in that 2015 speech. We do need to let every \nMember contribute and open up the process here in the House. We do need \nthe majority party to respect the minority party so we can actually \nwork together on bipartisan solutions.\n  But in the 2 years since Speaker Ryan took the gavel, he has, sadly, \nfailed to deliver on his commitment to open up the legislative process. \nThings have only gotten worse. In fact, Speaker Ryan is the only \nSpeaker who has not allowed a truly open rule to give Members the \nopportunity and the chance to do what their constituents sent them here \nto do and to offer different perspectives and ideas on how to improve \nlegislation.\n  With each new closed rule they bring to the floor, shutting out \namendments from both Democrats and Republicans, the cynical hypocrisy \ngrows louder and louder. Instead of the people's House, this has, \nsadly, become ``only the people who agree with Paul Ryan's House.''\n  I guess my question for the Speaker would be: Did you mean any of \nwhat you said? Did you forget all those promises you made? Or did you \nhave absolutely no intention of keeping those promises once you were in \npower?''\n  Every single Member of this House of Representatives was elected to \nrepresent the people of their district, but\n\n\nwe cannot do that if the party in the majority blatantly uses strong-\narm tactics like these that prevent us from doing our jobs.\n  In 2015, Speaker Ryan also said: ``We need to return to regular \norder. We are the body closest to the people. Every 2 years, we face \nthe voters. . . . We represent them. We are supposed to study up and do \nthe homework that they cannot do. So when we do not follow regular \norder--when we rush to pass bills a lot of us do not understand--we are \nnot doing our job. Only a fully functioning House can truly represent \nthe people.''\n  Where do I begin?\n  Literally just a few months ago, Speaker Ryan and the Republican \nleaders of this House were recklessly steamrolling their healthcare \nbill to the House floor without holding anything close to the number of \nhearings that we held when the Affordable Care Act was passed.\n  Instead, they led a haphazard process where the bill was drafted in \nsecret behind closed doors--locked doors--without any input from rank \nand file Members of Congress and the American people. Mr. Speaker, that \nis not regular order. That is unconscionable. That disrespects this \nHouse.\n  Today, when asked by a reporter about this record-breaking closed \nprocess, Speaker Ryan responded: ``Absolutely we have an open \nprocess.''\n  Really?\n  Let's review his record this Congress: Zero open rules--zero. Forty-\nnine completely closed rules.\n  Open process?\n  Open process my foot, Mr. Speaker.\n  I guess in the age of Donald Trump, words simply don't matter \nanymore. Black is white, up is down, open is closed, and politicians \ncan say whatever they think sounds good and they think they can get \naway with it--facts be damned.\n  If Speaker Ryan were serious about a fair and open process, he would \nnot turn this House into a rubber stamp for Donald Trump. He would let \nus be the independent voice the people of our districts elected us to \nbe. He would not routinely shut out the voices of Democrats and \nRepublicans. He would let this House actually debate the serious \nlegislation and issues that come before us.\n\n\n  With one closed rule after another on each bill that comes to the \nfloor, Speaker Ryan has completely shut out both Democrats and rank-\nand-file Republicans, routinely blocking amendments we offer.\n  This is not how the Congress is supposed to work. Our constituents \ndeserve a Congress that actually debates the bills that will affect \ntheir lives. They deserve better.\n  I refuse to sit by while the Republican leadership makes a mockery of \nthis House. American voices will not be silenced.\n  The Speaker may grant promises of openness, inclusiveness, and \nregular order, but we just lived through the most closed year in the \nhistory of this institution, and the year isn't even over yet, Mr. \nSpeaker.\n  Republicans ought to remember that they will not always be in the \nmajority. I don't think a Democratic majority could be this bad on \nbasic process, even if we tried. But any Member who votes for this \nrecord-breaking closed rule today had better not have crocodile tears \nfor regular order and openness when they find themselves in the \nminority some day in the future. Anyone who supports 49 closed rules \nand zero open rules in a single year loses all credibility on the issue \nof openness.\n  My Republican friends should be ashamed--ashamed--of diminishing this \nHouse and diminishing its Members and their thoughtful ideas. I urge \nDemocrats and Republicans to take a stand and vote ``no'' on this \nclosed rule.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.", "turn": 7, "speaker": "Mr. McGOVERN", "itemno": 10}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "B001289", "text": "  Mr. BYRNE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I am extremely proud of the work that the Rules \nCommittee has done this year and of the leadership in this Congress and \nhow we have handled legislation.\n  Unlike our Democratic colleagues who would shut the doors and refuse \nto accept late amendments from Members, the chairman of our committee \nhas made it a point to ensure every single Member has the opportunity \nto submit their amendments and come to the committee to share their \nthoughts and concerns.\n  Under this model of transparency and openness, the committee has \nspent countless hours listening and considering Member testimony. In \nfact, we have welcomed over 330 Members to testify, this Congress \nalone, before the Rules Committee. We have made in order 864 \namendments, including 403 from Democrats, 341 from Republicans, and 120 \nbipartisan amendments.\n  Unfortunately, our friends across the aisle have become more \ninterested in derailing legislation than actually improving \nlegislation. For example, Democrats politicized an open appropriations \nprocess by offering poison pill amendments meant to kill legislation \nthey had no intention of supporting, regardless of the outcome.\n  These tactics have fundamentally changed the way we do business. \nInstead of offering thoughtful ideas intended to shape a measure, their \ndilatory tactics are for one purpose and one purpose only: to score \npolitical points.\n  The Rules Committee will not let these political games get in the way \nof fulfilling the promises we made to the American people who elected \nthis majority. That is why the chairman of our committee has made it a \npriority to listen to all Members. I would ask all of you who come to \nthe Rules Committee to watch our committee listening to all Members.\n  We are also committed to moving the majority's progrowth agenda \nforward. As a result of our efforts, we have had a record of success in \nthis House. To date, we have passed almost 400 bills out of the House.\n  This further underscores that the House is here to work, we are here \nto serve, and we are here to get results. But the proof is in the \nfacts. John Adams said: ``Facts are stubborn things.''\n  As of November 7 of this year, in just the first session of this \nCongress, we have provided for the consideration of 864 amendments on \nthe House floor. Under Speaker Pelosi, during the entirety of the 111th \nCongress, both sessions, she had only made in order 778. You tell me \nwho has an open House and who had a closed House.\n  There is no shame on this side at all. There is great pride in the \nwork we are doing for the American people, and we are not going to let \nanyone get in the way of our making sure that we fulfill the promises \nwe made.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Washington (Mr. \nNewhouse), a distinguished member of the Rules Committee.", "turn": 8, "speaker": "Mr. BYRNE", "itemno": 11}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "N000189", "text": "  Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, first, I want to thank my friend, the \ngentleman from Alabama, for letting me participate in this very \nimportant debate today.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the rule, but specifically to voice \nmy very strong support for one of the bills of the underlying \nlegislation. That would be H.R. 3043, which is the Hydropower Policy \nModernization Act of 2017.\n  This legislation, which is sponsored and spearheaded by my good \nfriend and fellow Washingtonian, Representative Cathy McMorris Rodgers, \nwill improve the licensing process for U.S. hydropower resources by \npromoting accountability as well as transparency, by requiring greater \ncooperation among Federal and State agencies, as well as by reducing \nneedless duplication of efforts.\n  Mr. Speaker, I am a strong, steadfast supporter of hydropower--I \nadmit that--which, as America's first renewable electricity source, has \nprovided our country with low-cost, clean, reliable energy for over a \ncentury. In my own home State of Washington, nearly 70 percent of our \nenergy is derived from hydropower.\n  While there are still some misguided, extreme efforts to breach our \ndams and remove these critical sources of electric generation, I \nbelieve we need to increase our use of clean and renewable resources. \nBy passing the Hydropower Policy Modernization Act, we can take a very \nmajor step in doing just that.\n  Mr. Speaker, FERC, or the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, \nserves as the lead agency to coordinate hydropower reviews and convene \nstakeholders to participate in collaborative,\n\n\ntransparent public proceedings. However, FERC lacks the authority to \nimprove the hydropower licensing process, including the ability to \nresolve disputes among agencies and enforce scheduling deadlines.\n\n  Far too often, it is those Federal and State agencies, as well as \nother bureaucratic bodies, that stand in the way of moving these \nlicensing efforts forward. In fact, in response to a House Energy and \nCommerce Committee's subcommittee hearing, FERC reported that there are \n26 separate cases where the Commission has finished its environmental \nreview and is currently waiting for action to be completed by another \nagency before FERC can issue a decision on any particular project.\n  Mr. Speaker, the licensing process for these projects should not be \ntaking 10 years or more. Natural gas-fired facilities and other carbon-\nbased energy sources are being approved in considerably less time. \nMeanwhile, less than 3 percent of the dams in this country produce \nelectricity.\n  I will continue to support efforts to increase hydropower generation \nthat will provide our country with reliable, stable, and clean energy. \nWe can usher in a new era of U.S. energy independence derived from our \nvery first renewable energy source by streamlining these processes.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to support this rule and, particularly, \nits underlying legislation, H.R. 3043, the Hydropower Policy \nModernization Act of 2017.", "turn": 9, "speaker": "Mr. NEWHOUSE", "itemno": 12}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "M000312", "text": "  Mr. McGOVERN.

The fact that the gentleman \nwould get up and say that with a straight face, you take my breath \naway. It is unbelievable.\n  Today, we are considering our 49th closed rule of the 115th Congress, \nofficially making this the most closed session in Congress in history, \nand the gentleman is proud of that.\n  More than half of the rules Republicans have reported out of the \nRules Committee have not allowed any amendments.

But you blocked it.\n  You blocked an amendment for funding for troops in Syria.\n  You blocked an amendment to create the National Russian Threat \nResponse Center.\n  The list goes on and on and on.\n  These aren't killer amendments. These are important issues that get \nblocked time and time again. These issues are at the very core of our \nresponsibilities here in Congress, and you blocked them from even being \nconsidered by the full House.\n  In this Congress, the majority has blocked over 1,300 amendments from \ncoming to the floor. You are proud of that?

Mr. Speaker, I urge Members to vote ``no'' on the \nRepublican effort to roll back the joint-employer rule that the Obama \nadministration promulgated. This joint-employer rule is an attack on \nworkers, and it is an attack on franchisee businesses.\n  For people watching, Mr. Speaker, understand that when a franchisor, \nthe big headquarters, tells a franchisee, ``You have got to do every \nsingle thing we tell you. You basically work for us. We are going to \ntell you the size of the sandwich. We are going to tell you the kind of \noil to use. We are going to tell you how to schedule your workers. We \nare going to, basically, control your enterprise, though you are \nsupposed to be an independent business,'' the Obama administration \nsaid, ``We are going to treat you as if you are joint employers.'' So \nif there is wage theft or there is unfairness on the job or some \nproblem that comes up with workers, then the big company, the \nheadquarters, will also be held responsible for solving the problem.\n\n  What the Republicans do today, Mr. Speaker, is say: ``No, we might \nimpose all these conditions on you per the franchisee agreement, but, \nif there are problems, it is going to be your problem, franchisee.''\n  This is absolutely unfair. As workers are going all over this country \ntrying to get higher wages, this is a whole movement for them to get \nlivable wage for people who work every single day at our fast-food \nchains. They are going to their local franchisee owners to ask for \nthose wages.\n  But if the franchisor says: ``You can't pay any more than this. We \nare going to restrict you in multiple number of ways. We are going to \nmake you sell food items at a cost that you can't even sustain, like \nthe dollar menu''--those things cost more than a dollar, folks. But if \nthe big headquarters says you have got to charge a dollar as a \npromotion, then the franchisee has to eat that.\n  But when workers need more money, the big company makes that \nimpossible, and then workers are left holding the bag along with the \nfranchisee.\n  The joint-employer rule, holding both sides responsible for those \nwage thefts to pay for hours, these things make a more fair process and \nrequire the big headquarters to take responsibility as well.\n  I urge a ``no'' vote on this. This is an antiworker bill. This is an \nanti-small business bill, which is somewhat surprising to me, given \nthat my friends on the other side of the aisle say they are for small \nbusiness, but, really, they are just for big business.

Currently, under the FLSA, employers cannot \n     hide behind labor contractors or franchisees when they set \n     conditions of employment. H.R. 3441 strips nearly a century \n     of workforce protections to give large employers almost \n     unfettered ability to hide from long established employer \n     responsibilities.\n       The rise in temporary or precarious work in the United \n     States is fast becoming an unfortunate norm in the economy. A \n     recent study on the rise of temporary employment found the \n     proportion of American workers engaged in ``alternative \n     work'' jumped from 10.7% to 15.8% in the last decade. When in \n     the last decade 94% of net job growth is in the alternative \n     work category, workers continuously find themselves unable to \n     seek remedy for their grievances or an ability to \n     collectively hold their ultimate employer accountable. H.R. \n     3441 will accelerate the growth of job-instability as \n     employers will be able to manipulate the system to avoid \n     collective bargaining by hiring temporary employees or \n     contractor employees.\n       Congress' responsibility to American workers in this time \n     of rising income inequality and precarious work must be to \n     improve access to collective bargaining and stop employer \n     circumvention of U.S. labor laws, not to weaken them. H.R. \n     3441 strips workers of another tool to hold their employers \n     accountable. A vote for this legislation is a vote against \n     working people and the right to democratic representation in \n     the workplace. I urge you to vote no on H.R. 3441.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Leo W.

This legislation will not \n     benefit honest small businesses that create good jobs with \n     family-sustaining wages and benefits. It will actually place \n     such employers at a permanent competitive disadvantage to \n     unscrupulous companies that seek to thrive solely at the \n     expense of their workers and taxpayer-funded social safety-\n     net programs.\n       SWACCA is a national alliance of wall and ceiling \n     contractors committed to working in partnership with our \n     workers and our customers to provide the highest-quality, \n     most efficient construction services. Through the superior \n     training, skill, and efficiency of our workers SWACCA \n     contractors are able to provide both cost-effective \n     construction services and middle class jobs with health and \n     retirement benefits. Our organization prides itself on \n     representing companies that accept responsibility for paying \n     fair wages, abiding by health and safety standards, workers \n     compensation laws, and unemployment insurance requirements.\n       Unfortunately, however, we increasingly find ourselves \n     bidding against companies that seek to compete solely on the \n     basis of labor costs. They do so by relieving themselves of \n     the traditional obligations associated with being an \n     employer. The news is littered with examples of contractors \n     who have sought to reduce costs by willfully violating the \n     laws governing minimum wage, overtime, workers compensation \n     unemployment insurance, and workplace safety protections. The \n     key to this disturbing business model is a cadre of labor \n     brokers who claim to provide a company with an entire \n     workforce that follows them to job after job. It is a \n     workforce that the actual wall or ceiling contractor controls \n     as a practical matter, but for which it takes no legal \n     responsibility. In this model workers receive no benefits, \n     are rarely covered by workers compensation or unemployment \n     insurance, and are frequently not paid in compliance with \n     federal and state wage laws. The joint employment doctrine is \n     an important means for forcing these unscrupulous contractors \n     to compete on a level playing field and to be held \n     accountable for the unlawful treatment of the workers they \n     utilize.\n       As an association representing large, medium, and small \n     businesses, we oppose H.R. 3441 because it proposes a \n     radical, unprecedented re-definition of joint employment \n     under both the FLSA and the NLRA that goes far beyond \n     reversing the standard articulated by the NLRB in Browning-\n     Ferris or retuning to any concept of joint employment that \n     has ever existed under the FLSA since the Act's passage. H.R. \n     3441's radical and unprecedented redefinition of joint \n     employment would proliferate the use of fly-by-night labor \n     brokers by ensuring that no contractor using a workforce \n     provided by a labor broker would ever be deemed a joint \n     employer. This is because the bill precludes a finding of \n     joint employment unless a company controls each ``of the \n     essential terms\n\n\n     and conditions of employment (including hiring employees, \n     discharging employee, determining individual employee rates \n     of pay and benefits, day-to-day supervision of employees, \n     assigning individual work schedules, positions and tasks, and \n     administering employee discipline)''. H.R. 3441 goes further \n     by expressly countenancing a company using labor brokers \n     retaining control of the essential aspects of the workers' \n     employment in a ``limited and routine manner'' without facing \n     any risk of being a joint employer.\n       Simply put, H.R. 3441 would create a standard that would \n     surely accelerate a race to the bottom in the construction \n     industry and many other sectors of the economy. It would \n     further tilt the field of competition against honest, ethical \n     businesses. Any concerns about the prior administration's \n     recently-rescinded interpretative guidance on joint \n     employment under the FLSA or the NLRB's joint employment \n     doctrine enunciated in Browning-Ferris can be addressed in a \n     far more responsible manner. Make no mistake, H.R. 3441 does \n     not return the law to any prior precedents or standards. It \n     creates a radical, new standard. This standard will help \n     unethical employers get rich not be creating more value, but \n     instead by ensuring their ability to treat American workers \n     as a permanent pool of low-wage, subcontracted labor that has \n     neither benefits nor any meaningful recourse against them \n     under our nation's labor and employment laws.\n       On behalf of the membership of SWACCA, thank you in advance \n     for your attention to our concerns about this legislation. \n     Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any \n     questions or require additional information.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Timothy J.

They blocked an amendment to prohibit the \nrepeal of DACA.\n  You know, I mean, 800,000 people's lives now are in the balance \nbecause of Donald Trump rescinding the protection for these DREAMers, \nand he said: Congress, you do it. You fix it.\n  Well, we tried to bring an amendment to the floor to have a debate \nand fix it, and if my Republican friends don't want to vote for it, \nthey can vote ``no.'' But they blocked it. They blocked an amendment to \nbar funds from being spent on this stupid, idiotic wall that the \nPresident seems enamored with along our border. They blocked an \namendment to increase funding to fight rural domestic violence and \nchild abuse. They blocked several amendments to ensure the Trump family \ndoesn't profit off the Presidency, and we all know that they are, but \nwe can't even have that debate.\n  They blocked an amendment to protect asylum seekers and human \ntrafficking victims, and they blocked an amendment to ensure victims of \nincest can have access to abortion care. I can go on and on and on. I \nmean, they blocked Congressman Grothman's budget amendment twice. He is \na Republican. It was germane. He even testified before the Rules \nCommittee, but you blocked it.\n  Last week, you blocked Representative Jimmy Duncan's amendment to \nallow doctors to practice medicine out of State on a volunteer basis. \nGermane. It may be a good idea. It deserves to be debated. You blocked \nit.\n  Is that a poison pill? Is that what the gentleman was referring to? \nYou know, process matters, and it matters for this reason, because when \nyou have a lousy process, you end up with a lousy product.\n  I know it is not sexy to talk about process, you know, but it is \nimportant. It is important that we do our jobs, we debate these issues, \nand that we listen to Democrats and Republicans, you know, come before \nus with ideas: some we may agree with, some we may not, but let's have \nthat debate.

Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, we are bringing to the floor two bills today that I \nthink are bad bills. But, nonetheless, they represent the thinking of \nthe Republicans who are in charge of this Congress.\n  What is particularly distressing to me is that, on one of those \nmeasures, it is being brought to the floor under a completely closed \nprocess.\n  As I mentioned, last night, the ranking member of the Education and \nthe Workforce Committee came before the Rules Committee to offer three \ngermane amendments, and the Rules Committee said: No, you don't have \nthe right to have a debate on your ideas, even though they are \nperfectly germane, on the House floor.\n  I think that is lousy. As a result, we come today and we make \nhistory. This is now officially the most closed Congress ever in the \nhistory of our country. My friends on the other side of the aisle are \ngetting up and talking about how proud they are. They talk about \nbipartisanship. What they don't tell you is that most of the \nbipartisanship are on things that really don't mean a lot: naming of \npost offices and bills that pass by 435-0. On big things, on important \nissues, they block us. I mentioned some of the things they blocked.\n  I know a lot of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle care deeply \nabout the DREAMers, since Donald Trump decided to throw their fates \ninto the balance. They want to do something to help these young people, \nmany of whom came when they were 1 year old or 2 years old and know no \nother country as their home but this country. We tried to fix that \nlegislatively, as the President said he wanted us to do, and the \nRepublican majority blocked us. They blocked us.\n  We tried to offer an amendment again to say let's not invest a \ngazillion dollars on a border wall. Let's invest in our people. Let's \nbuild up our infrastructure. Let's construct the finest railway system \nin the United States--in the world--over the next decade. They blocked \nus.\n  We had an amendment to increase funding to fight rural domestic \nviolence and child abuse, and they blocked us.\n  We had an amendment to say we need to ensure that this culture of \ncorruption that we see in the White House doesn't grow any bigger, that \nthe Trump family doesn't benefit from the taxpayers, they don't benefit \nfinancially from the taxpayers, and we were blocked on that as well.\n  Then we have been blocked on amendments to debate these wars that \nhave gone on for years and years. The war in Afghanistan is endless. It \nis the longest war in American history. We can't have a debate on the \nfloor. We are\n\n\ntold that it is not appropriate and that it is not the right time.\n  The bottom line is, what my friends on the other side of the aisle \nare doing is they are running this place in a very authoritarian way, \nbasically saying: It is our way, and that is it. It is our way or the \nhighway, and you don't matter.\n  Well, we have had enough. We have had enough of being shut out, and \nwe are not going to shut up. We are not going to sit by and allow this \npattern of closed rules and closed processes to continue without a \nprotest. This is a serious matter.\n  For the Speaker of the House in his press conference today to get up \nand say, ``Oh, we have a very open house,'' I mean, where is he living?\n  That does not reflect the reality. Maybe Donald Trump can say those \nkind of things that don't reflect reality, but the Speaker of the House \nought to know that today, under his leadership, this has become the \nmost closed House ever, and it diminishes this institution and it \ndiminishes every single Member of this institution.\n  So vote ``no'' on this rule. I urge my Republican friends, who care \nabout process, who want this place to be more deliberative, to vote \n``no.'' Send a message to your leadership that you have had enough.\n  If you want more bipartisan legislation, if you want a less polarized \nCongress, then open the process up a little bit. I have news for you, \nif you do, maybe the popularity of Congress will go up a little bit. I \nthink we are at, like, 12 or 13 percent now. Maybe that might get you \nup to 15 or 16 percent. But it is the right thing to do.\n  This is not the way we are supposed to run a legislative body. When \nyou do it this way, you end up with lousy legislation. Your healthcare \nbill was a disaster. It reflected no input from anybody. Thank God the \nSenate said no to it. We see the same thing going on with the tax bill.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the previous \nquestion so maybe we can bring up a little bit of a debate on the need \nfor a select committee to study gun violence. But, please, vote ``no'' \non this. Please send a message to the Republican leadership that enough \nis enough and we are tired of these closed rules.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.", "turn": 28, "speaker": "Mr. McGOVERN", "itemno": 33}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

We don't really have any \nrules in the Rules Committee because we want to have it so open, we \nwant to give everybody such an opportunity, that we let everybody come \nand say whatever they want. Then we take it all into account and we \nmake some amendments in order and some not.\n  Because we have done our job so well this year, we have had so many \nbills in the House--and the House has passed them all--that this House \nis just about a record-breaking House in terms of what we are passing. \nYes, our friends over in the Senate haven't passed a lot of them. I \ndon't think the American people like that. I think the American people \nwant the Senate to get to work like the House has been at work.\n  This is important work, and we are here to do it and not play games. \nThe bills that are under this rule are very important bills.\n  I have heard a lot about climate change.

I do understand from \nthe people who are worried about it, and a lot of people are \nlegitimately worried about it. The only thing you can do about that is \nto have alternative sources of energy.\n  Hydroenergy is one of those sources. You don't release any carbon \nmolecules in the air when you generate electricity using water. So one \nof the bills addresses that.\n  The other bill--my bill--the Save the Local Business Act, is a very \nimportant bill, a bipartisan bill. There are bipartisan sponsors on \nthis bill.

It is a \n     vote about what the House should be debating.\n       Mr. Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of \n     Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the \n     previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or \n     control the consideration of the subject before the House \n     being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous \n     question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the \n     subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling \n     of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the \n     House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes \n     the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to \n     offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the \n     majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated \n     the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to \n     a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to \n     recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (R-Illinois) said: \n     ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman \n     from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to \n     yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first \n     recognition.''\n       The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous \n     question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an \n     immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no \n     substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.'' \n     But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the \n     Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in \n     the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition, \n     page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the previous \n     question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is generally \n     not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member \n     controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of \n     offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by \n     voting down the previous question on the rule. . . . When the \n     motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the \n     time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering \n     the previous question. That Member, because he then controls \n     the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for \n     the purpose of amendment.''\n       In Deschler's Procedure in the U.S. House of \n     Representatives, the subchapter titled\n\n\n     ``Amending Special Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the \n     previous question on such a rule [a special rule reported \n     from the Committee on Rules] opens the resolution to \n     amendment and further debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) \n     Section 21.3 continues: ``Upon rejection of the motion for \n     the previous question on a resolution reported from the \n     Committee on Rules, control shifts to the Member leading the \n     opposition to the previous question, who may offer a proper \n     amendment or motion and who controls the time for debate \n     thereon.''\n       Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does \n     have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only \n     available tools for those who oppose the Republican \n     majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the \n     opportunity to offer an alternative plan.\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 37}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "B001289", "text": "  Mr. BYRNE.
