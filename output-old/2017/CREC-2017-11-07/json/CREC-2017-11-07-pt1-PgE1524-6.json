Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Conrady \nJunior High School for receiving the prestigious 2017 U.S. Department \nof Education National Blue Ribbon School Award. The school's award was \nconferred under the Exemplary High Performing Schools category.\n\n\n  In 1982, the U.S. Department of Education established the National \nBlue Ribbon Schools Program to recognize public and private schools \nwith high or significantly improved achievement. I am proud that \nConrady Junior High School, located in Hickory Hills, has been honored \nas an exceptional school.\n  The teachers and staff at Conrady Junior High take great care to \nfocus on the needs of individual students, and this hard work is \nreflected in the school's academic performance. The school employs a \nunique curriculum with variable length math periods based on student \nneed, and daily periods of exploratory and intervention classes.\n  This is not the first time Conrady Junior High has been honored for \nexcellence in education. The school was designated as a National Title \nI Distinguished School in 2014, which recognizes success in educating \nstudents who come from families with low socioeconomic status. As \nPrincipal Andy Anderson often says, ``Conrady is a hard place to work, \nbut a great place to work.''\n  The Positive Behavior Interventions and Supports (PBIS) program and \nthe Academic Student Success Enrichment Teams (ASSETS) developed by \nteachers and administrators have also had a positive impact on student \nachievement. This success has resulted in visits by teachers and \nadministrators from other schools seeking to learn about their \ncurriculum, methodology, and technology integration.\n  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating Conrady \nJunior High School for this impressive achievement and recognizing the \nteachers, administrators, students, parents, and community for the hard \nwork that they have put in to earn this award.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. LIPINSKI", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 3}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "181", "extension": true, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "E1524-E1525", "wkday": "Tuesday", "day": "7", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "HONORING CONRADY JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL FOR BEING NAMED A NATIONAL BLUE RIBBON SCHOOL", "id": "CREC-2017-11-07-pt1-PgE1524-6", "title": "HONORING CONRADY JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL FOR BEING NAMED A NATIONAL BLUE  RIBBON SCHOOL"}
