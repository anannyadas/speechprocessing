Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and legacy of \nSergeant First Class Jeremiah Johnson, who was killed in action on \nWednesday, October 4, 2017 while defending our nation as part of the \n3rd Special Forces Group in Africa. SFC Johnson was a true American \nhero and our thoughts and prayers go out to his friends and family as \nthey mourn the loss of this great man.\n  Enlisting in the United States Army in October of 2007, SFC Johnson's \nlist of accomplishments runs long. He received numerous medals, \nincluding the Purple Heart and Meritorious Service Medal.\n  Men and women like SFC Johnson represent the best our nation has to \noffer. As a Chemical, Biological Radiological and Nuclear Specialist, \nhe had undergone some of the most specialized training in our military \nand emerged as a leader and role model. His selflessness allows us to \nenjoy the blessings of liberty that have persevered for well over 200 \nyears. When his country needed him most, he stood ready to answer the \ncall to serve our great nation.\n  Leaving behind a wife and two girls, our country can never repay the \ndebt we owe to SFC Johnson. He was a model citizen and soldier whose \nlegacy will live on forever. He will always be remembered and I will do \neverything in my power to honor his sacrifice.\n  Mr. Speaker, please join me today in commemorating the life of \nSergeant First Class Jeremiah Johnson for his service to God and \ncountry.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. HUDSON", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 3}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "181", "extension": true, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "E1528", "wkday": "Tuesday", "day": "7", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "IN MEMORY OF SERGEANT FIRST CLASS JEREMIAH JOHNSON", "id": "CREC-2017-11-07-pt1-PgE1528-5", "title": "IN MEMORY OF SERGEANT FIRST CLASS JEREMIAH JOHNSON"}
