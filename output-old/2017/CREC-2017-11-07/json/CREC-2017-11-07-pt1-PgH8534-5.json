Mr. Speaker, today, I come to the people's House floor \nin strong opposition to the Ryan-McConnell billionaires-first tax plan, \na plan that overwhelmingly benefits the superrich and well-connected, \nand scams the middle class and our most vulnerable Americans.\n  But don't just take it from me. According to the Institute on \nTaxation and Economic Policy, working families in my home State of Ohio \nwould see their taxes increase by $1,000 per year, while the wealthiest \nAmericans, people like President Trump, would see their taxes decrease \nby as much as $747,000, according to the Tax Policy Center.\n  Not to be overshadowed, the Tax Policy Center also concluded that \nnearly 80 percent of the bill's benefits pad the pockets of the \nwealthiest Americans. At the same time, it eliminates the medical \nexpenses deduction, student loan deduction, and the new markets tax \ncredit. That does not seem like fair taxes to me.\n  Instead of raising taxes on the middle class, what we should be doing \nis allowing for a better future, better opportunities, better jobs, and \nbetter wages for all Americans.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mrs. BEATTY", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "181", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H8534", "wkday": "Tuesday", "day": "7", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "OPPOSING RYAN-McCONNELL TAX PLAN", "id": "CREC-2017-11-07-pt1-PgH8534-5", "title": null}
