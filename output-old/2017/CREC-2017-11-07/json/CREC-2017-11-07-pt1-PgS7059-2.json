Mr. President, I would like to pay tribute to \nRonnie Lupe, a foreign war veteran and current chairman of the White \nMountain Apache Tribe in Arizona. Chairman Lupe will be retiring next \nyear following 50 years of distinguished public service to his Tribe.\n  Ronnie also honorably served his Nation overseas in Korea. As a young \nman, he journeyed far from his hometown of Cibecue to enlist in the \nU.S. Marine Corps. He soon found himself across the Pacific and \nentrenched in combat. Thankfully, Ronnie returned home safely to his \nfamily and friends.\n  Ronnie first joined the Tribal council in 1996. Since then, he has \nserved as chairman of the council for a remarkable nine terms. I have \nenjoyed working closely with Chairman Lupe over the years. Ronnie is a \ntireless advocate for the principles of Tribal self-governance and \nIndian self-determination. He led efforts to resolve the Tribe's water \nrights claims and developed a reservation-wide system for clean \ndrinking water.\n  Ronnie was also a pioneer in Federal Indian policy concerning \nwildlife conservation, expanding Tribal control over reservation land, \nits forest, and natural resources. He oversaw the Tribe's response and \nrecovery in the Rodeo-Chediski Fire in 2002 and the Wallow Fire in \n2011--the two worst wildfires in Arizona history. As chairman, he \nlabored to build and nurture Tribal enterprises like Hon Dah Casino and \nSunrise Park Resort, which today are hubs of tourism and recreation in \nthe White Mountains of Arizona.\n  Chairman Ronnie Lupe is a celebrated Tribal leader who brought about \ntransformative and lasting changes to the people of the White Mountain \nApache Tribe. I am proud to call him my friend. I thank him for his \nservice.\n\n\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. McCAIN", "itemno": 0}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 1}], "header": {"chamber": "Senate", "num": "181", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "S7059-S7060", "wkday": "Tuesday", "day": "7", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "TRIBUTE TO RONNIE LUPE", "id": "CREC-2017-11-07-pt1-PgS7059-2", "title": "TRIBUTE TO RONNIE LUPE"}
