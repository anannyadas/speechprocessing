Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of Dr. Billy \nGraham, a revered national treasure, who celebrates his 99th birthday \ntoday.\n  The world honors Dr. Graham's birthday because of a decision he made \n83 years ago. On November 1, 1934, at a Mordecai Ham tent revival in \nCharlotte, North Carolina, young Billy Graham accepted Jesus as his \npersonal Savior and committed his life to telling others about Jesus' \nlove and forgiveness. God used that decision to impact countless lives \naround the world.\n  While Presidents have sought his counsel over many decades and \nmillions have gone forward to accept Jesus Christ at his meetings, Dr. \nGraham is remembered most for honoring and following his Lord and \nmaster.\n  On a personal note, I first met Dr. Graham back in 1971 when I served \nas his caddy at the Byron Nelson Pro-Am, playing with Byron Nelson, Bob \nHope, and Arnold Palmer. That was a fun time, but I have admired his \nwalk with Jesus ever since.\n  Happy birthday, Dr. Graham.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. PITTENGER", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "181", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H8533", "wkday": "Tuesday", "day": "7", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "HONORING DR.
