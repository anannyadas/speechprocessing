Mr. Speaker, on Saturday, the Nation \ncelebrates Veterans Day. Originally called Armistice Day, November 11, \n1919, marked the end of World War I.\n  In 1926, Congress passed a resolution for an annual observance, and \nNovember 11 became a national holiday in 1938. In 1954, the holiday was \nrenamed Veterans Day.\n  Mr. Speaker, we all want to thank our veterans for their service to \nthis Nation, and there is no better way to do so than to care for them \nwhen they return home. That is why I encourage my colleagues to support \nthe Veterans E-Health and Telemedicine Support Act, or the VETS Act.\n  This bill will be on the floor this afternoon, and it will allow VA \nhealth professionals to practice telemedicine across State borders to \ncare for more of America's veterans. This Nation has the technology \navailable today to provide care for our veterans, no matter where they \nreside. This bill upholds our promise to be there for our veterans.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the VETS Act and work to \ngive our veterans access to the best care possible, no matter where \nthey are or where they live.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "181", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H8534", "wkday": "Tuesday", "day": "7", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "SUPPORT VETERANS", "id": "CREC-2017-11-07-pt1-PgH8534-2", "title": "SUPPORT VETERANS"}
