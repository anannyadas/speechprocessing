Mr. Speaker, what happens if Congress goes nuts on tax \ncuts without paying for them?\n  Kansas, which did just that, has now had to raise State taxes back to \nwhere they were, providing a valuable object lesson for Congress right \nnow: tax cuts about ideology, not economics, do not work.\n  Yet Republicans seem to be taking a page out of the Kansas tax cuts, \nauthored by Governor Sam Brownback, that crushed that State's economy.\n  He promised tens of thousands of jobs to fund the State's schools. He \nguaranteed a progrowth economy that would pay for the tax cuts and then \nsome.\n  Kansas did grow initially, but then lagged behind all the rest of the \nStates. Now Brownback's tax cuts have produced new taxes for Kansas.\n  Let's learn from Kansas, not become Kansas 2.0.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Ms. NORTON", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "181", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H8582-H8583", "wkday": "Tuesday", "day": "7", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "LET'S LEARN FROM KANSAS, NOT BECOME KANSAS 2.0", "id": "CREC-2017-11-07-pt1-PgH8582-7", "title": "LET'S LEARN FROM KANSAS, NOT BECOME KANSAS 2.0"}
