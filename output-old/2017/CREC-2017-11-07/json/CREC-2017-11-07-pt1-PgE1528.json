Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate McClure \nJunior High School in Western Springs for receiving the prestigious \n2017 U.S. Department of Education National Blue Ribbon School Award. \nMcClure Junior High was recognized under the Exemplary High Performing \nSchools category.\n  In 1982, the Department of Education established the National Blue \nRibbon Schools Program to recognize a select group of public and \nprivate schools with high or significantly improved achievement. I am \nproud that McClure has been honored as one of those exceptional \nschools.\n  McClure's mission statement is ``Be respectful, be responsible, and \nbe safe.'' Principal F. Daniel Chick, his hard-working staff, and the \nschool's exceptional teachers do a fantastic job perpetuating this \nmotto by encouraging students to help one another and build a \nfoundation of respect throughout the school community. After winning a \nNational Blue Ribbon School award in 2010, the staff at McClure and in \nDistrict 101 continued to strive for success by developing a \nProfessional Learning Roadmap and undertaking a thorough strategic \nplanning process.\n  McClure has promoted student ownership of their education as well as \nvarious other programs to enrich students' lives and provide for a \nbetter school experience. A great partnership with parents has also \nplayed an essential role in the school's success. Parent-run \norganizations such as the Parent Council and the Spirit Club raise \nfunds that directly impact the lives of McClure students. I commend the \nschool for going above and beyond with their offerings for students and \nI hope that other schools will use them as an outstanding example to \nfollow.\n  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing McClure \nJunior High School for this significant achievement and congratulating \nthe teachers, administrators, parents, students and community on a job \nwell done.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. LIPINSKI", "itemno": 4}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 5}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "181", "extension": true, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "E1528", "wkday": "Tuesday", "day": "7", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "HONORING McCLURE JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL FOR BEING NAMED A NATIONAL BLUE RIBBON SCHOOL", "id": "CREC-2017-11-07-pt1-PgE1528", "title": null}
