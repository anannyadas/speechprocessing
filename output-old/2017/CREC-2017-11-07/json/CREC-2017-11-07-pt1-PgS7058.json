Mr. President, today we solemnly mark the 85th \nanniversary of the Holodomor--the Ukrainian famine genocide--that \nclaimed the lives of millions in the 1930s. As part of its vicious \ncrusade promoting a failed ideology, the Soviet Union perpetrated a \nforced starvation campaign against ethnic Ukrainians, hoping to erase \ntheir place in history and their cries for freedom and independence. We \nmust never forget these crimes against humanity. Ukraine today faces a \ndifferent kind of threat from its neighbor Russia's ongoing occupation \nof its land and aggression towards its people. We must recall the \nlessons from history and remain united in solidarity with our \ndemocratic friends and allies and all those who pursue freedom and \njustice. I am proud to represent a strong, engaged, and vibrant \nUkrainian community in New Jersey, and I commend your efforts to \ncontinue to bring to light injustices of the past and efforts to \npromote a brighter future.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. MENENDEZ", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "Senate", "num": "181", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "S7058", "wkday": "Tuesday", "day": "7", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "85TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE HOLODOMOR", "id": "CREC-2017-11-07-pt1-PgS7058", "title": null}
