Mr. Speaker, congratulations to \nAmbassador Nikki Haley, the former Governor of South Carolina, for \nleadership opposing a misguided U.N. resolution calling for the U.S. to \nlift the Cuban embargo. This was a resolution the Obama administration \nhas shamefully abstained from voting on.\n  Rather than bow down to the Cuban Communist dictatorship, Ambassador \nHaley stood up to them and stood up for the oppressed people of Cuba.\n  Ambassador Haley correctly reviewed: ``The United States opposes this \nresolution today in continued solidarity with the Cuban people and in \nthe hope that they will one day be free to choose their own destiny.''\n  The economic catastrophe of Cuba is due to the Communist, \ntotalitarian dictatorship, not the American embargo. As cited by the \nlate Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher: socialism will work until you \nrun out of spending other people's money.\n  Ambassador Haley's service has ushered in a new era of moral clarity. \nThe United States is again a leader for expanded freedom. President \nDonald Trump's commitment to peace through strength is going to make \nthe world safer for American families, along with Vice President Mike \nPence, who is here in the Capitol Building today.\n  In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget \nSeptember the 11th in the global war on terrorism.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. WILSON of South Carolina", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "181", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H8533", "wkday": "Tuesday", "day": "7", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "AMBASSADOR HALEY SPEAKS TRUTH", "id": "CREC-2017-11-07-pt1-PgH8533-2", "title": "AMBASSADOR HALEY SPEAKS TRUTH"}
