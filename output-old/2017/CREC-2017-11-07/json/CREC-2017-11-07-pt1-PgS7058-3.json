Mr. President, today, I wish to recognize Eden \nElementary School of Greenfield, IN, for being named a 2017 National \nBlue Ribbon School by the U.S. Department of Education.\n  Established in 1982, the National Blue Ribbon Schools Program \nrecognizes schools that have demonstrated a vision of educational \nexcellence for all students, regardless of their social or economic \nbackground. Since its inception, this program has allowed schools in \nevery State to gain recognition for educational accomplishments, \nparticularly in closing the achievement gaps among students.\n  Eden Elementary School has continually distinguished itself as a top-\nperforming school in Indiana. For the last 4 years, Eden Elementary has \nbeen named a Four Star School and named an A-rated school by the \nIndiana Department of Education for 6 consecutive years.\n  Eden Elementary attributes much of its success to its effective \nimplementation of the professional learning community model. Teachers \nare encouraged to focus on higher order thinking, integrating \ntechnology, and collaboration with math and reading instructional \ncoaches. This model also allows teachers to work on targeted areas to \nimprove an individual student's performance, which is contributing to \nthe academic success of students. In addition, this interactive model \nenables teachers to share resources and ask questions to ensure the \ncurriculum is being met across grade levels.\n  Beyond strong academics, Eden Elementary also prides itself on its \ncharacter education program. This starts with Eden's Eagle \nExpectations--three rules: students should be respectful, responsible, \nand ready to learn. The school also promotes healthy habits by \ninstilling in students the importance of considering the needs of \nothers, listening first, and working together.\n  I am proud to recognize previous Eden Elementary School principal \nDevon Marine and current principal Melia Hammons, the entire staff, the \nstudent body, and their families. The effort and dedication you put \ninto the education of these young people have led not only to this \nprestigious recognition but will benefit you and the Greenfield \ncommunity well into the future.\n  On behalf of the citizens of Indiana, I congratulate Eden Elementary, \nand I wish the students and staff continued success in the future.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. DONNELLY", "itemno": 0}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 1}], "header": {"chamber": "Senate", "num": "181", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "S7058", "wkday": "Tuesday", "day": "7", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "RECOGNIZING EDEN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL", "id": "CREC-2017-11-07-pt1-PgS7058-3", "title": "RECOGNIZING EDEN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL"}
