Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commend President Trump for \nhis attention to the opioid epidemic sweeping over our great Nation and \nhis declaration of a public health emergency.\n  As we work to address this epidemic, I was happy to welcome Richard \nBaum, the acting director of the Office of National Drug Control \nPolicy, to Cecil County in Maryland's First Congressional District 10 \ndays ago for their Prescription Drug Take Back Day. My home State of \nMaryland has been hit particularly hard by the opioid crisis. Last \nyear, 89 percent of all intoxication deaths in Maryland were linked to \nopioid abuse, and the frequency of opioid-related deaths quadrupled \nover the last 7 years.\n  But despite these frightening statistics, State and Federal lawmakers\n\n\nacross the country are still pushing to legalize recreational \nmarijuana. Marijuana use increases the risk of cancer, hinders brain \ndevelopment in adolescents and young adults, and encourages \nexperimentation with even more dangerous drugs, including opioids.\n  Mr. Speaker, with the opioid crisis our Nation is currently fighting, \nwhy on Earth should we increase access to an addictive gateway drug?\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. HARRIS", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 3}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "181", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H8533-H8534", "wkday": "Tuesday", "day": "7", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "OPIOID CRISIS", "id": "CREC-2017-11-07-pt1-PgH8533-6", "title": null}
