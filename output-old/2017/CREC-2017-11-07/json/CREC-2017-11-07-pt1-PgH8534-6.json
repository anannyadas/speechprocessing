Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remember the life and \ncontributions of Judge Robert Lee Byrd, Jr.\n  Judge Byrd was born in Birmingham in 1932. He received his bachelor's \ndegree from Vanderbilt University in 1954, before attending the \nUniversity of Alabama School of Law.\n  He was in private practice in Mobile for over 20 years and was later \nappointed circuit judge in Mobile County. Judge Byrd was a dedicated \nmember of the Mobile community. During my time as an attorney in \nMobile, I had the privilege of practicing in his court where he \nconducted himself with immense dignity and professionalism. Judge Byrd \nrecently passed away, but his impact will live on.\n  Mr. Speaker, on behalf of the Alabama's First Congressional District, \nI want to share my deepest sympathies with his wife, Mary, and his \nthree daughters. Judge Byrd will never be forgotten.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. BYRNE", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "181", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H8534", "wkday": "Tuesday", "day": "7", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "REMEMBERING THE LIFE AND CONTRIBUTIONS OF JUDGE ROBERT LEE BYRD, JR.", "id": "CREC-2017-11-07-pt1-PgH8534-6", "title": "REMEMBERING THE LIFE AND CONTRIBUTIONS OF JUDGE ROBERT LEE BYRD, JR."}
