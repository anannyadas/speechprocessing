Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of November as \nNational Adoption Month in honor of the 111,000 children waiting to be \nadopted from the foster care system.\n  As a co-chair of the Congressional Foster Youth Caucus, I strongly \nbelieve that every child deserves a forever family. The love and \nstability that a family provides leads to far better outcomes for youth \nof all ages, and we must work to ensure that we have this support \nsystem.\n  But adoption does take a toll on families, both financially and \nemotionally. They need assistance, and the adoption tax credit provides \nthem with up to $13,570 in tax refunds for adoption expenses. I am \ntruly disturbed, Mr. Speaker, that Republicans have introduced a tax \nbill that would eliminate the adoption tax credit.\n  During National Adoption Month, I call on my colleagues to support \nadopted children and families by rejecting this misguided measure.\n  Mr. Speaker, we need to make sure that adoptions are affordable, that \nthey are possible, and that, long-term, they are successful, and the \nadoption tax credit does exactly that.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. LANGEVIN", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "181", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H8582", "wkday": "Tuesday", "day": "7", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "NATIONAL ADOPTION MONTH", "id": "CREC-2017-11-07-pt1-PgH8582-2", "title": "NATIONAL ADOPTION MONTH"}
