For many returning servicemembers, these \nstressors affect one's postdeployment, especially those receiving other \nthan honorable discharges.\n  Under current law, military personnel who separate under this status \nare not eligible for healthcare benefits or general services typically \noffered to honorable or generally discharged veterans through the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs.\n  Mr. Speaker, I want to be clear, I firmly believe that discharge \nstatus is an important tool for military leadership, a tool which helps \npreserve order and discipline among the ranks. Removing the proverbial \nbad apples from the bushel is key to maintaining a cohesive unit \nstructure.\n  However, there also seems to be an evolving trend of soldiers who \nreceive other than honorable discharges as a result of their military \nexperience, rather than simply being a bad or ineffective soldier.\n  In fact, according to the Medal of Honor Society, there are no fewer \nthan eight Medal of Honor recipients who have received other than \nhonorable discharges. H.R. 918, as amended, would provide that those \ncombat veterans who receive other than honorable discharge statuses \nwould be eligible to receive critical mental health assessments and \nservices from the Department of Veterans Affairs. It is only right, Mr. \nSpeaker.\n  Again, I appreciate the hard work and forward thinking of my friend \nfrom Colorado, who is also a veteran, Mr. Coffman.

It is appropriate we are here the week of Veterans Day \nbringing important legislation to the floor once again, a committee \nthat understands our responsibility, is not political or partisan, it \nis to this Nation's veterans in keeping the promise.\n  Mr. Speaker, I do rise in strong support of H.R. 918, as amended, the \nVeteran Urgent Access to Mental Healthcare Act offered by Mr. Coffman.\n  I would also like to take note of the work that Mr. Coffman has done \non many issues. This one, in particular, is near and dear to my heart. \nHis leadership has helped get us to the point where we are making \nprogress on this.\n  As you heard the gentleman from Florida say, the issues that come \nwith service in this Nation's military can be physical injury or they \ncan be the mental injuries of war. We also understand that with that \ncomes changes in behavior, and there are reasons that people are \nremoved from service, and I am incredibly proud that this committee has \ntaken this issue head-on. Of those who are removed because of issues \nthat they started to acquire from their service in uniform, this \nlegislation is going to ensure that those people with less than \nhonorable discharges get the care; specifically, focusing on military \nsexual trauma, the idea that we have warriors in uniform who are \nassaulted, in many cases, by fellow servicemembers, and because of the \ninability to reintegrate in that unit, they are discharged with less \nthan honorable paper, precluding them from getting the services that \nthey have earned.\n  With more than 20 veterans a day--and I think those numbers are \nprobably low--taking their own lives, this issue of making sure that \nall servicemembers and all veterans have access to mental healthcare, \nremoving those barriers, is of prime importance.\n  Secretary Shulkin has made the first step in this. Mr. Coffman has \ncontinued to make sure that this committee stays focused on this, \ncontinuing to add more and more access. For that, this legislation \nensures the initiative becomes permanent.

Mr. Speaker, as we approach Veterans Day, our Nation is \nstill faced with the epidemic of veteran suicide. And while the VA has \nmade it a priority to address this problem, there are still many combat \nveterans left without access to VA mental healthcare services.\n  Here is what we know. An average of 20 veterans commit suicide daily. \nVA evidence suggests a decrease in suicide risk among those who have \nreceived VA healthcare services. In May 2017, the Government \nAccountability Office found that 62 percent of the over \n91,000 servicemembers who were separated for misconduct from 2011 to \n2015 had been diagnosed with PTSD, TBI, or other conditions that would \nbe associated with misconduct.\n\n  Of those veterans, 23 percent, or 13,282, received an other than \nhonorable discharge, leaving them without access to VA's critical \nmental healthcare services.\n  As a Marine Corps combat veteran, I like to live by the rule that we \nnever leave anyone behind. Unfortunately, the military routinely used \nthe other than honorable discharge to rid itself of combat veterans who \nwere designated as having disciplinary problems and who often had \ndocumented medical histories of PTSD, rather than providing them with \nthe treatment and rehabilitation they so desperately needed.\n  While the correlation between their mental health condition and minor \nmisconduct could be linked, this fact made no difference to their \ncharacter of discharge.\n  Mr. Speaker, my legislation, H.R. 918, the Veteran Urgent Access to \nMental Healthcare Act, seeks to correct this. Historically, a veteran \nwith an other than honorable discharge has been able to seek VA care \nfor a service-connected disability. However, due to the way these \ncombat veterans were discharged and because of a failure to connect the \ndots between their minor misconduct and their mental health condition, \nthe Department of Defense has failed to recognize this as a problem.\n  H.R. 918 will stay with tradition and correct this disconnect by \nauthorizing mental healthcare services for these other than honorably \ndischarged combat veterans. This bill also requires an initial mental \nhealth assessment and directs the VA Secretary to establish a formal \ncharacter of service determination process to trigger reviews of their \ndischarges for potential eligibility for VA benefits.\n  Mr. Speaker, before the rate of veteran suicides increases any more, \nit is time to right this wrong and permanently authorize mental \nhealthcare services for some of our Nation's most vulnerable veterans. \nWhen someone puts on the uniform, they take an oath to defend our \nfreedoms. We, in turn, as a nation, promise to make sure they receive \nthe care and the services they need after returning from the \nbattlefield.\n  As we approach Veterans Day, I encourage my colleagues to keep that \npromise for these combat veterans with other than honorable discharges \nand to\n\n\nsupport the passage of H.R. 918.

I think the real number is \nmuch higher than that, but 20 a day, we know for sure, are taking their \nown lives in this country after they have put those same lives on the \nline for this country.\n  Amidst that crisis, we know that those veterans who have an other \nthan honorable discharge are taking their lives at twice the rate of \nthose veterans who have an honorable discharge.\n  Thanks to Mr. Coffman, my colleague from across the aisle, thanks to \nthe bipartisan support of the House Veterans' Affairs Committee, and \nthe leadership from the chairman and the ranking member, we are \nbeginning to address that, in ensuring that the 22,000 veterans who \nhave an other than honorable discharge since 2009, who incurred post-\ntraumatic stress disorder or military sexual trauma while in service to \nthis country will now be able to see mental healthcare providers. \nBefore this, they were precluded from that.\n  I want to thank the Trump administration and especially Secretary \nShulkin for doing the most that they could administratively to see \nthese veterans in crisis in emergency rooms, but we need to take the \nnext step and ensure that they have preventative care, continuous care, \nand continuity in that care going forward so that we save more of these \nlives.\n  Given what these veterans have laid down for this country, what they \nhave done for the United States, making us stronger and better, serving \nat less than 1 percent since 9/11 so that so many others do not have to \nserve, the least we can do is to make sure that they have access to the \ncare that they have earned.\n  I want to thank Mr. Coffman and his team, the minority and the \nmajority staffs for incorporating the best ideas from both sides of the \naisle to make sure that we have a bill that will become law that \nensures that we do our best for our veterans.\n  Mr. Speaker, I also want to thank our colleagues on the other side of \nthe Capitol, in the Senate, especially Senator Murphy, who worked on \nthe companion legislation of this, to make sure that we have something \nto bring to the President's desk.", "turn": 9, "speaker": "Mr. O'ROURKE", "itemno": 19}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "B001257", "text": "  Mr. BILIRAKIS.

Our country owes them a debt of \ngratitude, something we are often reminded of every year around this \ntime as we head into Veterans Day.\n  Unfortunately, too often, our fellow servicemembers are coming home \nand they are being prevented from receiving the care that they have \nearned through their service.

This legislation is bipartisan and would \nrequire the VA to provide urgent mental healthcare services, including \nan initial mental health assessment to veterans who have participated \nin combat operations or who have survived sexual assault or harassment.\n  It would also expand those services to those who received a discharge \nunder certain other than honorable conditions who haven't received the \ncharacter of service or discharge determination yet.\n  We have heard already about the high numbers of veterans who fall \ninto this category and about how negatively this discharge has affected \ntheir lives.

It takes away their access to services and benefits that \nthey have earned through, many times, multiple deployments, services \nthat are in place to help set our veterans up for success upon their \nreturn home.\n  In addition, this bill would require the VA to provide services at \nnon-VA facilities for veterans who live in rural or underserved \ncommunities.\n\n\n  I can't state enough how important this is because it affects those \nveterans in my district, and on different islands in the State of \nHawaii, who are separated literally by a body of water from the VA \nclinic.\n  The Veteran Urgent Access to Mental Healthcare Act would also mandate \nthe VA to provide additional information for mental health services for \nveterans and to ensure that they provide annual reports to Congress on \nthose services that they have been providing to our veterans.\n  This is such an important piece of legislation.

He said when that veteran came \nhome, he wasn't quite the same person that he had been. Unfortunately, \nthose challenges led to some substance issues, and then to an other \nthan honorable discharge.\n  As a consequence, as he explained, that veteran was unable to get \nmental healthcare treatment through the Veterans Administration. Here \nwas a veteran, someone who sacrificed for his country, who was unable \nto get the services he earned, due to a condition that he most likely \ndeveloped through that service.\n  Coming back to this Washington, I was honored to cosponsor this bill, \nand I appreciate the work of Representative Coffman, and other \ncolleagues, in advancing this important bill.\n  This bill is simple. It allows veterans discharged in an other than \nhonorable status to be screened for urgent mental health conditions and \nare found to be eligible for treatment.\n  While I appreciate the fact that the VA has voluntarily adopted this \npolicy on its own, we need to make sure that this becomes law to ensure \nthat future administrations help the thousands of veterans who have \nserved our Nation and might otherwise be denied needed treatment.\n\n\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.", "turn": 15, "speaker": "Mr. KILMER", "itemno": 25}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "W000799", "text": "  Mr. WALZ.
