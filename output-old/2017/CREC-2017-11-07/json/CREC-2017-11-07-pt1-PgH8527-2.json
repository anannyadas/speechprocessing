Mr. Speaker, I rise to alert the American people to the \ntax scam that is the Republican tax reform proposal, unveiled last \nweek. It is reported that President Trump wanted to call this bill \n``cut, cut, cut.'' That would have been apropos.\n  The first cut is for him and his family members, the second cut is \nfor his wealthy friends and acquaintances, and the third cut is for \nlarge corporations classified as LLCs. It certainly does not cut taxes \nfor middle-income families or most small businesses. In fact, it does \njust the opposite. It is crystal clear who gets the cuts and who gets \nto pay more.\n  First and foremost, the GOP tax plan eliminates inheritance taxes \nthat only apply to two-tenths of 1 percent of families who wish to pass \nalong their wealth, unearned and untaxed.\n  Why are Republicans doing this? Because it is a huge priority for \nsome of their biggest donors, and the middle-income families will be \nasked to pay for this $172 billion giveaway to the superrich.\n  The GOP pretend not to be cutting taxes for the superrich by \nmaintaining the top rate of 39.6 percent. However, their plan increases \nthe income levels that the 39.6 percent applies to from $470,000 a year \nto $1 million. These proposed rate changes will cost over $1 trillion.\n  The GOP tax plan also features a special rate for the owners of \npassthrough businesses that will cost $448 billion. These are LLCs and \npartnerships that pay zero corporate taxes and whose owners' income is \ntreated the same as everybody else's.\n  LLCs and other types of passthroughs make up 95 percent of all the \nbusinesses in the country. Some of the largest businesses, like Koch \nIndustries, Chrysler, and, of course, most of the entities owned by the \nTrump organization are LLCs.\n  Passthroughs that are truly small businesses are not currently \nsubject to the highest individual rates and already pay 25 percent or \nlower. The National Federation of Independent Businesses opposes this \nprovision for this very reason.\n  Mr. Speaker, most of us, especially those who have worked in State \ngovernments, view our States as the best\n\n\nlaboratories for the development of good ideas and best practices. This \npassthrough idea was the centerpiece of Governor Sam Brownback's tax \noverhaul in Kansas 5 years ago. The Governor promised it would yield \nmassive economic growth.\n  And what happened? Kansas was plunged into a massive budget deficit \nand forced to make draconian cuts to education, infrastructure, and the \nrest of the State's operations. This year, the Kansas Legislature \noverrode Governor Brownback's shortsighted experiment.\n  I urge my colleagues not to make the same mistake here. This scam \nwill subject the good people of this country to a second great \nrecession in a single decade. Middle-income families will pay more \nbecause the GOP plan eliminates deductions for State and local taxes. \nThis includes millions of Americans and over 500,000 South Carolinians.\n  Middle-income families who itemize deductions will pay more because \nthe elimination of the personal exemption will cost their households \n$4,000 per member.\n  Middle-income families who utilize mortgage interest deductions will \npay more because the GOP plan lowers the cap.\n  Middle-income families with children in college, or recent graduates, \nwill pay more because the GOP plan eliminates the deductions for \ninterest on student loans.\n  Middle-income families that are victims of natural disasters will pay \nmore because the GOP plan eliminates the casualty loss deduction.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise to alert the American people to the tax scam that \nis the Republican ``tax reform'' proposal, unveiled last week. It is \nreported that President Trump wanted to call this bill, ``cut, cut, \ncut.'' That would have been apropos. The first cut is for him and his \nfamily members, the second cut is for his wealthy friends and \nacquaintances, and the third cut is for large corporations classified \nas LLCs. It certainly does not cut taxes for middle income families or \nmost small businesses. In fact, it does just the opposite. It is \ncrystal clear who gets the cuts and who gets to pay more.\n  First and foremost, the GOP tax plan eliminates inheritance taxes. \nThis tax only applies to estates of over $11 million and only affects \ntwo tenths of one percent of families in America, those who wish to \npass along their wealth, unearned and untaxed.\n  Why are Republicans doing this? Because it's a huge priority for some \nof their biggest donors. In fact, this cut is not even about the 0.2 \npercent--it's really about two families--the Mercers and the Kochs.\n  The bottom line is that America's hard-working low, moderate and \nmiddle-income families will be asked to pay for this $172 billion \ndollar give away to the super rich.\n  At the heart of this scam is the GOP pretense not to be cutting taxes \nfor the super-rich by maintaining the top rate of 39.6 percent. \nHowever, it increases the income level that the 39.6 percent applies \nto; from $470,000 to $1 million. These proposed rate changes will cost \nover $1 trillion.\n  This cut also goes to those who make far more than $1 million as \nwell. Whether your income is $1 million, $10 million, or $100 million, \nthis provision alone gives you an extra $25,000 a year. Mr. Speaker, \nmany South Carolinians I represent do not make $25,000 in a year.\n  The GOP tax plan also features a special rate for the owners of \n``pass-through'' businesses at a cost of $448 billion. These are LLCs \nand partnerships, who pay zero corporate tax, and whose owners' income \nis treated the same as anybody else's.\n  The Republicans claim that giving these owners a special lower rate \nwill help small businesses, but nothing could be further from the \ntruth. LLCs and other types of pass-throughs make up 95 percent of all \nthe businesses in the country. In fact, some of the largest businesses \nlike Koch Industries, Chrysler, and of course, most of the entities \nowned by the Trump Organization, are LLCs.\n  Pass-throughs that are truly small businesses are not currently \nsubject to the highest individual rates, and already pay 25 percent or \nlower. The National Federation of Independent Businesses opposes this \nprovision for this very reason. It delivers a special low tax rate to \nwealthy owners and will not help the small businesses they claim that \nit will.\n  Mr. Speaker, most of us, especially those who have worked in State \ngovernments, view our states as the best laboratories for the \ndevelopment of good ideas and best practices. This pass-through idea \nwas the centerpiece of Governor Sam Brownback's tax overhaul in Kansas \njust five years ago. The Governor promised it would yield massive \neconomic growth. And what happened? Kansas was plunged into a massive \nbudget deficit and forced to make draconian cuts to education, \ninfrastructure, and the rest of the state's operations.\n  This year, the Kansas legislature overrode Governor Brownback's \nshort-sighted experiment.\n  I urge my colleagues not to make the same mistake. This scam will \nsubject the good people of this country into a second great recession \nin a single decade.\n  Let's take a look at who pays more while the President and his \nwealthy friends and acquaintances pay less.\n  Middle income families will pay more because the GOP plan eliminates \ndeductions on state and local taxes. This includes millions of \nAmericans and over 500,000 South Carolinians.\n  Middle income families who itemize deductions will pay more because \nthe elimination of the personal exemption will cost their households \n$4,000 per member.\n  Middle income families who utilize the mortgage interest deduction \nwill pay more because the GOP plan lowers the cap, costing millions of \nAmericans more.\n  Middle income families with children in college or recent graduates \nwill pay more because the GOP plan eliminates the deduction for \ninterest on student loans.\n  Middle income families that are victims of natural disasters will pay \nmore because the GOP plan eliminates the casualty loss deduction.\n  Middle income families who adopt children will pay more because the \nGOP plan eliminates the adoption tax credit.\n  Middle income school teachers will pay more because the GOP plan \neliminates their ability for to deduct for supplies they may purchase \nfor their classrooms.\n  Middle income families struggling to pay costly medical bills will \npay more because the GOP plan shamefully eliminates their \ndeductibility.\n  Mr. Speaker, paying for pass-through gimmicks and tax giveaways to \nmulti-millionaires by raising taxes on moderate and middle-income \nAmericans is reprehensible.\n  Democrats are ready to do real tax reform on a bipartisan basis. But \nnot once in this process, has the other side attempted to negotiate. In \nfact, they have publicly made it abundantly clear that they want a bill \nthat only Republicans will support.\n  Bipartisan tax reform should lower taxes for working people, not \nraise them.\n  Bipartisan tax reform should end incentives for offshoring jobs and \nlevel the playing field for American corporations.\n  Bipartisan tax reform should expand the Earned Income Tax Credit for \nsingle filers and the Child Tax Credit to help families.\n  Real bipartisan tax reform would not increase the deficit, add to the \ndebt and pass the bill on to our children and grandchildren.\n  I know many of my colleagues share these values. Let's set aside this \npartisan process and do something worthwhile for the American people. \nUntil then, the Democratic Caucus will be resolute in our opposition to \nramming through tax increases for middle income Americans and massive \ngiveaways for the rich.\n", "turn": 1, "speaker": "Mr. CLYBURN", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "181", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H8527-H8528", "wkday": "Tuesday", "day": "7", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "REPUBLICAN TAX PROPOSAL", "id": "CREC-2017-11-07-pt1-PgH8527-2", "title": "REPUBLICAN TAX PROPOSAL"}
