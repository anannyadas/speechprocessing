Mr. Speaker, in the year 1918, on the 11th hour of the \n11th day of the 11th month of the year, the armistice ending World War \nI was signed.\n  Originally known as Armistice Day, Congress passed and President \nDwight Eisenhower signed a resolution officially designating November \n11 as Veterans Day. Now, every year, Americans pause on this special \nday to recognize all those, young and old, who have served our country \nin uniform.\n  While we should honor the service and sacrifice of our veterans every \nday, this day provides a unique opportunity for us to come together as \na nation and pay tribute to the men and women who put their lives on \nthe line for our freedom.\n  This year I will be participating in my hometown of Montgomery's \nVeterans Day event, and I highly encourage you and your families to \nattend the festivities in your area. I can promise you that you won't \nregret it. For me, it is not only an opportunity to express my \ngratitude to those who have served, but it is also a chance for my \nchildren to meet veterans and to better understand the sacrifices that \nthey have made for us.\n  If you can't attend an event in person, I hope you will take time to \nreach out to friends and relatives who have served and let them know \nhow much you appreciate them.\n\n\n  Mr. Speaker, this Veterans Day comes as services for veterans are \nimproving both on a national level and locally in Alabama's Second \nCongressional District. I have been impressed by the leadership of the \nSecretary of Veterans Affairs, Dr. David Shulkin. He has been making \nthe long-troubled department work better for those it serves.\n  Closer to home for me, the Central Alabama Veterans Health Care \nSystem has improved its service rating and now ranks three out of five \nstars. This is encouraging news, especially considering that just a few \nshort years ago the Central Alabama VA was one of the Nation's worst. \nOur VA now has the steady leadership of Dr. Linda Boyle, and there is \nno question that her guidance has made a difference in making this \nsustained progress.\n\n\n  I am eager to see it continue. We still have significant issues to \naddress at our Central Alabama VA, which is why I will remain actively \nengaged in working to turn around the system.\n  Mr. Speaker, it is my distinct honor to represent a district that is \nhome to one of the Nation's highest concentrations of veterans and \nretired military personnel. One of the most rewarding parts of this job \nis being able to advocate for those who have served this Nation in \nuniform.\n  I take my responsibility to look after veterans very seriously, \nwhether pushing for better policies or fighting to improve access to \nthe VA medical services or going to bat on behalf of someone the \nbureaucracy has left behind.\n  So, Mr. Speaker, I would like to close by extending my sincere \ngratitude to everyone who has served this country and their families. \nOur country is great because of the men and women who were willing to \nsacrifice on our behalf.\n", "turn": 1, "speaker": "Mrs. ROBY", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "181", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H8530-H8531", "wkday": "Tuesday", "day": "7", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "VETERANS DAY", "id": "CREC-2017-11-07-pt1-PgH8530-2", "title": "VETERANS DAY"}
