Mr. Speaker, this week, Penn State \nUniversity recognizes Military Appreciation Week, which is in \nconjunction with its homecoming celebration.\n  The Penn State Homecoming and Military Appreciation game will take \nplace, and appropriately so, on Veterans Day, Saturday, November 11, \nagainst the Rutgers Scarlet Knights in Beaver Stadium. This game will \ncelebrate both Penn State and its commitment to alumni and others in \nthe community who have served in our military.\n  I am so pleased to see the Penn State community honoring \nservicemembers, veterans, and their families, expressing appreciation \nto them and recognizing the sacrifices of Gold Star families.\n  Faculty, staff, and students from around the university and within \nthe community are engaging in planning and recognizing Active-Duty and \nveteran military personnel and their families.\n  Mr. Speaker, the State College Borough and Centre County have also \njoined with University Park to present numerous events for veterans and \ntheir families during Military Appreciation Month. Events began on \nOctober 2 with the Penn State Veterans Career Fair and will continue \nthrough the end of this week.\n  The Vietnam Veterans Traveling Memorial Wall came to University Park \nduring the month's events. I had the opportunity to participate in both \nthe opening and closing ceremonies for the wall, and it was a moving \ntribute to all those who served during the Vietnam war.\n  The theme for the Centre County event was ``Welcome Home.'' We all \nknow that, in many instances, our Vietnam veterans did not receive a \nwarm welcome home when they actually returned home from war. This is a \nscar on our history and one that we are working to heal. The Traveling \nWall served as a reminder of the efforts to promote liberty and freedom \nthat our Vietnam veterans put forth.\n  Military Appreciation events continue this week in conjunction with \nhomecoming. There will be a Veterans Day ceremony in front of Old Main \non Friday, a tailgate before the Military Appreciation football game \nSaturday, and a Freedom 5K for post-traumatic stress disorder, to \nbenefit those suffering with it, on Sunday.\n  The 6-week regional celebration culminates Sunday afternoon with \nMilitary Appreciation basketball games for both the Penn State men's \nand women's teams at Bryce Jordan Center.\n  Mr. Speaker, caring for our veterans and military has been one of my \ntop priorities since beginning my congressional service. It has a \nspecial place in my heart, not just because of all our veterans have \ndone, but because I have seen firsthand the magnitude of their \nsacrifice.\n  As a military father, I know that wearing the uniform is about \nservice and sacrifice.\n  I thank all those who serve and have served this great Nation, and I \nlook forward to honoring their service this week at Penn State and in \nevery corner of our country.\n  May God bless our veterans, the United States of America, and the \nNittany Lions for a homecoming win.\n", "turn": 1, "speaker": "Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "181", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H8525", "wkday": "Tuesday", "day": "7", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "PENN STATE TO CELEBRATE MILITARY APPRECIATION WEEK AND HOMECOMING", "id": "CREC-2017-11-07-pt1-PgH8525-4", "title": "PENN STATE TO CELEBRATE MILITARY APPRECIATION WEEK AND HOMECOMING"}
