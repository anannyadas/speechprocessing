Mr. Speaker, I rise today against the GOP tax \nplan that benefits the top 1 percent by raising taxes on millions of \nworking families. It eliminates important tax incentives for middle \nclass families and those who strive to join the middle class.\n  This bill would no longer allow Americans to deduct interest on \nstudent loans, making college even more expensive.\n  By capping the mortgage deduction, it keeps the American Dream of \nowning your home in economically vibrant areas of my State out of \nreach.\n  The bill ransacks Medicare and Medicaid by $1.5 trillion, and if you \nhave a sick child or a family member with disabilities or long-term \nmedical needs, you will struggle just to make ends meet.\n  While the tax cuts for billionaires and corporations are permanent, \nthe help for working families would disappear over time.\n  Raising taxes on middle class families isn't the kind of tax reform \nour country needs. This isn't the relief they were promised. This isn't \nthe relief they deserve. Working moms and dads can't simply hope that \ncorporate tax cuts turn into profits that trickle down to them.\n  Mr. Speaker, we need to invest in economic growth, not in hurting \nworking families across America.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. BROWN of Maryland", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "181", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H8533", "wkday": "Tuesday", "day": "7", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "GOP TAX PLAN WILL HURT WORKING FAMILIES", "id": "CREC-2017-11-07-pt1-PgH8533", "title": "GOP TAX PLAN WILL HURT WORKING FAMILIES"}
