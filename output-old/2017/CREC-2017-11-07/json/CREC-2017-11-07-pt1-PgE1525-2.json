Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and legacy of \nStaff Sergeant Dustin Wright, who was killed in action on Wednesday, \nOctober 4, 2017 while defending our nation as part of the 3rd Special \nForces Group in Africa. SSG Wright was a true American hero and our \nthoughts and prayers go out to his friends and family as they mourn the \nloss of this great man.\n  Enlisting in the United States Army in July of 2012, SSG Wright's \nlist of accomplishments runs long. After attending Special Forces \nAssessment and Selection program, he earned his Green Beret and was \nassigned to 2nd Battalion, 3rd Special Forces Group. He received \nnumerous medals, including the Purple Heart and Meritorious Service \nMedal.\n  Men and women like SSG Wright represent the best our nation has to \noffer. As a Special Forces Engineer Sergeant, he had undergone some of \nthe most intense training our military has and emerged as a leader and \nrole model. His selflessness allows us to enjoy the blessings of \nliberty that have persevered for well over 200 years. When his country \nneeded him most, he stood ready to answer the call to serve our great \nnation.\n  Our country can never repay the debt we owe to SSG Wright. He was a \nmodel citizen and soldier whose legacy will live on forever. He will \nalways be remembered and I will do everything in my power to honor his \nsacrifice.\n  Mr. Speaker, please join me today in commemorating the life of Staff \nSergeant Dustin Wright for his service to God and country.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. HUDSON", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 3}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "181", "extension": true, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "E1525", "wkday": "Tuesday", "day": "7", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "IN MEMORY OF STAFF SERGEANT DUSTIN WRIGHT", "id": "CREC-2017-11-07-pt1-PgE1525-2", "title": "IN MEMORY OF STAFF SERGEANT DUSTIN WRIGHT"}
