Mr. Speaker, approximately 5 weeks ago, we tragically lost \nfour soldiers in Niger: Staff Sergeant Bryan Black, Sergeant La David \nJohnson, Staff Sergeant Dustin Wright, and Staff Sergeant Jeremy \nJohnson. As recently as this past week, we lost a soldier in \nAfghanistan, Sergeant First Class Stephen B. Cribben.\n  To honor those I have just named, and their families, I would like to \nclose by reading a September 26, 2010, editorial by Bob Schieffer, the \nhost of ``Face the Nation.'' The title of his editorial was: ``The Real \nCost of War.''\n  ``I was in an airport lounge the other day when I saw a woman across \nthe way. Why I kept staring, I don't know. Maybe it was just that she \nseemed so sad. And then I understood. And I looked away, hoping she had \nnot seen me stare.\n  ``Because in her lap was an American flag, neatly folded into a \ntriangle and placed in a clear plastic case--a flag folded the way it \nalways is when it is given to a soldier's family as the soldier's \ncoffin is lowered into the grave.\n  ``I figured her to be a soldier's mother, and I couldn't help but \nwonder what memories that flag evoked as she held it there.\n  ``Did it remind her of the first time she had seen her child in the \ndelivery room, or was it the memory of seeing him go off to school that \nfirst day, or when he brought home the prize from the science fair, or \nmaybe made the touchdown, or gave her the first Valentine when he wrote \nout, `Mommy, I love you.'\n  ``I keep thinking about all the talk in Washington about the high \ncosts of defense and how we have to cut the Pentagon budget before it \nbankrupts the country.\n  ``But as I watched the woman, budgets seemed to be such a small part \nof all of it.\n  ``No, the real cost of war is not what we pay in dollars and cents.\n  ``The real cost is what we take from a mother who is left with just a \nmemory--and a neatly-folded flag in a clear plastic case.''\n  Mr. Speaker, I share that with the House because I do not understand \nwhy, after 16 years in Afghanistan, we cannot have a debate on the \nfloor of the House by all the Members here, of both parties, of whether \nwe should continue to stay in Afghanistan or not.\n  After 16 years, we have spent over $1 trillion, 2,300 Americans have \nbeen killed, and over 20,000 wounded, but the House does not have a \ndebate.\n  I call on Mr. Ryan to please, as Speaker of the House, initiate the \ncommittees of jurisdiction to mark up a new AUMF and bring it to the \nfloor and let the 435 Members of the House have a debate, no matter \nwhether they want to stay or come home. But by not debating, we are not \nmeeting our constitutional responsibility.\n", "turn": 1, "speaker": "Mr. JONES", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "181", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H8527", "wkday": "Tuesday", "day": "7", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "THE REAL COST OF WAR", "id": "CREC-2017-11-07-pt1-PgH8527", "title": "THE REAL COST OF WAR"}
