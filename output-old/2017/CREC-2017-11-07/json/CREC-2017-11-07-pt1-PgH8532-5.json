Mr. Speaker, the administration has announced that \nit will terminate temporary protected status, or TPS, for Nicaragua \nwhile extending the immigration protection for Honduras for merely 6 \nmonths. In the coming weeks, an announcement on Haiti's TPS designation \nis expected.\n  I am greatly worried about these decisions because over 100,000 \nHondurans and Haitians legally residing in our communities could be \ndeported and forced to go back to the instability and chaos in their \nhome countries.\n  For years, the United States has been providing necessary funding for \nHonduras, which is still struggling with crime and security challenges, \nand for Haiti, which continues to be impacted by devastating natural \ndisasters. This is precisely why Congress enacted TPS: so that we can \nprovide a safe haven to those who are unable to securely return to \ntheir home countries.\n  Mr. Speaker, the decision to send these individuals back would be a \nsetback to our bilateral relations with those nations while tearing \nthese families apart.\n  I strongly urge the administration to extend TPS for Hondurans and \nHaitians residing in our beautiful country.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "181", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H8532", "wkday": "Tuesday", "day": "7", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "EXTEND TEMPORARY PROTECTED STATUS FOR HAITIANS AND HONDURANS", "id": "CREC-2017-11-07-pt1-PgH8532-5", "title": "EXTEND TEMPORARY PROTECTED STATUS FOR HAITIANS AND HONDURANS"}
