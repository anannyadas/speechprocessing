Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the Ryan-McConnell \ntax plan that puts the interests of wealthy elites and corporations \nahead of the needs of the American people.\n  This bill tears away protections for Americans with student loans and \nAmericans who choose to adopt children. It strips support for \nindividuals with unexpected health challenges, even those whose homes \nhave burned down.\n  Under this plan, some 8 million American families will see their \ntaxes go up almost immediately, and millions more will face tax \nincreases in the future.\n  All this is done while giving permanent tax breaks to millionaires \nand billionaires and increasing the deficit by trillions of dollars. \nThis puts America's social safety net and our economic future in deep \njeopardy.\n  This is not the type of tax relief the American middle class and \nworking poor need--or deserve--right now.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge every one of my colleagues to put the needs of \nthe American people first and oppose the very disastrous Ryan-McConnell \ntax plan.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. TONKO", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "181", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H8582", "wkday": "Tuesday", "day": "7", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "OPPOSE DISASTROUS RYAN-McCONNELL TAX PLAN", "id": "CREC-2017-11-07-pt1-PgH8582-5", "title": null}
