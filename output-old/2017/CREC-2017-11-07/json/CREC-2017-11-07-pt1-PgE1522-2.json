Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of Lonnie Richardson \nof Mountain View, Arkansas, who recently celebrated his 100th birthday \non September 12th.\n   Lonnie was born in 1917, in the Signal Hill community of Mountain \nView. In 1942, he answered the call of duty and was drafted into the \nU.S. Army. He served for four years during and after World War II, \nrising to the rank of corporal. After the war, Lonnie returned home to \nthe Ozarks. He settled down, raised a family, and tended to the family \nfarm.\n   Lonnie is truly a member of the greatest generation. We are all \nmeasured relative to people like Lonnie, who preserved global freedom, \nbuilt our communities, and continue to shape America today. I hope you \nand Congress will join me in wishing Lonnie Richardson a happy 100th \nbirthday.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. CRAWFORD", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 3}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "181", "extension": true, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "E1522", "wkday": "Tuesday", "day": "7", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "HONORING LONNIE RICHARDSON", "id": "CREC-2017-11-07-pt1-PgE1522-2", "title": "HONORING LONNIE RICHARDSON"}
