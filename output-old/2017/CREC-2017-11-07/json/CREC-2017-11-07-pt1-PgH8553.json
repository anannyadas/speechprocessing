Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1133, as amended, the \nVeterans Transplant Coverage Act of 2017.\n  This bill is meant to remove an unnecessary barrier to care for \nveterans in need of transplants involving a living donor.\n  Last year, Mr. Charles Nelson, a 100 percent service-connected \nveteran from Texas, sought a kidney transplant through the Department \nof Veterans Affairs with Mr. Nelson's nonveteran son, Austin, serving \nas Mr. Nelson's live donor.\n  Rather than travel from his home in Texas to VA transplant centers in \neither Nashville, Tennessee, or Portland, Oregon, Mr. Nelson requested \nto receive his transplant at the University Hospital in San Antonio \nusing the Choice Program. However, his request was denied by VA because \nAustin was not a veteran, and, therefore, VA did not believe the \nDepartment had the authority to pay for this portion of the transplant \nprocedure with Choice funds.\n  Mr. Nelson eventually received his transplant in San Antonio using \nhis Medicare benefits, private donations, and personal savings to cover \nthe cost of his and Austin's care.\n  To prevent any other veterans from being unable to access transplant \ncare in the community under Choice, H.R. 1133, as amended, would amend \nthe Choice Program to allow VA to pay for any care or services a live \ndonor may require to carry out a transplant procedure for an eligible \nveteran, notwithstanding that the live donor may not be eligible for VA \nhealthcare.\n  I thank my friend from Texas, Congressman Carter, for his dedication \nto solving this problem for his constituent, Mr. Nelson, and for \nveterans and families across the country. This is how Congress should \nwork. He is a great representative, and I am really proud to serve with \nhim.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to join me in supporting \nH.R. 1133, as amended, and I reserve the balance of my time.", "turn": 4, "speaker": "Mr. BILIRAKIS", "itemno": 12}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "W000799", "text": "  Mr. WALZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 1133.\n  And, again, the gentleman was very clear: by allowing the VA to \nprovide healthcare to non-VA eligible donors, veterans can more easily \nreceive lifesaving donations from their families and friends. Family \nmembers of veterans are often the best match for providing a veteran \nwith a live organ donation and are typically more willing to be a live \ndonor.\n  Under current law, a veteran can receive only a live organ donation \nfrom another veteran receiving the transplant at a VA hospital.\n  This is one of those pieces of legislation that, I think, when many \nof us saw it brought forward, makes great common sense. It is the right \nthing to do. I understand possibly why they put that in there. But all \nof us know that it is going to be that exact scenario that it is going \nto be a family member or someone near who is going to want to do the \ntransplant. If the best place to do that for the veteran is at the VA \nhospital, and they can get them in, it makes great sense to do it.\n  So I do want to also thank Representative Carter for bringing this \nforward.\n  This is, again, improving care, and making sure that we are focusing \non the issues that we can make a difference on.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.", "turn": 5, "speaker": "Mr. WALZ", "itemno": 13}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "B001257", "text": "  Mr. BILIRAKIS.

Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding, \nand I thank Mr. Bilirakis and Mr. Walz for rising in support of this.\n  When Mr. Nelson and his family came to me with this, the first thing \nI thought was: That is the dumbest thing I have ever heard.\n  You have a child, waiting to give you a live kidney in a transplant, \nand he is eliminated as a donor because he is not a veteran. It is hard \nenough to find live transplants as it is. And common sense by everybody \nwho ever knew anybody who got one knows: the best source is\n\n\na family member because it has got the best chance for a match and the \nbest chance for success.\n  Yet the VA had a limitation that he had to be a veteran. Now, what \nare the chances of all your family being veterans when all of a sudden \nyou have renal failure and have to have a kidney? They have got to be \noff the wall, and that is ridiculous.\n  So, Mr. Speaker, I filed this bill to correct this mess.\n  My colleague has given a great description of what happened to the \nNelsons. But, more importantly, common sense--and I like the mention of \nthat--tells us that you can't eliminate the best pool of donors that a \nfamily has because of their lack of being a veteran.\n  And we all know--we heard Mr. O'Rourke say previously--we are down to \nabout 1 percent of our Nation actually serves in the military anymore.\n  So this is a commonsense fix for a commonsense problem.\n  Mr. Speaker, I am really proud of my staff. They have worked really \nhard on this. They stayed at it and stayed at it. We got the attention \nof the VA, and I am happy for their cooperation. I want to thank the \ncommittee. They were overwhelmingly supportive on both sides of the \naisle. I urged my colleagues to fix a commonsense problem and allow a \nson to give a kidney to his father at a facility that is most \nconvenient to the family, which is all common sense, so that our \nveterans, who have given their all for us, have the right to have the \nbest healthcare available to American citizens, and that is what this \nbill will provide.\n\n  There was such a good explanation by my colleagues that I didn't go \ninto the details. But I just want to tell you that when you have a \nconstituent come in with a commonsense problem, we have a duty and a \nresponsibility to fix it because common sense is in short supply in \nWashington, D.C.", "turn": 7, "speaker": "Mr. CARTER of Texas", "itemno": 15}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "W000799", "text": "  Mr. WALZ.
