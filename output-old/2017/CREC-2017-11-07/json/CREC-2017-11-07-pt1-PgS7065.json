Mr. President, allegations of sexual harassment against \na growing number of people have surfaced recently. Some facing the \naccusations have issued public apologies, while others have maintained \ntheir innocence. But the allegations continue to mount, and as each new \none surfaces, so grows my concern about whether we're doing enough to \ncombat this problem.\n  There are many things on which members of this chamber don't agree, \nbut one thing on which we can and should agree is this: sexual \nharassment has no place in the workforce. And it certainly has no place \nin the halls of Congress.\n  To signal how seriously I take this issue, I last week called on the \nSenate Rules Committee to impose a requirement of sexual harassment \ntraining for every employee in this chamber. Today, I'm introducing a \nbipartisan resolution to ensure that the Rules Committee has the \nauthority necessary to ensure that every member of this chamber, every \nemployee on the Senate payroll, and every unpaid Senate intern receives \nanti-harassment training.\n  This is not an onerous requirement, and it's one that's long overdue. \nTraining materials on harassment already exist, thanks to the \nCongressional Office of Compliance and our Office of the Senate Chief \nCounsel for Employment. It's already mandatory for my Judiciary \nCommittee staff and personal office staff to take anti-harassment \ntraining. The executive branch and some private employers already have \ninstituted similar training requirements for their employees.\n  More than two decades ago, I sponsored the Congressional \nAccountability\n\n\nAct as a sign of our commitment to promoting fairness in the workplace. \nThis 1995 statute requires Congress to follow the same civil rights, \nlabor, workplace safety, and health laws to which other employers are \nsubject. The law also established our Office of Compliance to implement \nthe law's dispute resolution, education, and enforcement provisions for \nCongress. That office not only mediates sexual harassment complaints \nbut also has developed sexual harassment training for congressional \noffices. The Office of the Senate Chief Counsel for Employment also \nmakes anti-harassment training available to Senators and staff.\n  The resolution I'm introducing today also calls for the Sergeant at \nArms to develop an anonymous survey on the prevalence of sexual \nharassment in the Senate. This survey, which will be conducted every \ntwo years, is to be developed in consultation with the Office of \nCompliance and Office of the Senate Chief Counsel for Employment.\n  I have tremendous respect for my colleagues on both sides of the \naisle. I believe each of you works hard to ensure that your offices are \nprofessional, free of harassment, and places where merit's rewarded. \nBut I think we have to acknowledge that in our society, despite our \nbest efforts and intentions, sexual harassment remains a serious \nproblem. And we must work together to make sure that the Senate remains \nfree from harassment.\n  Some may say that policies regarding sexual harassment should be left \nto the discretion of each office. But I believe it's important for \nevery Senate office to have a consistent stance on this particular \nissue. Every office should receive the same training so the Senate \nmaintains a culture in which harassment is not tolerated. This is a \ncommon interest we all share. The voters who sent us here expect the \nbest. We owe it to the American people to hold ourselves and our \nemployees to the highest standards of conduct and professionalism.\n  Mr. President, I want to close by thanking Senators Feinstein, \nKlobuchar, Ernst, and Gillibrand for working so closely with me on the \ndevelopment of this resolution. I urge my colleagues to embrace a \ncommon sense approach to preventing sexual harassment by supporting its \npassage.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. GRASSLEY", "itemno": 6}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 7}], "header": {"chamber": "Senate", "num": "181", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "S7065-S7066", "wkday": "Tuesday", "day": "7", "month": "November"}, "related_bills": [{"type": "SRES", "context": "TITLE", "congress": "115", "number": "323"}, {"type": "SRES", "context": "HEADERLINE", "congress": "115", "number": "323"}, {"type": "SRES", "context": "OTHER", "congress": "115", "number": "323"}], "doc_title": "SENATE RESOLUTION 323--REQUIRING SEXUAL HARASSMENT TRAINING FOR MEMBERS, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, INTERNS, AND FELLOWS OF THE SENATE AND A PERIODIC SURVEY OF THE SENATE", "id": "CREC-2017-11-07-pt1-PgS7065"}
