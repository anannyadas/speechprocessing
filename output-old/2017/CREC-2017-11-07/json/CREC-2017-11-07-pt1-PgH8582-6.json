Congresswoman Jackson Lee also earned some of LA's \niconic Philippe's French dip sandwiches as part of our friendly wager.\n  We may be on opposing teams when it comes to baseball, but we both \nplay for the blue team here in Congress, and I look forward to working \nwith her to fight for working men and women across the United States.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. GOMEZ", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "J000032", "text": "  Ms. JACKSON LEE.
