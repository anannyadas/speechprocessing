Mr. President, I often praise the talents and \ngoodwill of Floridians across my home State, and today is no different. \nMs. Joani Slawson, a music teacher at Saturn Elementary in Brevard \nCounty, and Mr. James Yaques, of Palm Beach Central High School, have \nbeen nominated for a Grammy award. Their passion for teaching coupled \nwith their musical talent is rightly being recognized as they are both \nsemifinalists for music educator of the year.\n  As the Grammy process continues, I, along with my fellow Floridians, \nwill be rooting for Ms. Slawson and Mr. Yaques. I wish them, their \nrespective schools, and their students all the best.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. RUBIO", "itemno": 0}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 1}], "header": {"chamber": "Senate", "num": "181", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "S7060", "wkday": "Tuesday", "day": "7", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "TRIBUTE TO JOANI SLAWSON AND JAMES YAQUES", "id": "CREC-2017-11-07-pt1-PgS7060", "title": "TRIBUTE TO JOANI SLAWSON AND JAMES YAQUES"}
