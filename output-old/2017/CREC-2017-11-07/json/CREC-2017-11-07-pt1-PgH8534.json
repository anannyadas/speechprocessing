Mr. Speaker, I have grave concerns with the so-called \ntax plan Republicans are peddling. It should be called the Republican \ntax scam. Working Americans are being sold a bill of goods. Let me be \ncrystal clear: this plan will not cut taxes for working middle class \nfamilies. This is a tax cut for Wall Street and a tax hike for Main \nStreet. And what does your family get? More cuts to children's \neducation, deep cuts to your healthcare, and deep cuts to lifesaving \nemergency services.\n  Over 50 million taxpaying households will pay more taxes every April \n15, due to this tax scam. Let me repeat that another way. This tax scam \ngets rid of credits and deductions for the middle class and keeps \nloopholes for corporations to ship your jobs overseas.\n  Mr. Speaker, I am completely opposed to this tax scam that cuts taxes \nfor big corporations, and it forces big cuts to Medicare, education, \nand Social Security. This tax scam is wrong.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. CARDENAS", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "181", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H8534", "wkday": "Tuesday", "day": "7", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "REPUBLICAN TAX PLAN", "id": "CREC-2017-11-07-pt1-PgH8534", "title": "REPUBLICAN TAX PLAN"}
