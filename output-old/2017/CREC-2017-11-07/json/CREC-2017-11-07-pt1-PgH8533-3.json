Mr. Speaker, are there students in our \ncountry who think college has become too affordable? parents who feel \nthat saving for their children's education has become too easy? I know \nthat my constituents would certainly answer with a resounding ``no.''\n  Why would anyone support a tax bill that would make college even more \nexpensive for our students?\n  When will we start working together to put the interests of average \nAmericans before the interests of large corporations?\n  According to the Ways and Means summary, the Republican tax bill \nwould increase the cost to students attending college by $65 billion--\nthat is billion with a B--over the next decade.\n  This administration promised to put money back in the pockets of \nAmericans who need it the most, and this misguided tax bill does the \nexact opposite.\n  Mr. Speaker, education is the cornerstone of our global \ncompetitiveness, and this Republican bill would only make college less \naffordable and less accessible. I urge my colleagues to reject this \nassault on the middle class.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mrs. DAVIS of California", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "181", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H8533", "wkday": "Tuesday", "day": "7", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "TAX PLAN AND EDUCATION", "id": "CREC-2017-11-07-pt1-PgH8533-3", "title": "TAX PLAN AND EDUCATION"}
