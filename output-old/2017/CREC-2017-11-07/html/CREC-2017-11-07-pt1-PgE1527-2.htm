                100TH ANNIVERSARY OF MERCHANT'S GROCERY

                                 ______
                                 

                             HON. DAVE BRAT

                              of virginia

                    in the house of representatives

                       Tuesday, November 7, 2017

  Mr. BRAT. Mr. Speaker, this year marks the centennial of Merchant's 
Grocery. The store has been a cornerstone of community for Culpeper 
County and is worth taking the time to recognize.
   The store was founded in 1917 and is one the few stores to make the 
transition from a Mom and Pop grocery store to a modern food service 
model without losing the culture and atmosphere that has made it 
desirable.
   Merchant's Grocery has remained unswerving in its care for its 
customers and employees. Their quality of service is what has allowed 
them to last for 100 years and has kept their customers loyal to their 
industry.
   Businesses such as Merchant's Grocery are a taste of an age gone by. 
These businesses serve as a reminder of the importance of small 
businesses and the crucial roles they play within their communities.
   Merchant's Grocery has been a servant to Culpeper County, Shenandoah 
Valley, and the area of Central Virginia for the past 100 years and 
will continue to be a blessing to its employees and customers alike.
