                       Tuesday, November 7, 2017

  Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Ms. Tranine 
Chisom of Fairfield, California, who has dedicated her career to 
community service and improving support for people with mental health 
disabilities and those who experience housing challenges and 
homelessness. As the Director of Supported Housing of Caminar in Solano 
County, Tranine has tirelessly worked with property owners, and city 
and county officials to increase and leverage affordable housing 
resources for our most vulnerable citizens. Annually, Tranine and her 
team provide supportive housing services to over 100 residents who 
might not otherwise be able to obtain or maintain affordable housing on 
their own.
   Ms. Chisom also serves as the Board Chairwoman for Housing First 
Solano, a coalition of service providers in Solano County working 
together to end homelessness. She has been instrumental in the 
development and now the implementation of Solano County's Neighbors 
Helping Neighbor-Forward Together 5-Year Strategic Plan to address 
homelessness.
   Tranine is also active in the Solano Napa Habitat for Humanity 
program where she actively participates as a crew member on community 
building days, as well as serves on the Family Selection Committee to 
identify families most in need of a Habitat Home.
