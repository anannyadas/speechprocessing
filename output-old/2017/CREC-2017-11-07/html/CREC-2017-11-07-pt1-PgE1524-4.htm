                 HONORING THE CAREER OF CARLOS MENDOZA

                                 ______
                                 

                             HON. JIM COSTA

                             of california

                    in the house of representatives

                       Tuesday, November 7, 2017

  Mr. COSTA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the career 
achievements of Carlos G. Mendoza, the U.S. Small Business 
Administration's Fresno District Director. Mr. Mendoza retired on Nov. 
3, 2017 after more than 40 years of federal service. He has worked 
tirelessly in his career for small businesses and community 
development.
  Mr. Mendoza began his federal civil service career in 1975 as an 
architect at the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard. He is a graduate of the 
University of California, Berkeley and has advanced degrees from 
Princeton University and California State University, East Bay. After 
successfully completing several assignments for the U.S. Navy, he 
transferred to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development and 
quickly rose into the managerial ranks.
  In 1992, Mr. Mendoza began his term with the U.S. Small Business 
Administration, becoming the Deputy District Director of the Los 
Angeles District office before serving as District Director in El Paso 
and Fresno. As District Director in Fresno, he was responsible for 
small business development in Central California and the Central Coast. 
He expanded resources in the Central Valley, bringing in the Emerging 
Leaders mini MBA program, several PRIME grants, a Women's Business 
Center and the Small Business Development Center.
  Mr. Mendoza is known for his passion to make a difference. His work 
has received recognition from the Environmental Protection Agency, the 
Small Business Administration, the Department of Housing and Urban 
Development, the Chambers of Commerce and the North American 
Development Bank. For example, during The Great Recession in 2008, he 
was the first person in the country to offer a dedicated technical 
assistance phone line to respond to small business owner's needs. This 
accomplishment helped shift the focus from the lack of loans to an 
emphasis on ``small business survival skills.''
  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing the career 
achievements of Carlos G. Mendoza. I congratulate Mr. Mendoza for his 
many accomplishments throughout his career and ask that you join me in 
wishing him and his wife Lydia, continued success and happiness.
