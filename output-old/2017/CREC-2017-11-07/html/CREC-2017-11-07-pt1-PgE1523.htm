               RECOGNIZING THE 50TH ANNIVERSARY OF CONVAL

                                 ______
                                 

                           HON. JOE COURTNEY

                             of connecticut

                    in the house of representatives

                       Tuesday, November 7, 2017

  Mr. COURTNEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 50th 
anniversary of Conval, Inc., located in Somers, CT.
  In 1962, WWII Navy veteran, Chester ``Chet'' Siver designed a line of 
high-pressure, forged steel valves in his basement in Longmeadow, 
Massachusetts. After a brief period overseeing Hamilton Standard's use 
of his design, Mr. Siver eventually regained the rights to his product 
and set up shop. Conval, or ``Connecticut Valve'', was founded on 
November 7, 1967.
  Today Conval is the premier manufacturer of high quality, high 
temperature, and high pressure forged steel valves in the world. Conval 
valves are used in a variety of industries, including fossil power, 
nuclear power, pulp and paper, and water treatment.
  As the town's largest private employer, Conval has become an 
institution in Somers. This family-owned and operated small business, 
now overseen by Chet's son, Frank Siver, is an American success story 
that has stayed true to Siver's commitment to making Conval ``a nice 
place to work.'' For example, when it came time to expand, Conval 
elected to stay close to home to accommodate its employees and their 
families. Their new facility, located in nearby Enfield, CT, is set to 
open in February 2018.
  Mr. Speaker, please join me in honoring Conval for their fifty-year 
commitment to great American manufacturing and community. May they 
enjoy continued success for years to come.

                          ____________________
