               IN MEMORY OF SERGEANT LA DAVID T. JOHNSON

                                 ______
                                 

                          HON. RICHARD HUDSON

                           of north carolina

                    in the house of representatives

                       Tuesday, November 7, 2017

  Mr. HUDSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and legacy of 
Sergeant La David T. Johnson, who was killed in action on Wednesday, 
October 4, 2017 while defending our nation as part of the 3rd Special 
Forces Group in Africa. SGT Johnson was a true American hero and our 
thoughts and prayers go out to his friends and family as they mourn the 
loss of this great man.
  Enlisting in the United States Army in January of 2014, SGT Johnson's 
list of accomplishments runs long. After completion of Advanced 
Individual Training, earning the Military occupational specialty 91B 
Wheeled Vehicle Mechanic, he was assigned to 2nd Battalion, 3rd Special 
Forces Group. He received numerous medals, including the Purple Heart 
and Meritorious Service Medal.
  Men and women like SGT Johnson represent the best our nation has to 
offer. His selflessness allows us to enjoy the blessings of liberty 
that have persevered for well over 200 years. When his country needed 
him most, he stood ready to answer the call to serve our great nation.
  Survived by a loving family, our country can never repay the debt we 
owe to SGT Johnson. He was a model citizen and soldier whose legacy 
will live on forever. He will always be remembered and I will do 
everything in my power to honor his sacrifice.
  Mr. Speaker, please join me today in commemorating the life of 
Sergeant La David T. Johnson for his service to God and country.
