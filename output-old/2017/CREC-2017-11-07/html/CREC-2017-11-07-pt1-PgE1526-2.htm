                       Tuesday, November 7, 2017

  Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Ms. Susan Scott 
of Marysville, California, who has dedicated her life to helping 
children. In her 26 years of service to the Marysville Joint Unified 
School District, Ms. Scott performed many duties, from outreach, to 
attendance, to working as a school librarian. In every role, she 
demonstrated her devotion to children and their education. Ms. Scott 
has a strong understanding and appreciation of the role schools play in 
the growth and development of students.
   In keeping with her dedication to her community's education system, 
Ms. Scott ran for a position on the Marysville Joint Unified School 
District Board of Trustees. She was elected by an overwhelming 
majority, becoming the first African American woman elected in Yuba 
County. Ms. Scott's community recognized her commitment to making a 
difference in the lives of children and voted to have her continue her 
work.
   Ms. Scott's dedication to helping children does not stop at her 
workplace. She has fostered over 25 children in her home, helping to 
ensure that children have a safe and welcoming home in a time of need. 
Ms. Scott also sponsors a charitable program, ``To Tanzania With 
Love,'' which provides financial assistance to an orphanage in 
Tanzania. Whether in her role as a foster parent, serving her 
community's education system, or supporting children in a developing 
nation, Ms. Scott has shown her devotion to the betterment of 
children's lives.
