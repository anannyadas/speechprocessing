  HONORING LEMONT HIGH SCHOOL FOR BEING NAMED A NATIONAL BLUE RIBBON 
                                 SCHOOL

                                 ______
                                 

                          HON. DANIEL LIPINSKI

                              of illinois

                    in the house of representatives

                       Tuesday, November 7, 2017

  Mr. LIPINSKI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Lemont High 
School for being honored with the prestigious 2017 U.S. Department of 
Education National Blue Ribbon School Award. The award was conferred 
under the Exemplary High Performing Schools category.
  District Superintendent Mary Ticknor, School Principal Eric 
Michaelsen, administrative staff, and an amazing group of teachers are 
committed to Lemont High School's mission for all students to become 
life-long, independent learners and productive citizens. To further the 
mission, teachers are afforded the freedom to take risks in the 
classroom, and the school encourages project-based learning with real-
world applications. In this environment, students learn that success is 
open-ended and further educational attainment requires persistent hard 
work and self-improvement.
  Lemont High School takes pride in preparing students for their next 
steps in education and future careers. This past school year, Lemont 
students set two school records with the largest number of students 
ever to take at least one Advanced Placement exam for college credit 
and the highest percentage ever of those exams earning a passing score. 
Lemont High School's diverse set of accomplishments, both in and out of 
the classroom, speaks to the effort the school makes to produce well-
rounded young women and men.
  The U.S. Department of Education established the National Blue Ribbon 
Schools Program in 1982 to recognize public and private schools with 
high or significantly improved achievement. I am proud that Lemont High 
School has been honored as one of these exceptional schools.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating Lemont 
High School for this impressive achievement, and recognizing the 
teachers, administrators, students, parents, and community for the hard 
work that they have put in to earn this award.

                          ____________________
