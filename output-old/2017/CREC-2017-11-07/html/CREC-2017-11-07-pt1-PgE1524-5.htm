                       Tuesday, November 7, 2017

  Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Rita Montes 
Martin, a lifelong entrepreneur and community activist in the Davis, 
California community. At 95, she's led an extraordinary life and has no 
desire to retire. She embodies the true meaning of a public servant and 
community activist.
   Rita is an iconic personality in the Davis community, having 
developed many relationships with community organizers, business 
leaders and elected officials; you will always find her advocating for 
a local initiative or even take on a national policy. If it's good for 
the community then Rita will be involved. Rita is also active with 
Davis Media Access, a media company focused on education programming as 
a way of strengthening community.
   Rita has worn many hats, but the preponderance of her career has 
been in real estate. She was a loan officer and the only female 
appraiser for Great Western, as well as other financial institutions, 
and worked closely with builders and developers throughout her career. 
She held a leadership position as executive vice president, property 
management of Pegasus group.
   Rita has several irons in the fire, a serial entrepreneur and 
problem solver, Rita is also involved in political activism and is 
considered an author, screen play writer and friend to many in the 
Davis community.
