  HONORING McCLURE JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL FOR BEING NAMED A NATIONAL BLUE 
                             RIBBON SCHOOL

                                 ______
                                 

                          HON. DANIEL LIPINSKI

                              of illinois

                    in the house of representatives

                       Tuesday, November 7, 2017

  Mr. LIPINSKI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate McClure 
Junior High School in Western Springs for receiving the prestigious 
2017 U.S. Department of Education National Blue Ribbon School Award. 
McClure Junior High was recognized under the Exemplary High Performing 
Schools category.
  In 1982, the Department of Education established the National Blue 
Ribbon Schools Program to recognize a select group of public and 
private schools with high or significantly improved achievement. I am 
proud that McClure has been honored as one of those exceptional 
schools.
  McClure's mission statement is ``Be respectful, be responsible, and 
be safe.'' Principal F. Daniel Chick, his hard-working staff, and the 
school's exceptional teachers do a fantastic job perpetuating this 
motto by encouraging students to help one another and build a 
foundation of respect throughout the school community. After winning a 
National Blue Ribbon School award in 2010, the staff at McClure and in 
District 101 continued to strive for success by developing a 
Professional Learning Roadmap and undertaking a thorough strategic 
planning process.
  McClure has promoted student ownership of their education as well as 
various other programs to enrich students' lives and provide for a 
better school experience. A great partnership with parents has also 
played an essential role in the school's success. Parent-run 
organizations such as the Parent Council and the Spirit Club raise 
funds that directly impact the lives of McClure students. I commend the 
school for going above and beyond with their offerings for students and 
I hope that other schools will use them as an outstanding example to 
follow.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing McClure 
Junior High School for this significant achievement and congratulating 
the teachers, administrators, parents, students and community on a job 
well done.
