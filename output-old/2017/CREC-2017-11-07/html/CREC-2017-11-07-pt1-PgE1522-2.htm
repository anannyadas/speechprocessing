                       HONORING LONNIE RICHARDSON

                                 ______
                                 

                     HON. ERIC A. ``RICK'' CRAWFORD

                              of arkansas

                    in the house of representatives

                       Tuesday, November 7, 2017

  Mr. CRAWFORD. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of Lonnie Richardson 
of Mountain View, Arkansas, who recently celebrated his 100th birthday 
on September 12th.
   Lonnie was born in 1917, in the Signal Hill community of Mountain 
View. In 1942, he answered the call of duty and was drafted into the 
U.S. Army. He served for four years during and after World War II, 
rising to the rank of corporal. After the war, Lonnie returned home to 
the Ozarks. He settled down, raised a family, and tended to the family 
farm.
   Lonnie is truly a member of the greatest generation. We are all 
measured relative to people like Lonnie, who preserved global freedom, 
built our communities, and continue to shape America today. I hope you 
and Congress will join me in wishing Lonnie Richardson a happy 100th 
birthday.

                          ____________________
