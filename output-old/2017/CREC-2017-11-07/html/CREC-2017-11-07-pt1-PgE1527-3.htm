   COMMEMORATING THE 50TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE PUBLIC BROADCASTING ACT

                                 ______
                                 

                          HON. EARL BLUMENAUER

                               of oregon

                    in the house of representatives

                       Tuesday, November 7, 2017

  Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, since its inception, public broadcasting 
has truly remained both a national and local institution offering 
educational programming for youth, emergency communications, cultural 
programs, and providing for the unique broadcasting needs of rural and 
small towns. In fact, more than 170 million Americans rely on public 
broadcasting every month.
  Fifty years ago, the enactment of the Public Broadcasting Act created 
the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and led to the establishment of 
the Public Broadcasting Service and National Public Radio. Today, I 
commemorate this law's 50th anniversary signing and celebrate the 
critical services public broadcasting continues to provide as America's 
most trusted source of news and information.
  It's no surprise that an overwhelming majority of Americans want to 
maintain or even increase the federal contribution. That's why 
Congress, time and time again, has committed to funding public 
broadcasting through the appropriations process. Each federal dollar 
dedicated to public broadcasting leverages six private dollars, usually 
voluntary contributions.
  My colleague, Ryan Costello, and I founded the bipartisan 
Congressional Public Broadcasting Caucus to unite Members of Congress 
who understand that public broadcasting's mission is alive, well, and 
deserving of our support. We'll continue working to highlight the 
importance of the service, the needed federal support, and the valuable 
contributions to our citizenry.
