  Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Ms. Robin 
Dewey, a dedicated advocate for individuals living with disabilities in 
Davis, California, who is committed to serving her community. As 
President of Team Davis, a nonprofit organization established to help 
enrich the lives of children and adults with developmental, cognitive, 
and physical disabilities, Ms. Dewey has demonstrated her devotion to 
an underserved community.

Thanks to her dedication, people with disabilities have been provided 
opportunities for experiences that give them a sense of accomplishment, 
purpose, and belonging. Ms. Dewey has brought to life the mission of 
her organization, helping disabled individuals build physical skills, a 
sense of camaraderie, and a stronger connection with the Davis 
community.
   For decades Ms. Dewey has served her community by advocating for 
equity, social justice, and opportunity for disabled individuals. Not 
only does she serve a typically isolated community with compassion, 
consistency, and authenticity, but she also ensures that her volunteers 
do the same. Ms. Dewey's service to her community does not end with the 
disabled people she helps, but continues with the compassionate service 
she teaches to everyone in her organization.
