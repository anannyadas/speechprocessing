                       Tuesday, November 7, 2017

  Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Ms. Sharon 
Phippens of Orland, California, who has led an exciting, dynamic life, 
never straying from a desire to serve. The wife of a Foreign Service 
Officer, Ms. Phippens travelled the world and adapted to unknown 
situations, all in service to her country and her family. Ms. Phippens 
was a first-hand witness of some of our country's most interesting 
history through her work for two American embassies and her service in 
the United States Justice Department during President Nixon's 
resignation.
   Ms. Phippens later pursued an extensive and varied education which 
she has put to use serving her community. Ms. Phippens has worked in 
law enforcement, patient advocacy, education, and social work; all 
fields which allowed her to work serving others. In every role, Ms. 
Phippens distinguished herself as someone who would go above and 
beyond. She has also served on the boards of organizations that provide 
support to people in times of need. Ms. Phippens has used her many 
talents to the benefit of her community, lending her skills to a wide 
variety of fields.
