                          PERSONAL EXPLANATION

                                 ______
                                 

                            HON. JARED POLIS

                              of colorado

                    in the house of representatives

                       Tuesday, November 7, 2017

  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I was unavoidably absent on November 6, 2017. 
Had I been present for the following Roll Call votes:
  H.R. 3562--To amend title 38, United States Code, to authorize the 
Secretary of Veterans Affairs to furnish assistance for adaptations of 
residences of veterans in rehabilitation programs under chapter 31 of 
such title, and for other purposes, I would have voted Yea as this 
legislation would make it easier for the VA to assist veterans who are 
in need of adaptations made to their homes to receive care.
  On H.R. 1066--VA Management Alignment Act of 2017--Motion on Ordering 
the Previous Question on the Rule providing for consideration of H.R. 
2936, I would have voted Yea as this legislation would require the VA 
to submit a report on the individual roles and accountability 
mechanisms of the VA.

                          ____________________
