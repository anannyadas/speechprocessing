                    in the house of representatives

                       Tuesday, November 7, 2017

  Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Ms. Susan 
Schwartz of Vacaville, California, who is passionate about helping 
young people grow, helping small businesses prosper, and helping in the 
community. Susan is known as the ``volunteer extraordinaire'' at the 
Vacaville Neighborhood Boys and Girls Club where she lives by the motto 
``children don't care how much you know, until they know how much you 
care.'' Her genuine concern for the club youth is evident in everything 
she does which earned her recognition as the organization's 2013 
Volunteer of the Year and the 2016 Champions for Children Award by the 
Solano Kids Insurance Program.
   Ms. Schwartz has launched multiple projects at the club to include 
the Holiday Give Back for toys and donations for the needy, as well as 
the Garden Project that helps teach, grow, prepare, and consume meals 
from grown for themselves as well as the needy and homeless.
   Susan has taken her advocacy for children, and expanded it into the 
community by working as the driving force in a group to bring the Miss 
Representation Project to Solano County. Partnering with the Kroc 
Center and Brenden Theater, she helped sponsor the showing of the films 
The Miss Representation Project and The Mask You Live In. Ms. 
Schwartz's commitment to service has brought these films that raise 
awareness of gender stereotypes, and help young people better 
understand the issues we all face to over three hundred children and 
their parents.
