      IN RECOGNITION OF GUNNERY SERGEANT THOMAS J. SULLIVAN, USMC

                                 ______
                                 

                          HON. RICHARD E. NEAL

                            of massachusetts

                    in the house of representatives

                       Tuesday, November 7, 2017

  Mr. NEAL. Mr. Speaker, I would like to take this opportunity to 
recognize and honor Gunnery Sergeant Thomas ``Tommy'' Sullivan of the 
United States Marine Corps. On Thursday July 16, 2015, a gunman 
attacked a Naval Reserve Center in Chattanooga, Tennessee. During that 
senseless act of violence, Gunnery Sergeant Sullivan made the ultimate 
sacrifice by giving his life to defend his fellow service members.
  Tommy Sullivan was born and raised in Springfield, Massachusetts. He 
graduated from Cathedral High School in 1994, and became a Marine three 
years later. His friends and family all attest that Tommy was 
determined to serve his county since a young age. Over the course of 
nearly two decades in the military, Tommy survived two tours in Iraq, 
was awarded two Purple Hearts, and made a lasting impression on all 
those who served with him. Many have proudly said that he was 
everything that a Marine should be. He was a natural leader who always 
kept his composure, and who mentored less experienced Marines. Those 
who served with him recall that after battles he always took the time 
to talk to everyone under his command, and was never afraid to crack a 
joke in order to ease the tension.
  Tommy's bravery during the attack on that Chattanooga military 
installation in 2015 will forever be remembered. On that day, he helped 
more than a dozen of his fellow servicemen escape when a gunman opened 
fire. When he turned back to help two others, he unfortunately lost his 
life. For his valor, Tommy was posthumously awarded the Lieutenant J. 
Frank Murphy Medal of Valor--an annual award given by the Springfield 
Veterans' Activities Committee to a resident who risked their lives to 
save others. His family was also honored with Tommy's third Purple 
Heart which was awarded to him for his heroic actions.
  Mr. Speaker, in closing, I would like to once again honor Gunnery 
Sergeant Thomas Sullivan for his courage and service to our country. He 
was loyal to his family, his friends, and the extraordinary individuals 
of the Marine Corps and all of our nation's Armed Forces. To Tommy's 
family, please know that the United States of America will never forget 
his heroism and sacrifice and we are eternally grateful.
