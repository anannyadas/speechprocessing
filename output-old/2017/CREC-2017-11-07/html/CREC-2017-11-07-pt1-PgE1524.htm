                       Tuesday, November 7, 2017

  Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of Dr. George 
Francis Lee, a healer with a heart of gold, who passed away on 
September 26, 2017.
  Dr. Lee was born in Brooklyn, New York, on March 1, 1941. He was the 
oldest of five children and spent the majority of his youth in upstate 
New York where he met his future wife, Katherine Temple. They were 
married on August 24, 1963.
  After graduating from Albany Medical College of Union University in 
1968, Dr. Lee and his family moved to California in 1969 where he 
completed his residency in Obstetrics and Gynecology at the University 
of California, San Francisco. Throughout his career he was recognized 
for his exceptional bedside manner as well as his compassionate and 
trusted nature as a physician. His work in medicine not only improved 
the lives of women and children in San Francisco, but throughout 
California and the United States.
  In 1977, Dr. Lee and his family built their home, the Old Chatham 
Ranch in Yorkville, California. As a resident of Mendocino County, 
George was active in the community, helping establish the Mendocino 
Wine Growers, Inc. and serving on numerous committees, including the 
Anderson Valley School Board and the Anderson Valley Health Center.
  Dr. George Francis Lee has led a life dedicated to healing and 
helping people everywhere. He is survived by his wife Katherine, and 
his children Barbara, Kelly, and Douglas. Please join me in recognizing 
Dr. Lee's life of service.
