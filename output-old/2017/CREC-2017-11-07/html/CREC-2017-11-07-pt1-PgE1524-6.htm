  HONORING CONRADY JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL FOR BEING NAMED A NATIONAL BLUE

                                 ______
                                 

                          HON. DANIEL LIPINSKI

                              of illinois

                    in the house of representatives

                       Tuesday, November 7, 2017

  Mr. LIPINSKI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Conrady 
Junior High School for receiving the prestigious 2017 U.S. Department 
of Education National Blue Ribbon School Award. The school's award was 
conferred under the Exemplary High Performing Schools category.

  In 1982, the U.S. Department of Education established the National 
Blue Ribbon Schools Program to recognize public and private schools 
with high or significantly improved achievement. I am proud that 
Conrady Junior High School, located in Hickory Hills, has been honored 
as an exceptional school.
  The teachers and staff at Conrady Junior High take great care to 
focus on the needs of individual students, and this hard work is 
reflected in the school's academic performance. The school employs a 
unique curriculum with variable length math periods based on student 
need, and daily periods of exploratory and intervention classes.
  This is not the first time Conrady Junior High has been honored for 
excellence in education. The school was designated as a National Title 
I Distinguished School in 2014, which recognizes success in educating 
students who come from families with low socioeconomic status. As 
Principal Andy Anderson often says, ``Conrady is a hard place to work, 
but a great place to work.''
  The Positive Behavior Interventions and Supports (PBIS) program and 
the Academic Student Success Enrichment Teams (ASSETS) developed by 
teachers and administrators have also had a positive impact on student 
achievement. This success has resulted in visits by teachers and 
administrators from other schools seeking to learn about their 
curriculum, methodology, and technology integration.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating Conrady 
Junior High School for this impressive achievement and recognizing the 
teachers, administrators, students, parents, and community for the hard 
work that they have put in to earn this award.
