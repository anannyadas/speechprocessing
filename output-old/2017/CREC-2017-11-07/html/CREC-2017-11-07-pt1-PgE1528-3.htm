  IN RECOGNITION OF THE ACCOMPLISHMENTS OF THE NATIONAL COMMITTEE TO 
   PRESERVE SOCIAL SECURITY AND MEDICARE DURING ITS 35TH ANNIVERSARY

                                 ______
                                 

                          HON. DEBBIE DINGELL

                              of michigan

                    in the house of representatives

                       Tuesday, November 7, 2017

  Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the National 
Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare's (NCPSSM) 35th 
anniversary on the day of its Anniversary Open House. NCPSSM has played 
a critical role in protecting Social Security and Medicare for all 
Americans.
  With the passage of Medicare in 1965 under Title XVII of the Social 
Security Act, our country made a promise that seniors can age with 
dignity and security after a lifetime of hard work. As with the 
implementation of any historic program, it's important that there are 
organizational watchdogs that ensure our government makes good on its 
promise to the American people. There has been no group more committed 
to protecting the tenets of Social Security and Medicare than NCPSSM 
over the past 35 years.
  Founded in 1982 by Congressman James Roosevelt, NCPSSM served as 
response to proposed changes to Social Security and Medicare during a 
time when 24/7 news programs did not exist and seniors needed to be 
informed and mobilized. NCPSSM works side by side with federal, state 
and local lawmakers to protect and build on the safety net programs 
that Americans of all ages depend on. Then, as it does now, the 
Committee provided seniors with a way to organize and make their voices 
heard by lawmakers as well as writing highly regarded, in depth 
analysis on Congressional legislation and Presidential Executive Orders 
regarding Social Security, Medicare, and the federal budget. These 
documents are invaluable in helping everyday Americans understand the 
real impact that legislation will have on their day to day life.
  NCPSSM's efforts have been instrumental in passing bills that better 
the lives of seniors and that protect Social Security and Medicare. In 
2016, the Committee and its members fought hard to pass the ``Older 
Americans Reauthorization Act of 2016'' which funds critical services 
that keep older adults healthy and independent, including job training, 
senior centers, benefits enrollment and caregiver support. 
Additionally, the Committee continues to encourage Americans from all 
corners of the country to participate in petitions, surveys and phone 
banking, with a total of over 90 million petitions and letters sent to 
Congress and the President to date.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring the National 
Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare and its 35 years of 
success. Their advocacy has influenced legislation that protects the 
programs seniors and hardworking Americans depend on.
