  IN RECOGNITION OF NANCY AND GARY STEWART, AND THEIR SHOP, SANDWICH 
                      DEPOT, A CONCORD INSTITUTION

                                 ______
                                 

                           HON. ANN M. KUSTER

                            of new hampshire

                    in the house of representatives

                       Tuesday, November 7, 2017

  Ms. KUSTER of New Hampshire. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize 
Nancy and Gary Stewart, the owners of Sandwich Depot in my hometown of 
Concord, New Hampshire. Through hard work and dedication, Nancy and 
Gary, along with their employees, created a truly special place in our 
community.
  Sandwich Depot opened for business over 28 years ago. In the time 
since, they have turned an inconspicuous building on the side of Hall 
Street into one of the best sandwich shops in the state. Over the 
years, a lot has changed in Concord, but one thing has remained the 
same: if you want a world-class breakfast or lunch, you can find it at 
the Sandwich Depot. Gary has an uncanny ability to remember customers' 
names, and his warm smile and humor make any visitor feel welcome. 
Nancy cooks and assembles sandwiches that leave everyone full and 
satisfied. The shop is covered in historic pictures of Concord and 
local antique signs, which add to the sense that the Depot is a 
uniquely Concord institution.
  My family, friends, and staff--as well as everyone in the Concord 
community--will all miss the Sandwich Depot, but we are confident that 
Nancy and Gary will continue to make wonderful contributions to the 
Concord area in the years to come.
