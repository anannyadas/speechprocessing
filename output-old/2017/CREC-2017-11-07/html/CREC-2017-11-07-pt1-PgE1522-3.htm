IN RECOGNITION OF SUPERINTENDENT JOHN J. DONAHUE ON THE OCCASION OF HIS 
                               RETIREMENT

                                 ______
                                 

                          HON. MATT CARTWRIGHT

                            of pennsylvania

                    in the house of representatives

                       Tuesday, November 7, 2017

  Mr. CARTWRIGHT. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Delaware Water 
Gap National Recreation Area Superintendent John J. Donahue. After a 
38-year tenure with the National Park Service, Mr. Donahue has 
announced he will retire on December 3, 2017.
  Long before he advanced to his current position at the Delaware Water 
Gap National Recreation Area in 2003, Mr. Donahue began his federal 
career as a gardener at Cape Cod National Seashore. From there he 
advanced through the ranks, serving in a variety of roles that took him 
across the continental U.S. After many years, a man who had started his 
career as a gardener became the Superintendent of some of our country's 
most beautiful sites in Florida, Virginia, and Maryland.
  As a dedicated leader, Mr. Donahue oversaw critical projects and 
built relationships with elected officials, business partners, and 
local Native American tribes. Due to a recent stewardship land 
acquisition program, there are now hundreds of acres of connected open 
space stretching across Pennsylvania and New Jersey. However, this is 
just a singular testament to his commitment and drive. During his 
tenure, Mr. Donahue has written legislation, regulations, policies, an 
numerous articles.
  The impact of Mr. Donahue's work extends beyond our country's 
borders. Recently, he led an American and international delegation to 
China on behalf of the National Park Service. He also attended the 
World Parks Conference in Australia and served on a 1999 delegation to 
Haitian national parks in order to spur tourism and economic 
development.
  Mr. Donahue's dedication to his country leaves behind a legacy which 
will inspire future leaders and public servants. I ask my fellow 
Members to join me in recognizing Superintendent John Donahue and his 
38 years of service.
