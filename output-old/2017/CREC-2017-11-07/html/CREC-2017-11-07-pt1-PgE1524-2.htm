  Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Sakari Lyons, a 
strong advocate for women in Solano County, California as a Fellow with 
the Essie Justice Center. A social worker by profession, Sakari 
embodies the qualities and the desire to advocate for women and 
families in need of compassion, empathy and guidance due to the 
incarceration of their loved one.
   Inspired by her own situation, Sakari worked full time for Health 
and Social Services providing resources to children and families when 
she joined the Essie Justice Center. Through the organizations Healing 
to Advocacy program, Sakari has helped many women find strength to heal 
from their wounds through guidance, compassion and faith. She empowers 
and encourages them to be advocates for themselves and their children.
   As a single parent of four children, Sakari was able to pursue her 
education and holds both a B.A. and M.S. degree.
