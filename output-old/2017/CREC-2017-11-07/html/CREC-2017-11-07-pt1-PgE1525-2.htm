               IN MEMORY OF STAFF SERGEANT DUSTIN WRIGHT

                                 ______
                                 

                          HON. RICHARD HUDSON

                           of north carolina

                    in the house of representatives

                       Tuesday, November 7, 2017

  Mr. HUDSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and legacy of 
Staff Sergeant Dustin Wright, who was killed in action on Wednesday, 
October 4, 2017 while defending our nation as part of the 3rd Special 
Forces Group in Africa. SSG Wright was a true American hero and our 
thoughts and prayers go out to his friends and family as they mourn the 
loss of this great man.
  Enlisting in the United States Army in July of 2012, SSG Wright's 
list of accomplishments runs long. After attending Special Forces 
Assessment and Selection program, he earned his Green Beret and was 
assigned to 2nd Battalion, 3rd Special Forces Group. He received 
numerous medals, including the Purple Heart and Meritorious Service 
Medal.
  Men and women like SSG Wright represent the best our nation has to 
offer. As a Special Forces Engineer Sergeant, he had undergone some of 
the most intense training our military has and emerged as a leader and 
role model. His selflessness allows us to enjoy the blessings of 
liberty that have persevered for well over 200 years. When his country 
needed him most, he stood ready to answer the call to serve our great 
nation.
  Our country can never repay the debt we owe to SSG Wright. He was a 
model citizen and soldier whose legacy will live on forever. He will 
always be remembered and I will do everything in my power to honor his 
sacrifice.
  Mr. Speaker, please join me today in commemorating the life of Staff 
Sergeant Dustin Wright for his service to God and country.

                          ____________________
