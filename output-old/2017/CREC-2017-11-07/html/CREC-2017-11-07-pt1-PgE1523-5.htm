     HONORING RICHARD COOVER FOR HIS LEGACY AND COURAGEOUS SERVICE

                                 ______
                                 

                             HON. RAUL RUIZ

                             of california

                    in the house of representatives

                       Tuesday, November 7, 2017

  Mr. RUIZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise to celebrate the life and honor the 
memory of Richard Coover, a loving father and husband. Richard, who 
valiantly served our nation during World War II in the U.S. Marine 
Corps, passed away on October 27, 2017 at the age of 92.
  In February 1945, three U.S. Marine divisions landed on Iwo Jima, 
Japan; Richard was one of them. He not only survived the war, but he 
also endured and bravely defended our country facing many challenges. 
He fought right at the bottom of Mount Suribachi while bearing the 
sound of explosions that lasted all night long.
  Richard is indeed a hero. He was just a young man, thousands of miles 
away from his home, his friends, and his family when he bravely served 
our country in Japan. His actions embody the true meaning of valor.
  When I met Richard, I was deeply touched by his humility and spirit 
of service. He passionately expressed his love for our nation and was 
proud to have witnessed the U.S. flag being raised in Iwo Jima. His 
courage and strength is truly an inspiration.
  Richard's courage was displayed not only overseas, but also when 
fighting against cancer. My office had the honor to help him obtain 
medical assistance. I even had the humbling opportunity to present him 
with a flag that was flown over the U.S. Capitol in honor of his 
service. Throughout the process, Richard maintained an admirable and 
graceful presence.
  Mr. Speaker, I am proud to recognize and honor an outstanding 
constituent, Richard Coover. On behalf of California's 36th 
Congressional District, I extend my deepest respects and condolences to 
his family. His years of committed service to our nation are an example 
of excellence and dedication, all should seek to emulate.
