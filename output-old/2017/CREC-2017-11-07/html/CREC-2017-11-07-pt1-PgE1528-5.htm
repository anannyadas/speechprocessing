           IN MEMORY OF SERGEANT FIRST CLASS JEREMIAH JOHNSON

                                 ______
                                 

                          HON. RICHARD HUDSON

                           of north carolina

                    in the house of representatives

                       Tuesday, November 7, 2017

  Mr. HUDSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and legacy of 
Sergeant First Class Jeremiah Johnson, who was killed in action on 
Wednesday, October 4, 2017 while defending our nation as part of the 
3rd Special Forces Group in Africa. SFC Johnson was a true American 
hero and our thoughts and prayers go out to his friends and family as 
they mourn the loss of this great man.
  Enlisting in the United States Army in October of 2007, SFC Johnson's 
list of accomplishments runs long. He received numerous medals, 
including the Purple Heart and Meritorious Service Medal.
  Men and women like SFC Johnson represent the best our nation has to 
offer. As a Chemical, Biological Radiological and Nuclear Specialist, 
he had undergone some of the most specialized training in our military 
and emerged as a leader and role model. His selflessness allows us to 
enjoy the blessings of liberty that have persevered for well over 200 
years. When his country needed him most, he stood ready to answer the 
call to serve our great nation.
  Leaving behind a wife and two girls, our country can never repay the 
debt we owe to SFC Johnson. He was a model citizen and soldier whose 
legacy will live on forever. He will always be remembered and I will do 
everything in my power to honor his sacrifice.
  Mr. Speaker, please join me today in commemorating the life of 
Sergeant First Class Jeremiah Johnson for his service to God and 
country.
