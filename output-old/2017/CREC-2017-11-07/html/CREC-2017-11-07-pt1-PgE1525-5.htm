Blue Ribbon School by the U.S. Department of Education. Chosen for its 
exemplary high performance, as measured by state and national 
assessments, Liberty Elementary School was one of 342 schools to attain 
this honor from across the nation and one of only 25 schools selected 
from California. This highly competitive award reflects outstanding 
achievement and the highest caliber of professional service, family 
commitment, and community engagement.
  With 219 students across seven grades, Liberty Elementary School 
offers comprehensive educational programs that academically challenge 
and instill a joy of learning in its students while ensuring that all 
children have the skills and knowledge to reach their full potential.
  Mr. Speaker, this hard-earned distinction reflects true community 
success. From the students and their families, to the staff and 
administrators, and the extended community, Liberty Elementary School 
has developed an education model for the state and the nation: 
empowering today's students to be tomorrow's problem-solvers, 
inventors, and pioneers. Please join me in congratulating Liberty 
Elementary School on this impressive achievement.
