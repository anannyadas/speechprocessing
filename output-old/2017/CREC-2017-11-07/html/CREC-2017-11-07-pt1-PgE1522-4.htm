unable to be in Washington and missed Roll Call votes No. 607, To amend 
title 38, United States Code, to authorize the Secretary of Veterans 
Affairs to furnish assistance for adaptations of residences of veterans 
in rehabilitation programs under chapter 31 of such title, and for 
other purposes; and No. 608, To direct the Secretary of Veterans 
Affairs to submit to the Committees on Veterans' Affairs of the Senate 
and the House of Representatives a report regarding the organizational 
structure of the Department of Veterans Affairs, and for other 
purposes. Had I been present, I would have voted Yes on both bills.
