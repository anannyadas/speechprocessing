                              of kentucky

                    in the house of representatives

                       Tuesday, November 14, 2017

  Mr. COMER. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to honor the outstanding career 
of Dr. Theodore Davies.
   It all began in the mountains of eastern Kentucky, making house 
calls with his Father. Often, there was no road to help them travel 
where they needed to go; but, still, they found a way or made their 
own. This would become the story of young Theodore Edwin Clyde Davies' 
life. A life spent in dedication to others.
   His formal education began at the prestigious McCallie School 
located on Missionary Ridge in Chattanooga, Tennessee. Founded in 1905, 
McCallie is highly regarded as a private, Christian based college 
preparatory school for young boys and men, grades 6 through 12. Here, 
the virtues of honor, truth, and duty would be fostered, and he would 
encounter the question, ``What is man's chief end?''
   Young Theodore next found his way to Vanderbilt University and 
graduated in 1967. Answering the call to follow in his Father's 
footsteps, he then attended the University of Louisville School of 
Medicine and graduated in 1971. His surgical internships and residency 
in Neurosurgery would take him to the Indiana Medical Center, and 
Montreal, Canada. In Montreal, he would train on the first CT scanner 
in North America. Later, during his training in Louisville, he would 
begin treating patients with the first CT scans in the United States.
   The next leg of his journey would lead to the service of his country 
in the United States Navy. Reporting to both Portsmouth, Virginia, and 
Okinawa, Japan, he would leave the service with the rank of Lt. 
Commander.
   Finally, on to Paducah, Kentucky, answering the need for a private 
Neurosurgical practice. Here, he would make his home with his wife, 
Debbie--the most beautiful nurse he had ever seen. That home would 
eventually include the blessings of Ann, Teddy, Ellen and Emily. Now, 
37 years later, they continue to be blessed with new additions, 
including 4 grandchildren.
   As he concludes his active practice and retires this December, he 
looks forward to traveling and spending time with family, reading all 
those books that have been on his ``to do list'' for years, and hitting 
the greens every chance he gets. He will also be able to reflect upon 
his work as a physician and surgeon and know that he has upheld his 
Oath to others. He knows well, and has shared with countless others, 
that the answers to man's chief end is ``to glorify God and to enjoy 
Him forever.'' I thank Dr. Davies; well done, Sir.
