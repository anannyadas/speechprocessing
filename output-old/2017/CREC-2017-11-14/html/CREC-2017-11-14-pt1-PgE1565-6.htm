                     RECOGNIZING THE SMILEY FAMILY

                                 ______
                                 

                           HON. JOHN J. FASO

                              of new york

                    in the house of representatives

                       Tuesday, November 14, 2017

  Mr. FASO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and honor the Smiley 
Family of Mohonk Mountain House for being named the recipients of the 
2017 Legendary Family Historic Hoteliers of the Year by Historic Hotels 
of America and Historic Hotels Worldwide. This prestigious award 
acknowledges multigenerational, family-owned historic hotels that are 
exemplary in both their operation and preservation efforts. It is true 
testament to the Smiley Family's continued legacy of historical, 
environmental, and cultural stewardship.
  Founded in 1869 by Albert Smiley, the Mohonk Mountain House--a 
picturesque Victorian castle resort surrounded by vast forests and 
wildlife--is still owned and operated by the Smiley Family. What makes 
the Mohonk Mountain House such a prized treasure in the 19th District, 
and an attraction for travelers worldwide, is the Smiley Family's 
dedication to conserving the historical integrity of their resort and 
the land surrounding it.
  Using their timeless resort as a catalyst for historical, 
environmental, and cultural preservation, the Smiley Family has 
redefined the role of hoteliers and has established a higher standard 
of excellence. For example, in 1963, the Smiley Family founded the 
Mohonk Preserve, a nature preserve that safeguards more than 8,000 
acres. In 1980, the Smiley Family also founded Mohonk Consultations, a 
non-profit think tank focused on environmental issues throughout the 
Hudson Valley.

  On behalf of New York's 19th District, I want to congratulate and 
celebrate the Smiley Family on their much-deserved award. We are 
grateful for the Smiley Family's dedication to the values we in the 
19th District hold dear: environmental conservancy and a profound 
appreciation for history and culture.
