              CELEBRATING THE CAREER OF MS. ELAINE ROBERTS

                                 ______
                                 

                           HON. STEVE STIVERS

                                of ohio

                    in the house of representatives

                       Tuesday, November 14, 2017

  Mr. STIVERS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today on behalf of the people of 
Ohio's 15th Congressional District to celebrate the career of Ms. 
Elaine Roberts, as she retires from service as the President and Chief 
Executive Officer of the Columbus Regional Airport Authority.
  For over a decade, Ms. Roberts has served as the first-ever CEO of a 
combined aviation authority. She was named to the newly-created 
position in January of 2003, and has utilized her experience as an 
Accredited Airport Executive (A.A.E.), and the past Chair of the 
American Association of Airport Executives (AAAE).
  Ms. Roberts' leadership has guided the Authority during a period of 
expansive growth, including the merger of two airport authorities, more 
than one billion dollars in airport infrastructure development, and 
historic improvements at the John Glenn Columbus and the Rickenbacker 
International Airport facilities.
  Ms. Roberts is a true coalition-builder. She successfully brought 
stakeholders across the federal, state, and local levels, along with 
the private sector, to develop the Rickenbacker Intermodal Facility. 
Her efforts to transform Rickenbacker into a leading center for trade 
led to her nomination and selection as a 2015 White House Champion of 
Change in Transportation.
  Her contributions to the Central Ohio community and local economy are 
immeasurable. International and domestic freight operations--served by 
rail, highways, and international activation--helped to provide a 
livelihood for over 20,000 residents in the region.
  Ms. Roberts will be missed by her colleagues and fellow aviation 
executives, but I join the Ohio delegation in wishing her all the best 
as she begins a new chapter in her life and pursues future endeavors. I 
ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating Ms. Elaine Roberts on 
her invaluable service to the residents of Ohio, and the aviation 
industry at large.
