             TRIBUTE TO THE LIFE OF RODNEY MAURICE GILBERT

                                 ______
                                 

                       HON. DONALD M. PAYNE, JR.

                             of new jersey

                    in the house of representatives

                       Tuesday, November 14, 2017

  Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor the life and legacy of Rodney 
Maurice Gilbert, a giant in New Jersey arts and social justice 
activism. For the past fifteen years, Mr. Gilbert led Yendor 
Productions, a Newark-based firm he founded in order to develop and 
produce arts education programming that elevates oppressed voices. He 
was a dedicated artist, educator, and community leader.
   Mr. Gilbert devoted his life to helping underserved communities find 
their artistic voices. After graduating from the University of the Arts 
in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Mr. Gilbert spent three decades serving 
the arts community in New Jersey. He was an accomplished actor with 
credits on stages from Broadway to Little Rock. He was a gifted 
director known for shining artistic light on social issues such as 
mental illness. And he was an educator who inspired young artists to 
bring to life the untold stories of underserved communities.
   Mr. Gilbert left a lasting impact on New Jersey. He helped heal 
Newark by paving the way for people to use arts and culture as vehicles 
for advancing social justice. Mr. Gilbert brought people together. He 
inspired young people. And he created a platform for people to 
creatively tell their own stories. In July, Mr. Gilbert directed Down 
Neck, a play written by Pia Wilson that explores the 1967 Newark 
Rebellion's impacts on the Ironbound neighborhood. His inspirational 
use of arts as a means to speak truth, preserve history, and pursue 
justice has left a permanent mark on the New Jersey arts scene.
   Mr. Gilbert passed away on November 8, 2017, but his legacy will 
live on. I ask that my colleagues join me in honoring the life of 
Rodney Gilbert--artist, teacher, advocate, and friend.
