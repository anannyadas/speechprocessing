                    in the house of representatives

                       Tuesday, November 14, 2017

  Mr. MEEHAN. Mr. Speaker, today I recognize Alfred ``Ray'' Coe of 
Chester County, Pennsylvania, for his life dedicated to serving his 
community and our country. Mr. Coe honorably served the United States 
Army during Vietnam in three Calvary units in addition to serving his 
community of Kennett Square, Pennsylvania as a volunteer Scoutmaster 
with the Boy Scouts of America. Mr. Coe has also worked with his local 
government in various positions.
  Mr. Coe received three promotions during his tour in Vietnam. He was 
injured when his vehicle was blown up by a mine, but courageously 
returned and rescued his Sergeant from the vehicle. For these and other 
efforts he earned numerous awards for his honorable service. Among the 
honors were the Purple Heart, Bronze Star, and Army Commendation for 
Valor, of which he is most proud. Upon returning home, Mr. Coe began 
volunteering with the Boy Scouts of America, eventually becoming 
Scoutmaster. Mr. Coe continued his service to his community through the 
Scouts working as his district's Unit, Training, and Roundtable 
Commissioner. Mr. Coe's years of service to his country and neighbors 
are invaluable. There is no doubt he has saved and improved the lives 
of many through that service.
  I commend Mr. Alfred Coe for his passionate dedication to community 
and country. He has earned the respect of his friends, family, and 
colleagues, as well as the public he has served. I thank him for all he 
has done and continues to do
