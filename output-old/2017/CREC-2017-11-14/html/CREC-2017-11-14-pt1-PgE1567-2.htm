                       Tuesday, November 14, 2017

  Mr. BIGGS. Mr. Speaker, today I honor my constituent Grant R. Ward. 
Grant of Gilbert, Arizona. He has been chosen to receive the Lifetime 
Achievement Award from the National Water Resources Association (NWRA).
  This lifetime achievement award was established in 1948. According to 
the NWRA, this award ``recognizes members and individuals who have 
actively served in the leadership of the Association for many years and 
who, by their activities and service to the goals and objective of the 
Association, merit Life Member status.'' Grant embodies the spirit of 
this distinguished award.
  Grant has an impressive resume of service. He graduated from Brigham 
Young University in 1967 and received his law degree in 1969 from the 
University of Idaho. From there, he commenced his professional career, 
serving as an assistant branch manager at the Valley National Bank. He 
then took a job as General Manager of the Roosevelt Water Conservation 
District serving there for over a decade. Following this position, he 
continued his distinguished career as Executive Vice President of the 
Agri-Business Council of Arizona, Assistant General Manager of the 
Central Arizona Water Conservation District, and General Manager of the 
Maricopa-Stanfield Irrigation & Drainage District. He currently is an 
independent water and power consultant.
  Grant is married to Judy and their family includes seven children and 
36 grandchildren.
  Mr. Speaker, Grant has a remarkable track record of service to our 
community. He has provided a great example for his children of the 
value of hard work and giving back through his conservative efforts.
  I applaud Grant for his award, and I look forward to his continued 
service.
