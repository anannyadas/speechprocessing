          H.R. 3705, THE VETERANS FAIR DEBT NOTICE ACT OF 2017

                                 ______
                                 

                  HON. HENRY C. ``HANK'' JOHNSON, JR.

                               of georgia

                    in the house of representatives

                       Tuesday, November 14, 2017

  Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise to support H.R. 3705, the 
Veterans Fair Debt Notice Act of 2017. H.R. 3705 modifies the ways that 
veterans are notified of any outstanding debts from a Department of 
Veterans Affairs (VA) program.
  This bill is essential because current VA debt notification letters 
can be confusing, highly technical, and fail to convey important dates 
and amounts. This legislation would direct the VA to clarify language 
in debt notification emails, coordinate email and postal mail 
notifications, and study the process of debt notification to ensure 
that messages are communicated effectively. The cost of sending postal 
mail notifications would also be evaluated in this study.
  Congress should take measures to reduce veterans' debt by effectively 
communicating outstanding payments and due dates. Reducing debt is one 
of many ways we can ensure a smoother transition into civilian society 
for our veterans, which is why I support this legislation.
