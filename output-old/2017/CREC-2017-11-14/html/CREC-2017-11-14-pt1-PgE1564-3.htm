  IN RECOGNITION OF RICHARD KERN AND A TRADITION OF COMMUNITY SERVICE

                                 ______
                                 

                          HON. MATT CARTWRIGHT

                            of pennsylvania

                    in the house of representatives

                       Tuesday, November 14, 2017

  Mr. CARTWRIGHT. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Richard Kern for 
his 50 years of service in the East Bangor Fire Department. His 
accomplishments were celebrated by his peers on the evening of 
Saturday, November 11.
  As a resident of Bangor, Pennsylvania, Richard has been a constant 
steward of public safety in my District for a half-century. Richard led 
the department as Fire Chief from 1993 to 1995. During his service he 
inspired confidence and put his own life at risk to ensure the safety 
of others. Today, he remains an active member of the fire department as 
Safety Officer. His dedication to helping others extends beyond the 
East Bangor Fire Department. Richard is also a life member of the Blue 
Valley Rescue Squad, an organization founded in 1973 to provide 
emergency services to the Slate Belt region.
  I ask my fellow Members to join me in recognizing Richard Kern for 
life of service and commitment to the well-being of his community.
