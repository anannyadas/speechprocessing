                         HONORING ALICE'S KIDS

                                 ______
                                 

                       HON. DONALD S. BEYER, JR.

                              of virginia

                    in the house of representatives

                       Tuesday, November 14, 2017

  Mr. BEYER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to discuss a wonderful 
organization within my district. There are roughly 20,000 children in 
Fairfax County living at the poverty level. These children suffer both 
privately and publicly. Privately, they may not have enough food, no 
heat or no electricity. All hardships indeed. But when that same child 
leaves the home, they suffer public indignities that can seriously 
affect their self-esteem. When they go to school wearing the same dress 
for five straight days or shoes with holes in them, they can be targets 
of ridicule. When they cannot afford their senior dues, a sport's 
physical or a gym uniform, they are embarrassed. When they have to sit 
home while their friends are enjoying the prom, they experience pain. 
These situations are especially acute when poor children are integrated 
with wealthier children, as is often the case in Fairfax County.
   Seven years ago this month, my constituent and friend, Ron 
Fitzsimmons, formed ``Alice's Kids,'' a charity designed to give needy 
children the opportunity to feel a little bit more ``normal'' amongst 
their peers. They have built a network of approximately 500 teachers, 
school counselors and county social workers who contact Alice's Kids 
when they identify a child with a ``minor'' but nonetheless important 
need. It might be a pair of soccer cleats, glasses or summer camp fees. 
The child might not be able to afford their senior yearbook, wishes to 
take music lessons or needs a simple haircut. Within 24 hours, Alice's 
Kids either writes a check or issues a gift card to the referrer so the 
child can obtain the item. And the charity purposely does not interact 
with the family as they prefer to be anonymous to help the child 
maintain their dignity.
   I am pleased to see that this once small charity is now expanding. 
In addition to children in Fairfax County, they are now serving 
children in the City of Alexandria and in select schools in Washington, 
D.C. Even more exciting is that Mr. Fitzsimmons is carrying out his 
ultimate goal, which is to serve children all across the country as 
they are now helping children in San Antonio, Seattle, Miami, 
Charlotte, Nashville and several other cities working in conjunction 
with the national organization ``Communities in Schools.''
   In 2016, Alice's Kids provided assistance to 683 children. But I am 
thrilled to note that in 2017, they have already served 767 children! 
This is the little charity that could. I want to congratulate Alice's 
Kids as they continue to provide much-needed assistance to children in 
the D.C. Metropolitan area and wish them luck in their efforts to reach 
as many children as possible.
