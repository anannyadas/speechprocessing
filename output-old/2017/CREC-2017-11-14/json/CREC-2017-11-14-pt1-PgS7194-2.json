Madam President, I am here to respond to the \nnomination of Steven Bradbury for a senior legal position in the U.S. \nDepartment of Transportation. I have had some experience with Mr. \nBradbury, and in my experience, he is disqualified from serving in a \nlegal government position of trust, such as he has been nominated for.\n  The Bush administration pursued a policy of detainee mistreatment \nthat since has been acknowledged to include torture of detainees. The \nprocess that got the United States of America into a place where it was \ntorturing detainees was a legal process that was full of mistakes and \nfailures by the Office of Legal Counsel at the Department of Justice--\nby Mr. Bybee, by Mr. Yoo, and, following them, by Mr. Bradbury.\n  Let's start with just a word on the Office of Legal Counsel. Within \nthe Department of Justice, the Office of Legal Counsel is seen as being \nthe best of the best. The Department of Justice prides itself on \nattracting, training, and perfecting the skills of the best lawyers in \nAmerica.\n  As a U.S. Attorney, I had the privilege of serving with a lot of \nabsolutely spectacularly skilled lawyers and trial advocates just in \nthe small Rhode Island U.S. attorney's office and working with others \nfrom the Department of Justice, and I have a very, very high opinion of \nDepartment of Justice lawyers and Department of Justice lawyering. But \neven within the expectation that the Department of Justice lawyering \nwill be first rate, the Office of Legal Counsel is supposed to be a cut \nabove. These are people who go into that office with the possibility \nthat they will become U.S. Supreme Court Justices. These are people who \ncome out of clerkships on the U.S. Supreme Court--one of the highest \nacademic achievements a law student can have--and end up joining the \nOffice of Legal Counsel. The Office of Legal Counsel ought to be held \nto a very high standard.\n  What happened when the Office of Legal Counsel was asked to take a \nlook at the CIA torture program in the Bush administration was that it \nfell down or rolled over in virtually every respect. The factual \ninvestigation into what the CIA was actually doing was weak and \nineffectual. The legal investigation into the past, into precedents, \nwas--as I said in previous speeches at the time--fire-the-associate \nquality legal work. It is particularly bad coming from the Office of \nLegal Counsel because the Office of Legal Counsel is supposed to be the \nbest of the best.\n  It is hard to say that these guys failed having tried their best. \nThey just weren't smart enough to figure it out. They just weren't \nworking hard enough. They just didn't know enough about legal research \nor scholarship. So, you know, nice try but you blew it, but no harm in \nit because we don't expect much of you to begin with.\n  That is certainly not the case with OLC. The array of memos that the \nOLC wrote--the Bybee, Yoo, and Bradbury memos--were calamitous failures \nof historical and legal research. For one thing, they failed to \nrecognize and report that there had been prosecutions of Japanese \nmilitary officers after World War II for torturing American soldiers. \nOne of the techniques of torture for which those Japanese soldiers were \nprosecuted and convicted as torturers, as war criminals, was the use of \nthe waterboard. You may be able to say that there were some different \njustifications. You may be able to say that there were some different \ncircumstances, but to not even mention that, to not even do the \nresearch to find out that had taken place is a pretty bad legal \nfailing.\n  One of the reasons was that they kept it so close hold that they \ndidn't let military lawyers know what they were doing. One could argue \nthat there is consciousness of guilt there, that they didn't want \nother lawyers to know what they were doing because they knew that what \nthey were doing was shoddy legal work and they didn't want to be caught \nout in it. In fact, ultimately, a lot of those opinions were withdrawn.\n\n  The fact of the matter is that it was a failure to properly inform \nthe President of the United States about this history of our country \nactually prosecuting Japanese soldiers for the type of conduct that the \nDepartment of Justice was approving that the CIA engage in. It wasn't \njust prosecutions of Japanese soldiers by American military tribunals. \nThere were also prosecutions of American soldiers in the Philippines by \ncourts-marshal for torture. Guess what. The conduct involved was \nwaterboarding.\n  Again, perhaps you can say that there were some differences, that \nthere were some distinctions, but the fact is, in memo after memo--\nincluding the wrapup memo that Bradbury wrote--that was not discussed. \nIt was not disclosed, and it was not discussed.\n  You may say: Well, you know, it is asking an awful lot of the Office \nof Legal Counsel to go and look at history, to go and look at the \npractice of our military in prosecuting adversary officers or in \nprosecuting our own soldiers. After all, we are just the Department of \nJustice. That is the Department of Defense. What could we possibly \nlearn from that?\n  Well, obviously, that would be wrong and, obviously, that would be a \nmistake, particularly when you look across that boundary to military \nlaw and see these examples right on point that they did not bother to \ndiscuss or disclose.\n  Then, it gets better still. The OLC memos failed to disclose \nprosecutions by the Department of Justice for waterboarding. This is \nnot some case that never got reported someplace, that was just a trial, \nand you would have to look deep into your own records to try to find \nout what took place--perhaps, without a reported decision, just a \nverdict from the jury. This was a case that was extensively documented \nwith writings by the trial court judge, a U.S. district judge in the \nState of Texas, that went up on appeal to the circuit court of appeals, \nand the U.S. circuit court of appeals wrote a decision on appeal of the \ndistrict court's decision.\n\n\n  What were the facts? The facts were that there was a local sheriff. \nHis last name was Lee. So the case was named United States v. Lee. Mr. \nLee had gone into the business of waterboarding prisoners--strapping \nthem in a chair, tipping them back, and pouring water over their faces \nto give the illusion of drowning. The court's decision over and over \ndescribes this conduct as torture. If you use legal search tools and \nlook for the words ``water'' and ``torture,'' United States v. Lee \ncomes up, and it is a circuit court of appeals decision.\n  How could they miss it? There are only two explanations that I can \ncome up with. One is that they really did a shoddy job of workmanship, \nthat they didn't bother to do basic legal research. That is why I have \ndescribed this in the past as fire-the-associate quality work. If you \nhaven't done the basic legal research to determine what the cases are \non point on the question of whether the use of water on bound prisoners \nis torture, you haven't done much of a good job. The problem is that \nscenario is actually the best case scenario. The best case scenario is \nthat they did such slipshod work at the Office of Legal Counsel that \nthey didn't find a U.S. circuit court of appeals decision on point to \nthe question upon which the OLC was advising the President of the \nUnited States. That is the best case scenario.\n  The worst case scenario is that they did find it and decided not to \ntalk about it in their memos because you can read United States v. Lee \nand put it against those OLC memos, and I think any rational reader \nwill find them impossible to correlate.\n  There is a real possibility that the Office of Legal Counsel decided \nthat, because Cheney had decided on this torture program and because \nthey were embarked on this torture program, they were going to have to \ndeliver the legal opinion that allowed it to continue. If it meant \nignoring a case that proved their opinion wrong, they were going to \nignore the case, and they were going to go ahead with the opinion. As \nyou can imagine, that is considerably worse than simply not finding the \ncase.\n  We have never had a very good description of how this all came out. \nThere was an OPR report from the Department of Justice that heaped \ncondemnation on the various players here, but ultimately this question \nof what the obligation is of an OLC lawyer to fairly disclose what the \nrelevant case law is in writing an OLC opinion was never reached. It \nwas never reached because, at the end of this long and arduous process, \nthe Department of Justice made, I think, a terrible decision.\n  There is a rule of professional conduct that is called the rule of \ncandor to the tribunal. If you are a lawyer and you are going before a \njudge, you have an obligation to state the law fairly and accurately to \nthe judge. If you are not being truthful to the judge about what the \nlaw is, that is a violation of professional conduct for which lawyers \ncan be sanctioned. It applies to lawyers across the board. A hard-\nworking lawyer with six or seven files under his arms, piling into a \nState district court to maybe run through three or four cases in that \nday before a busy judge, has the obligation of candor, and it includes \nan obligation to do adequate research, to actually have looked up the \ncase law and to disclose it to the judge so that you are not misleading \nthe court about the state of the law. That applies to lawyers across \nthe country. The busiest, most distracted local lawyer and just a guy \nwith a practice, maybe in a strip mall, who buzzes into court with a \nbunch of files under his arms--that lawyer is under that same \nobligation.\n  Yet the Office of Legal Counsel--this high temple of lawyering, this \n``best of the best'' of the Department of Justice--made the decision \nthat those lawyers, in their providing advice to the President of the \nUnited States, did not have the same obligation of candor that an \nordinary, day-to-day, working lawyer in a local courthouse had to that \nlocal judge.\n  I believe that rule has since been reversed, and it is very good that \nit has been reversed because I think the President of the United States \nis entitled to at least the level of candor from these ``best of the \nbest'' lawyers at the Office of Legal Counsel that a local judge is \nfrom the hard-working, overburdened, day-to-day lawyers who appear in \nfront of him or her. That is not what the President got, not from this \nOffice of Legal Counsel, not from Steve Bradbury.\n  Again, I don't know that we will ever know because that decision by \nthe Department put to an end the investigation of the question of \nwhether this failure amounted to professional malpractice by the OLC \nlawyers, but the options aren't great. These lawyers either did not do \nthe work to discover the military tribunals, the courts-martial, and \nthe Texas criminal prosecution by the Department of Justice, or, worse \nyet, they did discover those things and deliberately withheld that \ninformation so that they could give the opinion they thought they were \nsupposed to give. It is about the worst thing a lawyer in that position \ncould do, and until that is cleared up, I could not possibly support \nthe nomination of Steven Bradbury to any position of trust in the \nGovernment of the United States.\n  I yield the floor.", "turn": 1, "speaker": "Mr. WHITEHOUSE", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, 2 days ago, I visited the community of \nSutherland Springs, TX, which is a small, rural community about 35 \nmiles from San Antonio, TX. We all remember the terrible shooting that \noccurred there just over a week ago at the First Baptist Church, an \nevent that those in Sutherland Springs and across Texas and maybe even \nacross the Nation will never forget. I hope we never forget it because \nI believe that those events were, by and large, preventable, and I will \nexplain more about that in a moment.\n  What I saw during my visit and what I found to be so remarkable is \nthat the community has already started the healing process. Already, \nthe church building that was riddled with bullets and the bodies of \npeople who were killed and injured has been turned into a memorial \nwhich will forever mark the terrible events of that day and honor the \nlives of those who lost their lives.\n  After an excruciating trial that the rest of us cannot even begin to \ncomprehend, the attitude in Sutherland Springs is incredibly hopeful \nand resilient. First Baptist held its Sunday service just 7 days after \nthe congregation lost 26 of its members. Can you imagine that--just a \nweek later, showing up for another church service a week after a gunman \nshot up the church, killing 26 people and injuring 20 more.\n  I went there for no other purpose than to lend a shoulder to the \nmourning and to try to offer what little encouragement I could. \nStrangely, what happened is that the reverse occurred: They gave me \nmore hope and inspiration than I ever could have imagined. This shows \nhow the shooter's ultimate plan failed. Evil never triumphs.\n  Just ask Pastor Mark Collins, who pointed out that the First Baptist \nChurch has been open for nearly 100 years but that on Sunday, the \ncongregation smashed its alltime attendance record.\n  Ask Pastor Frank Pomeroy, who lost his 14-year-old daughter in the \nattack but was already back doing the Lord's work of consoling other \nmembers of his church when he himself lost his own 14-year-old \ndaughter. Pastor Pomeroy said: ``We have the freedom to choose, and \nrather than choose darkness, like the young man did that day, we choose \nthe light.'' He said: ``Love never fails.''\n  It was an emotional service, to be sure. It was an honor and, as I \nsaid, an inspiration to join the Sunday worship service and to visit \nthe church that has been transformed into that stunningly beautiful \nmemorial to commemorate the victims.\n  The day before, I had had a chance to visit with a number of \nvictims--and their family members--who are recovering in local area \nhospitals. We cannot forget them as they continue to heal or forget the \nrest of the 20 who were wounded by the gunman that day--a man who was \nclearly deranged, was a convicted felon, someone who had been \nhospitalized for mental illness and had escaped, and someone who had \nbeen found guilty of domestic violence against his wife, including the \nfracturing of his infant stepson's skull.\n  We now know that when it comes to the shooter, there were plenty of \nwarning signs. The gunman's former colleague has said that he was \nalways on\n\n\nedge and that he scared her both while he was in the Air Force and \nthrough disturbing social media posts afterward. There were multiple \nred flags along the way--school suspensions, threats of killing his \nsuperiors, depression, the abuse of animals, choking his wife, as I \nsaid, fracturing his stepson's skull, and doing time in a military \nprison. One thing is abundantly clear: We can do more when it comes to \nspotting these flags, including in the military.\n  Where the law currently provides that an individual who is convicted \nof a felony or convicted of domestic violence or somebody who has been \nfound to be mentally ill by a court--we can make sure and do better to \nmake sure that those individuals do not purchase a firearm. Current law \ndisqualifies them, but unless the results are uploaded on the FBI's \nbackground check system, there is no way to catch them when they lie. \nThey are asked when they purchase a firearm at a firearms dealer: Have \nyou ever been convicted of a felony? Have you ever been convicted of \ndomestic violence? Have you ever been committed for mental illness? If \nthey lie and the background check system is simply silent, then there \nis no way to know and no way to stop them, and that is what happened to \nthis shooter.\n  We know now that the Air Force and the other branches of the military \nare considering what additional steps to take to make sure this never \nhappens again. I appreciate their prompt response, but it should never \nhave come down to this.\n  Now we have to do our part to ensure that this sort of preventable \ndisaster never happens again. Don't get me wrong--I don't believe we \ncan somehow wave a magic wand or pass a law that will prevent manmade \ndisasters in every instance in the future, but this one could have been \nprevented. We could have kept this shooter from buying a firearm \nthrough a legal firearms dealer. If the background check system had \nbeen accurate, he would not have been able to do so.\n  Today, I plan to introduce legislation to ensure that Federal \nagencies report and upload criminal records onto the background check \nsystem--records that are already required to be so but often that are \nnot. As we know, this was a major problem that led to the rampage in \nSutherland Springs. My bill would also reauthorize the two primary \ngrant programs that help the States report and upload their own records \nand incentivize States to improve overall compliance.\n  We know that just down the road in Virginia a few years ago, the \nrecords of a young man who had been adjudicated as mentally ill by the \nState of Virginia had never been uploaded into the background check \nsystem. Like this shooter in Sutherland Springs, when he went to \npurchase a firearm, there was never a hit on the FBI's background check \nsystem, and he simply lied about his mental health record.\n  It has been estimated that some 7 million records--including at least \n25 percent of felony convictions and a large number of convictions for \nmisdemeanor domestic violence--have not been posted on the background \ncheck system. That is outrageous. I doubt that any of us knew this \nbeforehand, but we know it now, and it is within our power to fix it. \nWe can all agree that this has to change and that this cannot stand.\n  Let me be clear. I think that law-abiding gun owners, under the \nSecond Amendment, can and should be allowed to purchase and possess \nfirearms. As somebody who enjoys hunting and sports and shooting, I \nbelieve that every law-abiding American should possess the same right \nthat I have to purchase firearms for recreation, for hunting, or for \ndefending our families or property. In fact, that is what happened in \nSutherland Springs. Sutherland Springs proves why guns can save lives \nwhen in the hands of law-abiding citizens. But if you have a long, \ndocumented history of dangerous behavior, if you are convicted of \ncommitting violent acts, under the law, you are not allowed to have \nguns. Today, we have to ensure that those laws will be enforced, and my \nbill will help to do that.\n  This is really an incredible story. When I went to Sutherland \nSprings, I learned more about Stephen Willeford, whom I have spoken \nabout before. Stephen Willeford lived about a block from the First \nBaptist Church, and he heard the shooting. I think it was his daughter \nwho alerted him to it. He got his AR-15 out of the gun safe in his \nhome, and he ran about a block away while barefoot. He saw the shooter \nexit the church. He, in turn, decided that it was up to him because \nthere was not anybody else to stop him.\n  Mr. Willeford, fortunately, is an NRA-certified shooting instructor \nand an expert marksman, and he shot and wounded the person who \ncommitted this mass atrocity, who then dropped his firearm, got in a \ntruck, and led him on a high-speed chase. Thanks to Mr. Willeford and \nanother Good Samaritan, they chased that shooter until ultimately the \nshooter took his own life. That shows you what can happen when law-\nabiding citizens--gun owners--can come to the aid of others. When the \npolice are not present and there is nobody else around, Good Samaritans \ncan help save lives.\n\n\n                               Tax Reform\n\n  Madam President, I would like to shift to a separate topic that the \nSenate will be addressing this week, and that is tax reform.\n  Last Thursday, the Senate Finance Committee introduced our proposal \nthat would enable more Americans to keep more of their hard-earned \npaychecks--send less of their money to Uncle Sam here in Washington, \nDC.\n  Yesterday, the Senate Finance Committee on which I serve began the \nmarkup with the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act with a series of opening \nstatements. Soon--tomorrow, perhaps--members of the committee will have \nan opportunity to consider and debate more than 300 filed amendments.\n  This morning, during the proceedings, some of my colleagues across \nthe aisle complained about the process. They said: This isn't a \nbipartisan bill.\n  I said: That is because you have refused so far to participate in the \nprocess.\n  They said: The bill is secret.\n  I said: Well, you are going to have an opportunity to see it, read \nit, amend it, and debate it on the Senate floor and in committee.\n  They then had the audacity to claim that this was all just a giveaway \nto corporations. I suppose what they would rather see is American jobs \ngo overseas because our punitive Tax Code punishes those businesses in \nthe United States with the highest tax rate in the world at 35 percent. \nCountries such as Ireland, the U.K., and others have lowered their tax \nrates and lured American businesses, investment, and job creators \noverseas. Are we supposed to ignore that and accept it? It would be \nabsolutely irresponsible to do so.\n  Unfortunately, I think some of our Democratic colleagues feel this is \nmore about political posturing than it is about getting the economy \ngrowing again or seeing more money in our paychecks, more money that \npeople can use for their family, for school, for retirement, or for \nwhatever reason they want to use it.\n  Under our bill, a family of four at median income, which is roughly \n$70,000 a year, will see a savings of about 40 percent on their tax \nbill. That may be chump change to the folks here in Washington, DC, \ninside the beltway, but for hard-working Texans and hard-working \nAmericans, that is money they can use and put to good use. We owe it to \nthem. If we can come up with a fairer, simpler, more competitive tax \ncode, we owe it to them to do so.\n  I mentioned the 300 amendments that have been filed. It is important \nto note that Chairman Hatch, just like Chairman Brady in the House Ways \nand Means Committee, is taking this through the regular legislative \nprocess. In other words, anyone who is willing to participate in it can \nintroduce amendments and get a vote on those amendments. You are not \nguaranteed to win, but you are guaranteed an opportunity to participate \nand to shape the product. That is the way the Senate and House are \nsupposed to work. Once both legislative houses come up with their \nversion of the tax bill, we reconcile those in a conference committee \nbefore we send it to the President. That is what we intend to do \nsometime before Christmas this year.\n  We have had 70 different hearings in the Senate alone, countless \nworking groups, white papers published. We have been working on this \nfor years. Now we finally have the opportunity to get it done.\n  What is so strange about the criticism that I have heard is that many \nof\n\n\nour Democratic colleagues, both past and present, have called for many \nof the reforms included in this legislation that they are now \ncriticizing. They were for it before they were against it.\n  Their previous support makes sense, because we know tax reform can \nwork. A new study by the Tax Foundation found that our proposal would \nincrease the size of the economy by 3.7 percent. It will increase wages \nfor hard-working American families almost 3 percent. It will create 1 \nmillion new jobs. If we reduce the business rate and don't chase jobs \noverseas, we can attract more investment and more job creation here in \nAmerica. The Tax Foundation estimates that this bill will produce \nnearly 1 million new jobs here in America. It will, incidentally, \nprovide more than $1.2 trillion of lost revenue for the Federal \nGovernment, helping us with our deficit and our debt. The study \nsuggests that families would see an after-tax income boost of 4.4 \npercent by the end of the decade. In Texas, for example, nearly 77,000 \njobs are expected to be created by this plan with an income growth for \nmiddle-class families surpassing $2,500 a year.\n  Notably, by repealing the tax on poor Americans known as the \nindividual mandate--half of it is paid by people who earn $25,000 or \nless, who can't afford to buy the government-mandated health insurance; \nthey pay the penalty. That amounts to a $43 billion tax on poor people \nin America. We intend to repeal that and let them keep that $43 billion \nover the next 10 years in addition to the tax relief we are providing \nhere.\n  It is not just the Tax Foundation that has pointed out the positive \nimpacts of our plan; the nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation has \ntoo. Its analysis over last weekend suggests that moderate-income \nfolks--not the high wage earners--would benefit most. In 2019, people \nin the middle of the income spectrum earning between $50,000 and \n$70,000 would see their taxes fall by 7.1 percent; those earning less--\nbetween $20,000 and $30,000--would see in excess of a 10-percent \ndecline in taxes, according to that report.\n  I know our Democratic friends have trotted out their old, tired \ntalking points and claimed that tax relief is only for the wealthy. But \nthese facts show otherwise, and it is not an accident. We tried on \npurpose to make sure that every taxpayer, every person across the \nspectrum, no matter what their tax rate, sees a reduction in their \ntaxes. The JCT's analysis proves that this is real, and while some of \nour colleagues can't resist the temptation to demagogue the issue, I \nwould suggest that a more productive use of their time would be for \nthem to join us to try to make this product even better.\n  I yield the floor.", "turn": 3, "speaker": "Mr. CORNYN", "itemno": 4}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I rise in opposition to the nomination of \nSteven G. Bradbury to be General Counsel of the Department of \nTransportation.\n  Typically, the Department of Transportation has been a bastion of \nbipartisan cooperation. As former Transportation Secretary Norman \nMineta said: ``There are no Democratic or Republican highways, no such \nthing as Democratic or Republican traffic congestion.'' Similarly, it \nhas been the overwhelming position of the U.S. Senate that torture is \ndisqualifying for high office. Mr. Bradbury's nomination threatens both \nof these traditions.\n  Based on his role in the approval of enhanced interrogation \ntechniques during the Bush administration, I believe Mr. Bradbury has \nfailed to demonstrate the judgment that would merit the Senate to \nadvise and consent on his nomination to any post. In addition, I am \ndeeply troubled by his failure to commit to recuse himself from all \nmatters related to his former client, the now-bankrupt airbag \nmanufacturer, Takata, whose products are responsible for at least 16 \ndeaths and 180 injuries.\n  From 2005 to 2009, Mr. Bradbury was the acting head of the Department \nof Justice's Office of Legal Counsel and was responsible for \ncoauthoring numerous legal memos that authorize torture. During that \nperiod, enhanced interrogation techniques approved by the Office of \nLegal Counsel included techniques that constituted torture or cruel, \ninhumane, and degrading treatment. We would not accept such techniques \nbeing used on our servicemen and women held in captivity by our \nenemies. Yet Mr. Bradbury approved those techniques and, in doing so, \nendangered our men and women in uniform, and that danger still exists \ntoday.\n  Mr. Bradbury authored four separate memos authorizing the harshest \nform of detainee abuse, including waterboarding and other forms of \ncruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment. Not only did these legal memos \nauthorize techniques that have been deemed abusive, they provided a \ngreen light for those willing to abuse enemy combatants in U.S. \ncustody.\n  Following the revelations of prisoner abuse at Abu Ghraib, the \nSenate, led by Senator John McCain, passed the Detainee Treatment Act \nof 2005 by a vote of 90 to 9. That law prohibited detainee abuse by the \nmilitary and other agencies.\n  However, legal opinions by Mr. Bradbury sought to provide a legal \ncover for the continued use of techniques that ran counter to the \nintent of that law. Our most respected military leaders have spoken out \nagainst the use of these unlawful interrogation techniques. A letter \nsigned by 176 retired senior military leaders opposed the kind of \ntorture techniques approved by Mr. Bradbury's Office of Legal Counsel.\n  Having had the privilege to serve in the Army of the United States, I \nbelieve they did this because they understood if we did it, our enemies \nwould do it with even more gusto to our men and women, and it would be \nunconscionable to give them even a shred of credibility to point to and \nsay: We are simply doing what you did to others.\n  Retired Marine Gen. Charles Krulak wrote in opposition to the \nBradbury nomination, saying that the use of techniques approved by Mr. \nBradbury ``not only violated well-established law and military \ndoctrine, but also endangered U.S. troops and personnel, hindered the \nwar effort, and betrayed the country's values, damaging the United \nStates' stature around the world as a beacon of human rights and the \nrule of law.''\n  That is the voice of one marine, speaking from years of experience in \ncombat, not simply to defend our ideals but to defend those men and \nwomen who serve today in uniform.\n  Secretary of Defense Mattis has expressed his full support for the \nArmy Field Manual as the single standard for all U.S. military \ninterrogations and has advised President Trump that such enhanced \ninterrogation techniques are not needed to keep our country safe.\n  Under Mr. Bradbury's direction, DOJ's Office of Legal Counsel \napproved opinions on enhanced interrogation techniques that appear \nintended to meet the political inclinations of the White House rather \nthan the intent of U.S. laws against such cruelty. Someone who has \njustified the use of torture, in spite of an act of Congress, should \nnot be allowed to hold a position of responsibility in the U.S. \nGovernment. Indeed, it is for that reason that this body refused to \napprove Mr. Bradbury as Assistant Attorney General for the Office of \nLegal Counsel in 2008.\n  If approved as the General Counsel of the Department of \nTransportation, Mr. Bradbury would again be called upon to render legal \nopinions that require sound and independent judgment. Even forgetting \nfor a moment his history of bending to the political desires of a \nstrong-willed White House, his refusal to completely recuse himself \nfrom matters relating to his former client, Takata, means he would \nenter this office with a cloud of potential conflicts around him.\n  Public service is not an entitlement but a privilege. For Mr. \nBradbury, the revolving door should swing shut. His lack of judgment at \na critical time in the Nation's history has disqualified him from the \nprivilege of holding high office in the current or any future \nadministration.\n  Surely the American people deserve someone who reflects our national \nvalues and has demonstrated much better judgment than Mr. Bradbury.\n  With that, I yield the floor.", "turn": 5, "speaker": "Mr. REED", "itemno": 6}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I thank my colleague, the Senator \nfrom Rhode Island, and I join him in strong opposition to the \nnomination of Mr. Steven Bradbury to be the general counsel of the U.S. \nDepartment of Transportation.\n\n\n  Mr. Bradbury is a deeply flawed nominee for many reasons, including \nhis unwillingness to recuse himself from issues involving his former \nclients and dodging commitments to forgo accepting waivers for \nrecusals. However, my opposition to his nomination is rooted in his \ntroubling record while serving at the Department of Justice during the \nBush administration.\n  As we know, Mr. Bradbury was Acting Attorney General at the \nDepartment of Justice from 2005 to 2007 and led the Office of Legal \nCounsel there from 2005 to 2009. When he was nominated by President \nGeorge W. Bush to be Assistant Attorney General in 2004, his nomination \nwas so unacceptable that the majority leader at the time offered to \nconfirm 84 stalled nominees in exchange for the withdrawal of his \nnomination.\n  Let me repeat that. The Senate majority leader at the time was \nwilling to accept 84 other nominees in exchange for President Bush \nwithdrawing Mr. Bradbury's nomination.\n  What Senators objected to then--and the reason I am so strongly \nopposed to Mr. Bradbury's nomination now--is that Mr. Bradbury is the \nchief architect of the legal justification that authorized \nwaterboarding and other forms of enhanced interrogation techniques we \nused to hear a lot about during the last Bush Presidency. For those who \nmight not be familiar with the term ``enhanced interrogation,'' there \nis another term for it that most Americans probably are familiar with. \nIt is called ``torture.''\n  The ``torture memos,'' as they are commonly referred to today, \nrepresent a dark period in our Nation's recent history that we must \nnever repeat. In my opinion, his connection to these memos alone should \ndisqualify Mr. Bradbury from government service. I understand he is \nnominated to serve at the Department of Transportation and not the \nDepartment of Justice, but his very willingness in the past to aid and \nabet torture demonstrates a failure of moral character that makes him \ndangerous to the American people and to our troops regardless of which \nagency he is nominated to serve in. Those torture memos displayed a \ndisturbing disregard for the intent of Congress and flouted both \ninternational and U.S. law.\n  If confirmed, Mr. Bradbury will swear a solemn oath to serve the \ninterests of the American public by providing honest and objective \nlegal analysis to the Department and the administration. I doubt he can \ncarry out that oath.\n  The American Government would, once again, rely on his counsel to \nmake sure Department of Transportation employees do not subvert the \nlaw, the intent of Congress, or the U.S. Constitution. Unfortunately, \nhe has let both the government and the American people down before, and \nI have no confidence that he is capable of carrying out this critically \nimportant role. Public servants are supposed to serve the public \ninterests, not the political whims of any President, Democratic or \nRepublican.\n  The public should be alarmed by Mr. Bradbury's history of \ndemonstrating complete deference to a President's policy goals, and we \nin the Senate should do everything we can to prevent the likelihood of \nthat history continuing in the Trump administration.\n  For my colleagues who may not be familiar with the programs Mr. \nBradbury justified in his legal opinion, let me clarify. Detainees, in \nhis opinion, could be sleep-deprived for up to 180 hours--approximately \n7\\1/2\\ days--forced into stress positions. Sometimes they were shackled \nto the ceiling, subjected to rectal rehydration and feeding, confined \nin boxes the size of small dog crates. It was also Mr. Bradbury's legal \nopinion that led CIA personnel to conduct mock executions. His legal \nopinion led to one man being waterboarded to the point that he became \n``completely unresponsive, with bubbles rising through his open, full \nmouth.'' His legal opinion also led to another man being frozen to \ndeath. Some of these abuses were authorized; others were not, but \nbrutality, once sanctioned, is not easily contained.\n  In 2005, this body voted 90 to 9 to enact the Detainee Treatment Act \nto prohibit ``cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment.'' \nThat law was enacted after the Supreme Court decided that terrorism \ndetainees in U.S. custody were protected by the Geneva Conventions. \nHowever, Mr. Bradbury still found legal loopholes to allow torture to \ncontinue.\n  Even the Department of Justice's own Office of Professional \nResponsibility criticized him for ``uncritical acceptance'' of the \nCIA's representations about the torture program. This is stunning, and \nit cannot simply be dismissed.\n  In testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee in 2007, Mr. \nBradbury defended the President's questionable interpretation of the \nHamdan case, a case where the Supreme Court ruled that President Bush \ndid not have the authority to set up military tribunals at Guantanamo \nBay, by famously suggesting the ``President is always right.''\n  This rubberstamp mentality is extremely dangerous, especially in the \nTrump administration. What will Mr. Bradbury do if President Trump asks \nhim to come up with a legal justification to abolish laws mandating \nseat belt use or to come up with ways to negate drunk driving laws?\n  Let me be clear. Mr. Bradbury didn't make America safer, and he \ncertainly didn't make our men and women in uniform safer either--quite \nthe opposite. The actions Mr. Bradbury helped to justify put our troops \nand diplomats deployed overseas in greater danger.\n  This is personal to me because perhaps most disturbingly Mr. \nBradbury's efforts to enable torture compromised our Nation's values. \nOur Nation's military men and women are taught the laws of armed \nconflict, the proper way to care for detainees, the importance of \nacting in accordance with American values. Mr. Bradbury's actions at \nthe Department of Justice undermined those values. This type of twisted \nlegal wrangling done at a desk far from the field of battle puts larger \ntargets on the backs of our troops. If captured, are they now at \ngreater risk of being tortured themselves? How we treat prisoners under \nour control affects how our troops are treated.\n  Let me read to you Warrant Officer Michael Durant's account of what \nhappened to him when he was shot down and captured in Mogadishu, \nSomalia. This is from his book.\n\n       DURANT'S fear of being executed or tortured eased after \n     several days in captivity. After being at the center of that \n     enraged mob on the day he crashed, he mostly feared being \n     discovered by the Somalian public. It was a fear shared by \n     Firimbi--\n\n  Who was one of the people guarding him--\n\n       The ``propaganda minister'' had clearly grown fond of him. \n     It was something Durant worked at, part of his survival \n     training. The two men were together day and night for a week. \n     Firimbi spoke Italian and Durant spoke some Spanish, \n     languages similar enough for them to minimally communicate.\n       Firimbi considered Durant a prisoner of war. He believed \n     that by treating the pilot humanely, he would improve the \n     image of Somalis in America upon his release.\n\n  Mr. Durant talked at length about how he was treated when he was \ncaptured in Somalia. He talked about going for days without his wounds \nbeing cared for, being dragged out of his downed Black Hawk by a mob. \nHe talked about being beaten. He talked about someone sticking a rifle \ninto his room and firing and shooting him, where he had to pull the \nround out of his own shoulder. He talked about being shackled.\n  All of that is still better than the treatment that Mr. Bradbury's \njustifications allow to happen now. It makes our troops' jobs harder \nand more dangerous, and their job is already pretty dangerous. Take it \nfrom me, our troops will do any job we ask of them, but we shouldn't be \ntrying to make those jobs more difficult or dangerous than they already \nare.\n  I can tell you from firsthand experience, as someone who has bled \nbehind enemy lines, legal gymnastics are a luxury not afforded our men \nand women in the field. They are at battle and, more importantly, these \njustifications do not protect our troops who are sitting on the floor \nof a POW cell. When you are stuck bleeding in a helicopter behind enemy \nlines, you hope and pray that if the enemy finds you first, they treat \nyou humanely.\n  When I was in flight school, I began the first of several periods \nwhen I was trained in the art of survival, escape, evasion, and rescue. \nAll pilots received this training. Then, when we were deployed to Iraq, \nwe also, as members of\n\n\nthe U.S. troops overseas who were identified as most likely at risk of \nbeing captured among U.S. troops deployed there, received additional \ntraining. This is what the Army told me I could expect upon being \ncaptured: I could expect to be raped. I could expect to be beaten. I \ncould expect to be starved.\n  As I sat in my helicopter thanking God that there was another \naircraft there to pull me out, even as the enemy were jumping into \ntheir pickup trucks, speeding toward us to try to capture us, the very \nrealities of what Mr. Bradbury was justifying happened to me. It is not \nsomething that you can look at from the safety and security of a desk \nin Washington. Our troops face this every single day. This is why this \nnomination is so incredibly, incredibly troubling.\n  If the warlords in Somalia recognized the Geneva Conventions and \ntreated Chief Warrant Officer Durant's capture more humanely, what does \nthat say about Mr. Bradbury and his willingness to allow far greater \nforms of torture than what the Somali warlords were willing to do?\n  Mr. Bradbury lacked the moral conviction in the Bush White House that \nSomali warlords possessed in Mogadishu, and I don't think he can be \ntrusted to stand up for the values I fought to defend, especially not \nin the current administration.\n  You don't just need to take my word for it. Mr. Bradbury's record \nspeaks for itself, but in case this point isn't clear enough, here is \nwhat retired Marine Corps General Charles Krulak wrote to the Commerce, \nScience, and Transportation Committee about this nominee just this year \non June 26 of 2017:\n\n       In his role as acting head of the Department of Justice's \n     Office of Legal Counsel . . . Mr. Bradbury displayed a \n     disregard for both U.S. and international law when \n     authorizing the use of so-called ``enhanced interrogation \n     techniques'' to interrogate terrorism suspects.\n\n  The general goes on further to say:\n\n       These interrogation techniques, which Mr. Bradbury \n     repeatedly approved, included methods that the United States \n     has acknowledged and even prosecuted as torture and cruel, \n     inhuman, and degrading treatment.\n       The use of these techniques not only violated well-\n     established law and military doctrine, but also endangered \n     U.S. troops and personnel, hindered the war effort, and \n     betrayed the country's values, damaging the United States' \n     stature around the world as a beacon for human rights and the \n     rule of law. We know that the United States is strongest when \n     it remains faithful to its core values. The use of torture \n     and cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment undermines those \n     values, and Mr. Bradbury continually represented their use as \n     legal and advisable during his time serving in the Bush \n     Administration.\n\n  The general goes on to say further:\n\n       In recommending these techniques, Mr. Bradbury also \n     displayed a discomforting deference to the executive branch's \n     wishes, tailoring his legal recommendations to fit the White \n     House's preferred outcome, and even testified in a Senate \n     Judiciary Committee hearing that ``the President is always \n     right.'' Mr. Bradbury's recommendations also contradicted the \n     intent of Congress. In 2005, Congress passed the Detainee \n     Treatment Act with a vote of 90-9. The law prohibited abuse \n     of detainees by the U.S. military and agencies, but Mr. \n     Bradbury authored a legal memo specifically designed to \n     undermine the will of Congress and to provide the Bush \n     Administration with authorization to continue using \n     interrogation methods that constitute torture and cruel, \n     inhuman, and degrading treatment.\n       I believe that this is more important than political \n     affiliation. Mr. Bradbury has time and again shown his \n     willingness to contravene established law and the intent of \n     Congress in service to the will of the executive branch. \n     Though the position to which he is nominated likely will not \n     involve decisions on national security issues, I believe that \n     based on his past governmental service, Mr. Bradbury is not \n     fit for this political office. I ask you respectfully to \n     oppose his nomination.\n\n  That letter is signed:\n\n     Semper Fidelis,\n\n                                            Charles C. Krulak,\n\n                                              General, USMC (Ret.)\n                              31st Commandant of the Marine Corps.\n\n  Also opposing Mr. Bradbury's nomination are 14 former national \nsecurity law enforcement, intelligence, and interrogation professionals \nwhose experience include service in the U.S. military, the Federal \nBureau of Investigation, the Central Intelligence Agency, the Drug \nEnforcement Administration, the Defense Intelligence Agency, the Army \nCriminal Investigation Command, and the Naval Criminal Investigative \nService.\n  They wrote:\n\n       We write today to express our opposition to the nomination \n     of Mr. Steven Bradbury to serve once again in a position of \n     significant responsibility within the U.S. government as \n     general counsel of the Department of Transportation.\n       Our opposition stems from the necessary judgment and \n     personal courage this office requires to provide candid and \n     objective legal advice to policymakers that may be seeking \n     politically expedient policy solutions.\n       We dedicated our professional lives to keeping our nation \n     safe. That work demanded using every resource at our \n     disposal, including and especially our moral authority. Our \n     enemies act without conscience. We must not.\n       Mr. Bradbury spent many years serving in the Department of \n     Justice--including as acting head of the Office of Legal \n     Counsel--during the George W. Bush Administration.\n       In this position, he prepared official memoranda that \n     provided legal cover for other agencies in the U.S. \n     Government to employ a program of interrogation tactics that \n     amounted to torture or cruel, inhuman, or degrading \n     treatment.\n       These brutal methods--which included waterboarding--\n     fundamentally violated domestic and international law \n     governing detainee treatment and caused untold strategic and \n     operational harm to our national security.\n       As former interrogators, intelligence, and law enforcement \n     professionals with extensive firsthand experience in the \n     field of interrogation, we were shocked by Mr. Bradbury's \n     attempt to defend the use of the waterboard and other torture \n     tactics based on the incorrect assertions that their use \n     would not cause severe physical pain or suffering and would \n     produce valuable intelligence.\n       In our professional judgment, torture and other forms of \n     detainee abuse are not only immoral and unlawful, they are \n     ineffective and counterproductive in gathering reliable \n     intelligence. They also tarnish America's global standing, \n     undermine critical alliances, and bolster our enemies' \n     propaganda efforts.\n       If the Senate confirms Mr. Bradbury, it would send a clear \n     message to the American public that authorizing the use of \n     torture is not only acceptable, but is not a barrier to \n     advancement into the upper ranks of our government.\n       We understand that Mr. Bradbury did not act alone in \n     authorizing torture, but as his nomination is before you, we \n     ask you to take this opportunity to reaffirm our commitment \n     to the ideals we strive to uphold by rejecting his \n     nomination.\n       Torture is not a partisan issue. Our respect for human \n     dignity is timeless, and we must never risk our national \n     honor to prevail in any war. Your vote to reject this \n     nomination would reflect the morally sound leadership that \n     this country needs and would not forget.\n\n  In another letter dated July 27, 2017, to the Commerce Committee, \nretired U.S. Air Force Col. Steven Kleinman wrote:\n\n       I write to express my deep concerns about confirming Mr. \n     Bradbury to serve once again in a position of significant \n     trust and responsibility within the U.S. Government.\n       I do not for a moment question his legal credentials; \n     rather, my apprehension centers around the equally important \n     elements of judgment and personal courage necessary to \n     provide legal advice that might run counter to the positions \n     advocated by his superiors.\n       History records that we have been down this road once \n     before with Mr. Bradbury and he was found sadly wanting.\n       As I trust you are aware, Mr. Bradbury served in senior \n     positions within the Department of Justice--including as \n     acting head of the Office of Legal Counsel--during the George \n     W. Bush Administration.\n       In that capacity, he prepared official memoranda that \n     provided legal cover for other agencies of the U.S. \n     Government to implement a program of severely coercive \n     interrogation practices.\n       These practices included an array of tactics--to include \n     waterboarding--that fundamentally violated domestic and \n     international law prohibiting cruel, inhuman, and degrading \n     treatment.\n       As an officer with extensive experience in both strategic \n     interrogation and in training members of the U.S. Armed \n     Forces to resist hostile interrogation, I was taken aback by \n     Mr. Bradbury's attempt to defend the use of the waterboard \n     based on wholly unfounded conjecture that it would not cause \n     severe physical pain or suffering.\n       If the committee were to favorably report this nomination \n     to the full Senate, it would be sending a clear and \n     undeniable message to the world, and, more importantly, to \n     the American public: Definitive action to support the \n     institutional use of torture is acceptable.\n       Clearly, Mr. Bradbury acted in concert with an untold \n     number of others within our government, and I am not asking \n     that he be singled out for his actions.\n       At the same time, his nomination is the one before you . . \n     . and with it an opportunity for the committee members to act \n     on behalf of all Americans in taking a vital step toward \n     reclaiming the moral high ground.\n       From the perspective of this American, the debate over \n     torture is not one that can be subject to partisan debate. \n     Instead, torture is something that is so inherently wrong and\n\n\n     so contrary to this nation's traditional values that it can \n     be one issue around which the entire country--and the U.S. \n     Senate--can rally.\n       Your vote to unfavorably report this nomination to your \n     colleagues would be a much-needed demonstration of ethical \n     leadership that would not soon be forgotten.\n\n  It is signed ``Very Respectfully, Steven M. Kleinman, Colonel, U.S. \nAir Force, Retired.''\n  Former Navy general counsel Alberto Mora wrote:\n\n       While acting as the head of the Office of Legal Counsel, \n     Steven Bradbury proved himself to be an advocate for the \n     brutal treatment of detainees, and then, when the Congress \n     enacted the McCain amendment to strengthen the legal \n     prohibitions against cruelty, he counseled the administration \n     on legal strategies on how to circumvent the law and the \n     Congress's will.\n       In exercising its advice and consent duty with respect to \n     the nominations of senior counsel to serve in this, or any, \n     administration, the Senate should take care to confirm only \n     those individuals with a clear record of respect for the law \n     and for the power of Congress as a coordinate and equal \n     branch of government. Steven Bradbury's record, \n     unfortunately, demonstrates a disrespect for both.\n\n  In a June 22, 2017, letter to the Commerce Committee, 14 human rights \norganizations highlighted their opposition to Mr. Bradbury's \nnomination:\n\n       We write to express our serious concerns regarding the \n     nomination of Steven G. Bradbury for general counsel of the \n     Department of Transportation (DOT).\n       Mr. Bradbury's role in justifying torture and cruel, \n     inhuman, or degrading treatment of individuals held in U.S. \n     custody marked him as an architect of the torture program.\n       Not only should the Senate be concerned about confirming a \n     nominee who had a central role in the criminal violation of \n     human rights, but his work during that period calls into \n     question his ability to provide the kind of rigorous, \n     independent legal analysis that is required of any top \n     government lawyer.\n       Mr. Bradbury was acting head of the Department of Justice's \n     (DOJ) Office of Legal Counsel (OLC) from 2005 to 2009. During \n     that time, Mr. Bradbury wrote several legal memoranda that \n     authorized waterboarding and other forms of torture and \n     cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment. As such, he is most \n     prominently--and correctly--known as one of the authors of \n     the ``torture memos.''\n       His analysis directly contradicted relevant domestic and \n     international law regarding the treatment of prisoners and \n     helped establish an official policy of torture and detainee \n     abuse that has caused incalculable damage to both the United \n     States and the prisoners it has held.\n       Mr. Bradbury's role in the torture program, even then, was \n     notorious--so much so that the Senate refused to confirm him \n     as assistant attorney general for the Office of Legal Counsel \n     during the Bush Administration.\n       The Senate now knows even more about Mr. Bradbury's record, \n     and the harm caused by his opinions, based on oversight by \n     the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence and its report on \n     the Central Intelligence Agency's use of torture and abuse.\n       In Mr. Bradbury's time as acting head of the OLC, he \n     demonstrated an unwavering willingness to defer to the \n     authority and wishes of the president and his team instead of \n     providing objective and independent counsel.\n       During congressional testimony in 2007, Mr. Bradbury \n     responded to questions about the president's interpretation \n     of the law of war by declaring, ``The President is always \n     right''--a statement that is as outrageous as it is \n     inaccurate.\n       The DOJ Office of Professional Responsibility reviewed Mr. \n     Bradbury's ``torture memos'' and determined they raised \n     questions about the objectivity and reasonableness of Mr. \n     Bradbury's analyses; that Mr. Bradbury relied on uncritical \n     acceptance of executive branch assertions; and that in some \n     cases Mr. Bradbury's legal conclusions were inconsistent with \n     the plain meaning and commonly held understandings of the \n     law.\n       Senior government officials from the Bush Administration \n     who worked with Mr. Bradbury have said that they had ``grave \n     reservations'' about conclusions drawn in the Bradbury \n     torture memos and have described Mr. Bradbury's analysis as \n     flawed, saying the memos could be ``considered a work of an \n     advocacy to achieve a desired outcome.''\n       Moreover, Mr. Bradbury's 2007 torture memo was written with \n     the purpose of evading congressional intent and duly enacted \n     Federal law.\n       The Detainee Treatment Act of 2005, legislation that passed \n     the Senate with a vote 90-9, stated, ``No individual in the \n     custody or under the physical control of the United States \n     Government, regardless of nationality or physical location, \n     shall be subject to cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment.'' \n     However, Mr. Bradbury's memo explicitly allowed the \n     continuation of many of the abusive interrogation techniques \n     that Congress intended to prohibit in the DTA.\n       Perhaps most concerning from a congressional oversight \n     perspective, Mr. Bradbury affirmatively misrepresented the \n     views of members of Congress to support his legal \n     conclusions.\n       Specifically, in his 2007 memo, he relied on a false claim \n     that when the CIA briefed ``the full memberships of the House \n     and Senate Intelligence Committees and Senator McCain . . . \n     none of the Members expressed the view that the CIA detention \n     and interrogation program should be stopped, or that the \n     techniques at issue were inappropriate.''\n       In fact, Senator McCain had characterized the CIA's \n     practice of sleep deprivation as torture both publicly and \n     privately, and at least four other Senators raised objections \n     to the program.\n       As a senior government lawyer, Mr. Bradbury authorized \n     torture and cruel treatment of detainees in violation of U.S. \n     and international law.\n       Mr. Bradbury demonstrated either an inability or an \n     unwillingness to display objectivity and reasonableness in \n     evaluating the president's policy proposals.\n       We ask that in reviewing Mr. Bradbury's nomination for \n     general counsel of the Department of Transportation, another \n     profoundly important position of public trust, you take these \n     serious and disturbing factors into consideration.\n\n  That letter was signed by the American Civil Liberties Union, Appeal \nfor Justice, Center for Constitutional Rights, Center for Victims of \nTorture, the Constitution Project, the Council on American-Islamic \nRelations, Defending Rights and Dissent, Human Rights First, Human \nRights Watch, the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, the \nNational Religious Campaign Against Torture, Open Society Policy \nCenter, Physicians for Human Rights, and Win Without War.\n  Earlier this year, a group of 176 of the most respected retired \ngenerals and admirals wrote to then President-Elect Trump urging him to \nreject the very kinds of torture and cruel treatment Mr. Bradbury \nauthorized. They wrote:\n\n       We have over six thousand years of combined experience in \n     commanding and leading American men and women in war and in \n     peace, and believe strongly in the values and ideals that our \n     country holds dear. We know from experience that U.S. \n     national security policies are most effective when they \n     uphold these ideals.\n       For these reasons, we are concerned about statements made \n     during the campaign about the use of torture or cruel, \n     inhuman, or degrading treatment of detainees in U.S. custody. \n     The use of waterboarding or any so-called ``enhanced \n     interrogation techniques'' is unlawful under domestic and \n     international law.\n       Opposition to torture has been strong and bipartisan since \n     the founding of our republic, through the administration of \n     President Ronald Reagan to this very day. This was reinforced \n     last year when the Congress passed the McCain-Feinstein anti-\n     torture law on an overwhelmingly bipartisan basis.\n       Torture is unnecessary. Based on our experience--and that \n     of our Nation's top interrogators, backed by the latest \n     science--we know that lawful, rapport-based interrogation \n     techniques are the most effective way to elicit actionable \n     intelligence.\n       Torture is also counterproductive because it undermines our \n     national security. It increases the risk to our troops, \n     hinders cooperations with allies, alienates populations whose \n     support the United States needs in the struggle against \n     terrorism, and provides a propaganda tool for extremists who \n     wish to do us harm.\n       Most importantly, torture violates our core values as a \n     nation. Our greatest strength is our commitment to the rule \n     of law and to the principles embedded in our Constitution. \n     Our servicemen and women need to know that our leaders do not \n     condone torture or detainee abuse of any kind.\n\n  I know some people might not understand why these enhanced \ninterrogation techniques are a problem so let me just take a few \nmoments to explain what they are.\n  Waterboarding. Waterboarding is a well-known torture tactic. \nWaterboarding creates the sensation of asphyxiation or drowning. The \ndetainee is immobilized on his back and water is poured over a cloth \ncovering his face. Far from the ``dunk in the water'' Dick Cheney has \nreferred to, internal CIA reports describe instances of waterboarding \nas ``near drownings.''\n  Detainees were often waterboarded repeatedly. Khalid Shaikh Mohammed \nwas waterboarded at least 183 times. Another detainee, Abu Zubaydah, \nwas waterboarded so often that it led him at least once to become \ncompletely unresponsive, with bubbles rising through his mouth. This \ntorture tactic may also lead to bleeding from the ears, severe lung and \nbrain damage, and lasting psychological damage.\n  If we waterboard our prisoners, they will waterboard our men and \nwomen when they become prisoners.\n  Walling. Walling is a torture technique that involves encircling the \ndetainee's neck with a collar or a towel and slamming him against the \nwall. Despite a requirement to use a false wall to avoid injury, Abu \nZubaydah\n\n\nwas slammed against a concrete wall. Even in the event of using a false \nwall, detainees suffered extreme injury. Abu Ja'far al-Iraqi suffered \nfrom an edema, or swelling on his head, as a consequence of walling \nwith the use of a false wall.\n  If we use this technique on our prisoners, they will use this \ntechnique on our men and women in uniform if they were to capture them.\n  Sleep deprivation. The detainees were kept awake by being shackled, \nforced to stand, or kept in stressed positions in an attempt to destroy \ntheir capacity for psychological resistance. This was routinely \ncombined with nudity and/or round-the-clock interrogation. Although not \novertly violent, extended periods of sleep deprivation can have painful \nand damaging mental and physical effects. After being forced to stand \nfor 54 hours, Abu Ja'far al-Iraqi required blood thinners to treat the \nswelling in his legs. Following 56 hours without sleep, Arsala Khan \nsuffered from violent hallucinations of dogs mauling and killing his \nfamily.\n  If we--the United States of America--use this technique on our \nprisoners, our enemies will use this technique on our men and women in \nuniform should they be captured.\n  Standing on broken feet. As an extreme form of sleep deprivation, two \ndetainees--Abu Hazim and Abd al-Karim--were forced to stand for hours \nwith broken feet. Despite recommendations that he avoid weight bearing \nfor 3 months, Abu Hazim underwent 52 hours of standing sleep \ndeprivation on his broken foot barely a month after his diagnosis. \nWhile injured, these detainees were also subject to walling.\n  Again, when we do this to our prisoners, our enemies would do this to \nour troops.\n  Solitary confinement. Detainees were regularly confined with no \nopportunity for social interaction. This is often combined with nudity, \nsensory deprivation, total darkness, or constant light, and shackling. \nAbu Zubaydah was isolated naked in a cell with bright lights and white \nnoise or loud noise playing. At one point, he was kept for 47 days in \ntotal isolation.\n  The dangers of solitary confinement were recognized by the U.S. \nSupreme Court as early as 1890 in In re Medley, where the Court \ndescribed prisoners becoming violently insane, committing suicide, and \nthe partial loss of their mental activity.\n  If we do this to our prisoners, they would do it to our troops.\n  Stress positions. These positions are designed to cause pain and \ndiscomfort for extended periods of time and were often used in \ncombination with sleep deprivation. Detainees were shackled with their \narms over their heads, forced to stay standing, or were placed in \ncramped confinement, such as coffin-sized boxes.\n  Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri was subjected to improvised stress positions \nthat not only caused cuts and bruises but led to the intervention of a \nmedical officer who was concerned that his shoulders would be \ndislocated. Abu Zubaydah was confined to a coffin-shaped box for a \ntotal of over 11 days.\n  If we do this to our prisoners--and Mr. Bradbury justified this--they \nwould do it to our troops.\n  Rectal feeding and rectal exams. Rectal feeding was used for \nprisoners who refused food and entails insertion of a tube containing \npureed food into the detainee's anal passage. This was used for \nbehavioral control, without medical necessity, despite risks of damage \nto the colon and rectum or of food rotting inside the digestive tract. \nOne detainee, Mustafa Ahmed al-Hawsawi, suffered a rectal prolapse \nlikely caused by overly harsh rectal exams.\n  If we do this to our prisoners--and Mr. Bradbury's memo made it so we \ncould--they would do this to our troops should our troops be captured \nby the enemy.\n  Nudity. This form of sexual humiliation relies on cultural and \nreligious taboos and required detainees to be fully or partially naked \nduring interrogations or when shackled. Nudity was also regularly \ncombined with cold temperatures and cold showers. One detainee, Gul \nRahman, died of suspected hypothermia following 48 hours of sleep \ndeprivation, half naked, in an extremely cold room.\n  Again, if we do this to our prisoners--and Mr. Bradbury wrote the \nlegal justification allowing this to happen--they will do this to our \ntroops. We do not want this man in the U.S. Government making more \ndecisions about what is right and what is wrong and how to protect the \nAmerican public. If he was willing to do this and allow this to happen, \nwhat can we trust him to have good judgment on?\n  In a September 6, 2006, article by Sean Alfano at CBS/AP entitled \n``U.S. Army Bans Torture Of Prisoners,'' he wrote:\n\n       A new U.S. Army manual bans torture and degrading treatment \n     of prisoners, for the first time specifically mentioning \n     forced nakedness, hooding and other procedures that have \n     become infamous since the Sept. 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. \n     Delayed more than a year amid criticism of the Defense \n     Department's treatment of prisoners, the new Army Field \n     Manual was released Wednesday, revising [a previous] one from \n     1992.\n       It also explicitly bans beating prisoners, sexually \n     humiliating them, threatening them with dogs, depriving them \n     of food or water, performing mock executions, shocking them \n     with electricity, burning them, causing other pain and a \n     technique called ``water boarding'' that simulates drowning, \n     said Lt. Gen. John Kimmons, Army Deputy Chief of Staff for \n     Intelligence.\n       Officials said the revisions are based on lessons learned \n     since the U.S. began taking prisoners in response to the \n     Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on the United States.\n       Release of the manual came amid a flurry of announcements \n     about the U.S. handling of prisoners, which has drawn \n     criticism from Bush administration critics as well as \n     domestic and international allies.\n       The Pentagon also announced an overall policy statement on \n     prisoner operations. And President George W. Bush \n     acknowledged the existence of previously secret CIA prisons \n     around the world where terror suspects have been held and \n     interrogated, saying 14 such al Qaeda leaders had been \n     transferred to the military prison at Guantanamo Bay and will \n     be brought to trial.\n       An international outcry about prisoner rights began shortly \n     afterward. Human rights groups and some nations have urged \n     the Bush administration to close the prisons at the U.S. \n     naval base in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, since not long after it \n     opened in 2002 with prisoners from the campaign against al \n     Qaeda in Afghanistan. Scrutiny of U.S. treatment of prisoners \n     shot to a new level in 2004 with a release of photos showing \n     U.S. troops beating, intimidating and sexually abusing \n     prisoners at Abu Ghraib in Iraq--and then again with news of \n     secret facilities.\n       Though defense officials earlier this year debated writing \n     a classified section of the manual to keep some interrogation \n     procedures a secret from potential enemies, Kimmons said \n     Wednesday that there is no secret section to the new manual.\n       Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld has said from the \n     start of the counter-terror war that prisoners were treated \n     humanely and in a manner ``consistent with Geneva \n     Conventions.''\n       But President George W. Bush decided shortly after the \n     Sept. 11 attacks that since it was not a conventional war, \n     ``unlawful enemy combatants'' captured in the fight against \n     al Qaeda would not be considered prisoners of war and thus \n     would not be afforded the protections of the convention.\n\n  The new manual, called ``Human Intelligence Collector Operations,'' \napplies to all the armed services, not just the Army. It does not cover \nthe Central Intelligence Agency, which also has come under \ninvestigation for mistreatment of prisoners in Iraq and Afghanistan and \nfor allegedly keeping suspects in secret prisons elsewhere around the \nworld since the Sept. 11 attacks.\n\n       Sixteen of the manual's 19 interrogation techniques were \n     covered in the old manual and three new ones were added on \n     the basis of lessons learned from the counter-terror war, \n     Kimmons said.\n       The additions are that interrogators may use the good-cop/\n     bad-cop tact with prisoners, they may portray themselves as \n     someone other than an American interrogator, and they may use \n     ``separation,'' basically keeping prisoners apart from each \n     other so enemy combatants can't coordinate their answers with \n     each other.\n       The last will be used only on unlawful combatants, not \n     POWs, only as an exception and only with permission of a \n     high-level commander, Kimmons said.\n       The Pentagon also on Wednesday released a new policy \n     directive on detention operations that says the handling of \n     prisoners must--at a minimum--abide by the standards of the \n     Geneva Conventions and lays out the responsibilities of \n     senior civilian and military officials who oversee detention \n     operations.\n       ``The revisions . . . took time,'' Deputy Assistant \n     Secretary of Defense for Detainee Affairs Cully Stimson said \n     at the briefing. ``It took time because it was important to \n     get it right, and we did get it right.''\n\n  It is interesting that the Department of Defense took the time and \nthe effort to rewrite their manuals as a result of the abuses that came \nabout following Mr. Bradbury's legal justification for the use of \ntorture.\n  Here is what the Army Field Manual 2-22.3 says. This is the Human \nIntelligence Collector Operations manual,\n\n\ndated September 6, 2006. This is what the Army now teaches our \nsoldiers:\n\n       All captured or detained personnel, regardless of status, \n     shall be treated humanely and in accordance with the Detainee \n     Treatment Act of 2005 and DOD Directive 2310.1E, ``Department \n     of Defense Detainee Program,'' and no person in the custody \n     or under the control of DOD, regardless of the nationality or \n     physical location, shall be subject to torture or cruel, \n     inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment, in accordance \n     with and as defined in US law.\n       All intelligence interrogations, debriefings, and tactical \n     questionings to gain intelligence from captured or detained \n     personnel shall be conducted in accordance with applicable \n     law and policy.\n       Applicable law and policy include US law; the law of war; \n     relevant international law, relevant directives, including \n     DOD Directive 3115.09, ``DOD Intelligence Interrogations, \n     Detainee Debriefings, and Tactical Questioning''; DOD \n     Directive 2310-1E, ``The Department of Defense Detainee \n     Program''; DOD instructions; and military execute orders \n     including FRAGOs. Use of torture is not only illegal but also \n     it is a poor technique that yields unreliable results, may \n     damage subsequent collection efforts, and can induce the \n     source to say what he thinks the HUMINT collector wants to \n     hear. Use of torture can also have many possible negative \n     consequences at national and international levels.\n\n  All prisoners and detainees, regardless of status, will be treated \nhumanely.\n  Cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment is prohibited. The Detainee \nTreatment Act of 2005 defines ``cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment'' \nas the cruel, unusual, and inhumane treatment or punishment provided by \nthe Fifth, Eighth, or Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution.\n  This definition refers to an extensive body of law developed by the \ncourts of the United States to determine when, under various \ncircumstances, treatment of individuals would be inconsistent with \nAmerican constitutional standards related to concepts of dignity, \ncivilization, humanity, decency, and fundamental fairness.\n  All DOD procedures for treatment of prisoners and detainees have been \nreviewed and are consistent with these standards as well as our \nobligation under international law as interpreted by the United States.\n  Questions about applications not resolved in the field by reference \nto the DOD publications must be forwarded to higher headquarters for \nlegal review and specific approval by the appropriate authority.\n  Isn't it amazing that it took the Army to contradict and to come up \nwith the procedures to counter the very actions Mr. Bradbury was \nwilling to condone? And we want this man back in government? He doesn't \nbelong back in government. This is a man who has, as his first \npriority, not America's values, not the morality of this Nation, not \nhumanity--his first value is: What is it that my boss wants me to say, \nand I will find a way to do it. He said just as much in testimony. That \nis not who we want as a top lawyer over in the Department of \nTransportation. It is simply not acceptable.\n  In that same Army Field Manual, there is a section that talks about \nhow interrogation should be conducted and the prohibited actions \nincluded, which are not limited to forcing the detainee to be naked, to \nperform sexual acts, or pose in a sexual manner, placing hoods or sacks \nover the head of a detainee, using duct tape over the eyes, applying \nbeatings, electric shock, burns, or other forms of physical pain, \nwaterboarding, using military working dogs, inducing hypothermia or \nheat injury, conducting mock executions, depriving the detainee of \nnecessary food, water, or medical care.\n  The field manual goes on to say:\n\n       While using legitimate interrogation techniques, certain \n     applications of approaches and techniques may approach the \n     line between permissible actions and prohibited actions. It \n     may often be difficult to determine where permissible actions \n     end and prohibited actions begin. In attempting to determine \n     if a contemplated approach or technique should be considered \n     prohibited, and therefore should not be included in an \n     interrogation plan, consider these two tests before \n     submitting the plan for approval:\n       If the proposed approach technique were used by the enemy \n     against one of your fellow soldiers, would you believe the \n     soldier had been abused?\n       Could your conduct in carrying out the proposed technique \n     violate a law or regulation? Keep in mind that even if you \n     personally would not consider your actions to constitute \n     abuse, the law may be more restrictive.\n\n  I wish those questions had been made available to Mr. Bradbury when \nhe was writing his memo, because the actions he condoned in his memo \ncertainly would have failed this very simple two-question test.\n  The manual says:\n\n       If you answer yes to either of these tests, the \n     contemplated action should not be conducted. If the HUMINT \n     collector has any doubt that an interrogation approach \n     contained in an approved interrogation plan is consistent \n     with applicable law, or if he believes that he is being told \n     to use an illegal technique, the HUMINT collector should seek \n     immediate guidance from the chain of command and consult with \n     the SJA to obtain a legal review of the proposed approach or \n     technique. . . . If the HUMINT collector believes that an \n     interrogation approach or technique is unlawful during the \n     interrogation of a detainee, the HUMINT collector must stop \n     interrogation immediately and contact the chain of command \n     for additional guidance.\n\n  This is not something that Steven Bradbury did or has even now stated \nthat he wished he had done, because his memo, which allowed all the \ntorture techniques I have already detailed, would truly have failed \nthese two tests, and he would have failed in moving forward with his \nmemo to do the basic thing, which is to stop an illegal activity from \noccurring.\n  At this point, the Army Field Manual provides some caution:\n\n       Although no single comprehensive source defines \n     impermissible coercion, certain acts are clearly prohibited. \n     Certain prohibited physical coercion may be obvious, such as \n     physically abusing the subject of the screening \n     interrogation. Other forms of impermissible coercion may be \n     more subtle, and may include:\n       Threats to turn the individual over to others to be abused; \n     subjecting the individual to impermissible humiliating or \n     degrading treatment; implying harm to the individual or his \n     property. Other prohibited actions include implying a \n     deprivation of applicable protections guaranteed by law \n     because of a failure to cooperate; threatening to separate \n     parents from their children; or forcing a protected person to \n     guide US forces in a dangerous area. Where there is doubt, \n     you should consult your supervisor or servicing judge \n     advocate.\n\n  This is the problem. Mr. Bradbury, in writing this memo, showed \nabsolutely no attempt or even desire to figure out whether what he was \ntrying to justify was truly legal, in keeping with American values, or \nwas the right thing to do for the United States. He simply moved \nforward with drafting this memo because the President of the United \nStates wanted it to happen. That is not the democracy we live in. We \ndon't live in a dictatorship. We are the greatest democracy on the face \nof the Earth because we are individuals who have the right to exercise \na moral authority and to speak up. Mr. Bradbury showed none of that.\n  Even in testimony, he has expressed no regrets in the legal \nwranglings that he went through in order to justify torture. He showed \nno introspection, no thought as to whether it was the right thing to \ndo. As far as he was concerned, his superiors wanted him to do this, so \nhe did it.\n  What is he going to do at the Department of Transportation? What is \nhe going to do when someone there tells him: The airbag manufacturers \nhave decided it is just too expensive, so we need you to come up with \njustification for us to stop using airbags?\n  What he is going to do when people come to him and say: We really \nwant to increase alcohol sales, so I think we should get rid of drunk \ndriving laws? What he is going to do?\n  He has shown that he is willing to do whatever his superiors have \nasked him to do and that he is just the right guy for the job if they \nwant a lawyer who is going to execute legal gymnastics to find a way to \nmake something happen. Do we really want that person at the very top of \nthe legal department of the Department of Transportation--not to \nmention the fact that once he is Senate-confirmed and in the Department \nof Transportation, it is that much easier to move him to another \nSenate-confirmed position, and there is no guarantee that he will not \nmake his way back over to the Department of Justice to create more \nharm.\n  I ask my colleagues, if you care about this country, if you care \nabout our troops who are in harm's way right now, please understand \nwhat it means to our troops who are downrange right now in all corners \nof the globe--facing the enemy, facing potentially being captured in \nthe execution of their duties, protecting and defending our\n\n\ngreat United States--to know that the enemy believes that America \ntortures and to know that they are at that much greater risk, if they \nwere to be captured, to be tortured themselves.\n  I can't oppose Mr. Bradbury's nomination strongly enough. His most \nprominent, consequential work was to justify unlawful torture and \ndetainee abuse. His comments in testimony during his confirmation \nhearings did not alleviate any of my concerns.\n  I know many of my colleagues are considering voting yes on this man \nbecause they think: Well, he is going to be over in the Department of \nTransportation. That was years ago; he will not have to write legal \njustification for the use of torture again, and we have passed laws \nabout it since then. But he has shown that despite existing laws, he \nwas able to find a way to get around them to justify torture. How do we \nknow he will not do the same thing again at the Department of \nTransportation when it comes to public safety? What about our kids who \nride school buses to school? They deserve protections.\n  The American public deserves protections. What they don't deserve is \na man who has no moral compass when it comes to what is right and what \nis wrong but only a compass that asks: What do my bosses want me to do? \nThat is not what the American people need. That is certainly not \nsomething we should be voting for.\n  If, in conversations with Mr. Bradbury, he promised you that he would \nbe independent, I just ask you to look at his record. He has never been \nindependent. In fact, when asked if he would recuse himself from \nvarious cases, he, in committee, avoided answering those questions, did \nnot answer them straightforwardly, and showed he is simply not willing \nto commit to doing what is right.\n  I don't know how anyone can vote for him. I don't know what he has \nsaid in private conversations--what he says he thinks he would do at \nthe Department of Transportation. All I can ask is for my colleagues to \nplease look at the evidence, and the evidence is overwhelming. This is \na man who cannot be trusted with the values of this country. He cannot \nbe trusted to do what is right on behalf of the American people. He is \nnot someone who will speak truth to power. If anything, this is a time \nin this country that we need more people who will speak truth to power, \nnot someone who will kowtow to power, and that is exactly the kind of \nperson Mr. Bradbury is. He is an unprincipled lawyer who will be paired \nwith an unprincipled executive, and that is a dangerous combination \nregardless of what agency he serves.\n  Again, I ask my colleagues to please vote no on Mr. Bradbury. I \ncannot oppose his nomination strongly enough. If you have any \nquestions, please come talk to those of us who have worn the uniform of \nthis great Nation, who know what it is like to be in jeopardy of being \ncaptured by the enemy, who know what it is like to hope and pray that \nthe nations around the world--which view America's conduct as the \nbellwether for how we treat others--know that they themselves will be \ntreated in the same manner that we treat our prisoners.\n  Those troops in harm's way right now know that because of Mr. \nBradbury, they are less safe and they are less able to do their jobs. \nWhen our troops go into harm's way, they should focus only on getting \nthe job done, not on what might happen should they get captured. Thanks \nto Mr. Bradbury, that is a real threat for them now.\n  Again, I ask my colleagues to please say no.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.", "turn": 7, "speaker": "Ms. DUCKWORTH", "itemno": 8}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hoeven).

Mr. President, I want to begin by thanking the \nSenator from Illinois. Not only did she serve this country, she \nsacrificed for this country. I for one, as I see her rolling up and \ndown the aisles and through the halls, am just so proud and so thankful \nfor her, for her family, for her work, and particularly I thank her for \nthese comments. I think the Senator is very worthy, and I am delighted \nto be her colleague.\n  Mr. President, I, too, rise in strong opposition to the confirmation \nof Steven Bradbury to serve as general counsel in the Department of \nTransportation.\n  Steven Bradbury has a troubling history of disregard for United \nStates and international law and seems unable to offer objective legal \nanalysis. Both of these troubling characteristics were on display when \nhe helped justify the CIA's torture program.\n  I was on the Intelligence Committee during this period of time--and \nstill am--and one of the things we wanted to see were the Office of \nLegal Counsel memoranda. The OLC memos were never given to us, although \nindividuals from the Department came and spoke to us about them.\n  Steven Bradbury was head of the Justice Department's Office of Legal \nCounsel from 2005 to 2009. During that time, he wrote four legal \nmemos--finally declassified, finally here--and this is what they look \nlike. Those memos provided the legal foundation for waterboarding and \nother interrogation techniques that were tantamount to torture.\n  The first memo, written on May 10, 2005, concludes that the use of \nso-called enhanced interrogation techniques was lawful. This memo, \nwhich addressed torture techniques including waterboarding, was written \nto replace the previous classified Office of Legal Counsel opinions.\n  The second memo, also written on May 10, found that the use of \nmultiple interrogation techniques would not violate U.S. law because \nthere would be no severe mental pain or suffering, just physical \ndistress.\n  The third memo, written on May 30, 2005, reaffirmed a previous OLC \nopinion that the CIA's use of torture, such as waterboarding, was not \nprohibited by the Convention against Torture, so long as it was done \noverseas. That memo also concluded that constitutional prohibitions \nagainst cruel, unusual, and inhumane treatment or punishment did not \napply.\n  The fourth memo, written on July 20, 2007, concluded that the \ncontinued use of six enhanced interrogation techniques by the CIA, \nincluding forced nudity and extended sleep deprivation, did not violate \nthe Detainee Treatment Act or the War Crimes Act or the Geneva \nConventions.\n  By writing these four memos, Bradbury not only provided the feeble \nfoundation upon which the CIA violated well-established law and \nmilitary doctrine, he also endangered U.S. troops--as the Senator from \nIllinois has pointed out--betrayed our country's values, and \ncompromised our standing as a world leader.\n  The tactics used by the CIA were not only more brutal than was known, \nthey also didn't produce actionable intelligence. We have a 7,000-page \ndocument, with 32,000 footnotes, which took 6 years of reviewing cables \nand information--all factual, not declassified, and a summary was \ndeclassified--and to date, nothing in it has been contradicted. \nCapturing terror suspects and torturing them in secret facilities \nfailed. Period.\n  Among Bradbury's many troubling conclusions in these memos were that \nneither the Constitution's prohibitions against inhumane treatment nor \nthe U.N. Convention Against Torture applied to the CIA's activities \noutside U.S. territory. That is interesting.\n  Even more troubling, Bradbury's 2007 memo was written with the \npurpose of evading congressional intent. It is stunning that the head \nof the Office of Legal Counsel would knowingly work to find loopholes \nin the law to justify the use of torture.\n  On October 5, 2005, the Senate voted 90 to 9 to approve the Detainee \nTreatment Act of 2005. This law stated: ``No individual in the custody \nor under the physical control of the United States Government, \nregardless of nationality or physical location, shall be subject to \ncruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment.''\n  However, less than 2 years later, Bradbury's fourth torture memo \nexplicitly allowed the CIA to continue many of the abusive \ninterrogation techniques that Congress clearly intended to prohibit in \nthe Detainee Treatment Act of 2005. These include forced nudity and \nextended sleep deprivation. This should be a disqualifier for\n\n\ncontinued service in the U.S. Government, regardless of the position, I \nbelieve.\n  It is true that Congress settled this matter in June of 2015 when, \nthanks to Senator McCain, we voted overwhelmingly to prohibit torture \nin that year's National Defense Authorization Act, but that doesn't \nchange the fact that Bradbury did his best to bypass Congress a decade \nearlier by writing those torture memos.\n  It is also true that as general counsel of the Transportation \nDepartment, Bradbury wouldn't be tasked with duties connected to \ndetainees. But by ignoring the intent of Congress in order to justify \nthe CIA's continued use of torture, Bradbury ignored the law to achieve \na desired result and that is unacceptable.\n  Even the Justice Department found fault with Bradbury's actions. \nAfter the OLC torture memos came to light, the Department of Justice \nconducted an investigation of the facts and the circumstances \nsurrounding those memos and DOJ's role in the implementation of the CIA \ninterrogation program.\n  On June 29, 2009, the Justice Department found ``serious concerns'' \nabout the objectivity and reasonableness of Bradbury's work. This \nincluded evidence that he gave into pressure in order to produce \nopinions that would allow the CIA torture program to continue.\n  The Department of Justice report cited several Bush administration \nofficials who believed Bradbury was producing opinions with the goal of \nallowing the program to continue.\n  Jim Comey, who served as Deputy Attorney General at the time of \nBradbury's memos, said there was significant pressure from the White \nHouse--specifically Vice President Cheney and his staff--to allow the \nprogram to continue. Comey said that one would have to be ``an idiot \nnot to know what was wanted.'' Comey also said that in his opinion, \nBradbury knew that ``if he rendered an opinion that shut down or \nhobbled the [interrogation] program the Vice President . . . would be \nfurious.''\n  John Bellinger, who in 2007 served as legal advisor to Secretary of \nState Condoleezza Rice, wrote to Bradbury and stated that he was \n``concerned that the [2007 Bradbury] opinion's careful parsing of \nstatutory and treaty terms'' would be considered ``a work of advocacy \nto achieve a desired outcome.''\n  The DOJ was also concerned that Bradbury relied too heavily on the \nCIA's reviews of its own interrogation program, which of course were \npositive.\n  During a time when we needed independent voices in government to \ncheck the CIA's actions, Bradbury failed to rise to the occasion. He \nfailed to fulfill the responsibilities of his position.\n  The Senate twice refused to confirm Bradbury as Assistant Attorney \nGeneral for the Office of Legal Counsel during the Bush administration \nbecause of this very issue.

Mr. President, I rise today to speak in opposition to the \nnomination of Steven Bradbury to be the general counsel of the \nDepartment of Transportation. I must say to my colleagues, of the years \nthat I have been here, I never thought that we would be considering the \nnomination of a person who supported the commission of what the Geneva \nConvention says are war crimes. That is a serious, serious issue. And \nthe Constitution charges the Senate to give its advice and consent to \nsenior executive branch nominations as a check against the appointment \nof people to an important government position who, because of one \nfailure or another, should not be entrusted with the interests of the \nAmerican people. I do not believe that Mr. Bradbury deserves that \npublic trust, and I will oppose his nomination. I am astonished that we \nare here, considering the nomination of a person who is in violation of \nthe Geneva Convention, the rules of war to which the United States of \nAmerica is signatory.\n\n  Some of us remember that Mr. Bradbury served as the acting head of \nthe Department of Justice's Office of Legal Counsel from 2005 to 2009. \nDuring this time, he authored a few of what have become to be known \ninfamously as the torture memos, which provided the legal \njustifications for 13 types of enhanced interrogation techniques \nemployed by the CIA against detainees held by the United States under \nlaw of war authorities.\n  My dear friends and colleagues, the term ``enhanced interrogation \ntechniques'' is a euphemism. These memos provided a legal framework for \nthe use of methods that include waterboarding, which is a mock \nexecution and an exquisite form of torture in which the victim suffers \nthe terrible sensation of drowning. In discussing this practice, we are \nspeaking of an interrogation technique that dates from the Spanish \nInquisition and has been a prosecutable offense for over a century. It \nis among the crimes for which Japanese war criminals were tried and \nhanged following World War II and was employed by the infamous Khmer \nRouge in Cambodia. I repeat. The Japanese war criminals were tried and \nhanged following World War II for--guess what--waterboarding. Of \ncourse, the Khmer Rouge, whom we all know about, was also one of those.\n  I must say to my colleagues that in the years I have been here in the \nU.S. Senate, I never believed that I would be voting against an \nindividual who justified the practice of torture. All you have to do is \nread the Geneva Conventions, to which the United States of America is \nsignatory, and you will see that Mr. Bradbury's memos, which basically \njustified torture, were in direct contravention.\n  The memos of which Mr. Bradbury was the author provided the \njustifications for the inhumane interrogation of detainees by using \nmethods such as forced nudity and humiliation, facial and abdominal \nslapping, dietary manipulation, stress positions, cramped confinement, \nstriking, and more than 48 hours of sleep deprivation. I would \nchallenge Mr. Bradbury to go through 48 hours of sleep deprivation \nbefore he signs off on another memo. Worse, the legal justifications \nfor these techniques were interpreted to permit their use \nsimultaneously, over long periods of time, which constituted what I and \nmany others who are familiar with these techniques believe are \ntorture--torture inflicted by the representatives of a Nation founded \non the ideal that all people are born with equal dignity and that even \nenemies who scorn our ideals, once they are our prisoners, are to be \nspared cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment.\n  The memos authored, in part, by Mr. Bradbury justified the use of \nthese techniques under article 16 of the United Nations Convention \nagainst Torture and declared them not in contravention to article 3 of \nthe Geneva Conventions, which prohibits ``outrages upon personal \ndignity''--those are the Geneva Conventions to which the United States \nis signatory--and violence to a life of a person. Most people, \nincluding, I am sure, Mr. Bradbury, have never been tightly bound, made \nto remain in a stress position, and deprived of sleep for 48 hours. Let \nme assure my colleagues that anyone who has suffered such treatment \nwill know that he has been tortured.\n  The two main memos that Mr. Bradbury wrote and signed were entitled \n``Application of United States Obligations Under Article 16 of the \nConvention Against Torture to Certain Techniques that May Be Used in \nthe Interrogation of High Value al Qaeda Detainees'' and ``Application \nof the War Crimes Act, the Detainee Treatment Act, and Article 3 of the \nGeneva Conventions to Certain Techniques that May Be Used by the CIA in \nthe Interrogation of High Value al Qaeda Detainees.''\n  In the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence's study of detention \nand interrogation program, CIA leadership and interrogators frequently \ncited these two Bradbury memos as the legal justification that \npermitted them to use enhanced interrogation techniques. These \ntechniques amounted to de facto torture. Put simply, Mr. Bradbury's \nmemos were permission slips for torture. I repeat to my colleagues who \nare about to vote for him that his memos were permission slips for \ntorture.\n\n\n  I wonder, of someone who is responsible for what he justifies, how he \nsleeps. I wonder how he gets rest. Doesn't the face of that person who \nhas been deprived of sleep for 48 hours ever pop into his mind?\n  I have long said that I understand the reasons that governed the \ndecision to approve these interrogation methods, and I know that those \nwho approved them and those who employed them in the interrogation of \ncaptured terrorists were dedicated to protecting the American people \nfrom harm. I know that they were determined to keep faith with the \nvictims of terrorism and prove to our enemies that the United States \nwould pursue justice relentlessly and successfully no matter how long \nit took. I know that their responsibilities were grave and urgent and \nthat the strain of their duty was considerable. I admire their \ndedication and love of country, but I argued then and I argue now that \nit was wrong to use these methods, that it undermined our security \ninterests, and that it contradicted the ideals that define us and which \nwe have sacrificed so much to defend.\n\n  While Mr. Bradbury has justified his work on these torture memos as \nthe duty of a lawyer representing his client, the Commander in Chief of \nthe United States, I believe that he had a higher duty, as do all who \nserve this country, to defend our most cherished ideals from wholesale \nviolation in the name of self-defense. Leave aside the fact that, as \nintelligence-gathering tools, torture is mostly useless and has been \nproven to be so by the record assembled by the Intelligence Committee. \nWe have led by example and sacrificed blood and treasure to advance our \nideals around the world only to undermine our good reputation in a \ncrucible in which we allowed fears to get the better of our decency.\n  While it is true, as Mr. Bradbury and his supporters claim, that the \nmemos issued under his name improved upon the sloppy and more expansive \nlegal work done by his predecessors, I do not think that that absolves \nMr. Bradbury of his role in this dark chapter of American history. \nIndeed, a more meticulous justification for torture is still a \njustification for torture--and, arguably, a more pernicious one.\n  Let's not pretend that there was no direct connection between the \nlegal work done by Mr. Bradbury and the abuses that followed. The memos \nthat bear his name made it possible for Khalid Sheikh Mohammed--a \nmonster and a murderer, to be sure, but a detainee held in U.S. custody \nunder the laws of armed conflict--to be waterboarded 183 times. I \nrepeat. Khalid Sheikh Mohammed was waterboarded 183 times. This \ntechnique was used so gratuitously that even those applying it \neventually came to believe that there was no reason to continue. They \nwere ordered to do so anyway.\n  The memos also made it possible for Abu Zubaydah, an alleged al-Qaida \noperative, to be subjected to waterboarding two to four times a day, \nrendering him so distressed that he was unable to speak. The damaging \neffects of waterboarding cannot be overstated. According to the Senate \nIntelligence Committee's report on torture, Zubaydah's waterboarding \nsessions ``resulted in immediate fluid intake and involuntary leg, \nchest and arm spasms'' and hysterical pleas. In at least one session, \n``Zubaydah became completely unresponsive, with bubbles rising through \nhis open, full mouth,'' and he required medical intervention.\n  The memos that bear Mr. Bradbury's name also made it possible for a \nLibyan detainee and his wife to be rendered to a foreign country where \nthe woman was bound and gagged, while being several months pregnant, \nand photographed naked as several American intelligence officers \nwatched.\n  I wonder what our average citizens would think when we tell them that \nan agent of the American Government took a woman who was several months \npregnant and bound, gagged, and photographed her naked as several \nAmerican intelligence officers watched. I am told that that picture \nstill exists somewhere in the archives that has recorded this shameful \nperiod in our history.\n  In voting against Mr. Bradbury's nomination, as I also voted last \nweek for similar reasons against Mr. Steven Engel's nomination to head \nthe Department of Justice's Office of Legal Counsel, I am making it \nclear that I will not support any nominee who justified the use of \ntorture by Americans. The laws of war were carefully created to be \nprecise and technical in nature but also to leave room for \ninterpretation, even at the risk of abuse by the executive branch. This \nmakes the duty of government lawyers all the more significant. They \nmust serve as guardians of our ideals and our obligations under \ninternational law. They are the safeguards and checks on the conscience \nof our government, and I cannot in good faith vote to confirm lawyers \nwho have fallen short in this awesome responsibility.\n  I will cast my vote against Mr. Bradbury, not because I believe him \nto be unpatriotic or malevolent but because I believe that what is at \nstake in this confirmation vote, much as what we stand to gain or lose \nin the war we are still fighting transcends the immediate matter before \nus. Ultimately, this is not about Mr. Bradbury; this is not about \nterrorists. This is about us--who we are and who we will be in the \nfuture.\n  This is about what we lose when, by official policy or official \nneglect, we allow, confuse, or encourage those who fight this war for \nus to forget that best sense of ourselves. This is our greatest \nstrength: When we fight to defend our security, we also fight for an \nidea--not a tribe, not a land, not a King, not a twisted interpretation \nof an ancient religion but for an idea that all men are created equal \nand endowed with unalienable rights.\n  It is indispensable to our success in this war that those we ask to \nfight it know that in the discharge of their responsibilities to our \ncountry, they are expected never to forget that they are Americans and \nthe defenders of a sacred idea of how nations should be governed and \nconduct their relations with others, even our enemies.\n  Those of us who have given them this enormous duty are obliged by our \nhistory and the many terrible sacrifices that have been made in our \ndefense to make clear to them that they need not risk our country's \nhonor to prevail and that they are always, always, always Americans--\nand different, stronger, and better than those who would destroy us.\n  Mr. Bradbury's work many years ago did a disservice to our Nation and \nits defenders. I cannot in good conscience give him my trust to serve \nus again.\n  I am confident, because of the way this system works, that Mr. \nBradbury will be confirmed, probably. This is a dark, dark chapter in \nthe history of the United States Senate. We are legitimizing offenses \nagainst the code of the Geneva Conventions. We are harming the \ncommitment that our forefathers made that we are all created equal. \nUnfortunately, we have now betrayed that sacred trust.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.", "turn": 15, "speaker": "Mr. McCAIN", "itemno": 18}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
