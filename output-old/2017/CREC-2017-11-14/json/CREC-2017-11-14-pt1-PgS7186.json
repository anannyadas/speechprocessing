Mr. President, in addition to the other work being \ndone by the committees, the Senate is continuing to confirm qualified \nand talented nominees sent to us by the President. Yesterday we \nconfirmed an important official for the Department of Transportation, \nand today we will confirm another.\n  Then, we will advance the nomination of David Zatezalo to serve as \nthe Assistant Secretary of Labor for Mine Safety and Health, a position \nof particular importance in my home State of Kentucky, where mining \nsupports thousands of good jobs.\n  Mr. Zatezalo has spent a lifetime working in the mining industry. He \nbegan as an underground coal miner and worked his way up through the \nranks to most recently lead a mining company based in Lexington, KY. He \nknows about various levels of the business, which would be an important \nasset as he works with operators, miners, and inspectors to ensure that \nmining operations are safe for our Nation's mine workers.\n  Having begun his career as a coal miner himself and having later \nmanaged and operated a number of mines, Mr. Zatezalo has a keen \nunderstanding of the challenges and risks sometimes associated with \nmining. This firsthand experience will serve him well in his new role. \nAs Assistant Secretary of Labor for Mine Safety and Health, Mr. \nZatezalo will be given the responsibility to reduce workplace accidents \nand promote safe and healthy workplaces for miners.\n  I strongly support his nomination to serve in this role, and I would \nask my colleagues to join me in advancing this nomination.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. McCONNELL", "itemno": 0}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 1}], "header": {"chamber": "Senate", "num": "186", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "S7186", "wkday": "Tuesday", "day": "14", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "NOMINATION OF DAVID ZATEZALO", "id": "CREC-2017-11-14-pt1-PgS7186", "title": "NOMINATION OF DAVID ZATEZALO"}
