Mr. Speaker, yesterday I rose to honor our Nation's public \nschools. Today I rise to honor Ms. Evelyn Malzberg, a lady who embodies \nthe saying: ``It is never too late to learn.''\n  After graduating high school in 1943, Ms. Malzberg thought about \ngoing to college, but Ms. Malzberg's mom told her that no man would \nmarry a woman smarter than he is. So Ms. Malzberg found success \nelsewhere. She married, raised a family, and had a career as a legal \nsecretary.\n  Somewhere along the way, Ms. Malzberg concluded that she had made a \nmistake. She started taking college courses, one a semester. A few \nyears ago, at the young age of 84, Ms. Malzberg graduated from New \nJersey City University with a bachelor's degree in creative writing.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me in celebrating Ms. Malzberg, a lady \nwhose remarkable story proves how valuable the Nation's public \neducation system is to our people.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. PAYNE", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "186", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H9239", "wkday": "Tuesday", "day": "14", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "HONORING EVELYN MALZBERG", "id": "CREC-2017-11-14-pt1-PgH9239-4", "title": "HONORING EVELYN MALZBERG"}
