Mr. Speaker, the Republican tax \nreform bill coming to the floor this week raises serious questions \nabout the impact that this legislation will have on middle class \nfamilies, our ability to invest in our transportation infrastructure, \nand students' ability to attend college.\n  My hometown, Dallas, Texas, and every municipality in the region has \nwritten objections to how they are affected. For one, the GOP tax plan \neliminates many tax deductions that are favorable to middle class \nAmericans, such as the medical expense deduction and State and local \nincome and sales tax deductions. These important deductions help middle \nclass families lower their tax liability and put more money in their \npockets for everyday needs of hardworking Americans.\n  The plan also looks to an estimated $2.6 trillion stockpiled overseas \nfor U.S. corporations. The plan seeks to allow repatriation of these \nfunds for as little as 5 percent tax on brick-and-mortar assets, or 12 \npercent on cash kept overseas.\n  This was one of the same methods being considered to fund the major \ninfrastructure bill that we are still waiting for, which raises \nconcerns about how we will pay for our crumbling infrastructure.\n  Finally, the GOP tax plan also seeks to eliminate the student loan \ntax deduction. This is a troubling change to existing law, as it places \nan even heavier burden on our future generations and others seeking a \ncollege education. Every college and university in my region has \ncomplained.\n  All of these changes are proposed to the tune of an added $1.7 \ntrillion dollars to our deficit.\n  Mr. Speaker, I share the view with many of my colleagues that we are \ndue for a major reform of our tax code. However, we must not do so at \nthe expense of millions of middle and lower class Americans are already \nstruggling to get by.\n\n\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "186", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H9240-H9241", "wkday": "Tuesday", "day": "14", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "TAXES AND A BETTER DEAL", "id": "CREC-2017-11-14-pt1-PgH9240-5", "title": "TAXES AND A BETTER DEAL"}
