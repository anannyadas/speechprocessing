Mr. Speaker, I rise to support H.R. 3705, the \nVeterans Fair Debt Notice Act of 2017. H.R. 3705 modifies the ways that \nveterans are notified of any outstanding debts from a Department of \nVeterans Affairs (VA) program.\n  This bill is essential because current VA debt notification letters \ncan be confusing, highly technical, and fail to convey important dates \nand amounts. This legislation would direct the VA to clarify language \nin debt notification emails, coordinate email and postal mail \nnotifications, and study the process of debt notification to ensure \nthat messages are communicated effectively. The cost of sending postal \nmail notifications would also be evaluated in this study.\n  Congress should take measures to reduce veterans' debt by effectively \ncommunicating outstanding payments and due dates. Reducing debt is one \nof many ways we can ensure a smoother transition into civilian society \nfor our veterans, which is why I support this legislation.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 3}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "186", "extension": true, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "E1565", "wkday": "Tuesday", "day": "14", "month": "November"}, "related_bills": [{"type": "HR", "context": "TITLE", "congress": "115", "number": "3705"}, {"type": "HR", "context": "OTHER", "congress": "115", "number": "3705"}], "doc_title": "H.R. 3705, THE VETERANS FAIR DEBT NOTICE ACT OF 2017", "id": "CREC-2017-11-14-pt1-PgE1565-4"}
