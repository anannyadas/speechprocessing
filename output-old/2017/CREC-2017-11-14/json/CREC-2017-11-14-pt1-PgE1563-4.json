Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize J. Michael \nAnderson, the 2017 recipient of the Zunic Award as presented by the \nSyracuse Football Club.\n   The Syracuse Football Club is a group of former Syracuse Orange \nfootball players focused on making a difference in the Central New York \ncommunity. The Zunic Award was created to honor Mike and Judy Zunic, \nwho died tragically in a United Airlines plane crash in Sioux City, \nIowa on July 18, 1989. The pilot, anticipating landing difficulties, \nrequested volunteers to give up their seats and sit at the exit doors \nto assist passengers in the event of an emergency. Mike and Judy gave \nup their seats in first class to sit at one of the doors. They both \ndied in the crash and those in the Zunics' original seats survived. The \nZunic Award honors those, like Mike and Judy, who have acted selflessly \nfor the good of others.\n   This year's Zunic Award recipient, J. Michael Anderson, is a former \nOrange offensive lineman, and has tragically lost two of his three \nsons--Jimmy and Eric. Despite this extraordinary loss, Mike has \nchanneled his own tragedy into advocacy and volunteerism. He and his \nwife, Flo, have focused on making a difference in the Central New York \ncommunity and assisting others who have experienced similar tragedy.\n   Anderson served as a youth basketball coach for more than two \ndecades at Immaculate Heart of Mary in Liverpool, and coached baseball \nin the Salt City Little League for 10 years. In addition, the Andersons \nare frequent holiday volunteers at the Syracuse Rescue Mission, serving \nmeals to those less fortunate, and are active participants in the \nLiverpool Central School District ``Dollars for Scholars'' program \nwhere they have established a scholarship in their son Jimmy's name. \nAnderson\n\n\nspends part of each day visiting online grief sites offering assistance \nto those who are struggling with tragedy.\n   For his tremendous efforts to make a difference in ending this \nscourge and to make our community a better place, I am proud to join \nthe Syracuse Football Club in honoring J. Michael Anderson.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. KATKO", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 3}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "186", "extension": true, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "E1563-E1564", "wkday": "Tuesday", "day": "14", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "RECOGNIZING J.
