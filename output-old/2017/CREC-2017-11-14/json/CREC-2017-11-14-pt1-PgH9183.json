Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the exceptional \nemergency and operational contributions of the Civil Air Patrol and its \n58,000 volunteers. In the near future, I hope to also talk about two \nother primary missions of the CAP: youth development and aerospace/STEM \neducation.\n  Literally every day, the CAP responds to life-threatening \nemergencies, homeland security requests, and a wide range of missions \nfor States and the Federal Government with over 500 single-engine \naircraft in every State and in Puerto Rico. As an active member since \n2004, I have had the privilege of flying many of these missions, so I \nspeak from personal experience.\n  Over the past 15 months, the CAP has responded to four hurricanes, \nmajor wildfires in the West, dozens of other emergencies, including \nsearch and rescues, in addition to vital military missions on a daily \nbasis. The high operational tempo has helped ensure that the CAP, for a \nsecond year in a row, has flown over 100,000 hours.\n  The CAP's pace of operations is extraordinary when one considers that \nthese missions are flown by volunteer professionals who pay dues to \nbelong to the CAP, and they must take time from their work or use their \nvacation times to actually fly these missions.\n  Vital for communities and for every State are the CAP's disaster \nrelief operations. The mission is best highlighted by the CAP's massive \nvolunteer response to the three recent rapid-fire hurricanes--Harvey, \nIrma, and Maria--that made U.S. landfall from Texas to the Virgin \nIslands.\n  While additional flight hours are still expected, 2,800 hours have \nalready been flown and nearly half a million photographs have been \ntaken for FEMA, Texas, Louisiana, Florida, South Carolina, Puerto Rico, \nand the U.S. Virgin Islands. These photos are being used to assess \ndamage and to focus on recovery efforts.\n  To do this, the CAP has used 118 aircraft and over 1,000 personnel \nfrom 44 wings--there is a wing for every State and Puerto Rico and \nD.C.--and region headquarters across the Nation. For large-scale \noperations, such as long-term hurricane support, the CAP often depends \non the assistance of these adjacent wings in different States and \ndifferent regions of the country.\n  I was able to view up close and personal hurricane recovery \noperations when I flew several sorties during Hurricane Harvey. On one \nmission, I was responsible for taking full-motion video of three dams \nalong the Texas-Louisiana border to help establish that they were in \ngood condition and safe for those living in surrounding areas. Those \nassessments could mean the difference between life and death for many \ncommunities.\n  In California, where fast-moving wildfires destroyed over 8,900 \nhomes, the CAP continues to fly photographic missions in support of \nFEMA and California. Hundreds of sorties have been flown and 13,586 \nphotos taken. These photos are being used to help emergency managers \nanalyze the damage and assess the assistance needed by those whose \nhomes and businesses have been damaged or destroyed.\n  In addition to conventional photography, the CAP's California \noperations have included testing a new leading-edge tactical aerial \nimagery system, which helped eliminate distortion in photos, making it \neasier for FEMA to analyze the data and making them a more effective \ntool for damage assessments. The CAP is pleased to be part of this test \nprogram, and it is expected to help improve wildfire damage \nassessments.\n  Operational missions for the Air Force and other government agencies \noccur daily and without fanfare. These include, among others, being a \ntarget for Air Force interceptors, helping to train combat ground \nforces, and escorting military remotely piloted aircraft for training. \nAir Combat Command's First Air Force provides operational coordination \nfor these CAP missions, which comprise about 80 percent of the First \nAir Force weekly operational flying.\n  I was privileged recently to fly with the CAP Congressional Squadron \non a Fertile Keynote mission. This mission is unusual, as it provides \nCAP aircraft as a slow-moving target for its Air Force pilots to \npractice interception techniques. The Congressional Squadron is unique, \nas it includes Members of Congress and congressional staff who fly with \nCAP airmen.\n  Our mission that day was to simulate a general aviation aircraft that \nwas in controlled airspace without permission. Two F-16 Vipers \nscrambled from Joint Base Andrews to find and definitely intercept us. \nThese missions provide excellent training at a fraction of the cost to \nthe government, and they are very valuable in training our great men \nand women who wear Air Force uniforms.\n  Another key mission is to help train ground combat soldiers who are \nabout to deploy overseas. Two CAP squadrons are tasked with providing \nthis support.\n  Mr. Speaker, I will certainly continue this discussion later.\n", "turn": 1, "speaker": "Mr. ABRAHAM", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "186", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H9183", "wkday": "Tuesday", "day": "14", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "THE CIVIL AIR PATROL'S PACE OF OPERATIONS IS EXTRAORDINARY", "id": "CREC-2017-11-14-pt1-PgH9183", "title": "THE CIVIL AIR PATROL'S PACE OF OPERATIONS IS EXTRAORDINARY"}
