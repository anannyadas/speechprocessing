Mr. Speaker, today I rise for the people of North \nCarolina's 12th Congressional District, to stand up for the \nopportunities our community needs, and to reject the ``billionaires \nfirst'' Republican tax plan.\n  This tax plan fails to hear the American people. It gives tax cuts to \ncorporations on the backs of the middle class.\n  Last week, I sent a letter to the Ways and Means chair and to Speaker \nRyan outlining the 12th District's tax priorities and urging the \ninclusion of education-related deductions.\n  Republicans refused to hear the call, so this week I announced my \neducation tax package. This series of amendments includes reinstating \nthe tax-exempt status of private-use bonds used to build infrastructure \nand affordable housing; reinstating the State and local tax deduction, \nprotecting the funds used to pay for schools, community development, \nand public safety; reinstating the student loan interest tax deduction; \nrepealing the tax on tuition waivers and student stipends; and \nincentivizing investments in STEM education.\n  Communities across the Nation need the increased access to upward \nmobility, and education, the great equalizer, is the place to start.\n  I urge my colleagues to support my amendments to make education \naccessible for all students.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Ms. ADAMS", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "186", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H9190", "wkday": "Tuesday", "day": "14", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "REPUBLICAN TAX PLAN", "id": "CREC-2017-11-14-pt1-PgH9190-2", "title": "REPUBLICAN TAX PLAN"}
