Mr. President, tax reform represents our best chance \ntoday to get the economy living up to its true potential, and it is a \nonce-in-a-generation opportunity.\n  The last time major tax reform happened was more than 30 years ago. \nIn the years since, our country, our economy, and the global \nmarketplace have changed in profound ways. Moreover, the lingering \neconomic challenges of the last decade only compound the urgency to get \nthis done.\n  Jobs went overseas. Wages didn't grow like they should have. Hard-\nworking families worried if they would be able to send their kids to \ncollege or save for retirement. It is clear that families and small \nbusinesses had a rough go of it during the Obama economy.\n  They deserve relief. They deserve the chance for something better. \nTax reform is an important way to help get the economy, jobs, and \nopportunity moving again in a serious way.\n  Listen to this small business owner and franchisee from Lexington, \nKY. She recently wrote to my office expressing the need for tax reform: \n``With the rising cost of doing business,'' she wrote, ``and the \n[g]overnment regulations that have been imposed on small businesses \nover the past several years, we desperately need tax relief and \ncompetitive rates. The current high tax rate that I pay,'' she \ncontinued, ``reduces the amount of earnings I can invest into my \nbusinesses, [into my] employees, and [into my] community.''\n  For small business owners in Kentucky and throughout the country, we \nwant to make it easier to grow, invest, and hire. For families \neverywhere, we want to make taxes lower, simpler, and fairer. In short, \nwe want to take more money out of Washington's pockets and put more in \nthe pockets of the middle class. That is why we are pushing tax reform.\n  Yesterday, the Senate Finance Committee began to mark up its tax \nreform legislation. The meetings this week represent the next step in a \nyears-long campaign, which included dozens of hearings and significant \ninput from both sides.\n  Chairman Hatch said yesterday:\n\n       First and foremost, this legislation will provide much-\n     needed tax relief to American workers and families. It \n     reduces rates across the board, particularly for those in the \n     middle class who have struggled to get through the past 8 \n     years of economic stagnation.\n\n  Indeed, under the Finance Committee's proposal, the typical American \nfamily of four earning the median income could see a tax cut of nearly \n$1,500.\n  As these hearings continue, I would like once again to commend \nChairman Hatch for his leadership of the committee and his commitment \nto regular order. As the tax proposal advances through an open process, \nmembers of the Finance Committee will consider many of the hundreds of \namendments that have already been filed on the bill. Once the committee \ncompletes its work, the bill will come before the full Senate.\n  Along with our colleagues in the House, as well as President Trump \nand his team, we will continue to push for tax reform to fulfill \nimportant shared goals for our country. We have a lot of work ahead of \nus, but we are committed to getting this done for the\n\n\nAmerican people. I hope that our Democratic friends will join us.\n  As I said before, until very recently, our colleagues on the other \nside of the aisle used to support many of the ideas included in this \nbill. The underlying ideas haven't changed. The urgent need for tax \nreform hasn't changed. The only thing that has really changed is the \noccupant of the White House. So I hope Senate Democrats will put aside \npartisanship and work with us in a serious way to deliver this much \nneeded relief to small businesses and the middle class.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. McCONNELL", "itemno": 0}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 1}], "header": {"chamber": "Senate", "num": "186", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "S7185-S7186", "wkday": "Tuesday", "day": "14", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "TAX REFORM", "id": "CREC-2017-11-14-pt1-PgS7185-6", "title": "TAX REFORM"}
