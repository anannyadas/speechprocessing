Mr. Speaker, a recent Washington Post University \nof Maryland poll asked Americans whom they blame for causing \ndysfunction in the U.S. political system.\n  It is no surprise that 88 percent of respondents said the news media \ncaused some or a lot of the dysfunction. Given that the liberal media \nunfairly blames President Trump for nearly all the problems in our \ncountry, they bear the burden of this dysfunction.\n  Months of liberal biased reporting have shredded the media's \ncredibility in the eyes of most Americans. The media should report the \nfacts objectively. That begins with fair coverage of the President and \nhis administration. So far this year, the media has been anything but \nfair.\n  According to a new Harvard study, media coverage of the President's \nfirst 100 days was 80 percent negative, a\n\n\nrecord for recent Presidents. Until the media becomes less slanted, \nthey will continue to be a source of dysfunction in our political \nsystem.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. SMITH of Texas", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "186", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H9190-H9191", "wkday": "Tuesday", "day": "14", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "THE MEDIA CAUSE POLITICAL DYSFUNCTION", "id": "CREC-2017-11-14-pt1-PgH9190-5", "title": "THE MEDIA CAUSE POLITICAL DYSFUNCTION"}
