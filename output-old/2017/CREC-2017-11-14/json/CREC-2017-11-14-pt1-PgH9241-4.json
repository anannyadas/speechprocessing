Mr. Speaker, a moment ago, you heard from my colleague \nfrom California (Ms. Judy Chu) about the tax bill. She put the first \npage of H.R. 1 up and she added this little percentage, H.R. 1 percent. \nI thought that was not only accurate, but it really does reflect what I \nwas going to show a moment ago, and then I decided to use hers.\n  H.R. 1 is really about the 1 percent. The top 1 percent wealthy \nAmericans would get 50 percent of a $1.5 trillion gift from the \nAmerican people, which really amounts to an enormous transfer of wealth \nfrom the working men and women of America who depend upon programs like \neducation--and that was discussed by my colleagues a few moments ago--\nand depend upon medical services from Medicare, Medicaid. In \nCalifornia, we call it Medi-Cal.\n  But what is going to happen here with this $1.5 trillion tax cut--and \nwhen you add the interest to it, basically, a $2.3 trillion bogus deal \nthat our Republican colleagues are putting forth--is what I call the \nTexas two-step. This really is Mr. Brady from Texas' program to really \ndo a two-step, together with the Speaker of the House, Mr. Ryan.\n\n  The two-step was laid out in the budget bill, and the two-step is \nthis:\n  First, make a monumental tax cut that really is for the superwealthy. \nAnd then as soon as you get that signed by President Trump, you do the \nsecond step, which is to do massive cuts so that you can deal with the \ndeficit.\n  So I am going to just bring up the issue of the deficit for just a \nmoment with this. I don't expect you to really look at all of these \nnumbers, but this is the structural deficit that exists today: $563 \nbillion structural deficit. Every year--this year and in the past \nyears--we are running a serious deficit: $1.5 trillion. Ten years from \nnow, it is going to be over a $1 trillion-a-year structural deficit.\n  So what does H.R. 1, the 1 percent bill, do to you?\n  What it does is it adds to the structural deficit this year $115 \nbillion; and, in 2027, it will add $155 billion.\n  You can look at it this way--and perhaps this is a little easier to \nunderstand. It is about the deficit, and this is why the two-step is \ngoing to happen.\n  By the way, all of the deficit hawks that once occupied that entire \narray on the right side of the congressional House of Representatives \ndisappeared. They migrated. They migrated south or somewhere. But I \nwill tell you this: as soon as this H.R. 1 percent passes, the deficit \nhawks will return with a mighty force to make cuts.\n  So here is what happens to the deficit: it starts down there--this is \nthe annual, not the total deficit--and rises to this in 2027. This \nlittle orange across the top is what will be added. We don't deal with \nthe deficit directly.\n  So here is the deal, folks: cut taxes now so that the superwealthy, \nfive of which are in President Trump's administration--oh, yes, \neliminate the estate tax. Great idea.\n  Do you know what that means to the Trump family?\n  If his wealth is $10 billion, as he says, what it means is that \nsomewhere around a $4 billion tax avoidance. Eliminating the estate tax \nand the Trump family immediately saves $4 billion. But maybe his net \nworth is really only $4 billion. So maybe it is just a $1 billion tax \nsavings. That is just on the estate tax alone.\n  This is a bad deal for Americans. It will increase the deficit and it \nwill create what we call the Texas two-step. Or maybe we should call it \nthe Speaker Ryan two-step.\n  Mr. Speaker, let me introduce a couple of my colleagues who have \njoined us today from the State of New York.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from New York (Mr. Suozzi) to \ncomment on this piece of legislation and what it means to his \nconstituents.", "turn": 1, "speaker": "Mr. GARAMENDI", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "S001201", "text": "  Mr. SUOZZI. Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Garamendi for bringing this \nSpecial Order to the floor today.\n  Mr. Speaker, I am here to point out the unfairness of the Republican-\nled bill for tax reform, as they claim, that would be devastating to \nNew York's middle class families.\n  I want the people at home to know that the U.S. Conference of \nCatholic Bishops have said:\n  ``This proposal appears to be the first Federal income tax \nmodification in American history that will raise income taxes on the \nworking poor while simultaneously providing a large tax cut to the \nwealthy.''\n\n\n  Mr. Speaker, this bill is flawed and unfair on many levels. One thing \nI have learned since taking office back in January, here in this \nCongress, is how very different the regions of this country are. It is \ndifferent from State to State and it is different from place to place. \nThe amount of money that people make in different regions is different. \nTheir cost of living is different, their property tax bills are \ndifferent, and their State income taxes are as different as night and \nday.\n  There are now 105 million full-time jobs in the United States of \nAmerica. Fifty-nine million of those jobs pay less than $50,000 a year. \nEighty-six million of those 105 million full-time jobs pay less than \n$75,000 per year. In my district, the average salary is actually higher \nthan that, but so are their property taxes, so are their income taxes, \nand so is there cost of living.\n  While this bill could be a net positive for some Americans in many \nregions--in my region and in many other regions, and in my State and my \ndistrict specifically--this bill is a huge net negative for middle \nclass families.\n  One particularly devastating element of this proposal is the \nelimination of the State and local tax deduction that would be patently \nunfair to the over 250,000 hardworking families in my district that \nrely on that important deduction. New Yorkers claim the State tax \ndeduction more than just about any other State. In my district, we have \nmore people in the State than any other place that claim the State and \nlocal tax deduction. It is the top 10 of the Nation.\n  Let's look at the some of the specifics of what actually happens in \nmy district:\n  People making between $50,000 and $75,000 in my hometown of Glen Cove \nwill see a 39 percent tax increase. In my hometown of Glen Cove, a \nfamily that makes between $100,000 and $200,000 will pay, roughly, \n$2,100 more in taxes under this plan.\n  In Huntington, every single family making over $50,000 a year will \nsee a tax increase. Every family in Huntington making between $50,000 \nand $75,000 a year will see--get this--a 135 percent increase on what \nthey currently pay. Every family making between $100,000 and $200,000 a \nyear will see a $3,000 tax increase.\n  In Whitestone, every individual tax filer making $50,000 or more will \nsee a tax increase, regardless of their income.\n  Mr. Speaker, the evidence is crystal clear for people in my district \nand in many places throughout this country.\n\n  This tax reform plan, as it is called, is a punch in the gut to \nmiddle class taxpayers. These are hardworking people who deserve to be \nlifted up, not slapped down, by draconian tax increases that offset tax \ncuts going to the superrich.\n  How could anyone support a bill that targets our middle class in such \na way is unfathomable. When I was elected to Congress, I came here \nready and willing to work--and I still stand ready and willing to \nwork--across party lines to get things done, even tax reform. I want to \nsee tax reform in this country, but I can't compromise my values. I \ncan't let down the families in my district who are going to be hurt by \nthis plan.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to try \nto do what is right: protect the hardworking Americans--the hardworking \nNew Yorkers--who play by the rules and ask for very little in return by \nvoting against this ill-conceived legislation, and protect the State \nand local tax deduction for our middle class.", "turn": 2, "speaker": "Mr. SUOZZI", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "G000559", "text": "  Mr. GARAMENDI.

Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from California (Mr. \nGaramendi) for yielding, but also, most of all, for his leadership on \nso many critical issues around jobs and infrastructure and, of course, \nfor pulling together this Special Order hour tonight on this very \nimportant subject, because I think that the American people should \nunderstand that Republicans in Congress are trying to literally rewrite \nthe U.S. economy with no hearings. There were a couple of markups, but \nthose are not hearings.\n  We only just have been receiving some of the information about what \nis even in the bill to be able to then see what the effects are. The \nreality is that we owe it to the American people to share how this bill \nwill affect their wallets, their housing, their education, their \nhealthcare.\n  Contrary to what the majority would have you believe, this tax bill \nis yet another vehicle for Republicans to raise taxes on millions of \nmiddle class families and reward the wealthiest and the largest \ncorporations by handing them trillions of dollars worth of taxes.\n  I think that Democrats certainly would love to see, as my colleague \nsaid, real tax reform; by that, I mean tax reform that benefits the \nmiddle class and tax reform that would allow us dollars to invest in \njobs, in infrastructure, in education, in healthcare.\n  The twist this time that I find interesting is that the Republican \nmajority has mysteriously jettisoned its dogmatic fidelity to reducing \ndeficits because--make no mistake about it--however you slice it, this \nRepublican tax bill will explode the budget deficits.\n  Mr. Speaker, Representative Garamendi talked about the two-step \nearlier, and that is right. We are all going to be dancing a two-step, \nbecause what the Congressional Budget Office literally just released is \nan analysis that said that this tax bill will lead to an immediate $25 \nbillion cut in Medicare.\n  This bill has many provisions in it. We have been talking about the \nState and local tax deduction elimination, and that is very important \nto my home State of Washington. We have about 800,000 people who are \nable to utilize that deduction and were able to reduce their tax \nliability by more than $2,600 in Republican and Democratic districts\n\n\nacross our State. This deduction is significant to our communities \nbecause, really, it guards against double taxation.\n  The Fraternal Order of Police just came out against what I am calling \nthe Republican tax scam and the SALT deduction elimination in \nparticular, the State and local tax deduction elimination.\n  Why did the Fraternal Order of Police come out against this?\n  They came out against this because they understand the two-step that \nwe are going to be dancing. They know that this tax bill and those \nkinds of deductions are ultimately going to lead to, and this is their \nwords: endangering the ability to fund these essential law enforcement \nagencies that actually keep our communities safe.\n  Another crucial mistake that the Republican tax bill makes is \neliminating tax-exempt bonds. For folks who are out there who are \nlistening, the way to think about this is, if you have an affordable \nhousing problem in your community, if you have a shortage of housing, \nwhich is happening across the country, then these tax-exempt bonds are \nthe way that we help encourage and leverage local and State dollars for \naffordable housing, with these tax-exempt bonds. They advance, also, \nvital transportation projects, and they support infrastructure projects \nand hospitals and colleges and charities.\n  For example, in my district, Seattle Pacific University has been able \nto use these private activity bonds to finance nearly $42 million in \nconstruction and renovations to the library and to the school of law. \nSimilarly, the University of Washington Medical Center has been able to \nuse these bonds to finance critical medical research that has been \nbeneficial across the country.\n  In eliminating several education-related tax deductions, the \nRepublican tax bill is also cutting off valuable paths forward for \nstudents of all ages to not only improve their lives, but also to join \na workforce that depends on 21st century skills.\n  Mr. Speaker, I know that Mr. Garamendi spent a lot of time on this, \nbut repealing the student loan interest deduction is in this bill.\n  Let me just remind people that we have $1.4 trillion in student loan \ndebt across the country. That is actually more than credit card debt in \nthis country.\n  This bill, in order to get tax cuts to the largest corporations and \nwealthiest 1 percent of individuals, would repeal that interest \ndeduction for student loans. In Washington State, that would harm more \nthan 275,000 taxpayers who claim that benefit, and it would raise their \nyearly taxes by more than $1,000 a year, on average.\n  This bill also hurts our responsible employers who provide tuition \nassistance to help workers continue their studies at associate's or \nundergraduate or graduate levels. Tens of thousands of students in \nWashington State have benefited from this deduction, and that is true \nacross the country. Nationwide, it is estimated that 70 percent of all \ncompanies offer tuition assistance.\n  There is another provision in this bill that everyone should be \nconcerned with, and that is eliminating the medical expense deduction. \nThat deduction basically says that, if you are suffering from a long-\nterm, very expensive disease, if you have somebody in a nursing home \nand you have to pay for expensive long-term care for people, or maybe \nsomebody who has cancer, that you can deduct medical expenses for those \nkinds of illnesses. This bill says: No more.\n  Once again, repealing the estate tax, which benefits 5,400 of the \nwealthiest families in this country, in order to provide that tax \nbenefit, we are actually going to take away this critical tax deduction \nfrom regular working families around medical expenses.\n  Finally, Mr. Speaker, the Republican tax bill repeals the new markets \ntax credit, which, again, was created, really, to incentivize \ninvestment in low-income and rural areas. That tax credit is \nresponsible for creating more than 12,000 construction jobs and an \nadditional 11,500 jobs in related industries across my State, just as \nan example. It is extremely shortsighted to repeal that, especially for \nan administration and a party that says that they care about investing \nin jobs and infrastructure.\n  We haven't seen any package for jobs and infrastructure. I am not \nsure if you have, but I certainly haven't.\n  The reality is that this bill, because of this two-step that Mr. \nGaramendi described, which I will just remind people what that is: the \ntransfer of trillions of dollars in wealth from the middle class to the \nlargest corporations and the top 1 percent, and then through exploding \nthe deficit, which this bill does, suddenly triggering automatic cuts \nas well as a rationale for cutting more from Medicare, from healthcare, \nfrom education, from transportation. That is what we are looking at.\n  The early word on the Senate Republican tax bill seems to be just as \nbad, because I just heard before coming onto the floor that Senate \nRepublicans are now saying that, once again, they are going to try to \nstrip healthcare from Americans by including a repeal of the Affordable \nCare Act individual mandate.\n  My State knows exactly what happened because we had a situation like \nthat about a decade ago, and we had to dig our way out of that. What it \nmeant was that, essentially, healthcare became way too expensive for \neverybody. There were too many people who were not buying healthcare, \nso you were stuck with all the people who needed healthcare, who were \nvery sick. It exploded costs and, literally, Americans across the \ncountry ended up suffering because of that.\n  They weren't able to get rid of healthcare. Three times we have \nbeaten that back. The American people, Republicans and Democrats in \nurban and rural districts across the country, said: No. We want our \nhealthcare. Do not take our healthcare away from us.\n  Once again, the Republicans plan to incorporate this provision and \ntry to once again strip healthcare.\n  Mr. Speaker, insanity is said to be doing the same thing over and \nover again and expecting a different result. I really fear for the \nthreshold that we are crossing. I fear for our economy; I fear for our \nmiddle class families; I fear for our low-income families; and I fear \nfor the future of this country and for the future of our children, \nbecause the reality is what we should be doing, if we were going to \nraise money through taxing people more, is we should be investing that \nmoney into infrastructure, jobs, healthcare.\n  Not only are we not cutting the taxes for people who need it the \nmost, but we are increasing their taxes to give a tax break to the \nwealthiest, and we are destroying all of the investments that we need \nto make into the U.S. economy and into our communities and into our \nmiddle class families.\n  This is an incredibly important issue. I don't think people realize \nthat the Republicans are trying to push through a vote on this bill as \nearly as this Thursday.\n  I really believe that there are some Republicans across the aisle who \nhave come out already and said that this is not a bill that helps our \nfamilies, that helps our middle class families and our communities. \nThey have been courageous to say that.\n  Mr. Speaker, I want to thank them for doing that, and I want to urge \nother Republican colleagues across the aisle to do the same thing so \nthat we can protect the livelihoods of our children and our families \ninto the future.\n  Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative Garamendi so much for his \nleadership and for his constant speaking out on the need to invest in \ninfrastructure and jobs.", "turn": 10, "speaker": "Ms. JAYAPAL", "itemno": 10}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "G000559", "text": "  Mr. GARAMENDI.

Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I \nthank\n\n\nhim for organizing this Special Order on this terrible Republican tax \nscam.\n  This scam is a desperate, disgraceful attempt to line the pockets of \nthe wealthiest Americans and corporations at the expense of the middle \nclass.\n  And for what?\n  We are told the corporate and upper income tax cuts will result in \nmore investment, in greater economic growth, which will yield more jobs \nand more revenue for the country and higher wages for the middle class, \nbut that is bull.\n  They have run this scam twice before. Ronald Reagan passed similar \nupper class tax cuts and told us they would generate such economic \ngrowth that they would pay for themselves. George W. Bush pulled the \nsame scheme.\n  What happened?\n  President Reagan's cuts sent the national debt--the national debt \naccumulated from George Washington through Jimmy Carter, which was a \nlittle less than $800 billion in 1980--from $800 billion to $4.3 \ntrillion 12 years later, quintupled.\n  President Bush's tax cuts turned the projected 10-year, $5.65 \ntrillion surplus--remember at the end of the Clinton administration, we \nwere having surpluses, and the projected surplus over 10 years was \n$5.65 trillion. His tax cuts turned that, in 8 years, into $10.63 \ntrillion debt.\n\n\n  It turned a $5.6 trillion surplus into a $10.6 trillion debt. So the \nargument that these kinds of tax cuts for the upper-income people and \nfor corporations generate greater economic growth to generate more tax \nrevenues has been tried twice, not to mention in Kansas, recently. It \ndoesn't work.\n  There is nothing in this bill to argue that this tax scam will have a \ndifferent impact on the economy than Reagan's or Bush's. In fact, this \nscam is so skewed toward the rich and corporations, it could actually \nbe worse.\n  The bill would eliminate the alternative minimum tax. To put it in \nperspective, in 2005, the only year for which we have at least the \nsummary pages of Donald Trump's tax returns, in that year, Donald Trump \npaid $38 million in taxes. Of that, $31 million was the alternative \nminimum tax.\n  The Republicans want to eliminate the only tax that we actually know \nthat Donald Trump has ever paid. His taxes would have been $5 million, \nnot $38 million, if it weren't for the alternative minimum tax. Of \ncourse, he wants to eliminates it.\n  Republicans will repeal the estate tax, despite the fact that the \nestate tax is paid by only the wealthiest 5,000 estates in the country \nevery year--two-thousandths of 1 percent.\n  Wealthy Americans would also see immediate personal benefits from \ncuts to corporate taxes. This bill immediately and permanently cuts the \ncorporate tax rate to 20 percent from 35 percent. It also cuts the \nrates for pass-through corporations from 39 to 25 percent.\n  Once again, Republicans claim this will help small businesses, but it \nsimply isn't true. These pass-through corporations are extremely \nwealthy partnerships and private companies. If you need a good example, \nI have a great one just outside my district; it is called the Trump \nOrganization, which is organized as a pass-through corporation.\n  Now, they tell us that middle-income businessmen will profit by this, \nbut middle-income businessmen are not paying more than 25 percent to \nstart with, so this will only benefit the rich, again.\n  But while billionaires and corporations will enjoy all these \nbenefits, the Republican bill hands working families ticking time \nbombs. Unlike the corporate tax changes, which are permanent and \nindexed to inflation, every benefit in the Republican tax scam for the \nmiddle class sunsets after 5 years or is indexed to a slower rate of \ninflation.\n  Speaker Ryan brags about a family earning $59,000 a year getting a \n$1,500 break in their tax burden next year. Well, even in his example, \nby 2023, that family is right back where they started; and by 2027, \nthey will be paying $500 more than they were this year.\n  This bill wipes out nearly every deduction and credit that helps \nworking families make ends meet--the deduction of State and local \nincome taxes, which hundreds of thousands of middle-income New Yorkers \nrely on each year.\n  When the income tax was first enacted to finance the Civil War, and \nwhen it was re-imposed to finance World War I--and we have had it since \nthen--we have always had a deduction for State and local taxes. Why? \nBecause you shouldn't be taxed on a tax. You shouldn't be taxed doubly. \nIt is unfair. But now we will be.\n  The medical expense deduction, which families use to pay for \neverything from fertility treatments to nursing home care, this \ndeduction says: If you are a middle-income family, and your out-of-\npocket expenses, beyond your insurance, if you have insurance, beyond \nyour Medicare, if you are a senior citizen, total more than 10 percent \nof your total gross income, you can deduct your medical expenses to the \nextent it exceeds 10 percent of your total gross income.\n  So it has got to be large. If your income is $75,000 a year, you can \nonly deduct the medical expenses that exceed $7,500, not the first \n$7,500. This will be gone, too.\n  Now, if you have got parents in nursing homes, you depend on this. If \nyou have got a child with cerebral palsy--God forbid--if you have got a \nkid with cancer, you depend on this, but it is going to be gone.\n  The student loan interest deduction will be gone. So people go to \nschool, they go to college, they come out with these terrible, huge \ndebts. They have to repay the student loans. At least they can deduct \nthe interest on the student loans. Not anymore.\n  The adoption tax credit, child care spending accounts, even \ndeductions for teachers who buy school supplies for their classrooms, \nall gone. And why? To pay for tax breaks for billionaires and \ncorporations.\n  But, as has been pointed out, under this scam, corporations keep \nthese deductions for their income. They keep the State and local tax \ndeduction, but individuals don't.\n  How can Republicans claim this bill helps the average American when \nfamilies are denied the deductions that corporations get to keep?\n  If this bill is so blatantly harmful to working families, why are my \nRepublican colleagues so crazy about it?\n  Does it create jobs or give the economy a boost? No. As I said, we \nhave tried that twice before with disastrous results. Kansas, \nBrownbackistan as they call it, after Governor Brownback tried that, \nwith disastrous results, so that the Republican legislature had to \nincrease taxes earlier this year, over the Governor's veto, to start \ngetting out from 4-day school weeks.\n  Under this plan, Republicans would tax companies less when they \nproduce goods overseas than when they produce them here in the U.S. It \nis a giant incentive to large corporations to send jobs overseas.\n  And if you ever doubted the Republicans were doing this at the \nbidding of corporate donors, well, just last week, Chairman Brady, of \nthe Ways and Means Committee, tweaked an excise tax multinational \ncorporations opposed and gave those corporations back $100 billion in \nrevenue. No such change was made for working families.\n  Now, we know--we know from experience--that a few years from now the \nRepublicans will use the $1.7 trillion deficit this scam creates to \nsay: Oh, my God. Look at this massive deficit. We have to make terrible \ncuts to Social Security, to Medicare, to education, to infrastructure, \nnot that we want to. We love Medicare. We love Social Security, but we \nhave got to savage them in order to pay for these terrible deficits \nwhich we created.\n\n  That is what they are building in now. That is what this tax bill is \ndesigned to produce.\n  The Republicans are scamming America. They are offering a facade of \nlower taxes that most Americans will never see, in exchange for massive \nand permanent tax breaks for the wealthy and corporations, and \nguaranteed cuts down the road, in fact, some of them right away, to \nSocial Security, Medicare, Medicaid, education, infrastructure.\n  I do not accept that deal, and the American people shouldn't have to \neither. We can find bipartisan common ground that allows us to support \nworking families, create jobs, and see every American pay their fair \nshare.\n  American corporations, huge corporations, have $2.4 trillion stashed\n\n\nabroad, which they don't pay taxes on until they bring it home. We \ndon't have to allow that. We can make them pay taxes on it right away, \nwhether they bring the money home or not.\n  Why should we encourage them to keep the money abroad, to create jobs \nabroad, by telling them they don't pay taxes if the money is abroad?\n  And the Republican bill just makes that worse. This Republican tax \nscam is not a fair plan. It is not a plan to increase the economy. It \nis not a plan for economic growth. It is not a plan for fairness to the \nmiddle class.\n  Let me just say one other thing. A number of years ago, while we were \ntold--I have seen ads--we were told by the Republican leaders that the \neconomic growth from this bill will produce huge gains for the average \nfamily. Never mind the tax cut that the average family will or won't \nget.\n  Because of the economic growth from this tax plan, wages will go up, \nand the average person will get $1,500 or $1,800 or $2,000, depending \nwho you are listening to, in extra wages.\n  Well, a number of years ago, we were told the same thing about a \nbankruptcy bill. This bankruptcy bill that the big banks pushed and all \nthe Republicans pushed, we were told that if we passed this bill, the \nbanks would save so much money from certain deadbeats that the average \nAmerican would save $400 a year in lower interest rates.\n  I offered an amendment to say: Fine, mandate that the interest rates \nbe lowered. And, of course, the Republicans voted that down.\n  Well, we passed that bill. We passed that bill 12 years ago. Have you \nseen the interest rates go down? The interest rates are still sky high. \nThe banks raked in the money, hand over foot. The lobbyists did very \nwell. The Republicans collected the campaign contributions. The \nAmerican people did not benefit.\n  Same thing here. There will be no increase in economic growth as a \nresult of this bill. There will be no increase in benefits. There will \nsimply be a huge sucking sound as the money is taken from the middle \nclass and low-income people and given to the superrich.\n  This bill is disgusting. It ought to be rejected.", "turn": 12, "speaker": "Mr. NADLER", "itemno": 12}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "G000559", "text": "  Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for bringing us the \nview from New York. He is quite correct about what happened during the \ngreat crisis in 2008, 2009. The American public, probably to the tune \nof about $1 trillion, bailed out Wall Street. And here we go again. \nMajor support for the American corporations who are hiding trillions of \ndollars overseas.\n  Let me just give you one other example. There is a lot of talk around \nhere from our Republican friends that somehow, if we reduce the \ncorporate tax rate, we will see jobs being generated and some $4,000 a \nyear of new money in the pockets of American workers.\n  Really? You think so?\n  Let me give you an example of one of America's great corporations, \nAT&T. I think we all know AT&T. We probably have them on our \nsmartphone. In the last decade, AT&T was capable, using various tax \nloopholes and deductions, to lower its effective corporate tax rate, \nnot to 20 percent, but to 8 percent.\n  So over that period of time, while they were reducing their effective \ntax rates, that is their real tax rate, from whatever it was to 8 \npercent during that decade, did they create new jobs? No.\n  What they did was to lay off 80,000 workers. And at the same time, \nguess what? The CEO, he raked in $124 million.\n  So what is going on here?\n  The American corporations, back in the seventies and sixties, \nactually invested more than 50 percent, almost 60 percent, of their \nafter-tax profits in expanding their business--investment in plants and \nequipment and wages and hiring people.\n  Today, less than 10 percent is spent on expanding their businesses. \nInstead, they are pumping up their stock prices with buybacks and with \ndividends.\n  So what is going down?\n  Tell me that this is going to somehow create jobs.\n  And, by the way, the gentleman didn't quite pick this one up, so let \nme add to the weight of this terrible bill. They use what is called \nterritorial tax system. Terrific. Corporations will not be taxed for \ntheir profits globally, but, rather, they will only be taxed for their \nprofits within the United States, so it is even a further incentive to \noffshore your jobs to the lowest tax place in the world: Bahamas. Used \nto be Ireland, but the EU decided that Ireland was cheating the rest of \nthe European countries; put a stop to that, so now they are off.\n  Apple, a great California company, abandoned Ireland and is now, I \nthink, located in the Jersey Islands off the coast of Great Britain.\n  Scheme, scam, the American public is going to be the beneficiary? No. \nIt is going to be the victim, is going to be the victim of this great \ntransfer of wealth.\n  The gentleman had one more point to make, and then I would like to go \nto my colleague, also from New York and what we still call the East-\nWest Show.", "turn": 13, "speaker": "Mr. GARAMENDI", "itemno": 13}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "N000002", "text": "  Mr. NADLER. I do have one more point to make, and the gentleman \nreminded me of it.\n  In 2004, when we had the repatriation, we told the big corporations \nthey could bring all the offshore money home and pay only a fractional \ntax on it; they were going to create jobs and so forth. And what \nhappened? They didn't create jobs. They had buybacks. They enriched \ntheir executives. They didn't create jobs.\n  The fundamental problem with this analysis is not that corporations \ndon't have enough money to invest, and, therefore, if you give them \nlower taxes they will have more money to invest; they have plenty of \nmoney to invest. They don't see the investment opportunities, and that \nis a different problem. There is plenty of money to invest. They are \nrolling in cash. There is not a dearth of investment opportunity. There \nis not a dearth of investment cash.\n  So if you give them more cash, they will pay their CEOs higher. They \nwill put more money into stock buybacks. The shareholders may benefit, \nbut they won't hire more workers. The economy won't benefit; and we \nwill be taking money away from the middle class and lower-income \npeople, and we will be taking money away from the governments, local \ngovernments, that have to spend the money on schools, housing, health, \nroads and bridges, and so forth to build up this country.", "turn": 14, "speaker": "Mr. NADLER", "itemno": 14}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "G000559", "text": "  Mr. GARAMENDI.

Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative Garamendi for leading \nus in this Special Order. It is so important that the public understand \nwhat is happening here with this issue.\n\n\n  The first response ought to be: Here we go again.\n  Trickle-down has not worked in the past--the far past, the recent \npast. It is not going to work again.\n  When does trickle-down become trickle-up?\n  Well, to suggest that this is a tax reform act is really pulling a \ntrick on the public. This is about a tax cut, and a tax cut for \ncorporations, a tax cut for the wealthiest amongst us.\n  This trickle-down theory becomes trickle-up because you are taking \nand raising the taxes on some 36 million families, those that would be \nclassified as middle class families, those who work day in and day out \nand don't even earn a minimum wage, but they are working. The poorest \namongst us, the lowest bracket, gets an increase in its rates.\n  How is this fair? How is this economic or social justice?\n  Both measurements prove that it is false. It is not economically \nsound. It is not socially just. What we are doing here is playing a \ngame with the economy, and we are putting the economy, the American \neconomy, at great risk.\n  We have seen major efforts made since January of 2009 to grow the \neconomy, and now we have this scam, this trickery, to go and do a \ntrickle-up: take from the working families, deny their purchasing \npower, weaken their purchasing power, and give it to corporations, give \nit to the upper income strata in this country. That is a formula for \ndisaster, and we are going to pay wickedly for this effort.\n  We have always heard about deficit situations. When President Clinton \nwas in office, when President Obama was in office, the Republicans \nwould talk about a deficit situation. There seems\n\n\nto be no concern about deficit here, a deaf ear to the deficit.\n  Borrowing to spend. Borrowing to spend. Borrowing $1.5 trillion, \nwhich probably amasses to $2.1 trillion to $2.3 trillion with the cost \nof borrowing, and using that borrowing to spend on the wealthiest \namongst us, be they families, individuals, or corporations.\n  How does that make economic sense? How does that help the economy?\n  When we look at this situation, we are going to impact your average \nfamily in any of our districts, those who are working to maintain a \nhousehold, to perhaps put aside some savings for improvements of that \nhousehold or to assist their children in their pursuits of a career, be \nit apprenticeship programs or college programs. We are going to hurt \nthese families.\n  Students will realize that their tuition deduction is eliminated--\neliminated. Students will realize, former students, that their loan \ninterest deductions will be eliminated.\n  I heard a lot about this, Mr. Speaker, when I was home over the last \ntwo weekends. We have always deducted exorbitant medical expenses when \nwe did our taxes. We prepared that for our accountant because we had \nexorbitant medical fees, medical expenditures, be they for families who \nare walking through life with Alzheimer's or who are fighting cancer or \nwho have chronic illnesses. They deserve to have that deduction.\n  I am told, on average, it is $9,000. Seventy-three percent of people \nwho make that deduction are earning less than $75,000. This is a brutal \nresponse to America's working families. It is a harshness tossed \nagainst this economy that has finally started to churn over the last \nseveral years. Now we step up and want to wreck all of that.\n  We have all sorts of efforts that deny various professions, teachers, \nfor one, who will not be able to deduct for classroom expenses where \nthey will, out of their own pocket, provide greater resources for the \nchildren who are in their classes that they teach. They are \nfacilitating this discovery, self-discovery, within children. They are \ndigging into their pockets to make that experience all the more real, \nall the more magical, all the more important, and here we are going to \ndeny teachers to deduct those expenses, but we won't do that for the \nbusinesses that want to reach into their own pocket and spend.\n  We look at this situation, and we understand who gets a fair shake in \nthis deal, in this scam, and it is regrettable.\n  Now the talk of a Senate version bringing in the individual mandate? \nDollars that are made available for families to realize healthcare \ncoverage, and we are going to penalize them and use that to help pay \nfor this borrowing? This is a disaster.\n  America needs to see this with its eyes wide open and to call your \nindividual Representatives and ask them to tell you how you are going \nto benefit from this package.\n  Somebody today told me it is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for tax \nreform--tax reform. Is there reform in this mess? There are the same \nold loopholes. We grow more loopholes, and they are getting a tax break \nin addition. What are we doing to our economy here? This is a terrible \nbill.\n  When it comes to the SALT deduction, the State and local tax \ndeduction, you will destroy States by requiring double taxation on the \ninvestments they make in their own programs in their State. That will \nseverely impact upon people in my home State of New York.\n  I think it is a disaster that this House, this majority, the entire \nmajority, would allow this bill to come to the floor.\n  Before you tell me how you are going to vote on this bill, tell me \nhow you tried to stop it from coming to the floor because it hurts so \nmany Americans. Thirty-six million families will be impacted. They will \nsee a tax increase. That is not my word. It is not Representative \nGaramendi's word. It is coming from the Tax Policy Center.\n  People are putting this one under the microscope, and they are \ndetailing what is in here and what is not in here, and this is a scam. \nIt is bringing down an economy. It is taking it in the wrong direction. \nIt gives tax breaks to corporations that want to grow their prosperity \noffshore and making it more productive for them to take jobs overseas.\n\n  How can we tolerate this? No wonder they are trying to rush the bill \nnow. Get it done in a day or two before America finds out what is in \nit. This is a tax disaster, not a tax reform. It is a tax cut for the \nwealthy at the expense of the working families and those who work below \nminimum wage in this country, people who make it their goal to be self-\nsufficient, and now this is how they are rewarded.", "turn": 16, "speaker": "Mr. TONKO", "itemno": 16}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "G000559", "text": "  Mr. GARAMENDI.

The Texas two-step is first you seriously cut the revenues with \nthis tax bill that is not a reform but, rather, a bill that actually 50 \npercent of the $1.5 trillion reduction goes to the American \ncorporations and the top 1 percent.
