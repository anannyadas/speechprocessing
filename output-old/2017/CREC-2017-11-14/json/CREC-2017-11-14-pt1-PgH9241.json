Mr. Speaker, I rise to support 76 years of celebrating \nGod's Word during National Bible Week. No other book has sold more \ncopies or changed more lives than the Bible.\n  Abraham Lincoln said: ``In regard for this great book, I have this to \nsay, `It is the best gift God has given to man. All that the good \nSavior gave to the world was communicated through this book.' ''\n  May we always remember the impact the Bible has had on this country \nand on our democracy. May we govern according to its timeless precepts \nand principles, and may God bless these United States of America.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. ARRINGTON", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "186", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H9241", "wkday": "Tuesday", "day": "14", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "CELEBRATING GOD'S WORD", "id": "CREC-2017-11-14-pt1-PgH9241", "title": "CELEBRATING GOD'S WORD"}
