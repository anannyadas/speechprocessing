Mr. Speaker, I was here when Democrats and Republicans \ncame together to enact bipartisan tax reform in 1986. We paid for our \ntax overhaul and never once asked future generations to foot the bill.\n  President Trump said in July that tax reform is, and I quote, ``going \nto be easy.'' I will admit that, to someone like him who is new to \ngovernment and who may not understand fully how Congress works, what we \nachieved in 1986 may, in hindsight, appear to have been easy. It \nwasn't.\n  It was difficult because it required compromise; it was difficult \nbecause it required trust; and it was difficult because it required \nboth parties to make tough choices and share the burden of taking \nresponsibility, along with the benefit of claiming victory.\n  Somewhere along the way, Mr. Speaker, it seems that many in the \nRepublican Party lost sight of this truth. First on healthcare, and now \non taxes, they have decided that it would be easier not to work with \nDemocrats at all, so they have chosen a partisan path, where the only \nones with whom they have to compromise are themselves. It is ``going to \nbe easy,'' they said.\n  And the result: We now expect, on this floor, a bill so dangerous and \nso reprehensible to the taxpayers of this country that nearly every \nmajor organization representing taxpayers, small businesses, workers, \nfarmers, seniors, home builders, realtors, teachers--and I could go \non--oppose this bill.\n  There are more serious problems with the Republican tax bill than \ntime to address them on this floor, so I want to highlight the three \nthat make it so utterly dangerous to our economy and to the middle \nclass.\n  First, most of the benefits of the tax cuts Republicans are proposing \nwill benefit only those at the very top 1 percent; the 99 percent left \nbehind. According to the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center's latest \nanalysis, under the Republican plan, 47 percent of the tax cuts will \nbenefit that top 1 percent, just 1.2 million households making more \nthan $900,000 a year.\n  Let me repeat: the top 1 percent will get nearly half of all the tax \ncuts in this bill, and 50 percent for the 99 percent.\n  Second, the Republican plan raises taxes on 36 million middle class \nfamilies. That is not what the Speaker said it was going to do. He said \nhe would give everybody a tax cut. That was not true, and is not true. \n36 million middle class American households will see their taxes go up \nover the next 10 years as a result of this Republican plan.\n  And third, the Republican plan will explode the debt by more than \n$1.7 trillion over the next decade. This bill is the granddaddy of all \ndebt creators. This means that those tax cuts, more than half of which \nbenefit only the top 1.5 percent, will be paid for by a huge tax \nincrease on our children and on our grandchildren.\n  The late Senator Russell Long from Louisiana liked to cite an old \nditty about who gets stuck with the pain of tax increase. He said: \n``Don't tax you, don't tax me, tax that fellow behind the tree,'' \nmeaning, of course, that none of the voters want a tax increase, so if \nyou raise taxes, make sure it is someone else who is out of sight and \nout of mind.\n  In this case, sadly, Mr. Speaker, that fellow behind the tree is a \nchild. This is a tax increase on all those children. It is a child who \ncan't vote and doesn't have a voice in this debate.\n  The Republican plan asks Members to pile $1.7 trillion or more of \ndebt onto our children and grandchildren and put the fiscal \nsustainability of our country at further risk. When confronted with \nthis fact, we heard only the same arguments we heard in 2001 and 2003, \nbefore the last major Republican effort to cut taxes precipitated the \nworst recession in our memory and a period of severe budget tightening \nthat led to disinvestment in our country under the threat of \nsequestration.\n  That argument, flawed and false, is that these tax cuts will grow the \neconomy so much that the ensuing growth will magically erase all the \ndeficits we know their plan will accrue.\n  So easy, Mr. Speaker, so easy. The cuts will simply pay for \nthemselves, we\n\n\nare told. We have been told that before, of course. The cycle repeats: \nRepublican promises that tax cuts will pay for themselves, followed by \nmassive deficits, 189 percent increase in the deficit under Ronald \nReagan, followed by Republicans insisting that we respond with austere \ncuts to investments in our people and in our opportunity. So easily \nthey forget.\n  But middle class Americans will not forget who is responsible when \ntheir taxes go up, when their tax increases pay for tax cuts for the \ntop 1 percent, and when, in the years ahead, more and more investments \nneed to be cut to pay the interest on the debt under which this plan \nwill bury the children and grandchildren of America.\n\n  And all because my colleagues across the aisle wanted to skip out on \ndoing what they knew would be hard, just as they did when former Ways \nand Means Committee Chairman Dave Camp introduced his comprehensive tax \nreform that was responsibly paid for. That is Dave Camp, Republican, \nState of Michigan. He is retired now, but he offered a responsible \nbill, and it was not even considered by his committee.\n  He asked his colleagues to do something hard, of course, but they \ndismissed it, dismissed it out of hand, because it would have required \nhashing out a difficult compromise. But easy is no synonym for \nsuccessful.\n  President Kennedy told us that we choose these things, that is, \ntackling our greatest challenges, ``not because they are easy, but \nbecause they are hard.''\n  So I ask my Republican friends--no, I urge them, set aside this \ndangerous, reckless, and irresponsible bill. Instead, let's choose the \nhard path that involves hard choices and trust and all of those things \nthat made tax reform successful in 1986, which are the missing elements \nin this flawed bill.\n  Mr. Speaker, Democrats are ready to sit down with you and work on \nthis challenge, together. It won't be easy, that is a promise, but if \nwe do it together, if we do it in a way that doesn't balloon the debt \nor raise taxes on the middle class, we have a chance to do it right. \nLet's take that chance.\n", "turn": 1, "speaker": "Mr. HOYER", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "186", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H9181-H9182", "wkday": "Tuesday", "day": "14", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "GOP TAX BILL", "id": "CREC-2017-11-14-pt1-PgH9181-4", "title": "GOP TAX BILL"}
