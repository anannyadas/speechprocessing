Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of an important \nbill that could help so many families with loved ones struggling with \nlife-threatening diseases. I am talking about the Right to Try Act \nwhich would allow terminally ill patients to request access to \nexperimental drugs after all other available treatment options have \nbeen exhausted as well as prevent the Federal Government from \ninterfering with States that have already passed such laws.\n  While Missouri passed a right-to-try law in 2014, I was reminded of \nthe importance of this bill just last year. As I was returning to my \noffice one morning after votes on the House floor, I was stopped by a \nlittle boy, Zack Mongiello, who ran after me to catch my attention. \nZack, who is only 11 years old, is one of the most effective advocates \nfor the right-to-try campaign. His father, Frank, was diagnosed with \nALS a few years ago.\n  This devastating disease has an average life expectancy of 2 to 5 \nyears, with half of those diagnosed surviving for only 3 years. Ever \nsince that life-changing diagnosis, Zack's family, including his mother \nand five siblings, have been doing all they can to ensure passage of \nthis important bill.\n  When Zack came running up to me that day last year, his message was \nclear and powerful: ``My dad is dying,'' he said. ``Please help.'' I \nwas incredibly moved by this, as I think anyone would be. Here is his \npicture. This precious little boy, whose family is dealing with the \nunimaginable, convinced me and numerous other legislators of the \nurgency of this legislation. We must act now.\n  I want Congress to help Zack's family and other families who have no \nother options. Washington should not stand in the way of Americans with \nlife-ending illnesses who want to try to save themselves and have no \nother available options.\n  That is why I am a proud cosponsor of the Right to Try Act and was \nglad to see the Senate pass their version of this bill. It is now time \nfor the House to act, and I call on my colleagues to support this \npotentially lifesaving legislation. Please join me so that we can give \nfamilies like Zack's more options and hopefully more time.\n", "turn": 1, "speaker": "Mrs. HARTZLER", "itemno": 3}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 4}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "186", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H9187", "wkday": "Tuesday", "day": "14", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "GIVE THEM A CHANCE", "id": "CREC-2017-11-14-pt1-PgH9187", "title": null}
