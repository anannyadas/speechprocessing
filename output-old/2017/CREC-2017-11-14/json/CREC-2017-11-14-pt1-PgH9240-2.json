Mr. Speaker, the last time we had real tax reform in \nthis country was 1986.\n  To achieve economic growth in the 21st century, we need a Tax Code \ndesigned for the 21st century. The status quo is simply not getting it \ndone. It is not good enough.\n  The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is a bold, transformative step that \nsimplifies our Tax Code and reduces the tax burden on working Americans \nand middle-income families. This bill reduces the Federal tax rate for \nthe majority of low- and middle-income Americans while doubling the \nstandard deduction. More than 65 percent of filers in Georgia's Sixth \nCongressional District use that standard deduction.\n  What does it mean?\n  It means that a married couple will be able to pay not a dime of tax \non their first $24,000 of income every year.\n  The bill will also fuel economic growth and job creation. Small \nbusinesses will be at the lowest tax rate since World War II. The Tax \nCuts and Jobs Act contains real tangible benefits for the majority of \nAmerican taxpayers. I support this bill enthusiastically and I urge my \ncolleagues to do the same.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mrs. HANDEL", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "186", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H9240", "wkday": "Tuesday", "day": "14", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "NEED A TAX CODE FOR THE 21ST CENTURY", "id": "CREC-2017-11-14-pt1-PgH9240-2", "title": "NEED A TAX CODE FOR THE 21ST CENTURY"}
