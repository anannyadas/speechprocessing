Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my support for the \nconference report on the National Defense Authorization Act, which \npassed the House of Representatives today.\n\n\n  In a great bipartisan moment, the NDAA received overwhelming support \nto authorize almost $700 billion in defense spending and set priorities \nfor our military, including the largest pay raise for our troops in 8 \nyears. The conference report kept funding important to Georgia's 12th \nDistrict, included in the earlier versions of the FY18 NDAA, such as $8 \nbillion in funding for cyber operations and over $85 million in new \nmilitary construction to prepare for our cyber warriors at Fort Gordon, \nlike new family housing and a new gate.\n  Ensuring that our soldiers, sailors, and airmen are equipped with the \nfacilities and resources they need to fight the battles of today and \ntomorrow is crucial to our Nation's safety and security.\n  Days after celebrating one of the most important days of the year \nhonoring our veterans, I am happy to say that, with the passage of H.R. \n2810, we have provided for the common defense, supported our \nservicemembers, and worked to close the critical readiness gap.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. ALLEN", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "186", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H9239-H9240", "wkday": "Tuesday", "day": "14", "month": "November"}, "related_bills": [{"type": "HR", "context": "OTHER", "congress": "115", "number": "2810"}], "doc_title": "NDAA CONFERENCE REPORT PASSAGE", "id": "CREC-2017-11-14-pt1-PgH9239-5"}
