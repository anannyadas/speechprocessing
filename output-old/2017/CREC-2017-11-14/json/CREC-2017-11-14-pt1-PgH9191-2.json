Mr. Speaker, House Resolution 616 provides for \nconsideration of H.R. 2874, the 21st Century Flood Reform Act, and the \nconference report to accompany H.R. 2810, the National Defense \nAuthorization Act for Fiscal Year 2018.\n  H.R. 2874, the 21st Century Flood Reform Act, reauthorizes the \nNational Flood Insurance Program for 5 years, introduces great private \nmarket competition, and provides additional reforms to benefit \npolicyholders and taxpayers.\n  Mr. Speaker, the Office of Management and Budget has said that the \nNational Flood Insurance Program, or NFIP, is not fiscally sustainable \nin its current form. The 21st Century Flood Reform Act helps transition \nit to a more sustainable program.\n  Importantly, the bill will help foster a robust product market for \nflood insurance, which allows private insurers to compete, in turn, \ndriving down the price of policies while creating greater consumer \nchoice. This is a win for policyholders and taxpayers alike.\n  Representing Alabama's Gulf Coast, it is important to me and my \nconstituents that they have access to affordable flood insurance \nthrough the National Flood Insurance Program or a private insurer.\n  I appreciate the inclusion of provisions in the 21st Century Flood \nReform Act to protect current policyholders while making the program \nsustainable.\n  I also appreciate Chairman Hensarling's willingness to work with \nMembers whose constituents, such as mine, rely very heavily upon the \nNFIP to address concerns we raised about the initial version of the \nbill that passed out of committee.\n  All in all, this bill is a positive step toward reauthorizing our \nNation's flood insurance program, which is currently set to expire on \nDecember 8. We must take action to ensure coastal homeowners and others \nin flood-prone areas have access to affordable insurance.\n  Mr. Speaker, I look forward to working with my colleagues in the \nSenate to get a long-term reauthorization across the finish line and \nsigned into law by President Trump.\n  House Resolution 616 also allows for consideration of the final \nversion of the National Defense Authorization Act that was conferenced \nbetween the House and the Senate, reconciling the differences between \ntwo different versions.\n  Mr. Speaker, before I go into the substance of the bill, I would like \nto take a minute to commend the open and regular order process that has \ntaken place from start to finish.\n  As a member of both the Armed Services Committee and the Rules \nCommittee, I have followed this bill throughout the legislative process \nand think we should all be proud of the regular order and the fact that \na wide range of members played a role in crafting the final product.\n  I applaud Chairman Thornberry, Ranking Member Smith, and the entire \nArmed Services Committee staff for their dedication to an open process. \nI also appreciate the countless hours they have poured into this \nconference report.\n  Just as a quick reminder, we considered 275 amendments during the \nHouse Armed Services Committee back in June, and another 210 amendments \nwhen the NDAA was considered by the full House in July. In total, 485 \namendments have been considered in the House, and, just as important, \nthere was a clear bipartisan split between the number of majority and \nminority amendments.\n  The conference committee continued this bipartisan and collaborative \nprocess under the leadership of four chairmen and ranking members. Once \nagain, this year's NDAA is truly a bipartisan and bicameral bill that \nprovides the best for our military and national security.\n  Mr. Speaker, this NDAA follows through on our promise to our \nservicemen and -women and our constitutional duty to provide for the \ncommon defense of the United States of America.\n  The FY18 NDAA conference report authorizes a 10 percent increase in \ntotal military spending, reminiscent of the Reagan era defense buildup. \nThe bill authorizes $626 billion for base budget requirements, $66 \nbillion for overseas contingency operations, and $8 billion for other \ndefense activities.\n\n\nThat adds up for a total national defense top line of $700 billion.\n  I am incredibly proud to support a top-line number high enough to \nbegin reversing the readiness crisis that has endangered the lives of \nour servicemembers and made it harder to defend our country.\n  Over the past 8 years, and under sequestration, our military has \nsuffered. We have planes that can't fly, ships that can't sail, and \nsoldiers who can't deploy, all while the number of threats around the \nworld keep rising.\n  I want to acknowledge that this top-line number is significantly \nhigher than the Budget Control Act cap for defense. I look forward to \ncontinued dialogue with the Appropriations Committee to raise this cap \nthat has crippled necessary defense spending in recent years.\n  Every day we operate under a continuing resolution or the BCA caps is \nanother day we are failing our men and women in uniform. The FY18 NDAA \nfulfills the authorization side of the equation, and I am hopeful the \nappropriations side will follow.\n  The FY18 NDAA increases the size of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Army \nGuard and Reserve, Naval and Air Reserve, and Air Guard to repair and \nrestore readiness.\n  The bill also authorizes construction of 13 new Navy ships, including \nthree littoral combat ships, as we work to grow toward a 355-ship \nfleet.\n\n  In a well-deserved benefit for our troops, the NDAA provides for a \n2.4 percent pay increase for servicemembers, which is the amount our \ntroops are entitled to under current law.\n  Another small but important provision in this bill eliminates the so-\ncalled widow's tax, which requires surviving spouses of servicemembers \nkilled in action to forfeit the survivor benefit pension annuity. The \nfinancial burden of this tax is something our military families should \nnot bear.\n  The bill also continues to advance Chairman Thornberry's priority of \nreforming and strengthening the military's acquisition process to make \nit more effective and efficient.\n  Importantly, the legislation takes into account the Trump \nadministration's $6 billion budget amendment to authorize more funding \nfor missile defense threats against North Korea, Navy ship repairs, and \nmore troops in Afghanistan.\n  Our men and women in uniform all over the world are on a mission to \nprotect and defend the freedoms we hold dear. The way I see it, our \nmission in Congress is to give these brave men and women the resources \nthey need to succeed. The FY18 NDAA does exactly that and is another \nstep in a multiyear process of restoring our military strength to \nfurther protect our national security. Ultimately, this bill is about \nkeeping the American people safe and secure.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support House Resolution 616 and \nboth of the underlying bills, and I reserve the balance of my time.", "turn": 5, "speaker": "Mr. BYRNE", "itemno": 8}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "S000480", "text": "  Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from \nAlabama for yielding me the customary 30 minutes, and I yield myself \nsuch time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, H.R. 2810, the Fiscal Year 2018 National Defense \nAuthorization Act, takes important steps towards strengthening our \nnational security and supporting our troops.\n  The conference report authorizes a total of $692 billion in \ndiscretionary budget authority, $26 billion more than the \nadministration requested.\n  I am pleased that it raises military pay by 2.4 percent, an increase \nfrom the President's request of 2.1 percent.\n\n\n  It also strengthens our efforts to counter Russia's campaign to \nundermine our democracy by fully funding cybersecurity and cyberspace \noperations at $8 billion and it drops harmful restrictions on funding \nthe New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty extension between the United \nStates and Russia. This treaty continues a bipartisan tradition that \nbegan under President Reagan, verifiably reducing both countries' \nnuclear arsenals.\n  Mr. Speaker, there is one glaring problem with this measure, and that \nis that the Budget Control Act imposes a $549 billion cap on defense \nspending for fiscal year 2018. This bill blows past that by more than \n$143 billion. Unless the Senate, the House, and the President come to \nan agreement on lifting or modifying the budget caps, there is no way \nthat these spending levels can become law. So far, that agreement is \nnot in the offing and it is past time for a bipartisan compromise on \nrealistic spending levels for defense and nondefense spending alike.\n  While I am glad to see this pay increase for our troops, this \nlegislation does not exist in a vacuum. Later this week, the \nRepublicans plan to bring to the floor a disastrous tax bill that would \nforce military families and veterans to finance tax cuts for \ncorporations and the superwealthy. The bill repeals tax credits that \nhelp veterans find employment. It makes education more expensive for \nveterans and undermines the GI Bill. It makes it more expensive for \nmilitary families to sell their homes. It eliminates tax relief for \nveterans suffering from chronic illnesses.\n  Veterans Day was just a few days ago, Mr. Speaker, and it is no way \nfor the majority to thank them for their service.\n  Also before us today is H.R. 2874, which is known as the 21st Century \nFlood Reform Act. Now, everybody in this Chamber recognizes the \nNational Flood Insurance Program is badly in debt, to the tune of $25 \nbillion. The hurricanes this year, together with the flooding across \nLouisiana last year, have stretched the program beyond its breaking \npoint.\n  Unfortunately, this package will cause more harm than good for the \ncommunities already struggling to rebuild. It will make flood insurance \nmore expensive for families by increasing premiums.\n  It also exempts businesses from the requirement to purchase flood \ninsurance even though the vast majority of policyholders with this \ninsurance only purchase it because they are required to by law. This \nchange would take effect beginning in January 2019.\n  The Independent Community Bankers and a number of other groups oppose \nthis provision. As businesses pull out of the insurance market and the \nnumber of participating dwindles, responsible businesses that stay in \nthe market will be forced to bear the burden of greatly increased \npremiums. I think these are shortsighted changes that will be felt all \nacross the insurance market.\n  Additionally, the legislation doesn't do enough to update the often \nout-of-date flood insurance rate maps being used in communities across \nthe country and in my district. Accurate flood insurance maps prepared \nwith the most recent mapping technologies would help constituents in \nall of our districts better prepare and protect themselves against \nflooding. Some current maps are so outdated that the maps don't reflect \nchanging landscapes and critical flood mitigation improvements. This \nbill simply falls short in helping homeowners who want to do the right \nthing based off the best available information.\n  We are in the wake of some of the worst hurricanes our Nation has \never experienced, and more of them. We are seeing how vital, \naffordable, and readily available flood insurance is to so many \ncommunities. It is unconscionable that the majority is moving forward \nwith this partisan package of bills, unlikely to ever pass the Senate, \nbecause this will only further delay the extension of the program with \n1 month left before it expires.\n  As the majority lurches from crisis to crisis and fritters away \nprecious legislative time with this partisan approach, we will likely \nfind ourselves right back here doing this over again in December.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.", "turn": 6, "speaker": "Ms. SLAUGHTER", "itemno": 9}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "B001289", "text": "  Mr. BYRNE.

Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from Alabama \nfor yielding.\n  First, I want to make a comment about how this process has gone in \ncoming up with this compromise with the amendment on the flood \ninsurance package. We have worked in the Financial Services Committee \nwith outside groups, whether it was the home builders or the realtors \nor the insurance industry. We have worked with Members of Congress from \nthe Gulf States and\n\n\nfrom the East Coast and from the West Coast. We worked with Democrats. \nWe had a number meetings with the ranking member of the committee, all \ntaking in their consideration, which has brought us to a compromise \nthat I don't know that anybody loves, but everyone says is a pretty \ndarn good bill that strives to make needed reforms in a program that \nhasn't been working well. When we have programs that don't work well, \nlet's try to fix them.\n  We have a program that, as was just mentioned, is $25 billion in \ndebt, but that doesn't include the $16 billion we just gave the program \nand forgave. So really, it is $41 billion in debt.\n  So when do we think through the policies of a program that continues \nto run deficits, number one, but, number two, continues to incentivize \npeople to live in harm's way?\n  I was down in Houston and I got to see a family who was talking about \ntheir next-door neighbor whose house was burning down. He was telling \nthe story about his neighbor, and as the house started on fire, he sent \nthe kids outside--like you would because your house is burning--as the \nflood waters are rising. The dad went to go put out the fire, and as he \nwas putting out the fire, he looked out the window and saw his kids \nwere being swept away by a flood. The current was too strong, so he ran \noutside to save his kids and let his house burn.\n\n  What are we going to do in that neighborhood that had been flooded \nthree times in the last 10 years?\n  We are going to rebuild houses in the same flood plain. This doesn't \nmake sense. Let's think about a reform that is going to improve the \nprogram, that helps people get out of dangerous areas and get into \nbetter areas that don't flood. Having a flooding house isn't a pleasant \nplace to live.\n  Not only that, first responders risk their lives to go save people, \nand they die. We are incentivizing through this policy to allow people \nto live in these dangerous areas. I don't have a lot of time left, but \nthe reforms are going to, yes, gently increase some of the premiums for \nthe most highly subsidized properties called the pre-FIRM properties. \nWe offer over $1 billion in mitigation to help families flood-proof \ntheir home or get out of their home and go to a better place to live \nbecause this improves the solvency of flood insurance. We are helping \nthem with mitigation.\n  We are helping them with mapping, allowing communities that haven't \nbeen mapped to actually map themselves, to pay for it, to take care of \ntheir own future and destiny instead of waiting for the Federal \nGovernment. We allow for a private market to come in and offer you a \npremium that might be lower than the Federal Government.\n  God forbid we offer a family a choice to let the private sector \ncompete with a public offering. My God, if you get a lower price, that \nis great. If you don't get a lower price, you can stay in the Federal \nplan.\n  My goodness, I am going to have some people come up in a second and \nsay: But you could cherry-pick, and that could jeopardize the solvency \nof the program.\n  The program is insolvent. It is $25 billion in debt--actually, $41 \nbillion, if you include that $16 billion. It is not a solvent program.\n  Just think if in Houston and in Florida we had people who had bought \ninsurance in the private market, we would be saving taxpayers money. \nThis is a commonsense bill that makes the program better, that helps \nfamilies, that empowers communities. Let's stand together. A little bit \nof reform might go a long way in making government actually work, so I \nwould encourage all of my colleagues on both side of the aisle to vote \n``yes'' for common sense.", "turn": 8, "speaker": "Mr. DUFFY", "itemno": 11}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "S000480", "text": "  Ms. SLAUGHTER.

I am a real estate developer. We build houses. We build \ncommercial projects. All that stops unless reform is made in the Flood \nInsurance Program. This bill proposes major reforms to one of the \nFederal Government's most broken programs, the National Flood Insurance \nProgram.\n  The Government Accountability Office has labeled the NFIP a high-risk \nprogram mainly because policyholders often pay premiums well below the \nactual risk of flooding on their properties.\n  H.R. 2874 requires FEMA to conduct an annual actuarial review of the \nstatus of the NFIP that will allow FEMA to adjust rates appropriately \nand help maintain the program's financial stability.\n  Currently, there are 4.92 million NFIP policies providing $1.23 \ntrillion in coverage to Americans. Many of these properties are what \nthis bill defines as multiple loss properties, where NFIP claims have \nbeen filed repeatedly.\n  This bill requires FEMA to raise premiums on multiple loss properties \nby 15 percent annually if the premiums do not reflect the full risk. \nThis is just another step toward FEMA improving the financial stability \nof the NFIP.\n  Often, with the Federal Government, there are changes and agreements \nmade behind closed doors with little or no public comment. H.R. 2874 \nrequires FEMA to publish an explanation and to hold public hearings in \nregards to any changes to premiums on policies. This is an excellent \nexample of making the government more transparent and helping \npolicyholders more accountable.\n  Lastly, the 21st Century Flood Reform Act requires the Government \nAccountability Office to conduct a study on how we can simplify the \nNFIP. With our country being battered by hurricanes and heavy rainfall, \nwe need to ensure that the NFIP is placed in sound financial footing \nfor future generations.\n  Mr. Speaker, for these reasons, I urge my colleagues to support this \nall-important legislation.", "turn": 14, "speaker": "Mr. NORMAN", "itemno": 18}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "S000480", "text": "  Ms. SLAUGHTER.

Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my colleague from New York, \nthe ranking member of the Rules Committee, for yielding.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to the bill and also to the \nrule. Just a few weeks ago, we observed the fifth anniversary of \nSuperstorm Sandy. New Jersey's recovery from that traumatic event has \nbeen prolonged in part by issues facing the National Flood Insurance \nProgram. Too many of my constituents are still dealing with high \npremiums and inaccurate flood maps or are still waiting for their Sandy \nclaims appeals to be decided.\n  We need a long-term NFIP reauthorization that focuses on increasing \naffordability, investing in mitigation, capping the profits of flood \ninsurance companies, and comprehensively restructuring the claims \nprocess--and this bill fails these tests.\n  H.R. 3823 would undermine the NFIP by allowing the development of a \nprivate flood insurance market, opening the door to allowing insurance \ncompanies to cherry-pick low-risk properties while leaving high-risk \nones in the NFIP. This bill does not do enough to address affordability \nissues and actually increases rates for some policyholders. It will \nallow commercial properties to opt out of mandatory coverage even if \nthey are in a high-risk zone, which will further decrease the pool and \nweaken the program.\n  Finally, this bill simply does not do enough to improve transparency \nand reform the claims process. Enactment of this legislation would make \nflood insurance more expensive and less available, while not actually \naddressing the program's many problems.\n  I have actually introduced legislation to tackle NFIP's issues head-\non. The bill is the bipartisan SAFE NFIP Reauthorization Act, which \nwould reauthorize the program, cap premium rate increases, authorize \nfunding for more accurate flood mapping, reform the appeals process, \nand cap the compensation of flood insurance companies.\n  I also offered amendments to the Rules Committee that would improve \nthis bill, including a 10 percent cap on premium increases, increasing \nthe increased cost of compliance from $30,000 to $100,000, capping the \nprofits of flood insurance companies, and other pro-policyholder \nprovisions, but none of these amendments were accepted by the Rules \nCommittee.\n  I hear my Republican colleagues talk about transparency.

Mr. Speaker, I would also like to thank my colleague, Mr. \nByrne, for his hard work, both on the Armed Services Committee and on \nthe Rules Committee, on this important rule.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the rule that will \nallow for consideration of the National Defense Authorization Act for \nFiscal Year 2018.\n  Mr. Speaker, as elected Members of this body, we have no higher \nobligation or responsibility than to provide for the support and the \ndefense of our Nation. No matter what else we do in this body--and we \ndebate very big, important issues. We debate tax cuts, we debate \nhealthcare, and these are crucial issues, but none of those issues \nmatters if we fail to get the resources necessary to defend this Nation \nfrom our adversaries.\n  For far too long, Mr. Speaker, we have failed to do that. Over the \nlast 8 years, we have seen policies that have failed to provide the \nkind of resources our Defense Department needs. We have also seen, Mr. \nSpeaker, legislation from this body--in particular, the Budget Control \nAct--that has caused significant damage to the military.\n  We have heard on the Armed Services Committee, week after week, \nbriefings from every layer of the military--from the Chairman of the \nJoint Chiefs, from the Secretary of Defense, and from the combatant \ncommanders--briefings about the extent to which there is a gap that is \ngrowing between our abilities and the abilities of our adversaries. \nNow, this is a gap that people seem to want to ignore, Mr. Speaker, but \nwe do so at our own peril.\n  I think that we need, as Members of this body, to think very \ncarefully about what we are going to say to our children and our \ngrandchildren one day if they say to us: Why didn't you do all you \ncould to ensure for the defense of this Nation? Why didn't you do all \nyou could when you were in a position to provide the resources?\n  Mr. Speaker, one of the reasons we don't do all we can is because we \nenable the Senate rules. We have gotten ourselves in a situation, \nthrough the Budget Control Act and through the way that we do budgeting \nin this House, where we enable the dysfunction of the United States \nSenate, and we let the United States Senate be in a position where, in \nfact, they prevent us from doing what we know is right from a policy \nperspective.\n\n  I am very proud of this piece of legislation, Mr. Speaker, because \nwhat this does, in a bipartisan fashion, is begin to fix that. It \nbegins to remedy the situation. It begins to allow our military to get \nout from under the burden, the hole that they have been in for the last \n8 years.\n  Funds authorized in this NDAA will ensure that we are able, for \nexample, to modernize our strategic forces. It will also ensure, Mr. \nSpeaker, that we are able to begin to provide funding for the kind of \nmissile defense that we know we need in a situation in which our \nadversaries have gained tremendous ground.\n  Mr. Speaker, when we have the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs come \nbefore the committee and tell us in public session that, if we continue \non the path we are on, within 5 years we will not be able to project \nour power, every Member of this body needs to stop everything else they \nare doing and listen to that warning. If we can't project our power, \nthen we cannot defend this Nation.", "turn": 18, "speaker": "Ms. CHENEY", "itemno": 22}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

I think closed rules are not good \nfor this institution regardless of who does it, and I would urge the \nmajority party to think about open rules so that the legislature can \ntruly work its way.\n  The legislation itself includes a handful of measures that I \nauthored--I am happy about that--to require reporting on Russia's role \nin the Balkans, including Serbia's defense relationship with Russia; to \nenhance congressional oversight of changes made to policies and legal \ninterpretations that govern security operations; a strategy to improve \ntransparency and civilian protection in Nigeria; and a requirement for \na Defense Department official to protect cultural heritage, the looting \nand trafficking of which is a funding source for terrorism.

Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman \nfrom Alabama for yielding.\n  Mr. Speaker, there are fundamental problems with flood insurance. We \nall know that. The program, by some estimates, has a debt, recently, of \nup to $24 billion, and it is going to be compounded by Hurricanes \nMaria, Irma, and Harvey and the other disasters that we have had this \nyear. We have had extraordinary damages this year.\n  But what is being missed is that this legislation really doesn't even \nfix the problem. You can look back over the last 37 years. Since 1980, \nwe have had 218 disasters that have exceeded $1 billion. We have spent \n$1.3 trillion responding to these disasters.\n  This bill is projected to, perhaps, save $18 million a year--$18 \nmillion, I will say it again. We have spent $1.3 trillion since 1980. \nThere are fundamental problems that need to be addressed.\n  Mr. Speaker, 40 percent of this Nation's population lives in just 10 \npercent of the land area adjacent to the coast--10 percent. Forty \npercent of the population lives there, and it is growing. It is going \nup. We have got to get good at resiliently living in these coastal \nareas.\n  Now, let me show you something, and this is what is happening in \nLouisiana. Louisiana drains, literally, from Montana to New York, and \nthe Canadian Provinces are all coming down.\n  Mr. Speaker, as we get additional development in the United States, \nwhat happens with that water? It comes down to us.\n  So let me give you a scenario.\n  Somebody builds their dream home or somebody starts a small business, \nand they fully comply with the regulations that are in place at the \ntime for baseline elevation. They build a home or business exactly \nwhere it is supposed to be. They start getting additional water down \nfrom this watershed or maybe from the coast because the Corps of \nEngineers has caused 2,000 square miles of the coast of this Nation to \nerode.\n  So, yes, we are more vulnerable. We are getting more water down or we \nhave the Gulf of Mexico encroaching on our citizens.\n  Why should our citizens be responsible for that? They have no control \nover what is happening. They have complied with the regulations and \ncomplied with the guidelines at the time of construction.\n  Mr. Speaker, I view this as a tax. If our citizens are being burdened \nwith additional fees or expense as a result of the government's \ninability to do its job to properly manage resources and water, then \nthat is not a premium increase; that is a tax, Mr. Speaker.\n  While I commend people for working on this bill and trying to address \nthis, the fundamental premise of the bill is flawed. It is \nfundamentally flawed. You can't charge people for things over which \nthey have no control. You can't charge people whenever they stepped up \nand did exactly what the government told them to do when they built a \nhome or built a business.\n  These things aren't portable structures. You can't just pick up a \nhome and say, ``I am going to move it.'' You can't pick up a business \nand say, ``I am going to move it.''\n  But that is exactly what this bill does. It increases the premiums \nand, in some cases, even kicks them out of their homes and businesses, \nthese dream homes and these lifesaving investments.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge opposition to the underlying bill.", "turn": 28, "speaker": "Mr. GRAVES of Louisiana", "itemno": 32}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "S000480", "text": "  Ms. SLAUGHTER.

I am \nparticularly enthusiastic about the inclusion of my bipartisan \nlegislation to facilitate the development of a robust private flood \ninsurance marketplace.\n  After months and even years of negotiations, we have produced \nlegislation that appropriately balances the need for affordable flood \ninsurance with our responsibility to act as faithful stewards of \ntaxpayer dollars.\n  Everyone knows that the National Flood Insurance Program is broken. \nWe should act accordingly. We need to fix it. But before we do that, we \nmust agree to proceed.\n  Less than a month ago, many of us voted to bail out this floundering \nprogram, forgiving $16 billion of its debt. But we knew that it would \nbe irresponsible to merely kick the can down the road. This is the \nopportunity to make things right.\n  I believe we need to proceed with the debate because we need to have \na reasonable and responsible conversation about fixing this problem \nbefore it gets worse. Americans deserve better than a Big Government \ninsurance monopoly that is unable to pay for the risk it insures.\n  The 21st Century Flood Reform Act will usher in a new era of consumer \nchoice, competition, and affordability by empowering policyholders to \npurchase the insurance products that best meet their needs.\n  We are getting rid of the top-down, single-payer approach to \ninsurance where we pretend there is no danger until there is a tragedy.\n  Giving consumers choice in a competitive marketplace will not only \ndrive down costs, but will also help reduce the unacceptable number of \nhomes that are not protected by flood insurance.\n  The NFIP can be an important tool for mitigating flood risks and \nhelping families recover from disasters after they strike, but it \ncannot be the only tool. A Federal program that conceals actual risk \nthrough artificially low rates is neither compassionate nor \nresponsible.\n  People deserve to know when they are in danger. When the Federal \nGovernment provides them with information that suggests otherwise, we \ndo more harm than good.\n  We cannot expect to have educated, thoughtful consumers if we deprive \nthem of the market information that is needed to make the smart \ndecisions. By putting policyholders on a slow path to sound premium \nrates, we are stepping towards a future where the threats of major \nfloods are confronted before they are realized.\n  I think we all agree that more needs to be done to mitigate flood \nrisks and incentivize investments in resiliency. We can take the first \nsteps by eliminating the false security that inoculates our society to \nthe dangers of flooding.\n  Let's remove the blindfold we have placed over the public's eyes. \nLet's gradually walk back the subsidies that conceal a homeowners risk. \nIt is time for this Nation to confront this threat with clear eyes and \na vision for the future. This bill is the first step in the right \ndirection.\n  In closing, I want to thank Chairman Hensarling and Housing and \nInsurance Subcommittee Chairman Duffy for their tenacity and commitment \nto paving the way for a safer and more affordable system for managing \nflood risks in this country.

Cannon (R-Illinois) said: \n     ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman \n     from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to \n     yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first \n     recognition.''\n       The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous \n     question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an \n     immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no \n     substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.'' \n     But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the \n     Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in \n     the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition, \n     page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the previous \n     question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is generally \n     not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member \n     controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of \n     offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by \n     voting down the previous question on the rule. . . . When the \n     motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the \n     time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering \n     the previous question. That Member, because he then controls \n     the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for \n     the purpose of amendment.''\n       In Deschler's Procedure in the U.S. House of \n     Representatives, the subchapter titled ``Amending Special \n     Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on \n     such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on \n     Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further \n     debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues: \n     ``Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a \n     resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control \n     shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous \n     question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who \n     controls the time for debate thereon.''\n       Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does \n     have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only \n     available tools for those who oppose the Republican \n     majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the \n     opportunity to offer an alternative plan.\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 44}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "B001289", "text": "  Mr. BYRNE.
