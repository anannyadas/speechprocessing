Mr. Speaker, as we observe American Education \nWeek, I rise today to recognize Leslie Diane Hiatt, a remarkable \nteacher and social activist in my 40th Congressional District of \nCalifornia. As a teacher at Bell Gardens Elementary in the Montebello \nUnified School District, Ms. Hiatt has inspired her students to act on \ninjustices in their community and in the world overall.\n  Born in Whittier, California, on December 10, 1960, to James and Jean \nHiatt, Ms. Hiatt was raised in a loving family that encouraged activism \nand equality. From a young age, her commitment to social justice and \nservice to her community was apparent. In high school, where she \norganized the first girls' track team, she often spent her lunch break \nat the local elementary school organizing intramural sports for the \nyounger students. She also spent her free time writing letters to \npoliticians about air pollution and the Vietnam War, trying to right \nthe wrongs of the world. In 1979, Leslie graduated from Monte Vista \nHigh School in Whittier, and went on to attend the University of \nSouthern California, from which she graduated in 1983.\n  Subsequently, Leslie started her teaching career at Bell Gardens \nElementary School In 1988, she pursued her Master of Arts at California \nState University, Fullerton. She also received a Math Authorization \nfrom Center X at the University of California, Los Angeles, in 2001.\n  Throughout her 34-year career as an educator, Ms. Hiatt has worked \nwith immigrant and Latino communities. This has positioned her \nperfectly to help inspire students to believe they cannot be \nbystanders, and that in order to bring change in the world, they must \nuse their voice to speak up about injustices. To encourage these \nconversations, she has her students write letters to government \nrepresentatives and emphasizes the importance of persistence and \ncollaboration. These experiences have empowered her students. Here are \nsome of their particularly important efforts over the years.\n  In 1989, one of Ms. Hiatt's classes refused to have grapes from the \nschool cafeteria after learning about the United Farm Workers movement \nand the dangers that grape workers faced as they were being exposed to \npesticides. As a result of the ongoing struggle of grape workers, her \nstudents wrote letters to their school board, and after a lengthy \ndebate, the district honored the grape boycott. The students' actions \nlater received attention from labor leader Cesar Chavez.\n  In 2015, as her students learned about the history of immigration in \nCalifornia and the unconstitutional ``Mexican Repatriation'' \ndeportations of the 1930s, her students were dismayed at the complete \nabsence of information on the deportations in their history textbooks. \nThey were also astounded to know that there has never been a federal \napology for those 1930s deportations, which expelled over 1.2 million \nUnited States citizens and over two million Mexican nationals who were \nlegally living in the United States. After drafting a letter to \nPresident Obama asking for a federal apology for the Mexican \nRepatriation of the 1930s, the students entered State Assemblywoman \nCristina Garcia's ``There Ought to Be a Law'' contest. Their goal was \nto have California recognize the history of the Mexican Repatriation \nand include it in California history textbooks. As winners of the \ncontest, Ms. Hiatt's students traveled to Sacramento to testify in \nsupport of the bill, and in the fall of 2015, Governor Brown signed the \nbill, AB 146, into law.\n  Later that same year, Ms. Hiatt's students wrote to me asking for my \nhelp in obtaining a federal apology for the unconstitutional \ndeportations. In 2016 and 2017, I introduced H.R. 6314 and H.R. 1412, \nrespectively, which would establish a committee to officially study the \nMexican Repatriation and to recommend appropriate remedies.\n  To this day, Ms. Hiatt's students continue to speak up and take \naction on pressing world events. They have focused on such subjects as \nthe Lakota Tribe in North Dakota, Hurricane Harvey, and the earthquake \nin Mexico City.\n  When Ms. Hiatt isn't teaching her classes and working with her \nstudents to implement new legislation, she also co-teaches the STEM \nClub at Bell Gardens Elementary, and helps organize the school's annual \nscience fair. She is also currently taking science education classes at \nCalifornia State University, Long Beach, to learn more about science \ncontent and pedagogy, and she is a member of the university's \nElementary Science Learning Academy program.\n  Ms. Hiatt has the infinite love and support of her husband, Francisco \nLopez, and her son, Joaquin Lopez, whose encouragement inspires her to \ncontinue her work as a passionate educator.\n  Ms. Hiatt has shown exemplary dedication to children and families in \nmy 40th Congressional District, and I am pleased to recognize her work \nas an educator and leader. I hope my colleagues will join me in \nrecognizing her tremendous activism, her commitment to social justice, \nand her determination to empower and develop a new generation of \nconscientious and compassionate activists.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Ms. ROYBAL-ALLARD", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 3}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "186", "extension": true, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "E1567", "wkday": "Tuesday", "day": "14", "month": "November"}, "related_bills": [{"type": "HR", "context": "OTHER", "congress": "115", "number": "1412"}, {"type": "HR", "context": "OTHER", "congress": "115", "number": "6314"}], "doc_title": "RECOGNIZING THE LEADERSHIP AND ACTIVISM OF LESLIE DIANE HIATT", "id": "CREC-2017-11-14-pt1-PgE1567"}
