Mr. Speaker, today I honor my constituent Grant R. Ward. \nGrant of Gilbert, Arizona. He has been chosen to receive the Lifetime \nAchievement Award from the National Water Resources Association (NWRA).\n  This lifetime achievement award was established in 1948. According to \nthe NWRA, this award ``recognizes members and individuals who have \nactively served in the leadership of the Association for many years and \nwho, by their activities and service to the goals and objective of the \nAssociation, merit Life Member status.'' Grant embodies the spirit of \nthis distinguished award.\n  Grant has an impressive resume of service. He graduated from Brigham \nYoung University in 1967 and received his law degree in 1969 from the \nUniversity of Idaho. From there, he commenced his professional career, \nserving as an assistant branch manager at the Valley National Bank. He \nthen took a job as General Manager of the Roosevelt Water Conservation \nDistrict serving there for over a decade. Following this position, he \ncontinued his distinguished career as Executive Vice President of the \nAgri-Business Council of Arizona, Assistant General Manager of the \nCentral Arizona Water Conservation District, and General Manager of the \nMaricopa-Stanfield Irrigation & Drainage District. He currently is an \nindependent water and power consultant.\n  Grant is married to Judy and their family includes seven children and \n36 grandchildren.\n  Mr. Speaker, Grant has a remarkable track record of service to our \ncommunity.
