Let \neverything done in this Chamber be for Your glory and for Your praise. \nWe bless You in advance for the mercy and truth that will permeate from \nthis House on this day and reach all areas of these United States and, \nindeed, the uttermost parts of the world.\n  In Jesus' name we pray.\n  Amen.\n", "kind": "Unknown", "speaker": "Unknown", "itemno": 0, "turn": -1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 1}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "186", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H9188", "wkday": "Tuesday", "day": "14", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "PRAYER", "id": "CREC-2017-11-14-pt1-PgH9188-4", "title": "PRAYER"}
