Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 3 minutes.\n  Mr. Speaker, for 55 straight years under both parties, Congress has \ncome together to pass a defense authorization bill to support our \ntroops and our country's security. Along with my partner on the Armed \nServices Committee, Mr. Smith, I am pleased to bring a conference \nreport that will do so again.\n  Mr. Speaker, I want to acknowledge and thank all the Members on both \nsides of the aisle who contributed to this product, and especially the \nmembers and staff of the House Armed Services Committee.\n  I also want to thank the conferees from the 14 other committees of \nthe House who were appointed to the conference, and I appreciate their \ncontributions.\n  Finally, I want to express my appreciation for the opportunity to \nwork with Mr. Smith and with our colleagues in the Senate, Senator \nMcCain and Senator Reed.\n  We do not always agree among the four of us; in fact, we disagree \nsometimes energetically, but I have no doubt that each of them is \ncommitted to doing the right thing for our troops and the right thing \nfor our country. Each of them is a patriot whom I admire.\n  Mr. Speaker, I know that I speak for all Members when we wish Senator \nMcCain the best in dealing with his current health challenges.\n  Members and the public were given a summary of this conference report \nlast week, so I will simply say that I believe the priorities in this \nbill are, number one, our people; number two, the readiness; number \nthree, missile defense; and number four, reform to see that we are more \ncapable of meeting the security challenges our country faces in the \nfuture and today.\n  In that regard, I especially want to commend the work of Mr. Rogers \nand Mr. Cooper and the Strategic Forces Subcommittee on space. They \ninitiated deep, far-reaching reforms based on a real sense of urgency, \nand they are in this bill. Their work exemplifies the work of our \ncommittee: bipartisan, really nonpartisan, on the national security \nchallenges the U.S. faces today.\n  Mr. Speaker, unfortunately, as the world grew more dangerous, we cut \nour defense budget and we added to the burden borne by the men and \nwomen who serve us.\n  We will not rebuild and fix our problems in 1 year or one bill, even \nwhen it is matched by an appropriations bill, which this will need to \nbe, but we can head in the right direction. That is what this \nconference report does, and I hope Members will support it.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.", "turn": 5, "speaker": "Mr. THORNBERRY", "itemno": 9}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "S000510", "text": "  Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 5 minutes.\n\n\n  Mr. Speaker, first and most importantly, I want to concur with the \nremarks of Mr. Thornberry. We have had a great many people work \ntogether to produce a very important product. The staff, the Members, \nHouse and Senate, have all done an outstanding job.\n  On the Armed Services Committee, we are very proud of the fact that \nwe produce a legislative product every year. We actually do legislation \nthe way it is supposed to be done. We work it through committee. \nChairman Thornberry often outlines the number of different provisions \nthat were asked for at the committee level, at the full House level and \nthe Senate level, and we worked through those, reached compromise where \nwe could, and produced a product that is truly a legislative product.\n\n\n  That is testimony to the great work, first and foremost, of our \nstaff. Both the House and Senate do an outstanding job with hundreds of \ncomplex issues and working with all the Members, and I thank them very \nmuch.\n  It is also a testimony to the Members, both House and Senate, to \ntheir commitment to make sure that we pass the National Defense \nAuthorization Act, understanding how important it is to support our \ntroops and meeting our national security needs.\n  I also want to thank our colleagues in the Senate. Mr. Thornberry and \nI oftentimes say those are some of our most contentious debates--not \nbetween us, but between us and the Senate. But they are handled, I \nthink, with great dignity and intelligence, and I enjoy working with \nSenator McCain and Senator Reed. They are great partners in this final \nproduct.\n  I am proud of this final product. There is a lot of very good policy \nin here. Mr. Thornberry mentioned several of the keys: acquisition \nreform, basically getting more out of the money we spend, making sure \nthe system works better.\n  I particularly want to thank Chairman Thornberry. He has taken a lead \non this issue for a number of years. I think we have made significant \nimprovements, even while acknowledging that we still have a long way to \ngo to get the efficiency that we need out of the Pentagon budget, but \nthat is an important change.\n  I also think that this bill does a great job of supporting our troops \nand their families. As the chairman mentioned yesterday, it is \nbasically the case that you recruit a servicemember but you retain the \nfamily, and that means that you have to provide for them. We fully fund \nthe 2.4 percent pay raise in this bill and support our troops and their \nfamilies in many other ways. This is a very good product.\n  I will also say, I want to particularly thank Representative Langevin \nfor working on this issue. This bill states that climate change is a \nnational security threat. We make that the policy of the United States \nCongress, to acknowledge climate change and the impact that it is going \nto have on our national security, and Representative Langevin was \ntireless in making sure that that was part of this bill.\n  So this is a good product. I am proud of it. I am proud of the work \nthat we have done together to produce a legislative product that, as \nMr. Thornberry says, none of us like everything that is in it, but we \nreached a compromise to produce a product on an important issue.\n  The challenge that we have going forward is what the chairman \nmentioned at the end there: This bill funds, I think it is right around \n$696 billion in defense spending. It goes $80 billion, roughly, over \nthe budget caps, and the bill can't do that on its own. Unless the \nbudget caps are lifted and appropriators pass the appropriations bill, \nthat doesn't happen; and we haven't made a lot of progress on that.\n  I was thinking, today, back to 2011, in August, when we first passed \nthe Budget Control Act. We were about 2 days short of not being able to \nmeet our debt ceiling obligations when we passed that; and at that \ntime, the hope was that we would come together on a compromise to deal \nwith our deficit and our debt to get us on a fiscally responsible path.\n  Well, over 6 years later, I can't say that we have made an enormous \namount of progress on that, and that is a huge threat to our troops and \nour national security. I would also say that it is a threat to the \nnondefense discretionary budget and the rest of the budget as well.\n  But without question, one of the greatest challenges the Pentagon \nfaces--they don't know from one month to the next how much money they \nare going to have. Is this going to be the number? Is this bill going \nto work?\n  I hope so, but we don't know. We have got to resolve that issue. We \nhave got to figure out how to have a fiscally responsible budget so we \ncan pass appropriations bills every year so all aspects of the \ndiscretionary budget can have some predictability.\n  It is absolutely true, as the chairman and others have said, we have \na readiness shortfall. What that means is we are not providing the \nequipment and the training to our troops necessary to fully prepare \nthem to do the missions we are asking them to do. I have no doubt that \npart of that is underfunding.\n  But another part of it is we have a National Security Strategy that \nis unclear and, as it is presented, is far greater than we would ever \nhave the resources to match. I had a meeting with a Pentagon official \nwho told me that they were very concerned because they were way short \nof having the funds necessary to meet their 2012 National Security \nStrategy.\n  And make no mistake about it. As big and confusing as the Pentagon \nmay look, they have a reason for everything that they spend. They have \na plan in place. Right now, we don't have the funds to match those \nplans.", "turn": 6, "speaker": "Mr. SMITH of Washington", "itemno": 10}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Rogers of Kentucky).

Mr. Speaker, I yield myself an additional 1 \nminute.\n  That is a huge problem. So going forward, while we do need to provide \nmore resources and more stability, I also think we need to take a look \nat that National Security Strategy and say: Where are we spending money \nthat we shouldn't be? What part of our strategy do we not need?\n  If we can't do that, if we can't cut back, we are never going to be \nin a position to provide adequate funds to our troops, and, to me, that \nis the absolute worst result.\n  Whatever the strategy is, the one thing that it absolutely ought to \ndo is fund our troops sufficiently to meet it. To have a big idea of \nwhat we ought to be able to do and then to underfund the men and women \nwhom we are asking to do it, I believe, has led to some of the \naccidents and deaths that we have had recently with our ships and with \nour planes.\n  We need to adequately fund readiness to meet a mission that is \nachievable.

We can no longer delay \nthe maintenance and sustainment problems that plague the military, and \nwe can no longer defer critical training and modernization that \ndirectly impact the ability to respond rapidly to emerging threats \nworldwide.

I am especially thankful for the \nspirit of cooperation that enables us to pass an act that directly \nimpacts the young men and women who defend our country.\n  The conference report authorizes $3.6 billion in additional \noperations and maintenance funds to increase training, spare parts, \nfacility and equipment maintenance, and other readiness enablers. This \nis a very important step to support the recovery of readiness in areas \nthat have been adversely impacted by high operational tempos and made \nworse by numerous continuing resolutions and the effects of \nsequestration. However, Congress must go further and provide the \nDepartment with budget stability by repealing sequestration so that we \ncan continue to support the training, the maintenance, and the \nmodernization needs of our forces.\n  The conference agreement also includes a number of provisions to \nsupport military readiness, such as providing authorities and \nflexibility for investments in infrastructure, extending direct hiring \nauthorities, protecting training ranges from encroachment, and \ncontinuing to support the Asia-Pacific Rebalance.\n  The Rebalance is critical to security and stability in the Indo-Asia-\nPacific region and a matter of most importance to me because of the \nrecent threats against the United States and, specifically, my home \ndistrict of Guam.\n  Critically, for my constituents, this agreement provides authority \nfor U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services to approve H-2B visas for \nGuam that support construction projects directly connected to, as well \nas those associated with, the realignment of military forces to Guam. \nAdditionally, the agreement authorizes $354.6 million for military \nconstruction projects in Guam.\n  As Guam's representative, I will continue to work with the DOD and \nthe USCIS to provide relief for healthcare and other industries that \nsupport our military on Guam. While I support the progress that we made \nin this bill, without further relief, our inadequate workforce will \nnegatively impact our national security.\n  So again, Mr. Speaker, I reiterate my appreciation for the work by \nour committees and our exceptional staff.

This bill comes in higher than the President's budget \nrequest, but it is in line with both the appropriations and the budget \ndocument that came out of the House.\n  This bill authorizes $634.2 billion in the base budget, a much-needed \nincrease over the original budget request, and fully supports many of \nthe unfunded requirements identified by the Department that totaled \nmore than $30 billion. The $634.2 billion authorization is essential. \nAnything less dramatically handicaps our ability to restore military \nreadiness over nearly a decade of neglect.\n  This increased base budget funding for fiscal year 2018 begins the \nlong process to rebuild our military's full spectrum readiness from \nyears of deferred modernization brought on by the failed assumptions \nfrom the previous administrations's Budget Control Act and \nsequestration.\n  Within the Tactical Air and Land Forces Subcommittee's jurisdiction, \nthis bill authorizes over $12 billion in additional funds to address \nunfunded modernization requirements and critical capabilities gaps.\n  If we do not begin, with this budget, to set favorable conditions to \nstart to reverse the high-risk defense posture we currently have, we \nwill significantly jeopardize our military's advantage that we have \ntaken for granted in past conflicts and steady-state operations.\n  As such, the bill recognizes the importance of land forces in current \nand future operations and authorizes over $2 billion to accelerate \narmored brigade combat team modernization, to include additional Abrams \ntanks and Bradley Fighting Vehicles.\n  The bill authorizes strike fighter capability and capacity shortfalls \nand authorizes over $3 billion in additional funding to procure new \nfifth-generation aircraft and modernize our fourth-generation fleet. \nThese projects address unfunded requirements for the Air Force, Navy, \nand Marine Corps.\n  The bill also continues to address the needs of the National Guard \nand Reserve components by authorizing an additional $250 million for \ntheir equipment and modernization.\n  This bill prevents the Air Force from reducing critical ISR \ncapabilities.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bill.", "turn": 14, "speaker": "Mr. TURNER", "itemno": 18}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "S000510", "text": "  Mr. SMITH of Washington.

Notably, it \nconsolidates acquisition, operations, and training of space forces \nunder the Air Force Space Command and eliminates ineffective or \nredundant authorities across the Department. Our assets in space, \nunfortunately, are increasingly vulnerable to attack.

Pressuring Russia, while avoiding \nan unnecessary nuclear arms race or a precipitous nuclear war, should \nbe top priorities for our defense in the current, more volatile \nenvironment.\n  In this context, I support the increased focus on modernizing our \nnuclear command and control system, which has been too long over-cost \nand delayed.\n  Finally, the bill ends years of wasteful spending on the unaffordable \nand failed MOX project in South Carolina by allowing the Department of \nEnergy to terminate it and move to a solution at a fraction of the \ncost.\n  Mr. Speaker, I support this bill.", "turn": 20, "speaker": "Mr. COOPER", "itemno": 24}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "T000238", "text": "  Mr. THORNBERRY.

Finally, the bill delivers \nexpanded authorities that will save the taxpayers billions of dollars.\n  Now, some of our colleagues have suggested that our defense budget is \nexcessive and that additional moneys should be provided towards other \nefforts. Mr. Speaker, this thought is not only misguided, but it is \ndangerous. We have a constitutional responsibility to provide for the \ncommon defense of our Nation. We will not shrink from that \nresponsibility, and I hope none of my colleagues undermine the efforts \nto deliver the $634 billion base moneys that are required for our \nnational security.\n  Finally, I want to recognize Ranking Member Joe Courtney. He has been \nand continues to be a true partner in ensuring the Seapower and \nProjection Forces of our Nation are properly resourced. I do not think \nthat we would be anywhere close to delivering the 355-ship Navy or \nproviding for our Air Force's deep-strike capability without his \nsteadfast resolve and sincere efforts to realize bipartisan solutions.\n  Mr. Speaker, I also want to reflect that with the chairman and the \nranking member and their leadership, and I urge my colleagues to \nsupport the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2018.", "turn": 22, "speaker": "Mr. WITTMAN", "itemno": 26}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "S000510", "text": "  Mr. SMITH of Washington.

Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 2810, and \nI want to begin by congratulating Chairman Thornberry and Ranking \nMember Smith for their really skillful bipartisan guidance of this \nmeasure.\n  The vote that took place last summer when the House passed it the \nfirst time through was the largest bipartisan vote, since 2008, for an \nNDAA, and that didn't happen by accident. It was because of their great \nwork.\n  I also want to thank my colleague, Mr. Wittman, on the Seapower and \nProjection Forces Subcommittee. It is a very bipartisan effort, and the \nresult, I think, really demonstrates that, when you do it that way, you \nget good results.\n  I also want to congratulate the staff, Dave Sienicki, Phil \nMacNaughton, and also Lieutenant Commander Dominic Kramer, a Navy \nfellow who is here today. Their support and work were invaluable in \nterms of getting the seapower portion of the bill to the really solid \nplace that it is today.\n\n  Again, last year, 2016, the Navy came forward with a force structure \nassessment that said: Based on national security needs around the \nworld, our fleet size needs to grow. When the President's budget came \nover last May, unfortunately, there were only eight new ships in that \nbudget; but our committee, again, showing its independence as a coequal \nbranch of government, produced a seapower mark that boosted that build \nrate to 15 and, again, has us now on a pathway to achieve the goal that \nthe Navy identified last year.\n  In particular, in terms of the undersea fleet, our combatant \ncommanders, whether it is an Asia-Pacific or a European command, have \nbeen loudly warning Congress that we should not allow the decline in \nthe fleet size to occur.\n  This bill, again, authorizes $5.9 billion for the Virginia-class \nsubmarine program and provides multiyear procurement authority to enter \ninto a contract for 13 Virginia-class, allowing for a build rate to \nmove from two a year to three fast-attack submarines in 2020, 2022, and \n2023.\n  The National Sea Based Deterrence Fund, which, again, our committee \ncreated in 2014, extends continuous production authorities which the \nNavy has told us will save $383 million in the Columbia-class program, \nwhich, again, is about smart procurement, which Mr. Smith referred to \nat the beginning.\n  Again, there are other provisions in the bill that I would just note. \nThere was no BRAC that is authorized in this bill. We also gave \nauthority to the United States as part of the Ukraine Security \nAssistance Initiative to provide medical treatment to wounded Ukrainian \nsoldiers, as well as training to Ukrainian healthcare specialists, \nwhich our allies desperately need. Again, it is a very, I think, smart \nmove by the committee.\n  Mr. Speaker, as has been noted, this is the 57th year in a row that \nwe have produced an NDAA. It is because we follow regular order. It is \nbecause we respect both sides of the aisle in terms of the contribution \nthat they make.\n  We still have meat left on the bone to get the 2018 spending bill \ndone, and hopefully the example that Mr. Thornberry and Mr. Smith set \nin terms of allowing the process to breathe is the way we are going to \nget to a successful result, just as we did with 2017.\n  Again, I want to congratulate the leadership of our committee, and I \nstrongly urge all the Members on both sides of the aisle to support \npassage of this measure.", "turn": 24, "speaker": "Mr. COURTNEY", "itemno": 28}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "T000238", "text": "  Mr. THORNBERRY.

After years of lower than by-law pay raise \nrequests, it is critical that we continue to give our troops and their \nfamilies the pay increases they have earned.\n\n\n  It increases the end-strengths of the Active National Guard and \nReserve Forces, thereby increasing mission readiness while reducing the \nstress and strain on the force and their families. It permanently \npreserves special survivor indemnity allowance payments and closes the \ngap in the ``widows tax'' to surviving military spouses.\n  It also continues to improve sexual assault prevention and response \nby adding a new provision to the Uniform Code of Military Justice, \nspecifically prohibiting nonconsensual sharing of intimate images; \nexpanding Special Victims' Counsel training; and expanding the annual \nSexual Assault Prevention and Response Report.\n  Finally, spouses of servicemembers are challenged by varying State \nlicensure and certification requirements when forced to move to a new \nState by military orders. Rather than imposing a single Federal \nstandard on the States, we provide a $500 reimbursement to defray these \ncosts. We ask States to work with the Secretary of Defense to develop \ncommon standards where possible.\n  In conclusion, I want to thank the ranking member, Ms. Speier, and \nher staff for their contributions to this report.\n  Of course, we were joined by an active, informed, and dedicated group \nof subcommittee members.

However, I \nshare Ranking Member Smith's concerns that this year's bill authorizes \na level of defense funding that is wholly unrealistic.\n  The numbers included in this bill are well above caps placed on \ndefense spending by the Budget Control Act, and prioritize defense \nspending at a devastating cost to important Federal agencies and other \ninvestments that are critical to maintaining our national \ncompetitiveness and the future of our country. They are being put \nforward at the same time that we are considering a tax reform bill that \nwill significantly cut revenues and, by the latest estimate, add $1.7 \ntrillion to the Federal deficit. Accordingly, the increased spending \nincluded in this bill are hollow numbers and we are failing to deliver \na credible or sensible long-term plan to the Defense Department.\n  Throughout my tenure on this committee, I have been guided by our \nmoral obligation to ensure that the men and women that we send into \nharm's way are properly equipped and the best protected in the world. I \nwould never deny them the tools they need to defend themselves and our \nNation, which is why I will be voting for this compromise.\n  I understand the necessity of many of the programs that are funded \neach year in this bill and believe its passage is needed to maintain \nAmerican military superiority against a variety of threats while \nsupporting our men and women in uniform.

This bill authorizes a much-needed $634 billion in base budget \nrequirements for our national security. This number is the minimum \nrequirement needed to even begin the process of restoring our \nmilitary's readiness.\n  Tragically, this year alone, we have heard report after report of \ndeadly training accidents.

Now is the time to invest, and this bill \ndoes just that.\n  The NDAA authorizes a 2.4 percent pay increase for our troops; \nauthorizes 24 additional F-18 Super Hornets to help fill the Navy's \nstrike fighter shortfall; and it fully funds the B-21 bomber, a \ncritical platform needed to deter and defeat future aggression around \nthe world.\n  I am proud to represent Missouri's Fourth Congressional District, \nwhich is home to Whiteman Air Force Base and Fort Leonard Wood.

I must say that I am so proud to be a member of a \ncommittee so known for its bipartisanship. I am particularly proud to \nserve on the Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee with my \ncolleague, Vicky Hartzler, from Missouri.\n  I am concerned that this administration is failing to confront the \nthreats our country faces, like Russia, so I am encouraged that this \nbill includes a package of measures to deter Russia, including U.S. \ntraining and support for our European allies; a plan for additional \nsanctions on Russia linked to treaty violations; as well as a \nrequirement for the administration to develop a strategy to counter \nRussia over the long term.\n  The bill also forces the same type of accountability that I have been \npushing for on Syria policy for a long time, requiring the President to \nsubmit a comprehensive Syria strategy, including diplomatic, military, \nand humanitarian assistance initiatives.\n  Too often, big bills like this forget the troops on the ground, but \nthis bill raises military pay by 2.5 percent and takes action on \nspecific concerns raised to me and my team by requiring a study on \nimproving opioid prescription practices as well as additional mental \nhealthcare for those transitioning out of Active Duty.\n  The bill includes a provision I supported for our critical allies in \nthe fight against terror. The Afghan Special Immigrant Visa program \naffords Afghan interpreters who have risked their lives--not only for \ntheir country, but for ours--the ability to resettle in the U.S. due to \nthreats that they and their families face on a daily basis because they \nwork with U.S. troops.\n  Here at home, our military families selflessly support our men and \nwomen in harm's way and provide the backbone so important to military \ncommunities across our country. That is why I led an effort to include \na requirement for the DOD to examine a new Military Family Service \nCorps to support volunteer efforts surrounding spousal career support, \ncareer transition assistance, community integration for military \nfamilies, support for liaison programs with schools, as well as \nfamilies with children of special needs. By building on these efforts, \nwe can ensure our servicemembers and their families are supported to \nthe fullest extent possible.\n  Despite the important provisions included in this bill, it does come \nat a time when we as a Congress have forced the Department of Defense \nto operate under yet another continuing resolution in the absence of a \nfull-year budget; and we are authorizing an unprecedented $692 billion \nin defense spending, blowing past the budget cap set by the Budget \nControl Act, by over $80 billion.\n  All the while, Republicans are pushing one of the most aggressive tax \ncut packages in history, set to cost our country at least $1.7 \ntrillion. Simply put, Republicans don't know how to balance a \ncheckbook. Ultimately, it is our servicemembers and their families who \nwill pay the price.\n  As Admiral Mike Mullen, the former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of \nStaff, said in 2010 and again in 2016:\n\n       Our Nation's long-term debt is the single greatest threat \n     to our national security.

Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close, and I \nyield myself the balance of my time.\n  As has been mentioned, this is an excellent bill that a lot of people \ndid very good work on. I thank them for that.\n  The only issue I want to raise in closing is the money. That is the \nsticking point and the difficulty that we have.\n  This bill, as it is currently constructed, is $80 billion above the \nbudget caps. In the 6 years since the budget caps passed, we have been \nunwilling to raise those.\n  But we have a larger problem. We have a $20 trillion debt. Our \ndeficit is close to $700 billion. It has no prospect of going down \nanytime soon. At the same time, we have other needs.\n  During this debate, we focused like a laser on armed services and the \nneeds of national security and our troops, as well we should. Those \nneeds are incredibly important. I don't doubt that for a second. But \nyou have to look at the whole or we are not going to be able to meet \nthe needs of our national security and our troops. The amount of \nrevenue that we take in as a country, unsurprisingly, impacts--or \nshould impact--the amount of money that we can spend.\n  We are having this debate now. We are talking about how underfunded \nthe military is and how badly we need to shore up our readiness. I \nagree with all that. The rest of this week we are going to figure out \nhow to make sure that our government takes in trillions of dollars in \nless money. That is wildly inconsistent. If we believe we have these \nneeds, we ought to be able to pay for them.\n  Then there are the other aspects of the budget. I know we are not \nsupposed to talk about that during the Armed Services Committee debate \non the National Defense Authorization Act, but the needs for infracture \nand education are things that also make our country strong, not to \nmention the Department of Homeland Security, the intelligence agencies, \nand other aspects of our national security, which are all part of the \nsame whole.\n  If we are going to get to a fiscally responsible place, we can't just \nsay defense gets whatever it wants and then let the chips fall where \nthey may elsewhere.\n  On the Armed Services Committee, if we truly care about making sure \nthat our troops have enough money, we need to do two more things in \naddition to this bill.\n  Number one, we need to argue that we shouldn't do a massive tax cut \nto undermine our ability to fund defense and national security.\n  Number two, we need to take a hard look at our national security \nstrategy and figure out where we can save money.\n  If we keep looking at every single section--it is too short here; it \nis too short here--we do not have enough money. Even if we had a fit of \nfiscal responsibility and decided to make cuts elsewhere--which hasn't \nhappened, by the way--and we decided to raise revenue instead of \ncutting it, even if we did that, we are still looking at needs within \nthe national security budget. When you look at the programs that people \nwant to fund over the next 10 years, they are wildly beyond the amount \nof money that we have.\n  We need a national security strategy that has an honest look at how \nmuch money we are going to have. Otherwise, we are not serving our \ntroops.\n  I know the comeback is: How can you put a price on national security? \nThey should get whatever they need.\n  The only problem with that is that they don't. If we have a national \nsecurity strategy that exceeds the amount of money we have, the ones \nleft holding the bag are our troops. They are the ones who are asked to \ndo missions that they are not adequately trained to perform. They are \nthe ones who are asked to train without the adequate resources to train \nproperly.\n  That is what we must fund. To do that, we need to do more than just \npass this bill. We need to have a fiscally responsible approach to the \noverall budget.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of the bill, and I yield back the balance \nof my time.", "turn": 66, "speaker": "Mr. SMITH of Washington", "itemno": 70}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "T000238", "text": "  Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.\n  Mr. Speaker, I, again, want to thank all the Members who have \nparticipated in this debate, and even more importantly, all the Members \nwho have contributed to this product, especially the members of the \nArmed Services Committee. Truthfully, Members from both sides of the \naisle throughout the House have contributed to it.\n  We have spent several moments here talking about a lot of the details \nthat are in this bill. Mr. Speaker, it is a rather large bill. It \ncovers everything from how much we pay our troops to how many ships and \ntanks and planes and bullets we buy, as well as what we research and \nvarious policies of the Department of Defense. So there is a lot in \nhere.\n  Let me take a moment just to step back and remind everybody what this \nis all about. Our Constitution says one of the reasons we have a \nFederal Government is to provide for the common defense. As a matter of \nfact, I think that is the first job of the Federal Government: to \ndefend the country, to defend our lives, and to defend our freedoms.\n  As a matter of fact, Article I, section 8 of the Constitution says \nspecifically it is this Congress' responsibility to build and support, \nprovide and maintain the military forces of the United States of \nAmerica. That is our job.\n  By passing this bill, that is how we fulfill that job. But as we have \ntalked about, what has happened in recent years is the world has grown \nmore dangerous. Yet we have cut the defense budget.\n  As a matter of fact, we are spending 18 percent less now on defense \nthan was spent in 2010, if you measure it in real terms, apples to \napples. I cannot think of another significant Federal program that has \nbeen cut nearly 20 percent over the last 7 years, yet that is what has \nhappened in defense.\n\n\n  What has happened as a result of that?\n  Our troops have borne the burden. We are 2,000 pilots short in the \nAir Force today. Sixty percent of the F-18s in the Navy and Marine \nCorps cannot fly today.\n\n  As Mr. Wilson said, we have just seen tragic accidents in the \nPacific, where 17 soldiers have lost their lives. We have had other \naccidents where others have lost their lives and other accidents where \nthey have not.\n  The point I am trying to make is that part of the responsibility for \nall of that happening rests here with the Congress of the United States \nnot fulfilling adequately, in my view, its job under the Constitution.\n  I would say one more thing, Mr. Speaker. I agree with virtually all \nof what the ranking member said about the importance of having a \nstrategy and then resourcing that strategy. It is true.\n  We have not had--and there is some responsibility with \nadministrations of both parties--a coherent strategy that holds \ntogether and resources that flow from that. We should.\n  The fundamental issue is that it is morally wrong to send men and \nwomen out on missions with our military for which they are not fully \nsupported, fully trained, and equipped with the best equipment our \ncountry can provide. It is wrong for us to do it, and that is exactly \nwhat has been happening.\n  As I mentioned at the beginning, we are not going to turn this around \nin a single bill or a single year, but we can make a start. This bill \nmakes a start.\n  I will absolutely agree with the gentleman from Washington and others \nthat we can't really start to turn this around without an \nappropriations bill that follows it, that matches it, and that really \ndoes repair our ships and planes, increases our end-strength, and \nprovides the training that I believe we deserve to give to the men and \nwomen who serve.\n  Finally, Mr. Speaker, I would just remind everyone that there are \nreally two reasons we do this bill. One is that we owe it to the people \nwho risk their lives to defend us. Secondly, for the national security \nof the United States.\n  The challenges to our Nation's security have grown more ominous in \nrecent years, certainly more complex than at any time in our lifetimes. \nThis is, I believe, a real opportunity on a bipartisan basis to show \nthe troops that we support them and to show adversaries and allies \nalike that the United States is going to stand up and defend ourselves \nby passing this piece of legislation and by following it up with a \nbudget agreement and an appropriations bill that follows.\n  That is what I think the Constitution requires of us. I hope my \ncolleagues will agree and support this conference report.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.", "turn": 67, "speaker": "Mr. THORNBERRY", "itemno": 71}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "M000312", "text": "  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I am outraged that for the third \nconsecutive year, an amendment to create a service medal for our Atomic \nVeterans has been dropped from the NDAA Conference Report. I find this \nparticularly shocking as this amendment, which I offered with my \nRepublican colleague, Congressman Tom Emmer, was approved by the House \nunanimously by a vote of 424-0.\n  It is unclear to me why our colleagues in the Senate are determined \nto deprive our Atomic Veterans this most basic recognition of their \nhonorable service.\n  Between 1945 and 1962, about 225,000 members of our Armed Forces \nparticipated in hundreds of nuclear weapons tests. These GIs were \nplaced in extremely dangerous areas and were constantly exposed to \npotentially dangerous levels of radiation in performance of their \nduties. They were sworn to secrecy, unable to even talk to their \ndoctors about their past exposure to radiation.\n  Thankfully, Presidents Bill Clinton and George H.W. Bush recognized \nthe Atomic Veterans' valiant service, and acted to provide specialized \ncare and compensation for their harrowing duty.\n  In 2007, our allies Great Britain, New Zealand and Australia enacted \ntheir versions of this amendment by authorizing a medal to honor their \nAtomic Veterans who served with the United States.\n  Regrettably, the Pentagon remains silent on honoring the service of \nour Atomic Veterans, arguing that to do so would diminish the service \nof other military personnel who are tasked with dangerous missions. Mr. \nSpeaker, this is a pitiful excuse.\n  Tragically, more than 75 percent of Atomic Veterans have already \npassed away, never having received this recognition. They served \nhonorably and kept a code of silence that most certainly led to many of \nthese veterans passing away prematurely.\n  Past Administrations and Congresses have dealt with the thornier \nissues of legality and compensation. What remains is recognizing these \nveterans' duty, honor and faithful service to our nation. And time is \nrunning out.\n  I thank my colleagues here in the House for supporting this \namendment. With their continued support, I hope we can convince the \nSenate or the Pentagon to finally do the right thing, before it's too \nlate.
