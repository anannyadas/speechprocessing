Mr. Speaker, on Saturday, I had the privilege of \nhonoring six World War II heroes at VFW Post 2423 in Indian Trail, \nNorth Carolina. Each hero was awarded the French Legion of Honor Medal \nby the French consul. They were:\n  Charles Richardson, who flew 35 combat missions aboard a B-17 over \nFrance, the Netherlands, and Germany.\n  Andrew McMahon received the Purple Heart while fighting to liberate \nFrance.\n  William Rachui helped liberate Rome and southern France while earning \nfive Bronze Service Stars.\n  James Crump landed at Omaha Beach on D-day and received two Bronze \nStars and three Purple Hearts.\n  Aster Rider landed at Omaha Beach on D-day. As a rifleman on the \nfront lines, he was one of only a handful of soldiers to survive.\n  Harold Granger landed at Utah Beach on D-day. He helped save lives by \nfinding and disarming landmines.\n  Mr. Speaker, I ask all of my colleagues to join me in thanking these \nbrave patriots for their service to the United States and the cause of \nliberty.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. PITTENGER", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "186", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H9190", "wkday": "Tuesday", "day": "14", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "HONORING WORLD WAR II HEROES", "id": "CREC-2017-11-14-pt1-PgH9190", "title": "HONORING WORLD WAR II HEROES"}
