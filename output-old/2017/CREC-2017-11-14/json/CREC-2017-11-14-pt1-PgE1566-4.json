Mr. Speaker, I rise today on behalf of the people of \nOhio's 15th Congressional District to celebrate the career of Ms. \nElaine Roberts, as she retires from service as the President and Chief \nExecutive Officer of the Columbus Regional Airport Authority.\n  For over a decade, Ms. Roberts has served as the first-ever CEO of a \ncombined aviation authority. She was named to the newly-created \nposition in January of 2003, and has utilized her experience as an \nAccredited Airport Executive (A.A.E.), and the past Chair of the \nAmerican Association of Airport Executives (AAAE).\n  Ms. Roberts' leadership has guided the Authority during a period of \nexpansive growth, including the merger of two airport authorities, more \nthan one billion dollars in airport infrastructure development, and \nhistoric improvements at the John Glenn Columbus and the Rickenbacker \nInternational Airport facilities.\n  Ms. Roberts is a true coalition-builder. She successfully brought \nstakeholders across the federal, state, and local levels, along with \nthe private sector, to develop the Rickenbacker Intermodal Facility. \nHer efforts to transform Rickenbacker into a leading center for trade \nled to her nomination and selection as a 2015 White House Champion of \nChange in Transportation.\n  Her contributions to the Central Ohio community and local economy are \nimmeasurable. International and domestic freight operations--served by \nrail, highways, and international activation--helped to provide a \nlivelihood for over 20,000 residents in the region.\n  Ms. Roberts will be missed by her colleagues and fellow aviation \nexecutives, but I join the Ohio delegation in wishing her all the best \nas she begins a new chapter in her life and pursues future endeavors. I \nask my colleagues to join me in congratulating Ms. Elaine Roberts on \nher invaluable service to the residents of Ohio, and the aviation \nindustry at large.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. STIVERS", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 3}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "186", "extension": true, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "E1566", "wkday": "Tuesday", "day": "14", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "CELEBRATING THE CAREER OF MS.
