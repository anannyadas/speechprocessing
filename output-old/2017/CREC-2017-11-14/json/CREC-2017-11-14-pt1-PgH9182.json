Mr. Speaker, this week is Rural Health \nWeek in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. It is a time to promote \nawareness of the full range of issues that impact rural health \nthroughout the State and the health status of rural Pennsylvanians.\n  Nationally, Pennsylvania ranks as one of the States with the highest \nnumber of rural residents, with 23 percent of Pennsylvanians residing \nin rural areas.\n  Rural communities also face unique healthcare concerns, a lack of \nproviders, accessibility issues, particularly in terms of \ntransportation and technology, and affordability issues as a result of \nlarger percentages of uninsured and underinsured citizens and greater \nout-of-pocket health costs.\n  Mr. Speaker, before I was elected to serve in the House of \nRepresentatives, I spent nearly 30 years in the nonprofit healthcare \nfield, assisting those with life-changing diseases and disabilities. I \nam acutely aware of the challenges many face when it comes to obtaining \nreasonably priced healthcare. It is especially critical for rural \nAmerica, like much of the Fifth Congressional District of Pennsylvania.\n  We are facing a healthcare crisis in our Nation's rural areas. These \noften disadvantaged populations are still struggling to access \naffordable, quality care. Many remain uninsured. Most are underinsured; \nhowever, access to quality care remains the largest challenge.\n  Even when people gain access to health insurance, it doesn't equal \naccess to care. Rural hospitals across the country are closing, leaving \npatients without access to their emergency rooms and long-term \nhealthcare facilities.\n  Eighty rural hospitals in the United States have closed since 2010. \nOne in three rural hospitals are financially vulnerable. At the current \nclosure rate, more than 25 percent of rural hospitals will close in \nless than a decade.\n  In addition to hospital closures, a workforce shortage plagues rural \nAmerica. Seventy-seven percent of more than 2,000 rural counties in the \nUnited States are designated as having a shortage of healthcare \nprofessionals. Recruitment and retention of experienced professionals, \nincluding primary care physicians, is an ongoing challenge.\n  Furthermore, the opioid crisis that is sweeping the Nation has \nravaged our rural communities, leaving even more of the population in \nneed of crucial health services. Adolescents and young adults living in \nrural areas are more vulnerable to opioid abuse than their urban \ncounterparts.\n  The prevalence of fatal drug overdoses has skyrocketed in rural \nareas. High unemployment and a greater rate of the types of injuries \nthat result in prescriptions for opioid medications have contributed to \nthis. But there are ways to increase treatment options.\n  Just last week, the House approved a bill that I introduced that \nwould expand healthcare access for our veterans through telemedicine. \nThe bill allows VA-credentialed healthcare providers to practice \ntelemedicine across State lines.\n  Mr. Speaker, our veterans should receive the best care possible, no \nmatter where they are located. With advances in technology, we see new \nopportunities for veterans to obtain coverage through telemedicine, \nespecially in some of our most rural areas.\n  As we celebrate National Rural Health Day this Thursday, it is my \nhope that we continue to strive for a 21st century healthcare system \nthat works for everyone in America. With technology today, we have the \nopportunity to expand services, regardless of where one resides, \nparticularly for those in rural regions where the need is great and the \nservices are scarce.\n", "turn": 1, "speaker": "Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "186", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H9182", "wkday": "Tuesday", "day": "14", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "RECOGNIZING RURAL HEALTH WEEK", "id": "CREC-2017-11-14-pt1-PgH9182", "title": "RECOGNIZING RURAL HEALTH WEEK"}
