Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor the life and legacy of Rodney \nMaurice Gilbert, a giant in New Jersey arts and social justice \nactivism. For the past fifteen years, Mr. Gilbert led Yendor \nProductions, a Newark-based firm he founded in order to develop and \nproduce arts education programming that elevates oppressed voices. He \nwas a dedicated artist, educator, and community leader.\n   Mr. Gilbert devoted his life to helping underserved communities find \ntheir artistic voices. After graduating from the University of the Arts \nin Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Mr. Gilbert spent three decades serving \nthe arts community in New Jersey. He was an accomplished actor with \ncredits on stages from Broadway to Little Rock. He was a gifted \ndirector known for shining artistic light on social issues such as \nmental illness. And he was an educator who inspired young artists to \nbring to life the untold stories of underserved communities.\n   Mr. Gilbert left a lasting impact on New Jersey. He helped heal \nNewark by paving the way for people to use arts and culture as vehicles \nfor advancing social justice. Mr. Gilbert brought people together. He \ninspired young people. And he created a platform for people to \ncreatively tell their own stories. In July, Mr. Gilbert directed Down \nNeck, a play written by Pia Wilson that explores the 1967 Newark \nRebellion's impacts on the Ironbound neighborhood. His inspirational \nuse of arts as a means to speak truth, preserve history, and pursue \njustice has left a permanent mark on the New Jersey arts scene.\n   Mr. Gilbert passed away on November 8, 2017, but his legacy will \nlive on. I ask that my colleagues join me in honoring the life of \nRodney Gilbert--artist, teacher, advocate, and friend.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. PAYNE", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 3}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "186", "extension": true, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "E1565", "wkday": "Tuesday", "day": "14", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "TRIBUTE TO THE LIFE OF RODNEY MAURICE GILBERT", "id": "CREC-2017-11-14-pt1-PgE1565", "title": "TRIBUTE TO THE LIFE OF RODNEY MAURICE GILBERT"}
