Mr. President, today, I join my colleagues, Senators \nShaheen, Isakson, and Menendez, in introducing the International \nViolence Against Women Act of 2017. This legislation makes ending \nviolence against women and girls a top diplomatic priority. It \npermanently authorizes the State Department's Office of Global Women's \nIssues and the position of the Ambassador-at-Large for Global Women's \nIssues. It requires the Administration to develop and implement an \nannual strategy to prevent and respond to violence against women and \ngirls for each of the five years after the date of enactment. This bill \nwould ensure that efforts begun under President George W. Bush and \nPresident Obama to combat gender-based violence continue in future \nAdministrations.\n  Mr. President, we have witnessed great strides in women's equality in \nour own Country, and in much of the world, over the past century. \nAcross vast swathes of the globe, however, violence against women and \nforced marriage remain everyday problems. One out of every three women \nworldwide will be physically, sexually, or otherwise abused during her \nlifetime, with rates reaching 70 percent in some countries. This type \nof violence ranges from domestic violence, rape, and acid burnings to \ndowry deaths and so-called ``honor killings.'' Violence against women \nand girls is a human rights violation, a public health epidemic, and a \nbarrier to solving global challenges such as extreme poverty, HIV/AIDS, \nand conflict. Such violence is often exacerbated in humanitarian \nemergencies and conflict settings.\n  In Iraq and Syria, girls and women have been abducted from their \nhomes and villages, sold into sexual slavery, and forced into marriages \nwith fighters of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant. In Burma, \nrape is used as a weapon against the women and girls of the Rohingya \nethnic group. In Nigeria, girls as young as 11-years-old are offered a \nhorrendous choice by Boko Haram: carry out suicide bomb attacks against \nNigerian villages or live in forced marriages and sexual slavery.\n  This systemic targeting of women is not confined to conflict zones. \nIn India, the United Nations special rapporteur on violence against \nwomen said that they experience such crimes ``from womb to tomb.'' \nCompounding this tragedy, local police often decline to investigate or \nseek justice. In Afghanistan, women and girls are concerned that as \nWestern forces draw down and attention shifts away from their country, \nthe fragile gains that have been made there could be lost.\n  The International Violence Against Women Act--IVAWA--ensures that the \nU.S. will continue to take a leadership role in combatting these \nproblems. It establishes that it is the policy of the United States to \ntake action to prevent and respond to violence against women and girls \naround the globe and to systematically integrate and coordinate efforts \nto address gender-based violence into U.S. foreign policy and foreign \nassistance programs.\n  Specifically, IVAWA will foster efforts in four areas. First, it will \nincrease legal and judicial protections by establishing and supporting \nlaws and legal structures that prevent and appropriately respond to all \nforms of violence against women and girls, including ``honor killings'' \nand forced marriage. Emphasis will be placed on promoting political, \nlegal, and institutional reforms that recognize violence against women \nand girls as a crime and train police and the judiciary to hold \nviolators accountable and to respond to the needs of victims. Second, \nIVAWA will increase efforts to build health sector capacity, \nintegrating programs to address violence against women and girls into \nexisting health programs focused on child survival, women's health, and \nHIV/AIDS prevention. Third, IVAWA will focus on preventing violence by \nchanging community norms and attitudes about the acceptability of \nviolence against women and girls. And fourth, IVAWA will focus on \nreducing women and girls' vulnerability to violence by improving their \neconomic status and educational opportunities. Efforts will include \nensuring that women have access to job training and employment \nopportunities and increasing their right to own land and property, \nallowing them to potentially support themselves and their children.\n  Violence has a profound effect on the lives of women and girls. In \naddition to being a pressing human rights issue, such violence \ncontributes to inequality and political instability, making it a \nsecurity issue as well as a moral issue for us all. I am committed to \ncontinuing to work with my colleagues to end violence against women and \ngirls and to provide the assistance and resources necessary to achieve \nthis goal.", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Ms. COLLINS", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                                 ______", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "recorder", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "      By Mr. LEAHY (for himself, Mr. Markey, Mr. Blumenthal, Mr. Wyden, \n        Mr. Franken, Ms. Baldwin, and Ms. Harris):\n  S. 2124. A bill to ensure the privacy and security of sensitive \npersonal information, to prevent and mitigate identity theft, to \nprovide notice of security breaches involving sensitive personal \ninformation, and to enhance law enforcement assistance and for other \nprotections against security breaches, fraudulent access, and misuse of \npersonal information; to the Committee on the Judiciary.", "turn": -1, "speaker": "The RECORDER", "itemno": 3}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "L000174", "text": "  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today, I am introducing the Consumer \nPrivacy Protection Act of 2017. This legislation, if enacted, will help \nensure that when Americans entrust corporations with their most \nsensitive personal information, these corporations take the right steps \nto keep this information secure, and do the right thing in the event of \na data breach. In today's modern world, data security is no longer just \nabout protecting our identities and our bank accounts; it is about \nprotecting our privacy and even our National security.\n  The need for this legislation has long been clear, and never more so \nthan in the wake of the recent, massive Equifax data breach. After \nmedia investigations and multiple Congressional hearings, we learned \nthat the Equifax breach exposed the sensitive personal information of \nalmost half the American population. We also learned that Equifax \nfailed to take basic steps to secure its databases, and waited an \nunjustifiably long period before notifying consumers and regulators. \nClearly, it is past time for all corporations that hold our personal \ninformation to maintain some common-sense, baseline cybersecurity \nstandards.\n  Corporations make significant profits from our personal information, \nand they should be obligated to keep it safe. Yet too often, data \nbreaches continue to plague American businesses\n\n\nand compromise the privacy of millions of consumers. At the same time, \nthe amount of information we share with corporations who are the target \nof these breaches is growing. Corporations collect and store our social \nsecurity numbers, our bank account information, and our email \naddresses. They collect information about our private health and \nmedical conditions. They know what routes we take to work and where we \ndrop our kids off at school. They can replicate our fingerprints or \neven faceprints. We trust them with private photographs that we store \nin the cloud. This information is increasingly targeted by both \ncriminal hackers and nation-states, including hostile foreign powers.\n  The Consumer Privacy Protection Act I am introducing today is based \non legislation I first introduced in 2015, and builds and expands on \ndata security legislation that I have introduced in Congress since \n2005. It seeks to protect the vast amount of information that we now \nshare with corporations each and every day. Americans want to know that \nthe corporations who are profiting from their information are actually \ndoing something to prevent the next data breach. Americans want to know \nwhen someone has had unauthorized access to their bank accounts and to \ntheir private family photographs, but they do not just want to be \nnotified of yet another data breach. Consumers should not have to \nsettle for mere notice of data breaches. American consumers deserve \nprotection. This legislation would accomplish that.\n  The Consumer Privacy Protection Act requires that corporations meet \ncertain baseline privacy and data security standards to keep \ninformation they store about their customers safe, and requires that \ncorporations provide notice and protection to consumers in the event of \na breach. This legislation protects broad categories of data, \nincluding, (1) social security numbers and other government-issued \nidentification numbers; (2) financial account information, including \ncredit card numbers and bank accounts; (3) online usernames and \npasswords, including email names and passwords; (4) unique biometric \ndata, including fingerprints; (5) information about a person's physical \nand mental health; (6) information about geolocation; and (7) access to \nprivate digital photographs and videos.\n  It is true that not every breach can be prevented. Cyber criminals \nand nation-state actors are determined and constantly looking for new \nways to pierce the most sophisticated security systems. But just as we \nexpect a bank to put a lock on the front door and an alarm on the vault \nto protect its customers' money, we expect corporations to take \nreasonable measures to protect the personal information they collect \nfrom us. Unfortunately, many of the corporations that profit from the \nvery information that we entrust them to protect, have woefully \ninadequate measures to secure this information. For others, security is \nsimply not a priority. American consumers deserve better and our \nnational security demands it.\n  This legislation creates civil penalties for corporations that fail \nto meet the required privacy and data security standards established in \nthe bill or fail to provide notice and protection to consumers when a \nbreach occurs. The Department of Justice, the Federal Trade Commission, \nand State attorneys general each have a role in enforcement. This \nlegislation also requires corporations to inform Federal law \nenforcement of all large data breaches, as well as breaches that could \nimpact the federal government. Such notification is necessary to help \nlaw enforcement bring these cyber criminals to justice and identify \npatterns that help protect against future attacks.\n  Many Americans understandably assume Federal law already protects \nthis sensitive information--common sense tells us that it should. \nUnfortunately, the reality is that it does not. States provide a \npatchwork of protection, and while some laws are strong, others are \nnot. For example, my home state of Vermont has a strong data breach \nnotification law that that has been in effect since 2007. But there are \nmany other States that have not passed data security laws designed to \nprevent data breaches.\n  This legislation sets a floor: a baseline standard that that protects \nAmericans across the country, while also freeing individual States to \nprovide even stronger protections to their residents. In crafting \nFederal law, we must be careful not to override strong State laws, but \nwe also need to ensure that all Americans, regardless of where they \nlive, have their privacy protected. To this end, the Consumer Privacy \nProtection Act preempts State law relating to data security and data \nbreach notification only to the extent that the protections under those \nlaws are weaker than those provided for in this bill. We must ensure \nthat consumers do not lose privacy protections they currently enjoy. \nSince this bill is modeled after those States with the strongest \nconsumer protections, I believe it will improve protections for \nconsumers in nearly every State.\n  I am joined today by Senators Markey, Blumenthal, Wyden, Franken, and \nBaldwin in introducing this legislation. These Senators have long \nshared my commitment to protecting consumer privacy. This legislation \nalso has the support of leading consumer privacy advocates, including: \nthe Center for Democracy and Technology, the Consumer Federation of \nAmerica, New America's Open Technology Institute, and Public Knowledge.\n  Millions of Americans who have had their personal information \ncompromised or stolen as a result of a data breach consider this issue \nto be of critical importance and a priority for the Senate. Protecting \nprivacy rights should be important to all of us, regardless of party or \nideology. I hope all Senators will support this common-sense measure to \nbetter protect Americans' privacy.\n", "turn": 1, "speaker": "Mr. LEAHY", "itemno": 4}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 5}], "header": {"chamber": "Senate", "num": "186", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "S7215-S7216", "wkday": "Tuesday", "day": "14", "month": "November"}, "related_bills": [{"type": "S", "context": "FIRSTPARAGRAPH", "congress": "115", "number": "2120"}, {"type": "S", "context": "OTHER", "congress": "115", "number": "2120"}, {"type": "S", "context": "OTHER", "congress": "115", "number": "2124"}], "doc_title": "STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS", "id": "CREC-2017-11-14-pt1-PgS7215"}
