Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize MAGLOCLEN,\n\n\nthe Middle Atlantic-Great Lakes Organized Crime Law Enforcement \nNetwork, and the Regional Information Sharing Systems Program.\n  Last month, I had the opportunity to tour the MAGLOCLEN site in my \ndistrict in Newtown, Bucks County, Pennsylvania. As one of six regional \ncenters, they serve Delaware, Indiana, Maryland, Michigan, New Jersey, \nNew York, Ohio, the District of Columbia, and Pennsylvania, as well as \nEngland and parts of Canada. Their work is integral to keeping local, \nState, and Federal law enforcement agencies informed and equipped with \nthe tools they need to do their jobs and to keep us safe.\n  MAGLOCLEN and Regional Information Sharing Systems have supported law \nenforcement agencies for a combined 40 years. In 2016 alone, in \nPennsylvania, MAGLOCLEN saw 299 requests for criminal investigative \nresearch assistance.\n  MAGLOCLEN's holistic approach embodies the best of what an integrated \ninformation sharing system can offer to other local, State, and Federal \nlaw enforcement agencies.\n  Mr. Speaker, we are proud of the work MAGLOCLEN does operating on \nbehalf of the Regional Information Sharing Systems Program in my \ndistrict. We are here to support them and their mission to support our \nlaw enforcement community.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. FITZPATRICK", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "186", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H9189-H9190", "wkday": "Tuesday", "day": "14", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "RECOGNIZING MAGLOCLEN AND THE REGIONAL INFORMATION SHARING SYSTEMS PROGRAM", "id": "CREC-2017-11-14-pt1-PgH9189-6", "title": "RECOGNIZING MAGLOCLEN AND THE REGIONAL INFORMATION SHARING SYSTEMS  PROGRAM"}
