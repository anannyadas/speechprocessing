Mr. Speaker, last week, the President visited Asia for \nthe first time as Commander in Chief, and took the opportunity, while \non foreign soil, to reiterate his America First doctrine.\n  I rise today because an America First doctrine mentality will not \nlead to success for the United States or the world. This way of \nthinking is an outdated, obsolete, and dangerous form of isolationism. \nIt will not keep us safe. It will not make us stronger economically.\n  Ironically, this phrase paints a picture that is blatantly un-\nAmerican. America First sends a signal to the global community that the \nUnited States no longer wants to carry the torch of freedom and \ndemocracy which shines brighter through inclusion and collaboration.\n  On the national security front, the United States has the strongest \nmilitary the world has known. For decades, allies have counted on the \nU.S. to step up to the plate to work with them to protect the shared \nvalues we hold dear.\n  As we face numerous international challenges, both old and new, we \nneed to put more faith and investment into our international and \ndiplomatic institutions, not weaken them. The United States did not \nearn its reputation as leader of the free world by standing back and \nallowing darker forces to prevail.\n  As oppressive regimes like Russia seek to undermine democracies, \nincluding our own, America's commitment to democracy must be stronger \nthan ever.\n  The President's threats to NATO and the U.N. have caused our trusted \nallies to question our commitment to collective defense. We know that \nwhen countries work in concert, the chance of conflict decreases.\n\n\n  Despite its challenges, globalization has led to one of the most \npeaceful and productive times in world history. Adopting protectionist \npolicies would stifle this progress, and certainly won't put America \nfirst.\n  Our efforts to address difficult domestic and international \nchallenges are not mutually exclusive. In fact, they can and should \nhappen simultaneously. We defeated communism, in part, by showing the \nworld that a commitment to democracy and expanding\n\n\neconomic opportunity makes peoples' lives better and nations more \nsecure. Meeting our commitments overseas also makes us stronger and \nsafer here at home.\n  Standing up against the isolationist tide sweeping the globe is \ncritical to preserving our leadership role. Take the President's \ndecision to pull out from the Paris climate agreement as another \nexample. By abandoning our partnership with every other country in the \nworld, the President has put our credibility and our Earth at risk. We \nare now the only nation not participating in this historic climate \npact.\n  To reassert our integrity for global leadership, we must lead by \nexample. This includes recalling lessons learned from earlier periods \nof isolationism. Relinquishing ground in this area creates a vacuum \nwhich less friendly, less democratic actors are prepared and capable to \nfill.\n  Abdicating global leadership, praising authoritarian regimes, and \nbelittling allies has been a hallmark of this Presidency. This does not \nput America or our interests first. Our U.N. and NATO partnership \nshould not just be honored and preserved, but strengthened. We are \nserious about taking on terrorism, cybersecurity treats, and other \ndangers that jeopardize the peace of our planet. Instead of \ndistinguishing between winners and losers and sowing division where it \nneed not exist, we must acknowledge our shared goals and values with \nour allies around the world, because our commitment to democracy and \ndiplomacy is what has always made our Nation great.\n", "turn": 1, "speaker": "Mr. QUIGLEY", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "186", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H9182-H9183", "wkday": "Tuesday", "day": "14", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "PRESIDENT TRUMP'S AMERICA FIRST DOCTRINE", "id": "CREC-2017-11-14-pt1-PgH9182-2", "title": "PRESIDENT TRUMP'S AMERICA FIRST DOCTRINE"}
