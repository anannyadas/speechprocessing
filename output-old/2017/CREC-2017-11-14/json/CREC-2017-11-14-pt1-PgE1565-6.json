Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and honor the Smiley \nFamily of Mohonk Mountain House for being named the recipients of the \n2017 Legendary Family Historic Hoteliers of the Year by Historic Hotels \nof America and Historic Hotels Worldwide. This prestigious award \nacknowledges multigenerational, family-owned historic hotels that are \nexemplary in both their operation and preservation efforts. It is true \ntestament to the Smiley Family's continued legacy of historical, \nenvironmental, and cultural stewardship.\n  Founded in 1869 by Albert Smiley, the Mohonk Mountain House--a \npicturesque Victorian castle resort surrounded by vast forests and \nwildlife--is still owned and operated by the Smiley Family. What makes \nthe Mohonk Mountain House such a prized treasure in the 19th District, \nand an attraction for travelers worldwide, is the Smiley Family's \ndedication to conserving the historical integrity of their resort and \nthe land surrounding it.\n  Using their timeless resort as a catalyst for historical, \nenvironmental, and cultural preservation, the Smiley Family has \nredefined the role of hoteliers and has established a higher standard \nof excellence. For example, in 1963, the Smiley Family founded the \nMohonk Preserve, a nature preserve that safeguards more than 8,000 \nacres. In 1980, the Smiley Family also founded Mohonk Consultations, a \nnon-profit think tank focused on environmental issues throughout the \nHudson Valley.\n\n\n  On behalf of New York's 19th District, I want to congratulate and \ncelebrate the Smiley Family on their much-deserved award. We are \ngrateful for the Smiley Family's dedication to the values we in the \n19th District hold dear: environmental conservancy and a profound \nappreciation for history and culture.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. FASO", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 3}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "186", "extension": true, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "E1565-E1566", "wkday": "Tuesday", "day": "14", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "RECOGNIZING THE SMILEY FAMILY", "id": "CREC-2017-11-14-pt1-PgE1565-6", "title": "RECOGNIZING THE SMILEY FAMILY"}
