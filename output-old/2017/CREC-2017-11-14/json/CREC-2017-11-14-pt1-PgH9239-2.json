Mr. Speaker, each day the President and \ncongressional Republicans are trying to sell the American people a \ndream that will not become a reality.\n  In addition to running up the deficit, lining the pockets of the very \nwealthy, and eliminating critical deductions that New Jerseyans rely \non, this tax scheme dismantles the ladder of opportunity that allows \nAmericans to grow and thrive.\n  Eliminating the medical expense deduction will devastate households \nnationwide struggling to recover from high healthcare costs. Removing \nthe student loan interest deduction will cost recent college graduates \nhundreds of dollars a year, significant to young Americans trying to \nget on their feet.\n  Our tax system works best when it is fair, responsible, and \nsupportive of the true drivers of our economy: families, workers, and \nsmall businesses.\n  I refuse to let congressional Republicans try to sell America a dream \nthat never will be reality, and definitely not on the backs of the most \nvulnerable.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 3}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "186", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H9239", "wkday": "Tuesday", "day": "14", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "SELL A TAX REFORM DREAM TO AMERICANS", "id": "CREC-2017-11-14-pt1-PgH9239-2", "title": null}
