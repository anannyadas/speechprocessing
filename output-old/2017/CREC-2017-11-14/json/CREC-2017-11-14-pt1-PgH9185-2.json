Madam Speaker, I rise to pay tribute to a freedom \nfighter, a beloved mother of her embattled country, Ukraine, Amina \nOkuyeva.\n  Amina Okuyeva was killed on October 30 in a cowardly act. Hitmen \nfired on Amina and her husband, Adam Osmayev, from behind bushes as \nthey drove by. Amina was struck in the head. The world lost a brave and \nbeautiful soul, but her loss will not be in vain.\n  Born in the southern Ukrainian city of Odessa, Amina was a mother, a \nmedical surgeon, a Ukrainian police lieutenant, and a Muslim activist \nknown for her stance on equal rights for men and women in uniform.\n  She was a born leader. At the start of the Euromaidan movement, Amina \njoined the peaceful protest in Ukraine in the bitter cold, a protest \nagainst repression. To show solidarity, she lived with her husband on \nthe streets in a tent.\n  When Russia illegally invaded Crimea in eastern Ukraine, Amina was \nthe first woman to join the Kyiv-2 volunteer battalion. She was awarded \nthe Hero of Ukraine Medal to honor her bravery at the battle of \nDebatsevo in the grizzly fight against Russian aggression.\n  She fought valiantly towards progress and against oppression. Her \nbravery symbolizes the extraordinary strength of Ukrainian women as the \nfountainhead of that society, holding the country together during \nsignificant duress.\n  With her assassination, the world has yet again witnessed how the \nenemy of democracy will stop at nothing to silence those who stand for \nfreedom and justice. Amina had been a target before due to her \nunyielding patriotism. A failed attempt occurred in June when an \nassassin, pretending to be a journalist, shot at her. Tragically, evil \npersisted, and on Monday, October 30, it succeeded in snuffing out the \nbeauty of Amina and wounded her husband, but her spirit endures larger \nthan life itself.\n  Amina is one of many fallen victims to Russia's illegal invasion of \nUkraine and its clandestine efforts to snuff out championships of \nfreedom. The list includes Nikolai Andrushchenko, Nikolai Volkov, Denis \nVoronenkov, and numerous other valiant souls who placed their lives \nforward in liberty's struggle.\n  I include in the Record an extensive list of lives purged by Kremlin-\nrelated assassinations.\n\n           List of Kremlin-Related Assassinations or Attacks\n\n       ``Two common causes of death for contemporary Russians are \n     heart attacks and falling to one's end from great heights. In \n     some cases, these fatal events actually even have something \n     to do with high cholesterol or tragic mishaps.``--journalist \n     Michael Weiss, Daily Beast\n\n\n                                  2017\n\n       April 19--Nikolai Andrushchenko, a 73-year-old Russian \n     journalist who openly criticized President Vladimir Putin's \n     administration died just over a month after he was attacked \n     and beaten by unknown aggressors. The Novy Peterburg founder \n     died in a St. Petersburg hospital from injuries attributed \n     the 9 March 2017 attack. Andrushchenko, a former St. \n     Petersburg city council member, was placed in a medical coma \n     after suffering major blunt trauma to his head, but never \n     recovered.\n       March 27--Nikolai Volkov, head of the Russian Interior \n     Ministry's construction department was shot dead in Moscow in \n     a residential neighborhood near his home at 10.30pm. A man \n     was seen grabbing Vokov's bag and then shooting him before \n     fleeing. Police, who stated that the body was riddled with \n     bullets, also stated that they believed the motive to be \n     robbery, further suggesting that they did not ``believe'' \n     that the killing ``was directly related'' to Volkov's job.\n       March 23--Denis Voronenkov, 45, Russian politician who fled \n     to Ukraine gunned down outside hotel in Kyiv.\n       March 21--Nikolai Gorokhov, 53, was thrown/pushed head \n     first from fourth story window. Russian security services \n     claim, ``he fell'' trying to move a bathtub that was being \n     lifted over a balcony. Experts have replied that when people \n     ``fall'' from a balcony accidentally, it is almost never \n     headfirst. Unidentified workers were on the balcony. Gorokhov \n     represented Sergei Magnitsky, a fellow Russian lawyer who \n     exposed Russia's largest ever tax fraud. Gorokhov was set to \n     testify in Moscow against investigator in Magnitsky case. He \n     was also consultant for Preet Bharara's anti-Russian mob case \n     in New York. He remains in intensive care, in a coma, with \n     severe head injuries.\n       March 16--Yevgeny Khamaganov, 35, died in Buryatia from \n     injuries (blunt force head trauma) suffered from when he was \n     attacked on March 10 after reporting on corruption in \n     Siberia.\n       March 2--Alex Oronov, 69, died of unexplained \n     circumstances, apparently a heart attack. His daughter is \n     married to brother of Michael Cohen, Trump's longtime \n     ``consigliere.'' Ukrainian parliamentarian Andrii Artemenko \n     asked Oronov to set up a meeting in late January with Michael \n     Cohen, where they were joined by former Trump Organization \n     employee Felix Sater, a known mobster and supposed FBI \n     informant. Oronov/Artemenko presented Mr. Cohen with a peace \n     plan for settling territorial disputes between Russia and \n     Ukraine, giving full control of Crimea to Putin, as well as \n     allegedly\n\n\n     compromising information on Petro Poroshenko, that they hoped \n     would force Poroshenko's resignation. Mr. Cohen took their \n     plan and their compromising information and forwarded to \n     then-National Security Advisor Michael Flynn.\n       February 20--Amb. Vitaly Churkin, 64, Russia's ambassador \n     to the United Nations, died of an apparent heart attack; \n     autopsy proved inconclusive.\n       February 2--Journalist and opposition politician Vladimir \n     Kara Murza became violently ill and temporarily paralyzed for \n     2nd time in less than two years due to poisoning. VKM father, \n     in an apparent effort to save his son from Russian \n     authorities, continues to deny that he was poisoned. However, \n     VKM and VKM wife state that it was purposefully effort to \n     poison. VKM wife stated that in 2015 after murder of Nemtsov, \n     a VKM colleague, Russian special services did not want to \n     outright kill her husband with the first poisoning did not \n     want to kill him, only ``frighten him and destroy him slowly \n     with illness.'' However, now they believe they did want to \n     kill him and effort failed since VKM was taken to doctor \n     immediately after showing symptoms. VKM left Russia on Feb. \n     19 and is now in the U.S. Recently testified at a \n     congressional hearing on the Russian opposition.\n       January 26--Amb. Alexander Kadakin, 67, Russian envoy to \n     India, died after a short illness. There was nothing \n     ``special or extraordinary'' about the circumstances that led \n     to his death said his assistant.\n       January 25--Russian newspaper Kommersant reported the \n     arrests of three men: Sergei Mikhailov, who heads the Center \n     for Information Security, an arm of the Russian intelligence \n     agency FSB; and Ruslan Stoyanov, a senior researcher with \n     Kaspersky Lab, the computer security company. Both men were \n     last seen the first week of December when in a Stalin-style \n     touch, a bag was suddenly thrown over Mikhailov's head during \n     a meeting of fellow intelligence officers, and he was dragged \n     out. Mikhailov has not been seen since. And is now almost \n     certainly dead. Sergei Mikhailo was believed to have been a \n     U.S. intelligence asset within the Russian government. The \n     third arrest was of Dmitry Dokuchayev, a hacker known by the \n     name ``Forb.''\n       January 9--Amb. Andrey Malanin, 54, Russian envoy in \n     Greece, was found dead in his apartment in Athens on bedroom \n     floor. Greek police stated that ``at first sight'' it appears \n     he died suddenly from natural causes. No autopsy was \n     performed, although that is standard procedure when a \n     diplomat dies.\n\n\n                                  2016\n\n       December 26--Oleg Erovinkin, 61, Russian intelligence \n     official found dead in the backseat of his car parked on the \n     streets of Moscow. Russian government agencies have not \n     released an official cause of death. He was a former general \n     in the FSB and served as chief-of-staff to Igor Sechin, the \n     president of state-owned oil giant Rosneft. Russia watchers \n     have speculated that he might have been a source of \n     information in the 35-page dossier that detailed alleged \n     links between the Trump campaign and Russia.\n       December 20--Amb. Andrey Karlov, 62, Russian ambassador to \n     Turkey, fatally shot in the back in Ankara. The shooter, a \n     Turkish police officer, shouted ``do not forget Syria'' \n     during the assassination.\n       December 20--Petr Polshikov, 56, a senior Russian diplomat, \n     was shot to death in his Moscow home, Polshikov's wife came \n     home and found him in their bedroom with a pillow over his \n     face. Underneath the pillow, police found Polshikov with a \n     head wound. Russian Foreign Ministry said Polshikov's death \n     was likely an accident and had nothing to do with his \n     official government duties.\n       November 8--Sergei Krivov, 63, Russian official in NYC dies \n     on U.S. Election Day. Kirvov worked for the FSB, his cover in \n     the U.S. at the Russian consulate was ``security guard.'' On \n     November 8, NYC police received a 911 call from the Russian \n     consulate. Emergency responders declared him dead at the \n     scene. Krivovhad served in the consulate as duty commander \n     involved with security affairs. Russian consular officials \n     first said Krivov fell from the roof. Then, they said he died \n     of a heart attack. The initial police report filed on the day \n     of the incident said Krivov was found ``with an unknown \n     trauma to the head.'' After conducting an autopsy, New York \n     City Medical Examiner ruled that Krivov died from bleeding in \n     the chest area.\n       August--The World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) announced that \n     Russian runner Yulia Stepanova's online doping management \n     account had been illegally accessed. The doping scandal, for \n     which she blew off the lid, rocked sport and cost over 100 \n     Russians their place at the Rio Games. The Russian runner \n     says she fears for her life and has been forced to move after \n     hackers tried to find her location. Stepanova has been in \n     hiding in the United States with her husband Vitaly, a former \n     Russian anti-doping official, after giving evidence that the \n     Russian government for years facilitated widespread cheating \n     across nearly all Olympic sports.\n       July--Interfax news agency reported that Aleksandr Poteyev, \n     64, an intelligence officer accused of defecting and \n     betraying a ring of Russian spies living undercover in \n     American suburbs, had died in the United States. However, the \n     U.S. has not confirmed these reports. Poteyev exposed Anna \n     Chapman and gang of 10, after defecting and entered \n     witness protection.\n       February 14--Nikita Kamaev, 52, a former executive director \n     of the Russian anti-doping agency died suddenly apparently of \n     a heart attack according to TASS. He planned to write a book \n     on drug use in sports Britain's Sunday Times newspaper \n     reported.\n       February 3--Vyacheslav Sinev, 52, a former general \n     director, Russian anti-doping agency died suddenly. Official \n     cause of death was never released.\n       January 14--Grigory Rodchenkov, 58, the director who ran \n     the laboratory that handled testing for thousands of Russian \n     Olympians and who developed a three-drug cocktail of banned \n     substances that he mixed with liquor and provided to dozens \n     of Russian athletes, helping to facilitate one of the most \n     elaborate--and successful--doping ploys in sports history, \n     fled to the U.S., seeking asylum and protective custody. \n     Within the next month, two of his colleagues died.\n       January 4--Col. Gen. Igor Sergun, 59, the head of the GRU \n     (Russia's military intelligence directorate), who has long \n     done secretive dirty work at the order of the Kremlin in the \n     war against Ukraine died suddenly. No information provided as \n     to cause of death.\n\n\n                                  2015\n\n       December 27--Major General Aleksandr Shushukin, 52, deputy \n     chief of staff of the Russian paratrooper forces and who led \n     the Russian military invasion in Crimea died suddenly. Blood \n     clots to the heart, Kremlin announced.\n       November 5--Mikhail Lesin, 57, found dead in his Dupont \n     Circle hotel room in Washington DC. A year later, in October \n     2016, the Washington DC medical examiner's office confirmed \n     that former Russian press minister died of ``blunt force \n     trauma to the head'' and also suffered injuries to his neck, \n     torso, arms and legs caused by falls, however determined the \n     cause of death to be accidental due to extreme inebriation. \n     Lesin founded the television network Russia Today (RT). The \n     Daily Beast reports that before his death, Lesin was \n     considering making a deal with the FBI to protect himself \n     from corruption charges. Lesin had been at the heart of \n     political life in Russia and would have known a lot about the \n     inner workings of the rich and powerful.\n       May--Vladimir Kara Marza, opposition journalist, deputy of \n     Open Russia poisoned for the first time.\n       February--Boris Nemtsov--just hours after urging the public \n     to join a march against Russia's military involvement in \n     Ukraine, Nemtsov was shot four times in the back by an \n     unknown assailant within view of the Kremlin. Putin took \n     ``personal control'' of the investigation into Nemtsov's \n     murder, but the killer remains at large.\n\n\n                                  2013\n\n       March 23--Billionaire Boris Berezovsky, instrumental in \n     Putin's rise to power, had a falling out with Putin which led \n     to his self-exile in the United Kingdom, where he vowed to \n     bring down the president. Berezovsky was found dead inside a \n     locked bathroom at his home in the United Kingdom, a noose \n     around his neck, in what was at first deemed a suicide. \n     However, the coroner's office could not determine the cause \n     of death.\n\n\n                                  2012\n\n       Alexander Perepilichny, 44, a former member of the Klyuev \n     Group, dropped dead while jogging in his adoptive home of \n     Surrey, England. There was no cause of death stated, but the \n     assumption by the British coroner's initial finding was that \n     nothing looked suspicious, even though Perepilichny was a \n     healthy 44-year-old with no known chronic or debilitating \n     ailments. Then Monique Simmonds, a researcher at the Royal \n     Botanic Gardens at Kew, hired by the coroner at the behest of \n     Perepilichny's life insurance company, uncovered traces of a \n     rare and toxic plant, gelsemium, in the victim's stomach. \n     Gelsemium, as it turns out, does not grow in the verdant \n     climes of Surrey. It is only found in China, where it is a \n     favored poison of assassins. Russian hitmen, too, have been \n     known to access the flower's quiet, lethal capability. At the \n     time of his death, Perepilichny had been helping the Swiss \n     government locate and freeze chunks of the missing $230 \n     million, some of which, the U.S. government concluded, wound \n     up in Manhattan real estate and American banks.\n\n\n                                  2009\n\n       November 16--Sergei Magnitsky, anti-corruption attorney \n     died in police custody in Moscow detention center after \n     allegedly being brutally beaten, then denied medical care. He \n     had been working for British-American businessman William \n     Browder to investigate a massive tax fraud case. Magnitsky \n     was allegedly arrested after uncovering evidence suggesting \n     that police officials were behind the fraud.\n       July 15--Natalya Estemirova was kidnapped outside her home, \n     shot several times--including a point-blank shot in the \n     head--and dumped in the nearby woods. A journalist who \n     investigated abductions and murders that had become \n     commonplace in Chechnya where pro-Russian security forces \n     waged a brutal crackdown against Islamic militants. Like \n     fellow journalist Anna Politkovskaya, Estemirova reported on \n     civilians who often got caught between these two violent \n     forces. Nobody has been convicted of her murder.\n       January 19--Stanislav Markelov a human rights lawyer known \n     for representing Chechen civilians in human rights cases \n     again the Russian military. He also represented journalists \n     who found themselves in\n\n\n     legal trouble after writing articles critical of Putin, \n     including Novaya Gazeta reporter Anna Politkovskaya, slain in \n     2006. Markelov was shot by a masked gunman near the Kremlin.\n       January 19--Anastasia Baburova, a journalist from Novaya \n     Gazeta, was fatally shot as she tried to help Stanislav \n     Markelov. Russian authorities said a neo-Nazi group was \n     behind the killings, and two members were convicted of the \n     deaths.\n\n\n                                  2008\n\n       Semyon Korobeinikov, allegedly a clothing salesman, lost \n     his footing on a balcony and tumbled to his demise. A year \n     later, Korobeinikov was named as the purchaser of Universal \n     Savings Bank, a dubious financial institution that had been \n     fingered by investigators as a way-station for stolen Russian \n     money. Only he didn't buy the bank. It was part of a \n     government ruse to exonerate the true owner, an ex-convict \n     called Dmitry Klyuev, implicated in a series of massive tax \n     frauds that cost Russian citizens $1 billion. Korobeinikov \n     might have therefore borne witness against Klyuev, if he \n     wasn't conveniently dead.\n\n\n                                  2006\n\n       November 23--Alexander Litvinenko, a former KGB agent, died \n     three weeks after drinking a cup of tea laced with deadly \n     polonium-210 at a London hotel. A British inquiry found that \n     Litvinenko was poisoned by Russian agents Andrei Lugovoi and \n     Dmitry Kovtun, who were acting on orders that had ``probably \n     been approved by President Putin.'' Russia refused to \n     extradite them, and in 2015 the Russian president granted \n     Lugovoi a medal for ``services to the motherland.'' After \n     leaving the Russian Federal Security Service, Litvinenko \n     became a vocal critic of the agency, which was run by Putin, \n     and later blamed the security service for orchestrating a \n     series of apartment bombings in Russia in 1999 that left \n     hundreds dead.\n       October 7--Anna Politkovskaya, a Russian reporter for \n     Novaya Gazeta whose book, ``Putin's Russia,'' accused the \n     Kremlin leader of turning the country into a police state. \n     She wrote extensively about abuse in Chechnya. She was shot \n     at point-blank range in an elevator in her building.\n\n\n                                  2004\n\n       July 9--Paul Klebnikov, chief editor of the Russian edition \n     of Forbes. He had written about corruption and dug into the \n     lives of wealthy Russians. He was killed in a drive-by \n     shooting in an apparent contract killing.\n\n\n                                  2003\n\n       October--Mikhail Khodorkovsky jailed for ten years.\n       Sergei Yushenkov, the affable former army colonel, had just \n     registered his Liberal Russia movement as a political party \n     when he was gunned down outside his home in Moscow. Yushenkov \n     was gathering evidence he believed proved that the Putin \n     government was behind one of the apartment bombings in 1999.\n       July 3--Yuri Shchekochikhin, a Duma deputy, journalist and \n     author who wrote about crime and corruption in the former \n     Soviet Union. He was investigating the 1999 apartment \n     bombings for Novaya Gazeta when he contracted a mysterious \n     illness in July 2003. He died suddenly, a few days before he \n     was supposed to depart for the United States. His medical \n     documents were deemed classified by Russian authorities.\n       April 17--Sergiey Yushenkov, 52, the affable former army \n     colonel, who had just registered his Liberal Russia movement \n     as a political party was gunned down outside his home in \n     Moscow. Yushenkov was gathering evidence he believed proved \n     that the Putin government was behind one of the apartment \n     bombings in 1999. He was shot three times in the back by a \n     single assailant using a pistol with a silencer, police said. \n     It was the 10th killing of a member of parliament since 1994.\n\n\n International Press Institute figures on Russian journalists who were \n              murdered or died in suspicious circumstances\n\n       2011--three Russian journalists dead (including newspaper \n     editor Khadzhimurad Kamalov, shot 14 times as he left his \n     office); 2010--two dead; 2009--five dead (including a young \n     reporter from Novaya Gazeta, caught in a hail of bullets); \n     2008--four dead; 2007--one killed; 2006--two killed, \n     including Anna Politkovskaya, and Yevgeny Gerasimenko--found \n     in his Saratov flat with a plastic bag pulled over his head \n     and computer missing; 2005--two died; 2004--three, including \n     Paul Klebnikov; 2003--three more; 2002--eight editor \n     (including Valery Ivanov, editor, shot in the head); 2001--\n     one; 2000--six dead reporters and editors.\n", "turn": 1, "speaker": "Ms. KAPTUR", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "K000009", "text": "  Ms. KAPTUR. Madam Speaker, it is hard for people of goodwill to \nimagine the depth of depravity that Russia's malevolent dictators will \nstoop to to serve the narrow, pecuniary, and political interests of the \nfew at the price of the many.\n  Dr. Timothy Snyder, in his extraordinary book, ``Bloodlands,'' \nrecounts the intergenerational human tragedy wrought by Russian \ndictators, citing the 14 million civilians, women, children, and \nfamilies, who were murdered at Russia's hand in eastern and central \nEurope.\n  Vladimir Putin is the latest dictator in a long line of them, and, \nsadly, this dark history from Stalin to Putin continues today.
