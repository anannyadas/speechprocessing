Mr. Speaker, my Republican colleagues tell me that \nthis tax plan will grow the economy and make American workers more \ncompetitive, but, in reality, the plan would bankrupt our future. It \nthreatens provisions that directly support our schools and our \nstudents. By eliminating the State and local tax deductions, it \npenalizes States and school districts that have chosen to invest in our \nyoung people.\n  In my home State of California, that threatens over $750 in State \nfunding per public school student each and every year. For Americans \nwith student loan debt, this plan eliminates the student loan interest \ndeduction.\n  In my district, over 21,000 people claim this deduction each year. As \na former college professor, I know the sacrifices that many of our \nstudents have to make to pursue an education. This tax plan asks them \nto pay even more.\n  These priorities are out of sync. This is not tax reform that puts \nmiddle class families first. We can do better.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. LOWENTHAL", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "186", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H9240", "wkday": "Tuesday", "day": "14", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "TAX PLAN AND EDUCATION", "id": "CREC-2017-11-14-pt1-PgH9240", "title": "TAX PLAN AND EDUCATION"}
