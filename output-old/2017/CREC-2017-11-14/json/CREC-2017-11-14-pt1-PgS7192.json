Mr. President, it is good for both of us and our \ncolleagues to be thinking this month about National Adoption Month, to \nrecognize the celebration of National Adoption Day, which will occur \nthis Saturday. I have had the great privilege of serving as cochair of \nthe Coalition on Adoption with Senator Klobuchar from Minnesota. It is \nan opportunity not only for us to work together in a bipartisan way, \nbut at an event we attended just the other\n\n\nday, I was told the adoption caucus in the House and Senate is the \nbiggest caucus of either body and the biggest caucus of the Congress. \nOf course, it should be. It is built on the idea that kids have the \nneed of a family and that there are families out there who want to \nadopt kids. Whether that is nationally, domestically, or \ninternationally, we really work hard to try to make that more possible.\n  Our House cochairs have been great to work with. Senator Klobuchar \nand I are working on several pieces of legislation right now to make it \neasier for families to adopt and to make sure adopted families have the \nsupport they need to stay strong.\n  One piece of legislation we are working on is the Adoption Tax Credit \nRefundability Act. It is a little bit outside the norm of the \ndiscussion of simplifying the Tax Code, but I was pleased the other day \nto have some important evidence put on the table when the chairman of \nthe House Ways and Means Committee--who, by the way, is an adoptive \nfather of two sons and an advocate for adoption and for kids--when the \ncurrent adoption tax credit was not in the House bill, he said one of \nthe reasons it is not here is so many families who adopt kids don't pay \nincome tax because of the low level of their income. My thought was, \nwell, that is exactly what Senator Klobuchar and I were saying. That \nshould be a refundable credit as well as a credit, but I am glad to see \nthe current credit back in the tax bill that the Finance Committee is \nlooking at now. We want to continue to look at not only the current \ncredit but expanding that.\n  According to the Department of Health and Human Services, one-third \nof all adopted children live in families with an annual household \nincome at or below 200 percent of the poverty level. It is because of \nthat the tax burden is low. They don't pay income taxes. The adoption \ntax credit isn't as helpful to those families as it is to families who \nactually have income tax to credit it against.\n  More than 400,000 children now in the United States are also in the \nfoster care system, and more than 100,000 of those 400,000 kids are \nready and waiting for families they can call their own. Lots of other \nchildren need to be in families all over the world, but we can be \nlooking carefully at the children in our system now. We both looked--\nand others have joined us in that--at the foster care system and \nensuring behavioral health screening happens within 30 days of getting \ninto that system. Once you get into the foster care system, often it is \nbecause of unavoidable challenges families face, and often it is \nbecause of challenges kids should never have to face. So that early \nevaluation of what is going on there can really make a difference in \nhow foster kids are dealt with in the system and how they get ready--as \n100,000 of them now are--to leave the foster care system and be \nadopted.\n  Before I turn to Senator Klobuchar, I just want to mention some kids \nright now who are on what is called the Missouri Heart Gallery. More \nthan 1,200 Missouri children are in need of permanent homes. The \nMissouri Heart Gallery is a place to look, as we approach the end of \nthis year, to see what the stories of some of these kids are.\n  Brandon, for instance, who is 12, loves to play games. LEGO sets are \nhis favorite toy. He likes to smile and give hugs. He probably hasn't \ngotten enough hugs in his life up until now, but it is possible to try \nyour best to catch up with kids who need hugs. He needs a stable and \nloving family. He is often playing outside. It would be wonderful if he \nwere playing outside a house or a home that he knew was a permanent \nhome for him.\n  Shaniah and Shanae are sisters who hope to be placed together, and \nthey hope to have a chance to maintain contact with their aunt \nfollowing placement. Shaniah loves dancing and cheerleading. Her \nfavorite color is green. She hopes to be a scientist one day. Shanae's \nfavorite hobby is singing, and she makes friends really easily between \nher dancing and singing skills that she shares with her sister. Both of \nthese girls would really bring a lot of life and vitality into what we \nwould hope would be their family forever.\n  Brandon, Shaniah, and Shanae are in need of permanent and loving \nhomes. This is a time when we ought to be thinking not only about the \nobstacles to adoption, the things that encourage adoption but also how \nwe can make the support system for both adoption and foster care and \nadoption out of foster care work better.\n  I know my colleagues will be eager to join Senator Klobuchar and me \nin marking November as National Adoption Month and by passing our \nresolution today.\n  I turn to my friend from Minnesota Senator Klobuchar.", "turn": 2, "speaker": "Mr. BLUNT", "itemno": 4}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.", "turn": 3, "speaker": "The PRESIDING OFFICER", "itemno": 5}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "K000367", "text": "  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, first of all, I would like to thank \nSenator Blunt for his leadership. We have worked side by side on these \nissues for so many years, and I am really pleased--as he noted--that \nthere has been a lot of focus on this issue of the adoption tax credit \nand not only how it needs to be fixed in any tax bill and make sure it \nis maintained, but, in fact, it should be expanded on. I thank him. We \nhave both been advocating for that.\n  One of the reasons I am so involved in this issue is, in my State of \nMinnesota, we have historically had a lot of adoptions. One is \ninternational adoptions. We have one of the highest rates of \ninternational adoptions in the country. We have families who have \nopened their hearts to kids from Vietnam to Guatemala, to Nepal, to \nHaiti.\n  I have had the opportunity to witness the power of adoption firsthand \nwhen I served for 8 years as the Hennepin County attorney--which is the \nlargest prosecutor's office in our State. We also have civil \njurisdiction so one of the things I worked on was speeding up the \namount of time it took for foster kids to get out and into permanent \nhomes. I was able to see firsthand those loving parents who would do \nanything to bring these kids into their families. When you see it \ninternationally, it just breaks your heart if it goes on for years and \nyears and years.\n  Right now, domestically, over 425,000 children are living without \npermanent families in our foster care system. Over 110,000 of these \nkids are eligible for adoption. One of the reasons Senator Blunt and I \ncame together today is to make people aware that, yes, there is \ninternational adoption--it is so important--but there are also kids \nright here in America who would love to be taken in by a family. That \nis part of the theme of our Adoption Month for the country.\n  We have tackled a number of issues over the last few years, along \nwith former Senator Landrieu of Louisiana. One of them was the \nInternational Adoption Simplification Act, which was a big help in \nterms of making sure that older children weren't left behind when \nyounger siblings were adopted. I worked on that bill with Senator \nInhofe; then, Senators Blunt and Landrieu and I introduced the Accuracy \nfor Adoptees Act, which helps greatly to ensure that families don't \nhave to fight with foreign authorities to get their kids' documents \nchanged.\n  We are also working on some of the international issues now because \nof the slowdown in international adoptions and the work that we can do \nthere. We look forward to working with the State Department and other \nagencies on that.\n  One of the best parts of our job is helping a family in our home \nState with an adoption. Recently, I got to visit a family in the \nwestern suburbs of Minnesota. For years, they had been waiting to adopt \ntwo Ethiopian boys. We worked really hard on this, as the halt of \nadoptions out of Ethiopia affected more than 200 American families; one \nof them was David and Katie Norton. Because of the work that was done \nand the push that was made, a number of these kids came home to their \nfamilies.\n  I got to swing on a tire swing with these two rather fun boys who, \nevery day, like to put on their bicycle helmets just because they think \nthat is cool, and they wear them around the backyard. We had a great \ntime with them.\n  There are other children, and it makes you realize how close to home \nthis is and how pleased we are to welcome these kids to American \nfamilies. That is what National Adoption Month is all about. We want \nmore kids to be able to swing on tire swings, so we will continue to \nwork with the foster care system, as well as the international\n\n\nadoption system, to make this a reality for more and more orphans \nacross the world.\n  I thank Senator Blunt for his leadership, and we look forward to \nworking on this issue for many years to come.", "turn": 4, "speaker": "Ms. KLOBUCHAR", "itemno": 6}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
