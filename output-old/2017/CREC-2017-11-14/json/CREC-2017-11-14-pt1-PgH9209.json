Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, Maria: the images of the human misery and \nthe economic devastation are still clearly imprinted on our minds.\n  Unfortunately, we know that part of this is a result of a failed \nNational Flood Insurance Program, which, Mr. Speaker, faced three \nimportant challenges.\n  First, it is a bankrupt program. It is unsustainable. Taxpayers are \non the hook for $1.2 trillion, running an annual actuarial deficit of \n$1.5 billion. It has already received two different bailouts, for a \ncombined total of about $25 billion.\n  Also, it incents and subsidizes people to actually live in harm's \nway.\n  Finally, Mr. Speaker, it is a government monopoly that, \nnotwithstanding subsidized rates, still, unfortunately, has \nunaffordable premiums for many.\n  Today is a good day, Mr. Speaker, because today the House gets to \nvote on the 21st Century Flood Reform Act.\n  I thank the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. Luetkemeyer) for his \nleadership on the mapping reforms and reinsurance. I want to thank the \ngentleman from Florida (Mr. Ross) for his reforms on opening up the \nmarket. I certainly want to thank the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. \nDuffy) for his tireless effort and leadership in bringing this bill to \nthe floor.\n  There are a lot of good reforms in this bill, Mr. Speaker, for both \ntaxpayers and ratepayers. Let me just briefly touch upon two.\n  It is an absolutely revolutionary reform, Mr. Speaker, that we can \nbreak open the government monopoly and bring in market competition, \ninnovation competition, and more affordable rates for so many.\n  Milliman, one of the actuarial experts within the marketplace, \nreleased a study a couple of months ago talking about the market \ncompetition, saying: ``Based on our estimates, this would hold for 77 \npercent of all single families in Florida, 69 percent in Louisiana, and \n92 percent in Texas,'' who all would see cheaper premiums.\n  We know that is not theory. It is actually happening in the market \ntoday. In the nascent part of the market that is open, people are \ngetting hundreds, if not thousands, of dollars of savings.\n  One of the great tragedies that I saw in my native State of Texas, in \nHouston, was how few people actually took up flood insurance. Think, \nMr. Speaker, if we had competition, if we had advertising, if people \ncould roll that into their homeowner rates, how many more people would \nhave been protected by the ravages of these hurricanes.\n  One more reform, briefly. We have these repetitive loss properties \nwhere people live in areas that flood over and over and over. I met a \ncouple of families in Houston. They had three floods in 8 years. We \nhave got to help them.\n  This bill provides more money for relocation, for flood-proofing, and \nfor mitigation, than any other flood reform bill, all by 25 percent. We \nwould prioritize these areas.\n  We also have to realize that if we are going to make this program \nsustainable, we cannot have 1 percent of the properties causing 25 \npercent of the losses.\n\n\n  Ultimately, if all we do is rebuild the same properties in the same \nfashion in the same location, that is neither wise nor compassionate. \nWe have an opportunity to enact historic reforms. We should do it \ntoday.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.", "turn": 5, "speaker": "Mr. HENSARLING", "itemno": 115}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "W000187", "text": "  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such \ntime as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to H.R. 2874, legislation \nthat will make flood insurance more expensive, less available, and less \nfair for consumers.\n  At the outset, let me just say that I appreciate the time and effort \nthat Chairman Hensarling and Mr. Duffy spent in responding to my calls \nfor bipartisanship. We sat down multiple times to discuss areas where \nwe could find compromise and a path forward.\n  Although our discussions were ultimately not successful and I \nstrongly oppose this bill, I continue to believe that flood insurance \nreally can be a bipartisan issue. In fact, I have a long history of \nworking across the aisle on the National Flood Insurance Program.\n  In 2012, I coauthored the Biggert-Waters Act with former \nRepresentative Judy Biggert, and in 2014, when FEMA's botched \nimplementation of the premium increases called for in that law led to \nunintended consequences, lawmakers from across the aisle joined me once \nagain to pass the Homeowner Flood Insurance Affordability Act.\n  Unfortunately, despite the best efforts of Members from both sides of \nthe aisle, I cannot support H.R. 2874 because it contains many \nprovisions that will harm American families and businesses.\n  First and most importantly, the bill makes flood insurance more \nexpensive. This bill will punish low and middle class Americans with \nincreased premiums, surcharges, and reserve fund assessments. In the \nwake of a historic hurricane season that devastated so many \ncommunities, it is unconscionable that we are considering a bill that \nwould make flood insurance less affordable. We should be focussing on \nproviding additional disaster relief and recovery after these \ndevastating storms, not punishing these communities with higher \npremiums and surcharges.\n  It is clear that there are those who choose to live near the coast as \na luxury, but there are also those who live in floodplains who are low- \nand middle-income families with modest homes, including some \nneighborhoods that are predominantly minority. This is because of the \nsad history of government-endorsed racism in access to credit and in \nneighborhood planning that pushed minorities into the bad parts of \ntown, which, in some cases, were bad because they were prone to \nflooding.\n  These communities also often lack the resources to make upgrades to \ntheir homes and infrastructure to guard against future flood risk and \nare the least able to recover after a flood. The Lower Ninth Ward in \nNew Orleans is a prime example.\n  Another example is Greenspoint, a business district in Houston that \nwas one of the hardest hit by Harvey. One in three residents in \nGreenspoint lives below the poverty line. Families in Greenspoint were \nstill living in water-damaged and moldy units from flooding last year \nwhen they were hit again by Harvey.\n\n\n  There is no simple answer to our Nation's flooding problems, but I do \nknow that raising the premiums and racking these up on policyholders \nwill only hurt families as well as our economy.\n  Second, the bill makes flood insurance less available by allowing \nbusinesses to opt out of the requirement to purchase flood insurance, \neven if they are a high-risk property in a flood zone.\n  What is more, the bill kicks out certain low-value homes from the \nNFIP by prohibiting coverage for any home with claims that, over the \nentire history of the property, following enactment, even if it changes \nhands, exceed three times the replacement value of the structure.\n  This provision is so ill-conceived that the American Bankers \nAssociation wrote: ``Cutting off such properties from NFIP coverage \nwill likely lead to significant hardship for homeowners, lenders, and \ncommunities. As borrowers lose NFIP coverage, and especially if \nalternative private coverage is not available or affordable, these \nproperties will lose value, and the risk of abandonment and/or \nforeclosure increases dramatically. In some flood-prone communities, \nthis could lead to a local or regional foreclosure crisis.''\n  Third, the bill makes flood insurance less fair for policyholders. In \nthe wake of this historic hurricane season, it is astounding to me that \nthe bill does nothing to fund flood maps so that we can better protect \nfamilies. Oftentimes, communities are unaware of their true flood risk; \nand by not providing any funding for flood maps, building in areas with \nno information about flood risk will only continue.\n  Climate change will only make these storms more frequent, stronger, \nand more devastating than ever before, and we must make sure that the \nNFIP remains available and affordable to all Americans, not make it \nworse.\n  For all of these reasons, I urge my colleagues to oppose H.R. 2874, \nand I reserve the balance of my time.", "turn": 6, "speaker": "Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California", "itemno": 116}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "H001036", "text": "  Mr. HENSARLING.

One of those was \nto provide better disclosure to consumers about flood risk. We wanted \nthem to know. And the second was to decrease the number of repeatedly \nflooded properties. This bill accomplishes both of those things.\n\n  Section 108 of the bill includes language that I authored, which will \nprovide information to home buyers about past flood events, about the \ndamage, about insurance claims, about any obligation they might have to \ncarry flood insurance; and the National Association of Realtors \nsupports this commonsense approach.\n  Section 402 of the bill includes the bipartisan Repeatedly Flooded \nCommunities Preparation Act, sponsored by Representative Earl \nBlumenauer and me. This means that repeatedly flooded properties, which \ncomprise less than 2 percent of NFIP policies but account for one-third \nof all claims, are dealt with.\n  Responsible, community-driven mitigation is a win-win proposal, one \nwhich will help our neighborhoods become stronger in the face of floods \nand address the fiscal footing of the overall program by decreasing the \ncost as this is addressed to community level.\n  Finally, Mr. Speaker, I would particularly like to thank the Pew \nCharitable Trusts, their flood-prepared communities initiative, for \ntheir support of our reform efforts.", "turn": 8, "speaker": "Mr. ROYCE of California", "itemno": 118}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "W000187", "text": "  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California.

The bill raises costs on pre-FIRM \nstructures from 5 percent to 6.5 percent.\n  Additionally, the bill will require a $40 surcharge on primary \nresidences and seeks to increase the reserve fund by charging \npolicyholders an additional 1 percent every year.\n  The bill also changes the fee to policyholders who opt to pay their \npolicy monthly. Many of our constituents who live in flood-prone areas \nare not wealthy. These are hardworking Americans who rely on the NFIP \nto help offset costs and protect their homes from disastrous flooding.\n  Instead of working to find ways to truly address affordability within \nthe NFIP, the bill proposes to set up a voluntary State affordability \nprogram. This proposal then fails to provide States with the \nadministrative costs to set up a program, a cost that may be far too \nburdensome for many already-struggling States.\n  Even worse, the program would offset discounts for eligible \npolicyholders by charging policyholders who are not able to take \nadvantage of the affordability program--yet again increasing costs for \nhomeowners.\n  Importantly, H.R. 2874 makes no effort to address the debt. Though \nthe NFIP had been self-sustaining for many years, extreme unexpected \ndamage following Hurricane Katrina and Superstorm Sandy left the NFIP \nwith over $20 billion in debt. Though some of the debt was, in fact, \nrecently forgiven, the NFIP needed to borrow more from the Treasury \nfollowing Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria.\n  The NFIP pays over $400 million a year in interest, money that could \ngo towards making improvements in the program or helping enhance \naffordability. We need to wipe the slate clean and give the NFIP a \nfresh start.\n  H.R. 2874 fails to provide additional funding for flood maps, maps \nthat, in many jurisdictions, are desperately needed if we are going to \nhave updated maps. This bill also lacks funding for new mapping \ntechnology that could help improve the accuracy of the flood maps.\n  In conclusion, the short-term reauthorization of the NFIP expires \nearly next month.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the 21st \nCentury Flood Reform Act.\n  Chairman Hensarling and Chairman Duffy have crafted a great \nsubstitute amendment that will bring about meaningful reform of NFIP \nand protect taxpayers and policyholders alike.\n\n  The amendment includes H.R. 2246, my Taxpayer Exposure Mitigation Act \nof 2017. Included in that bill is a requirement that the FEMA \nAdministrator purchase reinsurance or a capital market alternative in \nan effort to guard taxpayers against losses.\n  I know of no major insurance company in the private sector that does \nnot purchase coverage to protect itself against loss of this kind. \nThese products function well. There is no reason that FEMA should not \nbe following this best practice as well.\n  The amendment also grants States and local governments and our \nconstituents the ability to play a more proactive role in the FEMA \nfloodplain mapping process.\n\n\n  I represent the Lake of the Ozarks with its 27,000 pieces of property \nalong its shoreline, which has dealt with tremendous mapping issues \nover the past several years. Hundreds of letters of map amendments were \ngranted to my constituents, and there were multiple attempts by the \ncommunity to engage with FEMA to fix their mapping process, but my \nconstituents never felt their concerns were taken seriously.\n  The Lake of the Ozarks is not unique. FEMA processes 25,000 LOMA \nletters each year at a cost of $13 million. This should tell all of us \nsomething about the mapping process. Under this bill, areas like the \nLake of the Ozarks would be able to improve the accuracy of the maps \nthemselves, no longer beholden to Washington, D.C.\n  This amendment would also create an opt-out from the mandatory \ncoverage required for commercial properties, allowing banks and \nbusinesses more flexibility to secure flood insurance coverage that \nmeets an entity's unique risks and needs.\n\n\n  It is important to note that this legislation does not preclude any \nbusiness from securing NFIP policy. Policies will remain available to \nall businesses.\n  Also, this provision should not be misconstrued as a caveat to avoid \nthe purchase of flood insurance. Businesses operating in flood plains \nshould have flood insurance, and I am confident that lenders will \ninsist upon reasonable coverage. I believe this should be a business \ndecision between the lender and the business customer.\n  Lastly, this amendment would require FEMA to use actual replacement \ncost in determining premium rates for NFIP policies--language \noriginally included in my H.R. 2565.\n  Pricing for private policies frequently takes into account the actual \nreplacement cost of a structure. It makes sense. Any insurance policy \nshould factor in the amount of money that would be needed to replace a \nstructure.\n  FEMA doesn't adhere to this fundamental of insurance. Rather, the \nagency effectively uses a fixed national average for insured value and \nreplacement costs when determining customer premiums.\n  The result of FEMA's current practice is that lower-income \npolicyholders subsidize wealthier homeowners.\n  The substitute amendment we consider today gives FEMA the flexibility \nit needs to stop this practice and move toward a replacement cost \npricing structure.\n  I also want to thank my colleague from Wisconsin for including this \nprovision in his substitute amendment. I am confident this package will \nallow the private sector to flourish and take risk off the backs of \ntaxpayers while protecting NFIP policyholders.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the measure.", "turn": 12, "speaker": "Mr. LUETKEMEYER", "itemno": 122}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "W000187", "text": "  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California.

Under \nthis bill, FEMA would have to increase premiums by a minimum of 6.5 \npercent per year.\n  When you add up the mandatory increases in premiums required to fund \nFEMA's reserve fund and all of the other surcharges in the bill, the \neffect would be to significantly increase flood insurance premiums for \nhomeowners.\n  Finally, I am concerned about eliminating the noncompete clause for \nso-called write-your-own private insurers. This would allow the private \ninsurers that administer the National Flood Insurance Program to \nexploit their access to FEMA's database in order to cherry-pick the \nsafest properties. This would leave FEMA with only the riskiest \nproperties, and would undermine the solvency of the National Flood \nInsurance Program.\n  So, while there are many thoughtful good provisions in this bill, \nthere are too many provisions that would dramatically increase premiums \nfor my constituents.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``no'' vote on this bill.", "turn": 14, "speaker": "Mrs. CAROLYN B.

Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the 21st Century Flood Reform Act, \nwhich would give communities in the Tampa Bay area and all of our \nconstituents a National Flood Insurance Program that serves as a \nlifeboat when disaster strikes.\n  Right now, the NFIP is more like an anchor tied around our neck, \ndragging this country deeper and deeper into debt as the waters rise.\n  With a $1.4 billion annual deficit and debt that continues to grow, \nthis program desperately needs reform, and H.R. 2874 is our \nopportunity.\n  We should all recognize that the NFIP is not a relief program. It is \nan insurance program. It is supposed to insure against losses, which \nentails far more than simply paying for damages.\n  Insurance is not about relief. It is about responsibly managing risk. \nInsurance means mitigating risks before disaster strikes, making \ninvestments in resiliency measures, telling people when the risk they \nface is simply too great, and providing service that makes people \nthankful for choosing your product.\n  No one knows this better than the professionals in the insurance \nindustry who work day in and day out to help Americans protect their \nlives, their loved ones, and their belongings against all types of \nthreats--car crashes, earthquakes, and wildfires.\n  Regrettably, Federal policy has made it extremely difficult for \nprivate insurers to write policies that cover flood risk. We have \ncreated a virtual monopoly for the NFIP at the expense of policyholders \nand taxpayers alike, yet we are still $30 billion in debt.\n  H.R. 2874, which includes my bipartisan Private Flood Insurance \nMarket Development Act, will allow the private sector to compete to \nhelp homeowners manage thei exposure to floods.\n\n  Competition can lower costs, provide more affordable options for \nconsumers, and reduce the unacceptable number of uninsured homes by \nhelping people understand their risk.\n  As it stands now, the NFIP is the worst of all worlds: It is too big \nto fail. It is also bound to fail.\n  With this legislation, we can make substantial progress in turning \naround a program that has found itself on the GAO's high-risk list for \nthe last decade.\n  Under this bill, consumers will finally have an opportunity to select \namong a menu of options a plan that would fit their needs. As a result, \nthey will be more likely to buy insurance than ever before.\n  That is not the case today with the NFIP. Our constituents are \nseverely limited. $250,000 maximum coverage on an NFIP policy. If you \nown a business, you are not going to get business interruption \ncoverage.\n  What good is the insurance, then?\n  Thankfully, the private sector is capable of offering more robust \npolicies that also provide more incentives for property owners to \ninvest in mitigation and resiliency. Ultimately, this increased \nemphasis on mitigation will benefit homeowners and taxpayers alike.\n  This legislation will help us end the absurd practice of paying to \nrebuild a home that has been destroyed by flooding on more than three \noccasions.\n  Further, it strengthens the NFIP by directing FEMA to spread the \nNFIP's risk onto the global marketplace.\n\n\n  This bill also contains more funding for mitigation and recovery than \nhas ever been authorized by Congress. Over $1 billion will be made \navailable by this bill to help manage our constituents' exposure to \nfloods and improve the safety of a home after a catastrophe.\n  Mr. Speaker, let's support the freedom to insure against obvious \ndanger that imperils people's homes and their wallets.

The NFIP does not.\n  For almost 50 years, the experiment in government-provided flood \ninsurance has proven to be ineffective, inefficient, and indisputably \ncostly to hardworking taxpayers. The time for action is now.\n  Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record USA Today, Washington Post, \nWashington Times, and Chicago Tribune articles.\n\n                  [From the USA Today, Sept. 7, 2017]\n\n                Make Flood Insurance Reflect Actual Risk\n\n\nafter hurricanes, taxpayers can't absorb ever increasing tabs: Our view\n\n       In 1968, in the wake of Hurricane Betsy, Congress decided \n     it had enough. Flooding was destroying too many homes, \n     leaving financial and physical devastation in its wake.\n       So lawmakers created the National Flood Insurance Program, \n     a government-run insurance fund for homeowners in flood-prone \n     areas.\n       And that's when things got really bad.\n       The NFIP has been losing money ever since. The program is \n     nearly $25 billion in the red and is running annual deficits \n     in the range of $1.4 billion. That's because it's a creation \n     of Congress and therefore sets its premiums according to what \n     is politically convenient rather than what is actuarially \n     sound.\n       With Hurricane Harvey devastating the Houston area, and \n     Hurricane Irma bearing down on the Southeast coast, the \n     program is certain to take a massive loss this year.\n       What's worse, the NFIP's woes are self-generating. Because \n     the premiums are well below what should be charged, this \n     effectively subsidizes construction in flood-prone areas. And \n     that means its losses grow as more flood-prone land is \n     developed.\n       Hurricane Katrina, which ravaged the Gulf Coast in 2005, \n     exposed just how costly and counterproductive the program had \n     become. In 2012, after years of debate, Congress enacted a \n     law that made flood insurance rates more reflective of actual \n     risks and expanded the areas considered flood-prone.\n       This generated Category 3 blowback from homeowners and the \n     real estate lobby, and in 2014 Congress passed another law \n     undoing much of the first.\n       Now, with catastrophic losses mounting and sea levels \n     rising, it's time to revisit the issue.\n       Making federal flood insurance more reflective of reality \n     would only go so far in dealing with the problem of building \n     in flood-prone areas. That's because many homeowners don't \n     have flood insurance and because much of the damage that the \n     government eventually pays for is not covered by the program. \n     (Private insurance typically covers damage from wind but not \n     water.)\n       With Katrina, for instance, the flood insurance payout was \n     $16.3 billion. But Congress passed supplementary spending of \n     more than $100 billion to provide intensive relief and \n     temporary housing, as well as fix broken levies.\n       With Harvey and Irma, the federal tab beyond of flood \n     insurance is likely to be even higher. Only an estimated 20% \n     of homeowners in the area affected by Harvey even bothered \n     with flood insurance, a number that has been dropping in \n     recent years. But making flood insurance reflect actual risks \n     is a vital first step in coming to grips with reality.\n       In the past several decades, Americans have flocked to \n     coastal communities, many of them in parts of the country \n     prone to hurricanes. With the hit to taxpayers growing and \n     the danger increasing, restraint--even some reversal--of this \n     trend is needed.\n       While people in the hurricane zones deserve disaster \n     assistance and the nation's sympathy, taxpayers can't simply \n     absorb ever increasing tabs for flood losses. The government \n     needs policies that encourage people to build their homes in \n     safer places. Harvey and Irma are just the latest sobering \n     wake-up calls with that message.", "turn": 27, "speaker": "Mr. HILL", "itemno": 137}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                                  ____\n\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Aug. 30, 2017]\n\n               After Harvey, Flood Insurance Needs Reform\n\n       Congress must be generous in helping to repair the damage, \n     to lives and to property, from Hurricane Harvey. The full \n     extent of the destruction may not be known for a long time \n     but is evidently catastrophic, just as the damage wrought by \n     Katrina and Sandy was. Even as they demonstrate that they \n     have a heart, lawmakers must also show that they have some \n     brains. Specifically, the United States is long overdue for \n     smart reforms to one of the major government institutions \n     designed to help people cope with the risk of natural \n     disaster: the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP), which \n     has underwritten a total of 5 million policies providing \n     homeowners and some businesses $1.2 trillion in coverage.\n       Now almost half a century old, the NFIP grew out of what \n     was, at the time, a basic reality of the insurance business: \n     Flooding risks were actuarially imponderable, so insuring \n     against them was uneconomic for the private sector, \n     especially in places such as the hurricane-prone Gulf of \n     Mexico. To fill the gap, the federal government offered \n     coverage on two conditions: that local communities would take \n     appropriate land-use and other measures to prevent \n     development in risky low-lying areas; and that homeowners \n     would pay actuarially sound premiums.\n       Elegant in theory, the plan gradually succumbed to real \n     estate interests, with the result that flood insurance \n     enabled rather than managed development along coasts and in \n     other flood-prone areas--ultimately putting more people and \n     property at risk than might otherwise have been the case. As \n     it happens, well-to-do people benefit disproportionately from \n     this program; they're the ones who tend to build big houses \n     on the beach. The NFIP has spent many millions of dollars to \n     repair properties that have been repeatedly flooded.\n       Prior to Katrina, the NFIP was nevertheless generally able \n     to pay for coverage through the premiums it collected. \n     Massive losses from that storm and Sandy, however, have \n     driven it into de facto bankruptcy; the program has been \n     forced to borrow more than $24 billion from the treasury to \n     pay claims, a debt that was nearly unpayable even before \n     Harvey hit. At the moment, the program has $1.7 billion on \n     hand, plus $5.8 billion left on its line of credit with the \n     Treasury--and some 373,000 policyholders in the Harvey flood \n     zone who will expect to get paid.\n       Coincidentally, the program is due for reauthorization on \n     Sept. 30. Ideally, this deadline would galvanize Congress to \n     ensure enough money is available to pay current commitments, \n     while reforming NFIP for the future. What's needed are \n     tougher flood-risk mitigation requirements, more realistic \n     premiums and encouragement for private-sector involvement in \n     the business, based on modern technology that may enable \n     insurance companies to underwrite risks they could not have \n     underwritten in the 1960s.\n       Recent history, alas, doesn't make us optimistic: Congress \n     did reform the program on a bipartisan basis in 2012, only to \n     see much of that undone under pressure from coastal-state \n     lawmakers in 2014, after Sandy. ``There is a tide in the \n     affairs of men, which taken at the flood, leads on to \n     fortune,'' Shakespeare wrote.

Sadly, the federal flood \n     insurance program is already underwater and Harvey will only \n     add to the flood of red ink. It's clear that Congress must \n     reform the program so the premiums property owners pay more \n     closely reflect the flood risk. Until that happens, nature's \n     frequent fury will continue to undermine the finances of \n     everyone.\n       With the angry water from the Category 4 hurricane damaging \n     200,000 Houston-area homes and business firms, early \n     estimates place the cost of restoration as high as $190 \n     billion. That would eclipse the $108 billion loss in the 2005 \n     Hurricane Katrina and Superstorm Sandy in 2012. President \n     Trump expects Congress to quickly approve a $7.9 billion down \n     payment for emergency relief.\n       The National Flood Insurance Program, designed to wield the \n     financial muscle of the federal government to protect flood-\n     prone property, has proved to be a money sieve. It covers \n     about 5 million flood-prone properties nationwide, worth \n     about $1.2 trillion, and collects about $3.5 billion annually \n     in premiums. The program was $25 billion in the red before \n     Harvey hit--a clear indicator that overall, property owners \n     who are required to carry flood insurance are not paying for \n     the risk.\n       Among the existing program's shortcomings are its policy of \n     grandfathering older structures built in low-lying regions \n     before accurate floodplain mapping began, encouraging owners \n     to renovate rather than demolish. Between 1978 and 2004, \n     these risky properties comprised 1 percent of the program's \n     insured properties but accounted for 38 percent of the damage \n     claims, according to the Government Accountability Office. \n     The federal program is subsidizing insurance\n\n\n     for expensive waterfront property along the Southeastern \n     coastline, favoring the wealthiest homeowners.\n       Congress has made several attempts to put the insurance on \n     a sustainable financial footing, without success. The program \n     will expire at the end of this month, which offers \n     legislators an opportunity to resolve the unintended \n     consequences of the program.\n       Several constructive bills were reported out of the House \n     Financial Services Committee in June. Among the proposals are \n     provisions giving more leeway to private insurers who \n     currently offer only federally approved policies. Doing so \n     would allow insurers to set premiums tailored to individual \n     properties, resulting in a closer match of insurance cost and \n     flood risk. Other provisions would limit claim payments for \n     repeatedly flooded properties and require the use of \n     replacement cost in setting insurance rates.\n       The House is seeking a five-year reauthorization of the \n     National Flood Insurance Program and the Senate version calls \n     for a 10-year term to ensure continuity. Both versions back \n     provisions to allow a gradual increase of private-sector \n     involvement in flood insurance. It's an idea endorsed by the \n     free-market Cato Institute, which says ``the ideal `reform' \n     to the [program] would be to fully privatize flood insurance. \n     That would be more likely to fix the system in a way that \n     would limit the long-run government liability than any \n     alternative legislative approach.'' Allowing private insurers \n     to have a larger role in future flood protection is sensible.\n       No one could have foreseen the once-in-a-lifetime deluge \n     that swamped Houston, but actuaries make their bones \n     calculating risk, including in their calculations such \n     unpredictable natural disasters as tornadoes and earthquakes. \n     Insurance premiums undistorted by Washington rules would give \n     consumers a clearer picture of flood hazards, helping them \n     avoid the mistake of building in the path of storms like \n     Hurricane Harvey.

The owners of a Houston home that flooded 16 \n     times in 18 years got more than $800,000 in payments--for a \n     house worth just $115,000.\n       The folly of the government's flood insurance program has \n     been evident for decades, and some Midwestern communities \n     have been in on the action. We've written about how federal \n     flood insurance has serially benefited many of those who \n     refuse to move from river flood plains, sometimes to a fault. \n     After the Mississippi River flood of 1993, one Grafton, Ill., \n     resident explained to a reporter that he had collected \n     $24,000 in federal insurance for damage to his small house \n     from floods in 1979, 1982, 1986 and 1992. For '93, he \n     expected an additional $32,000. His total insurance premiums \n     since buying the house in 1975: $6,000.\n       Houston, according to a new study by the National Wildlife \n     Federation, accounts for more than half of all the properties \n     that are flooded and paid for over and over. It has ``managed \n     to host three `500-year floods' in the past three years,'' \n     notes Michael Grunwald of Politico. Each one costs taxpayers \n     large sums. Yet development in these precarious spots \n     continues apace.\n       ``Why are we writing flood insurance (policies) for new \n     construction in flood zones?'' asks Craig Fugate, who headed \n     the Federal Emergency Management Agency in the Obama \n     administration. ``Think about it: If you're going to build a \n     new structure in the flood zone, the private sector can \n     insure it. And if they can't insure it, then why is the \n     public subsidizing the risk?''\n       It's a big subsidy. Thanks to past storms, the flood \n     insurance program has a $25 billion deficit. The \n     Congressional Budget Office found that coastal counties at \n     risk from tropical storms make up just 10 percent of all the \n     counties with federal flood insurance policies--but generate \n     75 percent of the claims and most of the deficit.\n       So why is the public subsidizing the risk in these places? \n     Because the people living there, the politicians they elect, \n     the businesses they patronize and various interest groups \n     (such as homebuilders and the real estate industry) have \n     strong stakes in preserving this program. They've been able \n     to prevent the sort of reforms needed to make it actuarially \n     sounder and closer to self-sustaining.\n       In 2012, Congress passed a modest package of sensible \n     changes that would have raised costs to the flood-prone. But \n     two years later, feeling the political heat, lawmakers \n     backtracked.\n       Homeowners located in areas that are expected to flood \n     every 100 years are required to buy flood insurance if they \n     want federally insured mortgages. But they pay rates far \n     lower than the risks warrant.\n       That gap deprives builders of incentives to stay out of \n     low-lying areas that are vulnerable to flooding--or to \n     elevate structures to keep them dry when the waters rise. It \n     also promotes the destruction of wetlands that could reduce \n     flooding. Oh, and it helps to tilt migration toward \n     vulnerable coastal regions like those of Texas and Florida.", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 140}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                                  ____\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 141}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "W000187", "text": "  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California.

This bill, which is the compilation of the seven-bill \n     package approved by the House Financial Services Committee \n     this summer, is detrimental to Pinellas County residents and \n     local governments. Despite the minor changes proposed in the \n     amendment, the bill will increase costs for National Flood \n     Insurance Program (NFIP) policyholders, create unfunded \n     mandates by increasing regulatory burdens and \n     responsibilities for local governments, and lead to fewer \n     participants in the NFIP, which will undermine the integrity \n     of the program. We strongly urge you to oppose the bill.\n       The bill would increase premiums on homes built prior to \n     the first flood map by a minimum of 6.5% each year, with \n     properties that have made two or more claims subject to even \n     higher rate increases. In addition to this increase, all \n     policy holders would be assessed new and increased fees and \n     surcharges with some of these fees, such as the reserve fund \n     fee, increasing each year. As these increased costs are \n     passed on to policyholders, the bill acknowledges that an \n     affordability assistance program is needed, however it \n     delegates that authority to states and requires it to be \n     financed through additional charges on the other \n     policyholders in the state, creating an even greater \n     financial burden. These increased costs along with the new \n     restrictions in the bill on types of properties that can \n     obtain coverage through the NFIP will undermine participation \n     in the program, further destabilizing it. The bill does \n     nothing to invest in new flood mapping and technology, which \n     would result in more accurate maps and does not sufficiently \n     invest in mitigation. We ask for your continued assistance in \n     ensuring that this bill does not become law.\n       Additionally, we want to thank you for cosponsoring H.R. \n     3285, the Sustainable, Affordable, Fair and Efficient (SAFE) \n     NFIP Act.

I was the author of \nthe last major piece with our former colleague, Doug Bereuter. I agree \nwith much of what was said on both sides.\n  There are remaining significant problems. Insurance is not priced \nproperly. It is not that it is too expensive or it is too cheap, it is \nnot priced properly. We have some winners and losers now, but too many \npeople are subsidized by the majority.\n  We are not doing all that we can.

We have \nincluded those reforms in this bill.\n  I sat down countless hours with the ranking member. She shared her \nphone number with me. She left me at the dance though, because before \nthis thing was done, she walked away. We tried to get a bipartisan \nbill. We worked on this thing together; so to say something other than \nthat is just not fair, it is not right. We have tried.\n  You might not like the end product, but we have gone a great distance \nto get a bill that everybody can agree on, and I think we are going to \nget that today.\n\n\n  I want to talk about a few things. We are $25 billion in debt, a \ndeficit of $1.5 billion a year. This program is not sustainable. We \nhave people who are building homes in harm's way. They get flooded \nmultiple times.\n  The chairman and I saw a homeowner who was flooded three times in 10 \nyears. One homeowner let his house burn because he had to go save his \nkids who were getting swept away in floodwaters, and we rebuild those \nhomes in the same location and risk the lives of firefighters and first \nresponders to go save them. This policy is unacceptable and it is not \ncompassionate.\n  I hear my friends across the aisle say: You are going to hurt \nhomeowners. Their rates are going to skyrocket.\n  What? On average, for a year, the price of flood insurance, on \naverage, will go up $20, less than $2 a month, and they are screaming \nbloody murder about that? And what do they get for it? I have a list of \n30 things of great reform we get in this bill to help homeowners.\n  Yes, highly subsidized properties in a pre-FIRM space are going to \npay a little more, a little higher escalator, but we spend a billion \ndollars on mitigation helping people flood-proof their homes, helping \npeople get bought out of their home and get to higher ground so they \ndon't have to live in a home that is continually flooded.\n  I don't know if you have lived in a flood home, but it ain't fun. It \nis horrible. Get them out. A billion dollars for that program.\n  We help communities with their mapping. We give them options to map, \nand we give them an appeals process in their mapping. Great reform, we \nset up a private market.\n  Now, you don't have to take the private market, but you have an \noption to get a private plan that might have a better rate than the \ngovernment offers you. You have a choice--a choice, God forbid--a \nchoice that gives you a better price.\n  By the way, when we get the private market in, we all float our risk \nto the private sector. When a disaster hits Texas or Florida, it is not \njust the taxpayers who bear all the burden. We have private companies \nin play. That is a great thing. This is a good bill. This is a \nbipartisan bill.

Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the \nbalance of my time.\n  Mr. Speaker, let me say to my colleagues on the opposite side of the \naisle, my chairmen, Mr. Hensarling and Mr. Duffy, we did work very hard \nto try and get a bipartisan bill.\n  As I negotiated with them, every time I reached an impasse, I thought \nabout Sandy and how hard Democrats had to work to provide support for \nan area that should have gotten the support of everyone in the Congress \nof the United States. However, there was a demand from the opposite \nside of the aisle that it had to be paid for. We worked very hard to \ngive them assistance, and they still have not been made whole.\n  Every time I reached an impasse, I thought about Louisiana and the \nwork that I had done after Katrina and the visits that I have made \nthere, the people that I got to know, and what I really have learned to \nunderstand about affordability.\n  Every time I reached an impasse, I thought about Florida, I thought \nabout Texas and what has happened recently with these storms.\n  Having worked in this way and having been a coauthor of Biggert-\nWaters and having been the author of the Homeowner Flood Insurance \nAffordability Act, I think I know something about storms, something \nabout the devastation that has been caused to families and communities, \nand I insist on affordability.\n  Mr. Speaker, as Democrats and some Republicans have made clear, this \nis a comprehensively bad bill that is harmful for families and \nbusinesses. In the wake of one of the most disastrous hurricane seasons \nin history, this bill would make flood insurance more expensive, less \navailable, and less fair for millions of Americans.\n  I have repeatedly stated that affordability is my top priority, which \nis made worse by this bill. Even with the slight revisions that the \nchairman has made, coverage would still be less available, and cherry-\npicking by the private sector would be encouraged, putting the \ngovernment on the hook for the riskiest of policies.\n  It is important to note that the biggest challenge to the National \nFlood Insurance Program is its massive debt, which the bill only \naddresses by charging hardworking Americans more for their flood \ninsurance. That is just not fair.\n  We have comprehensive support for this bill from both the private \nsector and from our nonprofits. I don't know about any consumer \norganizations that support this bill, but I do know this. I know that I \nworked very hard to talk about mitigation and how I thought it could be \na program that the locals could be involved in with the Federal \nGovernment. I know I worked very hard talking about the repetitive \noccurrences that the chairman was concerned about, but I also offered \nalternatives to what he is advocating.\n  I talked about outreach and education to them, about a buyout program \nthat they may join with and accept voluntarily. I know that I tried \neverything that I could. I listened to Members from both sides of the \naisle, and I know that we both wanted to have a comprehensive bill that \nwas bipartisan.\n  Mr. Speaker, it is unfortunate that we end up with this bad bill.

Mr. Speaker, this is the final amendment to the bill, \nwhich will not kill the bill or send it back to the committee. If \nadopted, the bill will immediately proceed to final passage, as \namended.\n  Mr. Speaker, this amendment would require the FEMA Administrator and \nthe DHS inspector general to certify that all claims for victims of \nSuperstorm Sandy are addressed before this bill takes effect.\n  Many in this Chamber should recall 5 years ago Superstorm Sandy \ncaused widespread destruction throughout New Jersey and many States in \nthe Northeast. Superstorm Sandy barreled up the East Coast, bringing \ndeath and destruction. Over 200 people in the United States and the \nCaribbean died, and the storm caused more than $71 billion in damage. \nSandy swamped coastline communities. It knocked out power for millions \nof people and businesses, flooded public transit systems, and set \nneighborhoods ablaze.\n  Many Sandy victims have begun down the long road of recovery, but 5 \nyears later, many victims and communities are still waiting for relief. \nThey are still struggling to rebuild their homes and their businesses. \nIt took years for the hardest hit communities in my district, Little \nFerry and Moonachie, to receive the relief to build key pieces of \npublic infrastructure.\n  In New Jersey, over 1,200 property owners are still moving through \nthe recovery programs. Approximately 900 are still not back in their \nhomes. Of all Sandy victims, there are over 2,000 people still awaiting \nfinal review of their flood insurance claims.\n  After victims faced delay after delay to start the claims process \nwith FEMA, they then struggled with insurance companies which were and \ncontinue to be a major source of strife for Sandy victims.\n  Many of the residents of New York and New Jersey saw insurers \nintentionally paying out too little on their claims, which in many \ncases was not enough to cover the cost of repairing the damage. We \nheard stories of insurance adjusters making significant errors on \nreports because they misunderstood technical definitions, \nunderestimated the extent of the damage done, or intentionally \nmisrepresented the cause of the damage.\n  This is all documented.\n  The problems were so significant, we had to force FEMA to reopen the \nclaims process for thousands of homeowners. Some ended up getting \nadditional money. I have heard from many who say that it is still not \nenough to cover their recovery costs.\n  Mr. Speaker, on the heels of Hurricanes Harvey and Maria, we are now \ntasked with reauthorizing the National Flood Insurance Program. To \nensure these victims do not face the same troubles as those in my \nState, we need to apply the lessons we learned from Superstorm Sandy in \nthis reauthorization. Tragically, this bill does not.\n  We should not allow companies who profited off Superstorm Sandy \nvictims while committing widespread fraud and failing to meet their \nbasic obligations under the National Flood Insurance Program to sell \ntheir own flood insurance.\n  We should not reauthorize the program without reforming the claims \nprocess to ensure technical definitions of ``earth movement,'' \n``basement,'' and ``mold damage'' do not cause delay for victims \nreceiving their fair share.\n  This bill should ensure that victims have the time they need to file \nan appeal and require FEMA to respond so victims are able to move the \nclaims process forward.\n  I submitted several amendments to the Rules Committee with my \ncolleague Representative Frank Pallone of New Jersey to address these \nissues and the lessons we learned from Sandy. We were denied a vote.\n  At the very least, Mr. Speaker, we must ensure that FEMA certifies \nthat all victims from Superstorm Sandy have had action taken on their \ncase before we make more changes to the National Flood Insurance \nProgram. That is what a vote in favor of this recommit would do. Simply \nput, it would delay the implementation of the bill until the FEMA \nAdministrator and the DHS inspector general certified that all claims \nfor Superstorm Sandy have been addressed.\n  In order to support Superstorm Sandy victims, I encourage my \ncolleagues to vote in support of this recommit, because a ``no'' vote \nis a vote against the victims of Superstorm Sandy, no doubt about it, \nwho, for 5 years have still not been made whole.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.", "turn": 65, "speaker": "Mr. PASCRELL", "itemno": 184}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "H001036", "text": "  Mr. HENSARLING.

Many of them, I hope and trust, have been \naddressed in this\n\n\nbill. It is not too late. I would urge the gentleman to look at that \ntitle IV of the bill and perhaps he would be encouraged to support it.\n  Otherwise, Mr. Speaker, I must urge rejection of the motion to \nrecommit because, as you heard from the gentleman from New Jersey, he \nsays it is all about delay. We can't delay getting people out of harm's \nway. We can't delay getting people out of neighborhoods that have \nflooded four, five, six, seven times in the last 8 years.\n  For those who can't afford flood insurance, we can't delay getting \nthem market alternatives, where, in the 2 percent of the market that \nexists today, particularly in Pennsylvania, there are people that are \nnot just saving hundreds of dollars, Mr. Speaker, but even thousands of \ndollars. We can't delay.\n  We know that this is a program that is unsustainable. It is a \nbankrupt program that is being funded, regrettably, by a bankrupt \nnation. Taxpayers are on the hook for $1.2 trillion and an annual \ndeficit of $1.5 billion of actuarial deficit a year.\n  This thing isn't just broke, Mr. Speaker, it is bailout broke. We \ncan't delay. We can't delay trying to put this back on a path of \nsustainability so the next time we have a serious storm or superstorm, \nwe want there to be funds available to actually pay claims.\n  So, no, Mr. Speaker, we cannot delay. We cannot delay, and we cannot \ncontinue to do what we have done in the past in these repetitive loss \nareas and have our hands unclean by putting people back in the exact \nsame neighborhoods that haven't just caused the loss of their property, \nbut one day may very well cost the loss of their lives. We cannot \ndelay.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge a rejection of the motion to recommit, and I \nyield back the balance of my time.", "turn": 68, "speaker": "Mr. HENSARLING", "itemno": 187}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "  The SPEAKER pro tempore.
