Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize First \nLieutenant Patrick J. McNulty, Jr., one of my constituents who, on \nFriday, November 3, received the Silver Star Medal, which is our \nNation's third highest award for heroism in combat during the Vietnam \nwar.\n  On November 7, 1967, Lieutenant McNulty was serving as an artillery \nforward observer when his unit was attacked. Lieutenant McNulty called \nin accurate fire on multiple enemy positions, while also directing \nfriendly units. Even after being seriously wounded, Lieutenant McNulty \ncontinued to fight. As the enemy began to retreat, Lieutenant McNulty \norganized the effort to provide aid to his wounded comrades. Lieutenant \nMcNulty's actions saved lives.\n  Lieutenant McNulty returned home to his wife and raised his children. \nHe purchased a home in Sellersville where he has now lived for 46 \nyears. He earned an MBA from Temple University, worked for the Ford \nMotor Company, and has been an active member of our community. His \nstory continues to inspire us all.\n  Madam Speaker, I offer to this body Patrick's personal motto, the \nsame as Navy Seabees: ``The difficult we do now, the impossible takes a \nlittle longer.''\n\n\n              Honoring the Life and Memory of Bernie Lens\n", "turn": 1, "speaker": "Mr. FITZPATRICK", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "F000466", "text": "  Mr. FITZPATRICK. Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and \nmemory of Bernie Lens, who passed away in May. In his 96 years, Bernie \nlived a life that impacted a great number of people in our community. \nToday, months after his passing, his impact is still felt.\n  In 1939, Bernie enlisted in the Army to fight the war in Europe. \nDuring his time there, serving in Patton's Third Army, he helped to \nliberate Dachau concentration camp.\n  After the war, he returned home and went about his life, rarely \ntalking about what he had seen, until one day he began to share his \nstory. He was known in our community for his talks with students in \nschools and community centers working to ensure the horrors of what he \nsaw at Dachau were not forgotten and would never happen again. People \ngravitated toward him due to his quick wit and his warm demeanor.\n  He worked closely with the Holocaust Remembrance Program of Post 697 \nof the Jewish War Veterans in Levittown, Bucks County, which continues \nhis work today.\n  Bernie found incredible purpose from a dark experience in his life, a \nlesson that we can all benefit from.\n", "turn": 2, "speaker": "Mr. FITZPATRICK", "itemno": 3}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 4}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "186", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H9188", "wkday": "Tuesday", "day": "14", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "RECOGNIZING FIRST LIEUTENANT PATRICK J.
