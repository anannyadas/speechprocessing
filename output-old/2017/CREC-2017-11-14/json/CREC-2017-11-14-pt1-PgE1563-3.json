Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate all of the \naward winners from the U.S. International Trade Commission who were \nrecognized last week, on Tuesday, November 7, 2017, at their annual \nCareer Service Awards Ceremony.\n   The employees at the U.S. International Trade Commission are on the \nfront line of enforcing our U.S. trade laws and addressing a wide \nvariety of trade-related issues. U.S. trade laws protect American \nworkers from unfair trade practices and support communities that \nmanufacture and produce the products that power our national economy \nand that are essential to supporting our national security. The \ndedicated employees at the U.S. International Trade Commission \ninvestigate allegations of unfair trade practices against countries \nfrom around the world, and their work is essential to defending good \njobs throughout our country, including steel and manufacturing jobs in \nthe First Congressional District of Indiana.\n   Last week, I was pleased to be able to attend their 2017 Career \nService Awards Ceremony, which recognized the outstanding \naccomplishments of the International Trade Commission staff from the \npast year. For example, the ceremony presented Quality Step Increase \nAwards to individuals that received a permanent increase in their rate \nof pay in recognition of high quality performance above that ordinarily \nfound. The ceremony also presented Superior Accomplishment Awards based \non an act, service, or suggestion that contributes to the efficiency or \nother improvement of government operations. I would note that under \nthis category, an award was presented to the Carbon and Alloy Steel \nCut-to-Length Plate team for providing high quality work products, \nmeeting aggressive statutory deadlines, and adroitly overcoming \nnumerous analytical challenges with a high-profile case that involved \nthe greatest number of countries for a single case in more than a \ndecade.\n   Additionally, the ceremony presented employees with Length of \nService awards, including 40 Years of Service awards for Judith M. \nBryant, Deborah A. Daniels, Jean H. Jackson, Myra D. Lay, and Deborah \nA. McNay, 45 Years of Service awards for William W. Gearhart, Jr., and \nLinda D. Powell, and a 50 Years of Service award for Tyrone F. Coward.\n   I also would like to call attention to the Distinguished Service \nAward winners, Karen Attardo, Attorney-Adviser in the Office of \nAdministrative Services, and Vu Q. Bui, Investigative Attorney in the \nOffice of Unfair Import Investigations. This award is the second-\nhighest honor that can be conferred upon an employee and recipients are \nchosen by senior management in recognition of notable contributions. \nFurther, I would like to recognize Jennifer Rohrbach, Program Manager \nin the Office of Operations, as the recipient of the Commissioners' \nAward for Exceptional Service. This is the highest honor that can be \nconferred upon an employee and recipients are chosen directly by the \nCommissioners in recognition of distinguished and exceptional service.\n   Mr. Speaker, I believe that our former colleague and my friend from \nIndiana Lee Hamilton said it best when he stated that public service \n``is not just a way of life, it is a way to live fully.'' I am \nincredibly grateful for the invaluable, diligent, and thorough work of \nall of the employees at the U.S. International Trade Commission. I \nthank all of them for choosing to have a career in the service of our \ncountry and again congratulate all of the award winners for their \nexemplary performance.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. VISCLOSKY", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 3}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "186", "extension": true, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "E1563", "wkday": "Tuesday", "day": "14", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "RECOGNIZING THE EMPLOYEES OF THE INTERNATIONAL TRADE COMMISSION", "id": "CREC-2017-11-14-pt1-PgE1563-3", "title": "RECOGNIZING THE EMPLOYEES OF THE INTERNATIONAL TRADE COMMISSION"}
