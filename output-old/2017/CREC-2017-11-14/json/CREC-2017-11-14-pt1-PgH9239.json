Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize World \nSeries Champion Josh Reddick and all of his efforts to give back to his \nhometown in the First Congressional District of Georgia.\n  Baseball fans across America know Mr. Reddick as the Houston Astros' \nright fielder. But to Rincon, Georgia, Mr. Reddick is a friend and a \nvolunteer who works to improve every corner of his community. Namely, \nhe founded the Josh Reddick Foundation with its most recent project to \nbuild an artificial turf baseball field designed specifically for \nchildren with special needs.\n  He donated $1 million for the project, which will have smooth fields \nfor wheelchairs, a dugout designed for easy access, first class stadium \nseating, a 10-foot by 36-foot scoreboard, and more. Groundbreaking for \nthe field will begin on November 18.\n  I am proud that World Series Champion Josh Reddick is from the First \nCongressional District of Georgia, but I am even more proud to see how \nthis fine young man is giving back to his community.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. CARTER of Georgia", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "186", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H9239", "wkday": "Tuesday", "day": "14", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "RECOGNIZING BASEBALL PLAYER JOSH REDDICK", "id": "CREC-2017-11-14-pt1-PgH9239", "title": "RECOGNIZING BASEBALL PLAYER JOSH REDDICK"}
