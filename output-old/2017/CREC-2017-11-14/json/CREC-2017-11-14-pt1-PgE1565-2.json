Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and legacy \nof Reverend Mary Edith Moody, a native of Baton Rouge, Louisiana, who \npassed away on October 28, 2017 at the age of 91.\n  Rev. Moody was born on July 29, 1926, in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. She \nwas one of nine siblings in a family of modest means. Her father, Mr. \nJames Nathaniel Moody Sr., was a supervisor of Negro Schools in West \nBaton Rouge and her mother was a teacher. After graduating from high \nschool at Southern University Lab School in 1943, she earned two \ndegrees from Southern University: one in business education and the \nother in secondary education. She later earned a master's degree in \neducation from Louisiana State University and a certificate of theology \nfrom the Interdenominational Theological Center in Atlanta, Georgia.\n  Rev. Moody taught English and business education to visually impaired \nchildren for more than 30 years at the Louisiana State School for the \nBlind at Southern University--and was one of five teachers named \nOutstanding Secondary Educator of America from a field of 5,000 \ncandidates--before retiring from her teaching career to become one of \nthe first female ministers for the African Methodist Episcopal Church.\n  Rev. Moody was ordained in 1976 and assigned to Black Creek AME \nChurch in Darlington that same day. During her pastoral career, she \nserved as pastor at Mount Everett AME Church in St. Helena Parish and \nHeard AME Church in Baton Rouge and eventually became an associate \npastor at Bethel AME Church on South Street.\n  Rev. Moody received numerous awards for service, commitment and \nleadership, including the Powell-Reznikoff Award from the Baton Rouge \nCouncil on Human Relations in 2001 along with the first Mid City \nCommunity Lifetime Achievement Medal in 2004 at the age of 77. Also, \nshe was a proud member of Zeta Phi Beta Sorority, Inc., for more than \n70 years.\n  Rev. Moody devoted herself to numerous Baton Rouge community \norganizations, advocating for children, African Americans, women, the \npoor, and anyone facing hardship. We cannot match the sacrifices made \nby Rev. Moody, but surely we can try to match her sense of service. We \ncannot match her courage, but we can strive to match her devotion.\n  Rev. Mary Edith Moody survivors include her sister, Ms. Martha E. \nMoody Boone; Brother, Mr. Charles David Moody, Sr.; and Sister-in-Law, \nMs. Dorothy Johnson Moody; twenty-four Nieces and Nephew; a host of \nGrand-, Great-Grand-, and Great-Great-Great-Nieces and Nephew; and a \nhost of surrogate sons and daughters.\n  Mr. Speaker, I celebrate the life and legacy of Reverend Mary Edith \nMoody a beloved daughter, sister, and grandmother as well as a true \nexample of Baton Rouge culture personified\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. RICHMOND", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 3}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "186", "extension": true, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "E1565", "wkday": "Tuesday", "day": "14", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "HONORING THE LIFE AND LEGACY OF REVEREND MARY EDITH MOODY", "id": "CREC-2017-11-14-pt1-PgE1565-2", "title": "HONORING THE LIFE AND LEGACY OF REVEREND MARY EDITH MOODY"}
