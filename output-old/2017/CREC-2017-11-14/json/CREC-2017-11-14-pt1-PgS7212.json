Mr. President, today I wish to recognize Barr-Reeve \nElementary School of Montgomery, IN, for being named a 2017 National \nBlue Ribbon School by the U.S. Department of Education.\n  Established in 1982, the National Blue Ribbon Schools Program \nrecognizes schools that have demonstrated a vision of educational \nexcellence for all students, regardless of their social or economic \nbackground. Since its inception, this program has allowed schools in \nevery State to gain recognition for educational accomplishments, \nparticularly in closing the achievement gaps among students.\n  Barr-Reeve Elementary School's history traces back to 1910 when it \nwas known as Montgomery School and had 20 students. Today Barr-Reeve \nElementary teaches students grades second to fifth and has \napproximately 290 students.\n  The school supports students academically through small class sizes. \nWhen students face academic challenges, teachers help tutor them before \nand afterschool as well as during recess.\n  Barr-Reeve Elementary utilizes innovative technology to learn about \nthe geography and culture of the world on a digital level. Students \neach benefit from having a Chromebook, enhancing their learning and \nhelping to prepare them for the technology based workplaces they will \nencounter in the future. Many teachers also utilize the nearby Naval \nSurface Warfare Center located in Crane, IN, for professional \ndevelopment and to take advantage of its lending library that enhances \nvarious STEM skills they can teach to students.\n  Barr-Reeve Elementary School's staff, students, and families work \ntogether to teach and foster values that develop strong character. Each \nmonth, a different social skill is modeled and taught throughout the \nschool. Students reinforce these positive behaviors through cards \nhanded out by the student council to recognize students' positive \ncharacter and leadership skills. The student council also instituted a \ntutoring program during the lunch recess to allow students to help \ntheir peers.\n  Barr-Reeve Elementary School is an example of how dedication, \nmotivation, collaboration, and strong family engagement in education \nbenefits both students and the local community. At Barr-Reeve, parents \nare not only involved through an active parent teacher organization, \nbut also as coaches, guest speakers, and volunteers in the classroom.\n  I am proud to recognize Barr-Reeve Elementary School principal Dena \nLangacher, the entire staff, the student body, and their families. The \neffort, dedication, and value you put into education has led not only \nto this prestigious recognition, but will benefit you and the \nMontgomery community well into the future.\n  On behalf of the citizens of Indiana, I congratulate Barr-Reeve \nElementary School, and I wish the students and staff continued success \nin the future.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. DONNELLY", "itemno": 0}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 1}], "header": {"chamber": "Senate", "num": "186", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "S7212", "wkday": "Tuesday", "day": "14", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "RECOGNIZING BARR-REEVE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL", "id": "CREC-2017-11-14-pt1-PgS7212", "title": "RECOGNIZING BARR-REEVE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL"}
