{"content": [{"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "D000563", "text": "  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, today I want to take a few moments to \nacknowledge former mayor of Evanston, IL--and my friend--Liz Tisdahl.\n  Liz began her service to Evanston in 1989 on the Evanston Township \nSchool Board. After 2 years as president of the board, Liz was \nappointed to the Evanston City Council in 2003 by Mayor Lorraine \nMorton. Mayor Morton had met Liz years earlier when she was picking up \nher youngest granddaughter from softball practice. She didn't recognize \nthe new coach and asked about her. It was Liz Tisdahl. Liz didn't have \na child on the team, but she wanted to lend a helping hand in the \ncommunity.\n  When Lorraine Morton became mayor, she always remembered how Liz \nstepped up just to help other people, so when it came time for Mayor \nMorton to decide whom she wanted to replace her, the first and only \nname that came to mind was Liz Tisdahl. When Liz was first approached \nto run, her answer was ``absolutely not,'' but after giving it more \nthought, Liz answered the call to run to help out Evanston's residents \nwho were leaving the community due to the increasingly high cost of \nliving. Liz Tisdahl wasn't running for mayor to help herself, but like \nher time coaching that softball team years earlier, she was doing it \nfor other people.\n  Early in Liz's tenure as mayor, she quickly learned what it meant to \nbe the ``face of Evanston'' and the good she could accomplish. At the \ntime, too many Evanston residents struggled to afford housing, so Liz \nwrote a Federal grant application and flew to Washington, DC, to lobby \nfor money to expand affordable housing in her community--and it worked. \nEvanston received an $18 million grant. I remember calling her with the \ngood news. Liz later said that was ``the day that I realized that there \nreally was something to this `being a mayor' thing.''\n  Liz Tisdahl also has successfully lobbied to secure a designation for \na Federal qualified health center in Evanston, resulting in the \nestablishment of the Erie Evanston/Skokie Health Center. Since 2012, \nthe Erie Evanston/Skokie Health Center has treated nearly 12,000 \npatients and provided immediate care for the residents of Evanston.\n  In 2009, when Liz Tisdahl first ran for mayor of Evanston, she \ncampaigned under a simple platform: ``Diversity, Sustainability, and \nEconomic Development.'' First, Liz set out to increase employment. She \nexpanded the Mayor's Summer Youth Employment Program, which had 167 \njobs in 2009. Since 2012, the program has grown by 100 jobs each year, \nemploying 750 young people in 2016. Liz also created partnerships with \nNorthwestern University, NorthShore University HealthSystem, and other \nbusinesses to establish job training and apprenticeship programs for \nthe community's most vulnerable people. In 2009, the unemployment rate \nof Evanston was 8 percent. When Mayor Tisdahl left office earlier this \nyear, unemployment was down to 4.1 percent.\n  Liz Tisdahl also worked to make Evanston greener and--as promised--\nbrought changes to the city's sustainability efforts. According to a \n2015 emissions report, Evanston reduced its greenhouse gas emissions by \nmore than 18 percent between 2005 and 2015. In 2014, Evanston became \none of America's first two cities to receive a four-star rating from \nthe Sustainability Tools for Assessing and Rating Communities \nInitiative. For her environmental work and focus on sustainability \nissues, Liz received the Climate Protection Award from the U.S. \nConference of Mayors.\n  Earlier this year, after two terms in office, Liz Tisdahl decided not \nto run for a third. When asked why, her answer was simple. Although she \nloved being mayor, she had accomplished her goals. Liz Tisdahl went out \non top.\n  Despite her many achievements, Liz's proudest accomplishment is her \nfamily. Now that she is retired, I know she is enjoying more time with \nher children and grandchildren, but this isn't the last we have heard \nfrom Liz Tisdahl. She will continue to be a fearless advocate for the \npeople of Evanston. Since retiring, Liz has joined the board at Curt's \nCafe, an Evanston coffee shop that trains at-risk youth, prepares them \nto become job-ready, and helps them to transition into full-time \nemployment. One thing is clear, Liz Tisdahl is not done helping the \ncommunity she loves.\n  I want to congratulate Liz Tisdahl on her distinguished career and \nthank her for her outstanding service to the people of Evanston. Now as \nshe enters the next chapter in her life, I wish her and her family all \nthe best.\n  (At the request of Mr. Schumer, the following statement was ordered \nto be printed in the Record.)\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. DURBIN", "itemno": 0}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 1}], "header": {"chamber": "Senate", "num": "186", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "S7209", "wkday": "Tuesday", "day": "14", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "TRIBUTE TO ELIZABETH ``LIZ'' TISDAHL", "id": "CREC-2017-11-14-pt1-PgS7209-2", "title": "TRIBUTE TO ELIZABETH ``LIZ'' TISDAHL"}
