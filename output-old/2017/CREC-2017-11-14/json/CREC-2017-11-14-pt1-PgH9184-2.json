Mr. Speaker, after a treacherous extended game of hide-\nand-seek, Republicans this week are rushing through this House a \nwretched tax bill. The future of this sneak attack on America depends \nupon how quickly the truth can catch up with so many lies.\n  This bill is just a way to curry favor with Washington's special \ninterests, awarding tax windfalls to large multinational corporations \nand the fortunate few who sit way up atop the economic ladder.\n  ``Don't worry,'' Republicans say. ``What middle class people lose to \npay for this unbalanced tax cut, will eventually trickle down. With a \nlittle fairy dust magically, it will appear in your pocket, and you \nwill get more than ever.''\n  This is a massive corporate tax break where the tail is wagging the \ndog of a corporate tax break. The Republican gimmick that Americans are \nbeing asked to swallow is the same experience we have had previously. \nThe middle class will not enjoy the benefits of this bill. Both history \nand arithmetic tell us that.\n  First, they are borrowing this money--much of it--to finance this tax \nbreak from the Chinese and the Saudis, and others whom we have looked \nto to pay for our immense national debt in the past.\n  Second, we know from experience that tax breaks like this do not \ncreate lasting jobs. But it is even worse than all of that because \nRepublicans are creating a special new loophole for outsourcing so many \nmore American jobs.\n  Candidate Trump, last year, made a central theme about protecting \nAmerican jobs and stopping outsourcing, but he has endorsed a tax bill \nthat does just the opposite. It creates a gaping new loophole to \nencourage greater outsourcing of our jobs and our profits abroad. Here \nis how it all works:\n  A multinational investor has a choice to make. Do I invest with new \nmanufacturing in San Antonio, or do I choose Stuttgart or Shanghai? If \nI invest in America under their proposal, it will be a 20 percent tax \non my profits; but if I invest abroad in Shanghai or in Stuttgart, the \nmost I pay is 10 cents on the dollar, and more likely, I don't pay \nanything because of the way this bill is constructed. The bill will \ncreate some new jobs, no doubt, but it is a mighty long commute to \nEurope or Asia to get one of those jobs.\n  With the help of Washington's special interests, they have rigged up \nan even more complex international tax-dodging system that pretends to \ntax foreign investment at half the U.S. rate. In\n\n\nfact, it permits many of these companies to funnel even more of their \nprofits into tax havens where their liability in America will end up \nbeing zero, and much of their profit will not be taxed anywhere, by \nanybody.\n  Whatever happened to making America great?\n  For Republicans, it is not enough to reward future tax dodging. No. \nThey want to go back and reward tax dodging from the past. And we sure \nhave had plenty of that because, for years, large multinational firms \nhave exploited these island tax havens, setting up artificial offices \nin the Bahamas or the Caymans to get their tax bill down to little or \nnothing, leaving working families and those American-oriented \nbusinesses, small businesses, large domestic-oriented businesses, to \npay the bill for our national security that they decline to pay.\n  The recent revelations of the Panama Papers and, more recently, the \nParadise Papers, have exposed how these companies use these tax laws.\n  How did the Republicans respond? By granting multinationals with \nhoards of taxes that they hold in separate accounts they call offshore \nbut sit right there on Wall Street, by letting them pay less than half \nof what they owe at a rate much lower than most middle-class families \npay. It is another Republican myth meant to convince working families \nto go along with this proposal. Many of these profits come from those \ncompanies that claim they are trapped offshore, but it is only the \nAmerican people who are trapped by this proposal.\n  Goldman Sachs, itself, has said repatriation is likely to have a \nlimited effect because repatriated earnings are already working here \nfor domestic activities. There is nothing patriotic about repatriation. \nThis is a tax bill borne by the middle class to benefit the wealthy few \nand these multinationals, to reward them for what they have been doing \nin the past, and it must be rejected.\n", "turn": 1, "speaker": "Mr. DOGGETT", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "186", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H9184-H9185", "wkday": "Tuesday", "day": "14", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "REJECT THE TAX BILL", "id": "CREC-2017-11-14-pt1-PgH9184-2", "title": "REJECT THE TAX BILL"}
