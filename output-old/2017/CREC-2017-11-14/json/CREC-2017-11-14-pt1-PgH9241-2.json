Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the \nGOP tax scam bill, H.R. 1, which, considering who it really helps, \nshould be labeled ``H.R. 1 percent.''\n  As a member of the Ways and Means Committee, I offered amendments to \nensure the middle class benefits, but Republicans rejected those \nproposals in order to give away tax cuts for corporate interests and \nthe top 1 percent. Instead, H.R. 1 percent repeals the deductions for \nState and local taxes, raising taxes on California families who already \npay more to the Federal Government than they receive back. In fact, the \naverage middle class California family who owns a home will see an \naverage tax increase of 26.4 percent, making California the hardest hit \nState in the country. It is outrageous.\n  The SALT deduction enables communities to fund important services \nthat improve our quality of life, like law enforcement, infrastructure, \nand education. But repealing it forces constituents in my State to \neither accept higher taxes or a lower standard of living, all to pay \nfor tax cuts for corporations and the wealthiest few.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the GOP tax scam.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Ms. JUDY CHU of California", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 3}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "186", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H9241", "wkday": "Tuesday", "day": "14", "month": "November"}, "related_bills": [{"type": "HR", "context": "FIRSTPARAGRAPH", "congress": "115", "number": "1"}, {"type": "HR", "context": "OTHER", "congress": "115", "number": "1"}], "doc_title": "GOP TAX SCAM BILL", "id": "CREC-2017-11-14-pt1-PgH9241-2"}
