Mr. Speaker, I rise today to discuss a wonderful \norganization within my district. There are roughly 20,000 children in \nFairfax County living at the poverty level. These children suffer both \nprivately and publicly. Privately, they may not have enough food, no \nheat or no electricity. All hardships indeed. But when that same child \nleaves the home, they suffer public indignities that can seriously \naffect their self-esteem. When they go to school wearing the same dress \nfor five straight days or shoes with holes in them, they can be targets \nof ridicule. When they cannot afford their senior dues, a sport's \nphysical or a gym uniform, they are embarrassed. When they have to sit \nhome while their friends are enjoying the prom, they experience pain. \nThese situations are especially acute when poor children are integrated \nwith wealthier children, as is often the case in Fairfax County.\n   Seven years ago this month, my constituent and friend, Ron \nFitzsimmons, formed ``Alice's Kids,'' a charity designed to give needy \nchildren the opportunity to feel a little bit more ``normal'' amongst \ntheir peers. They have built a network of approximately 500 teachers, \nschool counselors and county social workers who contact Alice's Kids \nwhen they identify a child with a ``minor'' but nonetheless important \nneed. It might be a pair of soccer cleats, glasses or summer camp fees. \nThe child might not be able to afford their senior yearbook, wishes to \ntake music lessons or needs a simple haircut. Within 24 hours, Alice's \nKids either writes a check or issues a gift card to the referrer so the \nchild can obtain the item. And the charity purposely does not interact \nwith the family as they prefer to be anonymous to help the child \nmaintain their dignity.\n   I am pleased to see that this once small charity is now expanding. \nIn addition to children in Fairfax County, they are now serving \nchildren in the City of Alexandria and in select schools in Washington, \nD.C. Even more exciting is that Mr. Fitzsimmons is carrying out his \nultimate goal, which is to serve children all across the country as \nthey are now helping children in San Antonio, Seattle, Miami, \nCharlotte, Nashville and several other cities working in conjunction \nwith the national organization ``Communities in Schools.''\n   In 2016, Alice's Kids provided assistance to 683 children. But I am \nthrilled to note that in 2017, they have already served 767 children! \nThis is the little charity that could. I want to congratulate Alice's \nKids as they continue to provide much-needed assistance to children in \nthe D.C. Metropolitan area and wish them luck in their efforts to reach \nas many children as possible.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. BEYER", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 3}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "186", "extension": true, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "E1563", "wkday": "Tuesday", "day": "14", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "HONORING ALICE'S KIDS", "id": "CREC-2017-11-14-pt1-PgE1563-2", "title": "HONORING ALICE'S KIDS"}
