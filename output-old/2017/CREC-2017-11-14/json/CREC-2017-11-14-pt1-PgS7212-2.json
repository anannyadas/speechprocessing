Mr. President, today I wish to take the opportunity \nto highlight the innovation and the creative spirit that small \nbusinesses in my home State of Idaho are known for. The small business \nthat I am honoring today goes above and beyond when it comes to \nembodying that spirit. As chairman of the Senate Committee on Small \nBusiness and Entrepreneurship, it is my pleasure to recognize \nKrehbiel's Sales & Service as the Senate Small Business of the Month \nfor November 2017. Known for their passion, friendliness, and \ndedication to providing unparalleled service, Krehbiel's is the \ndefinition of what it means to be a family-owned small business in \nAmerica.\n  Clint Krehbiel and his son Terry Krehbiel opened the doors to their \nvehicle dealership in Aberdeen, ID, in 1972 while Terry was still in \nhigh school. They have been proudly serving southeast Idaho for the \npast 45 years. The Krehbiel family specializes in off-road recreational \nand utility vehicles, along with various brands of lawn care equipment. \nIn addition to these products, they have expanded into several other \nbusinesses, ranging from swimming pools to satellite sales and \ninstallation.\n  Terry and his wife, Valerie, bought Clint's share of the business \nwhen he retired in 1996 and have made it their life's work to carry out \nthe principles of honest and ethical business that Clint passed down \nover the years. For the past four-and-a-half decades, the family's \ncommitment to their mission has been unwavering, and their loyalty to \ntheir customers is second to none. Perhaps the most incredible display \nof their dedication can be seen in the expansion of their business to \nserve customers hundreds of miles away while still maintaining a high \nlevel of customer service and a close-knit team of employees. At any \ntime, you can walk in and see Karalee Krehbiel-Bonzon, Terry and \nValerie's daughter, providing the exceptional customer service that she \nhas been known for ever since she started working at her family's \nbusiness in 2007. You will also see Valerie doing the bookkeeping by \nhand, as she has done every day since 1980. Another long-time employee \nis mechanic Charlie Wiebe. Charlie was hired in 1987 and is still with \nthe business to this day. He has been an integral part of building and \nmaintaining good relationships with customers and in training other \nmechanics like the team's newest member, Tyler Jones.\n  Customer service is not the only thing that Krehbiel's is known for. \nWith over 60 years of combined experience, their factory-trained \ntechnicians have built a reputation for high-quality, dependable \nrepairs for all manner of recreational and utility vehicles. The \ncompany's reputation in this area brings in customers from miles around \nwho have never bought a vehicle from the Krehbiels but who have built a \nbond of trust with their well-qualified mechanics.\n  Aberdeen is considered to be ``off the beaten path'' by most people. \nMany say you need to have a reason to go there. Terry and Valerie, \nalong with their employees, have given many people a reason to do just \nthat. A continuous entrepreneurial spirit, quality customer service, \nand strong relationships with long-time employees are all principles \npossessed by the Krehbiels. I would like to extend my sincerest \ncongratulations to Terry and Valerie Krehbiel and all of the employees \nof Krehbiel's Sales & Service for being selected as the November 2017 \nSmall Business of the Month. You make our great State proud, and I look \nforward to watching your continued growth and success.\n\n\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. RISCH", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 3}], "header": {"chamber": "Senate", "num": "186", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "S7212-S7213", "wkday": "Tuesday", "day": "14", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS", "id": "CREC-2017-11-14-pt1-PgS7212-2", "title": "ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS"}
