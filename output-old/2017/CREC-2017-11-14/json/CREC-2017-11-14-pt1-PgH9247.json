Mr. Speaker, it is a great honor for me to come to the \nHouse floor tonight to celebrate National Bible Week.\n  This is an opportunity, for the next hour, to celebrate the \ntremendous influence of the Bible on the freedoms we enjoy today in \nAmerica. We are truly blessed to live in a nation where we are free to \nworship and read the Holy Scriptures without fear of persecution.\n  There are many places throughout the world, unfortunately, where such \nfreedoms do not exist. Americans have the right, under our wonderful \nsystem of government, to respect and study the Bible, or any other \nsystem of belief, if they so choose, or even no belief at all. That is \nthe beauty of the American way, and I believe it is founded and goes \nback to the Bible.\n\n  In 1941, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt declared the week of \nThanksgiving to be National Bible Week. Every U.S. President since has \nfollowed this tradition by declaring this time of year to be National \nBible Week. The National Bible Association and the United States \nConference of Catholic Bishops have designated the specific days of \nNovember 12 through 18 of this year as National Bible Week.\n  This is the week set aside to recognize the Bible as a foundational \nbuilding block of Western civilization, the Judeo-Christian heritage, \nand the legacy that motivated and shaped the founding of the United \nStates. In this hour, we will hear from Members of Congress from \nvarious faith traditions and denominations speak about what the Bible \nmeans to them and what it means to the country. We are here, in keeping \nwith tradition, to recognize National Bible Week.\n  Mr. Speaker, I am just going to speak for a couple of moments about \nmy own personal experience and then turn it\n\n\nover to some Members who want to share some thoughts that I think bear \nworth listening to.\n  When I was a freshman at the University of Kansas four decades ago, \nsomeone asked me if I knew what the Bible was about. I said, yes, I \nknew what it was all about. But I realized that my answer was actually \npretty presumptuous because I had never actually read any of it.\n  Mr. Speaker, I wonder if this might be true for others who might be \nlistening tonight. The only honest thing I could do at that point was \nto read the Bible for myself. I started by reading the Gospel of John \nin the New Testament. When I read it, I discovered that I hadn't known \nat all what the Bible was about.\n  In that Gospel, Jesus says: ``I am the way, the truth and the life; \nno one comes to the Father but through me.'' And I ended up discovering \na personal relationship with Jesus Christ who became my Lord and \nSavior.\n  Mr. Speaker, this is what I know from personal experience. It is \nbetter to read the Bible for one's self and not just to take someone \nelse's word for what is in it. For me, it made all of the difference in \nthe world. My life has been totally different since then as a result.\n  As King David says in the Psalms: ``The unfolding of Your words gives \nlight; it gives understanding to the simple.''\n  As we celebrate National Bible Week, we remember the importance of \nfaith in both our private and public lives. We recognize the Bible's \npowerful message of hope. We cherish the wisdom of the Bible, and we \nthank God for providing this Holy Book that has truly been, in the \nwords of the Scripture, ``a lamp unto our feet and a light unto our \npath.''\n  Mr. Speaker, at this point, I yield to the gentlewoman from Missouri \n(Mrs. Hartzler).", "turn": 3, "speaker": "Mr. LAMBORN", "itemno": 4}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "H001053", "text": "  Mrs. HARTZLER. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman. I have a riddle \nfor everyone. What is the most dangerous book ever published? What is \nthe most powerful book ever written? What is the most cited book by \nPresidents and our Nation's Founders? What is the most prized \npossession that I own? The Bible.\n  It is a controversial book. Many people have it on their shelf at \nhome, or it gathers dust on some end table, and people think it is a \npretty innocuous book. But more people have lost their lives over this \nbook than any other book ever written.\n  Many rulers have ordered the gathering and burning of all Bibles in \nthe country, and, even today, in countries like North Korea, possession \nof a Bible results in death or sentence to a labor camp.\n  Why? Well, because it is more than a historic book, although it is; \nand it is more than a collection of wise advice and spellbounding \nstories, which it is. It has the audacity to claim something radical \nand all-inspiring at the same time. It claims to be the Word of God.\n  Now, as a result, it changes lives. The Bible reveals a plan. It \nstarts right out with these words: ``In the beginning, God made. . . \n.'' That changes everything. That sets the stage saying that we are not \nhere by chance, that there is a loving God who has a design, and we are \na part of it. It makes a difference if we have a plan. It reveals that \nplan. It also gives us a purpose.\n  Part of the Psalms in 139 says, we are ``fearfully and wonderfully \nmade'' by a loving God. We are not here by chance. And it goes on and \nsays, and this is God speaking: ``For I know the plans I have for you, \nsays the Lord, plans for good and not for evil, to give you a future \nand a hope.''\n  That is exciting.\n  The Bible also gives us power. It gives us power to overcome evil, \nhardship, and trials of life by revealing how God sent his son, Jesus, \nto introduce us to God and make a way for us to have a personal \nrelationship with the living God who made us and loves us. It is \nincredible.\n  The Bible also gives us peace and hope as a result, not just for \ntoday, but for the future. I start each day reading from my Bible, and \nI am so thankful for it. It has made a difference in my life. I want to \ninvite anyone who has never read it to read it and to discover God's \nplan and purpose for your life which will give you power and peace. So \nlet this most radical book ever written touch and bless your life.", "turn": 4, "speaker": "Mrs. HARTZLER", "itemno": 5}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "L000564", "text": "  Mr. LAMBORN.

Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 76th celebration of \nNational Bible Week. As I reflected on what I would share with everyone \ntonight, I couldn't get away from my background and my family heritage \nof being raised by Christian parents, who were raised by Christian \ngrandparents, who worked hard and believed that the instruction book \nfor life was the Word of God.\n\n  Bryon and I have chosen to raise our children in much that same way. \nIn fact, when I was telling my family--we have a group text that we \ntext in all the time with my kids, my husband and I. I was telling them \nthat it was National Bible Week. I said to them: Do you kids remember \nwhat the Junior Bible Quiz answer is? For the very first question in \nthe Junior Bible Quiz book is: What is the Bible?\n  And my middle daughter, Kennedy, who is 20 years old, immediately \ntexted back, and she said: The Bible is the inspired Word of God and is \nHis revelation to all people of Himself and His plan for salvation. I \nsaid: Good job, Kenners.\n  You see, because we--my grandparents grew up going to church and \nbecame very frustrated that it was religious; that it wasn't a personal \nrelationship with the Lord. In fact, so much so, that they decided that \nthey would plant their own church. It is the church that I go to today, \nthat our entire family goes to today. But for a year, they held Bible \nstudies in homes seeking God's will for their lives and what it meant \nto have a personal relationship with Him and to spread it to their \ncommunity.\n  They were very poor, but they knew that everything in their life, \ntheir success, and their family's hope and future relied on the Lord's \nwill and them being obedient to it.\n  Mr. Speaker, I grew up as a young girl coming downstairs in the \nmiddle of the night for a drink of water to find my dad on his knees \nreading his Bible in the middle of the living room. He had a bad back. \nHe worked hard. He was always in pain, and whenever he had a difficult \ntime on the farm or couldn't sleep because of the pain that was in his \nbody, the first thing he would do would be to read his Bible.\n  Oftentimes, we didn't realize how much time he really did spend \nworshipping God, and reading His words to find comfort and release \nthrough some of the difficult times that he had gone through.\n  I remember being 13 years old and being very insecure. In fact, my \nmom said she worried about me. She wondered if I was going to be a \nyoung girl who would grow up proud. I didn't have many friends. I \ndidn't think I was attractive. I didn't think I had any gifts. She sat \nme down at the kitchen table, and she read to me Scriptures out of the \nBible that told me how God saw me; that God saw me above and not \nbeneath; that He saw me as someone who had plans for me from the time I \nwas in the womb. And you know what? I bought it. I completely changed \nmy attitude and my perspective of myself that day because of God's Word \nthat was spoken over me by my mother.\n  So we as a family, from the time I was little, went to church Sunday \nmornings. We went Sunday nights. We went Wednesday evenings.\n\n\n  We knew that if the doors were open on church, we were to be there, \nand we were to be meditating on God's Words in our lives. That is how \nBryon and I have chosen to raise our kids as well. We put them in \nJunior Bible Quiz because we wanted God's Word hidden in their heart. I \nam thankful that today they still have God's Word hidden in their \nheart.\n  Mr. Speaker, Jesus tells us in Matthew 7: ``Anyone who listens to My \nteaching and follows it is wise, like a person who builds a house on \nsolid rock. Though the rain comes in torrents and the floodwaters rise \nand the winds beat against that house, it won't collapse because it was \nbuilt on bedrock.''\n  How often does it feel like we are stuck in that storm, as though the\n\n\nfloodwaters are rising around us and around people of faith, as though \nthe winds are beating on our door?\n  It is during these times that we must lean on our foundation, the \nBible, our instruction book.\n  It is in that Bible that God reveals how He would like to use us as \ninstruments of faith and as defenders of freedom that show Christ's \nlove and compassion to our community, Nation, and world. Allowing Him \nto guide us through His Word is the surest way to navigate any storm.\n  But so many times, people try to navigate our policy debates in this \nChamber by fighting to change one another's minds. Mr. Speaker, I am \nconvinced what we ought to be doing is seeking God to change their \nhearts, gearing their hearts toward Him. I recognize that that takes \ntrust, and it takes faith, but that is what we are directed to do.\n  It is written in Proverbs: ``Trust in the Lord with all your heart \nand lean not on your own understanding. In all your ways acknowledge \nHim, and He will make your paths straight.''\n  Mr. Speaker, I pray that we are being servants for God's good, that \nwe allow Him to light our path, and that we humble ourselves enough to \nbuild our house on His firm Biblical foundation. In this way, whatever \nwe do, we do it to the glory of God.", "turn": 6, "speaker": "Mrs. NOEM", "itemno": 7}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "L000564", "text": "  Mr. LAMBORN.

One of the first acts of Congress during the \ntumultuous beginning of our Nation was the authorization of an \nAmerican-published Bible. The war with the British had cut off the \nsupply of any Bibles from England.\n  Our Founding Fathers understood how important it was for the American \npeople to have Bibles, so, in 1782, Congress reviewed, approved, and \nauthorized the first known English language Bible to be printed in \nAmerica.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Johnson).", "turn": 7, "speaker": "Mr. LAMBORN", "itemno": 8}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "J000299", "text": "  Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Mr. Speaker, I am grateful to my friend and \ncolleague, Congressman Doug Lamborn, for organizing this Special Order \nseries in recognition of the 76th anniversary of National Bible Week.\n  I am delighted to stand with these other Members today to share our \nperspectives on why the Bible is so important to us and to our country. \nAs we approach the Thanksgiving holiday, there is really no better time \nto present these reflections.\n  I wanted to share the preface to a historic text that I have in my \ncollection. What I am holding here is a copy of the New Testament Bible \nstudy course that was approved by and published for the public schools \nof Dallas, Texas, by its board of education in September of 1946. The \npreface was written by Henry Van Dyke, and it is a wonderful summary of \nwhat the Bible means to us and to the world.\n  Mr. Speaker, let me read to you what it says here in the text:\n\n       Born in the East and clothed in that form and imagery, the \n     Bible walks the ways of the world with familiar feet and \n     enters land after land to find its own everywhere. It has \n     learned to speak in hundreds of languages to the hearts of \n     men. It comes into the palace to tell the monarch that he is \n     a servant of the Most High and into the cottage to assure the \n     peasant that He is a son of God. Children listen to its \n     stories with wonder and delight, and wise men ponder them as \n     parables of life. It has a word of peace for the time of \n     peril, a word of comfort for the time of calamity, a word of \n     light for the hour of darkness. Its oracles are repeated in \n     the assembly of the people, and its counsels whispered in the \n     ear of the lonely. The wicked and the proud tremble at its \n     warnings, but to the wounded and the penitent, it has a \n     mother's voice. The wilderness and the solitary place have \n     been made glad by it, and the fire on the hearth has lit the \n     reading of its well-worn pages. It has woven itself into our \n     dearest dreams so that love, friendship, sympathy, devotion, \n     memory, and hope put on the beautiful garments of its \n     treasured speech, breathing of frankincense and myrrh. No man \n     is poor or desolate who has this treasure for his own. When \n     the landscape darkens and the trembling pilgrim comes to the \n     valley named of the shadow, he is not afraid to enter. He \n     takes the rod and the staff of Scripture in his hand. He says \n     to friend and comrade: Good-Bye; we shall meet again. And \n     comforted by that support, he goes toward the lonely pass as \n     one who walks through the darkness into light.\n\n  Mr. Speaker, I love those words. I also love the words that are \ninscribed above the Speaker, where it says in the marble: In God We \nTrust.\n  There is a reason for that. Our Founders understood that this is our \nfoundation. George Washington, the father of our country, famously said \nin his Farewell Address: ``Of all the dispositions and habits which \nlead to political prosperity, religion and morality are indispensable \nsupports.''\n  Adams was our second President. He comes next. He said: ``Our \nConstitution is made only for a moral and religious people. It is \nwholly inadequate for the government of any other.''\n  We have to remember these truths. I close with the words of ``The \nGipper.'' Ronald Reagan said it more recently: ``If we ever forget that \nwe are one nation under God, we will be a nation gone under.''\n\n  I am so grateful for National Bible Week. I am so grateful to my \nfriends and colleagues here for our recognition of this great truth, \nwhat it means to our country, and what it means to each of us.", "turn": 8, "speaker": "Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana", "itemno": 9}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "L000564", "text": "  Mr. LAMBORN.

Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend and colleague from \nColorado for yielding.\n  Mr. Speaker, I appreciate so much tonight the opportunity to speak \nhere during Special Orders. We could talk about the principles of \ncharity from the Scriptures. We could talk from the Scriptures on \nprinciples of science. We could talk on principles of education. We \ncould even talk about the principles of taxation and be very up to date \nas we deal with that here.\n  But tonight, as we discuss the issues of the Bible in this National \nBible Week, I want to go back to my earliest days in my childhood home. \nI thank God that I had a mother and a father who would speak to me \nabout God's Word, from God's Word, and impart God's Word in my life \neven when I didn't want it or didn't understand it.\n  I remember from my earliest days being taught to memorize Psalm \n119:11, where it says: ``Thy Word I have treasured in my heart. That I \nmight not sin against Thee.''\n  As a young man, the thoughts of sin in some cases were enticing, but \nI am glad that I had the opportunity to put the Scriptures in my life \nbecause ultimately, through the course of time, it truly did change my \nlife.\n  It brought me to the Book of Romans, where in Romans, the third \nchapter verse 23 said: ``For all have sinned and fallen short of the \nglory of God.''\n  With that verse in the Psalm, my mother would say: Tim, this book \nwill keep you from sin, or sin will keep you from this book.\n  I found the truth in both of those statements. What I found there in \nRomans 3:23, that we have all sinned, I identified with that. But it \ndidn't end there because I went over a few pages to Romans 5:8, where \nit said: ``But God demonstrated His own love toward us, in that while \nwe were yet sinners, Christ died for us.''\n  Those are words of Scripture. The Bible impacted my life. As a young \nman, ultimately, I had to ask: Is that true?\n\n\n  I am so thankful that ultimately I admitted the truth, and I came to \nRomans again, chapter 10:13, where it says: ``For whosoever will call \non the name of the Lord will be saved.''\n  My good friend from Colorado indicated how that changed his life. It \nchanged my life as well, admitting personally that I was a sinner in \nneed of a savior. The Bible said so. It changed my life.\n  Now, some might reject this. That is okay. But most who seek the \ntruth of the Bible are not disappointed. It truly changes lives. \nAdmittedly, I am not perfect--and my colleagues could identify with \nthat--but I am forgiven. I am forgiven, and every day I have a purpose \nbeyond myself to live in a way that makes a difference because of not \nwho I am, but who this book and my savior has made me be.\n  So I will end with this, Mr. Speaker, in my namesake, 2 Timothy 2:15, \nit says to me specifically: Study to show thyself approved unto God, a \nworkman that doesn't need to be ashamed, accurately handling the word \nof truth.\n  At the end of each day, Mr. Speaker, because of this passage, I ask, \nfirst of all: Is God pleased?\n  Secondly, has the work been done well?\n  Thirdly, has the word--the truth--been used well in my life?\n  If I can answer in the affirmative to each of those based upon the \nBible, I know for whatever reason my God has been served well, and I \nhave done the work well.\n  Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Colorado for leading this \nSpecial Order tonight talking about something so significant as the \nBible, and I pray that it imparts wisdom to all we do here.", "turn": 10, "speaker": "Mr. WALBERG", "itemno": 11}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "L000564", "text": "  Mr. LAMBORN.

Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman holding this \nhour tonight.\n  In September of this year, we celebrated the 230th birthday of our \nConstitution, a document that has provided for the governance of this \ngreat people for 230 years.\n  The history behind that was that the States in 1787 decided that the \nArticles of Confederation were not properly forming a nation that could \nprotect itself properly. So they sent really smart men to Philadelphia \nto fine-tune--or tweak--the Articles of Confederation.\n  James Madison and others had a different idea. They locked the doors, \nthey went into closed session, and they came forth with a Constitution \nthat we have lived under for the next 230 years.\n\n  Benjamin Franklin, who was the oldest Framer, emerged from that \nexperience and was asked by a woman, whom we think was named Mrs. \nPowell. She said: Good Doctor, what have you given us, a monarchy or a \nrepublic?\n  He looked her in the eye and said: ``Madam, a republic, if you can \nkeep it.''\n  That is a daunting phrase, Mr. Speaker, and it is one that carries \nforward now for 230 years. It never ends. It is not a one-and-done \ncircumstance.\n  So the question arises: How, in fact, do we keep a republic?\n  Mr. Speaker, only a free, self-governing people can keep a republic. \nAs was previously quoted by my colleague from Louisiana, John Adams \nwrote that only a moral and religious people can self-govern.\n  Mr. Speaker, as I look at our Nation today, I am deeply concerned \nthat we are losing that moral high ground to be able to maintain the \nmoral authority, in fact, to self-govern. We each say the Pledge of \nAllegiance often. There is a line in that pledge that says, ``One \nnation under God,'' with no comma.\n  Mr. Speaker, think about that juxtaposition, ``One nation under \nGod.''\n  What does God see when He sees our Nation today? What does He see in \nAmerica that can, in fact, please Him?\n  He sees a nation that has come to accept the killing of 57 million \nbabies in the last 44 years. He has seen a nation whose family units \nare breaking up and the impact it has on the moral guidance of \nchildren. He has seen a coarsening of our society, a language that is \nunsuitable, a filthiness and commonness that, quite frankly, offends \nHim at every level.\n  Mr. Speaker, you and others listening to me tonight, I think, have \ntheir own list of things that God looks at and cannot and simply will \nnot bless.\n  How do we turn that around? How do we reclaim that moral high ground?\n  I am going to argue, Mr. Speaker, that that is an individual job. I \ndon't think any of us would argue that we can legislate this work, \nbecause this is a work of each of our hearts.\n  Mr. Speaker, I think you reclaim this moral high ground by living a \nmoral code. I live the Judeo-Christian model. Jesus Christ is my \npersonal savior. I try to live his tenets every single day. Some days I \nam better at it than others. Each of those days, I am simply a sinner \nsaved by grace. That grace of God has provided the story of that, and \nhow that works is provided for us in the Bible that we celebrate \ntonight.\n  Mr. Speaker, each one of us has to live a code that, in fact, can \ncreate moral and religious people. Each of us in this body take an oath \nevery 2 years--those of us who are fortunate to get reelected--to \ndefend and protect the Constitution against all enemies foreign and \ndomestic.\n  We have got good men and women in uniform tonight who are putting \ntheir lives between us and some really bad guys as a result of that \noath of office.\n  I'm going to ask each of my colleagues here tonight to think about \nwhat they are willing to put on the line to protect and defend the \nConstitution, to help create that moral fiber, and to reclaim that \nmoral high ground that will, in fact, allow us to continue self-\ngovernance and, by extension, protect this Republic.\n  That used to be the easy thing to do, Mr. Speaker, but the voices \nagainst us, the voices of intolerance are growing louder and louder \nevery single day. It will come at a risk to stand up for those Biblical \ntruths on which this country was founded and which have sustained her \nfor some 230 years.\n\n\n  Are you and I, in fact, willing to take those risks, take the risk of \nbeing ostracized, being ridiculed, being made fun of because we stand \nup for the truths that all of us know built and sustained this country?\n  I certainly hope we are because we have got young men and women in \nuniform who put their lives on the line, and I am going to ask you to \nput your reputation and mine on the line to help create and maintain \nthis Republic.\n  As Benjamin Franklin said: ``A Republic, if you can keep it.''

President Reagan chose to have \nhis Bible open to II Chronicles 7:14, ``If my people, which are called \nby my name, shall humble themselves, and pray, and seek my face. . . . \n''\n  With the Bible as our guiding compass, these leaders chose to serve \ntheir fellow Americans with humility and strength.\n  As we honor National Bible Week, I hope that individuals across this \ncountry, regardless of their faith background, will take a moment to \nreflect on the gift of religious liberty and their role to serve others \naround them.

Mr. Speaker, I am going to mention something about \nfulfilled prophesy. This is one of the reasons why we can believe in \nand trust the Bible.\n  People come here to Congress with all different kinds of backgrounds, \nincluding pastors. This diversity of background adds a valuable thread \nof experience and thought that helps us all.\n  One reason many people respect the Bible is that so many prophesies \nfor telling future events have come true exactly as foretold. In the \nOld Testament, there are many predictions that were given to prove \nthat, if a speaker were divinely inspired, those things that he \npredicted would come true; it would validate the words of that prophet.\n  The Book of Daniel, for instance, contains scores of detailed \nprophesies that were literally fulfilled. Skeptics have fallen back to \nthe position that Daniel must have been written after the fact and is, \ntherefore, not being honest.\n  In fact, the Book of Daniel is found in its entirety in the Greek's \nSeptuagint and partially in the Dead Sea Scrolls, both of which we know \npredated the events that were prophesied. That means that the critics \nof the dating of the Book of Daniel are the ones who are not being \nhonest.\n  The rise and fall of empires, the capture and destruction of cities, \nthe destiny of kings all were prophesied in minute detail. Archeology \nand history have literally confirmed hundreds of such prophesies as \nhaving come true.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr. LaMalfa).", "turn": 15, "speaker": "Mr. LAMBORN", "itemno": 16}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "L000578", "text": "  Mr. LaMALFA. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from Colorado (Mr. \nLamborn) for leading this Special Order tonight on National Bible Week.\n  Last night, several of us had the privilege to attend a preview of \nthe national Museum of the Bible. It was very impressive. I would urge \neverybody watching tonight and who hears about it to tour it when you \nget the chance here in Washington, D.C.\n  One of the things that struck me very early on in that tour was a \nbanner hanging inside the museum that says: ``The law of the Lord is \nperfect, refreshing to the soul. The decree of the Lord is trustworthy, \ngiving wisdom to the simple''--Psalm 19:8.\n  That also applies to the Bible itself, the inherent and infallible \nWord of God.\n  Jesus himself used Scripture that was written before him. Jesus never \nbelittled the Scripture, as some modern critics do, or set it aside, \nnor did he criticize it; although he criticized those who misused it or \ncontradicted it, although he rejected many interpretations of it.\n  When we hear the Son of God's quotes to Scriptures, we need no \nfurther testimony. He believed every word of Scripture. All the \nprophesies concerning Himself were fulfilled, as my colleague, Mr. \nLamborn, said.\n\n  Time and time and time again, the timelines prove the Word of God's \nprophesy. Matthew 19:4 and 19:5 were one of those that Jesus spoke of, \ndocumented in the New Testament, accounts by those over there with \nJesus at the time.\n  We know Moses wrote the Pentateuch, Jonah wrote Jonah, Daniel wrote \nDaniel. Jesus attests to that. He believed the Old Testament was spoken \nby God, Himself, written by the Holy Spirit's inspiration, even though \nthe pen was held by men. That is an important point for those who ask: \nHow can the Bible be real, since it was written down by men?\n  The committed task of all writing of the Word of God, though they \nwere fallible men, were guided by the infallible Holy Spirit. That is a \nfaith we have and hold.\n  It does take some faith, yes, just as it takes faith for me to get on \nthat airliner and fly back East each week. But the faith in the Bible \nis much stronger. It has never been proven wrong. All the prophesies \nthat were made that have occurred already have been proven true.\n  The Founders thought it was a key element in the founding of this \nNation, obviously. Right in this room, behind the Speaker's dais, is \nthe inscription: ``In God We Trust.'' Facing me right now is the only \nforward-facing image in here of Moses looking over this House of \nRepresentatives.\n  Lastly, I would leave with this. As you watch the machinations of the \nMembers of Congress, I think one of the most important guidelines we \nwould have I find in Proverbs 4:25 through 4:27: we uphold the honor \nnot only of this institution and our families, but those who walk with \nGod, that walk with Jesus.\n  In Proverbs, you see: ``Let your eyes look straight ahead. Fix your \ngaze directly before you. Keep straight the passage for your feet and \nbe steadfast in all your ways. Do not turn to the right or the left. \nKeep your feet from evil.''\n  That is what the Bible inspires. As I read it on the plane coming \nback and forth and read it at home or at my bedside, this is what true \nfaith is all about, proven time and time again.\n  I urge everybody not just to have the Bible at your home. The \nstatistics are that every home has 2.2 Bibles, on average. It isn't \nthat there aren't enough Bibles. It is that people don't open it often \nenough.", "turn": 16, "speaker": "Mr. LaMALFA", "itemno": 17}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "L000564", "text": "  Mr. LAMBORN. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from California (Mr. \nLaMalfa) for his sincere words.\n  When National Bible Week was started in 1941, even though that has \nonly been 76 years, the Bible itself has been celebrated by Americans \nsince the beginning of our country--in fact, before we were a country.\n  Our Presidents have been very vocal in their acknowledgment of the \nBible and the DNA of who we are as Americans. Several have been quoted.\n  Listen to what Civil War hero Ulysses Grant gave as advice to Sunday \nschool children: ``Hold fast to the Bible as the sheet anchor of your \nliberties; write its precepts on your hearts and practice them in your \nlives. To the influence of this book we are indebted for the progress \nmade in true civilization, and to this we must look as our guide in the \nfuture.''\n  Then he finished with this quote from the Bible: ``Righteousness \nexalteth a nation, but sin is a reproach to any people.''\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Allen).", "turn": 17, "speaker": "Mr. LAMBORN", "itemno": 18}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "A000372", "text": "  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise with great privilege to celebrate \nNational Bible Week.\n  As stated, it has been 76 years since President Franklin Roosevelt \ndeclared this National Bible Week. I thank Congressman Lamborn for \nrecognizing the importance of honoring God's Word here tonight.\n  Just 16 short years ago, I learned the most valuable lesson of my \nlife. I realized I had to change my priorities. Part of that change was \nto put God first. A big part of that commitment was the reading and \nstudying of His Word through prayer and meditation. It is easy to say, \nbut difficult to do.\n  I had come to a point in my life where I made a covenant with God on \nmy knees, which reminds me of God's instruction to Joshua 1:8, ``This \nbook of laws shall not depart from your lips, but you shall meditate on \nit day and night so that you may be careful to do according to all that \nis written in it; for then, you will make your way prosperous, and then \nyou will have true success.''\n  I learned to gradually believe all the wonderful promises God made \nthrough His Word, and he credited to me His righteousness, just as He \ndid our spiritual father Abraham in Genesis 15:6, ``I learned it was \nnot my will be done, but His will be done.''\n  I learned what Jesus Christ had done for me and the entire world and \nhow he leads me in all my endeavors and has called me to places I never \nimagined I would go. One of those is right here.\n  Years ago, I could never have imagined myself here tonight, speaking \non\n\n\nthis floor in the United States House of Representatives, representing \nthe great people of Georgia's 12th District. But here I am, by the \ngrace of God.\n  In this endeavor, I meditate often, and as said in Philippians 2: \n``Do nothing out of selfish ambition or vain conceit, but in humility \nconsider others more important than yourself. Each of you should look \nnot only to your own interests, but look to the interests of others.''\n  At a time when many Americans are increasingly divided, I often \nremind myself and those around me to have faith in Him and to remember \nthe Judeo-Christian values our Nation was founded on.\n  The Bible's influence on or founding documents can still be seen here \ntoday and was mentioned tonight. Again, when the Constitutional \nConvention reached an impasse, Ben Franklin asked clergymen to come in \nand pray and read the Scriptures. They united around the greatest \nconstitutional document created in the history of mankind.\n  Americans are looking to Congress to come together to find solutions \nfor rising healthcare costs, a simpler, fairer Tax Code, and let's get \nour good folks back to work again. It is time to put the American \npeople's interests above political will.\n\n  The division in this Nation is real. They are evident right here in \nthis body. How could our behavior ever show the world to believe that \nGod sent His Son to save the world?\n  This is when we should look to God's provision. The truth can always \nbe found through faith in him. Jesus summed it up when he prayed for us \nin John 17:21: ``That all of them may be one, Father, just as You are \nin me and I am in You. May they also be in us so that the world may \nbelieve that You sent me.''\n  My inspiration is found in Psalms 51:10-12, David's Prayer: ``Create \nin me a pure heart, O God, and renew a steadfast spirit within me. Do \nnot cast me from your presence or take your Holy Spirit from me. \nRestore to me the joy of Your salvation and grant me a willing spirit \nto sustain me.''\n  As we enter the Christmas season, one of the most important seasons \nof the year, we all must remember to keep His Word close and let it \nlead us in all that we do.\n  I am grateful that we have a President who actually wishes a merry \nChristmas as we all celebrate the birth of the Savior of the world.\n  God bless.\n\n", "turn": 18, "speaker": "Mr. ALLEN", "itemno": 19}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "L000564", "text": "  Mr. LAMBORN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Georgia for \nbeing here tonight and for those thought-provoking and very well-\nintended words.\n  As our next speaker comes to the podium, let me mention the issue of \narchaeology. Archaeology is one of the reasons why we can have trust in \nthat what the Bible says is true. There are many archaeological \ndiscoveries which have validated Biblical accounts, giving \ntrustworthiness to the Bible that we acknowledge and commemorate during \nthis National Bible Week.\n  Time and time again, archaeology has shown that Biblical \npersonalities, locations, and events actually existed in time and \nspace. Claims by critics that a Biblical statement was simply made up \nhave been debunked by later archaeological studies more times than we \ncan say.\n  Jewish archaeologist Nelson Glueck has said: ``It may be stated \ncategorically that no archaeological discovery has ever controverted or \ncontradicted a Biblical reference.''\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. \nRouzer).", "turn": 19, "speaker": "Mr. LAMBORN", "itemno": 20}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "R000603", "text": "  Mr. ROUZER. Mr. Speaker, I greatly appreciate my colleague from \nColorado for leading this Special Order on the Bible, its importance to \neach of us, and its influence on our constitutional Republic.\n  Our Founding Fathers understood that Biblical values were the basis \nfor our Republic and that this country would be slowly destroyed if the \npeople's knowledge and adherence to those values were ever lost.\n  In reference to this danger, John Adams wrote: ``Democracy will soon \ndegenerate into an anarchy, such an anarchy that every man will do what \nis right in his own eyes, and no man's life or property or reputation \nor liberty will be secure, and every one of these would soon mold \nitself into a system of subordination of all the moral virtues and \nintellectual abilities, all the powers of wealth, beauty, wit, and \nscience, to the wanton pleasures, the capricious will, and abominable \ncruelty of one or a very few.''\n  In a simpler language, that means ``tyranny.''\n  When Alexis de Tocqueville visited the United States early in the \n19th century, he wrote in ``Democracy in America'' that our Nation's \n``religious atmosphere was the first thing that struck me on arrival in \nthe United States.'' He believed that adherence to the virtuous \nstandards was indispensable for the preservation of liberty.\n  Mr. Speaker, he was correct in this assessment. This brings me to one \nof my own favorite passages in the Bible: the Apostle Paul writing to \nTimothy, in 2 Timothy 3:16 through 2 Timothy 4:5. And I might add that \nI find this passage to be more and more relevant to our times with each \nand every passing day.\n  It reads: ``All Scripture is inspired by God and profitable for \nteaching, for rebuke, for correction, for training in righteousness; so \nthat the man of God may be adequate, equipped for every good work.\n  ``I solemnly charge you in the presence of God and of Christ Jesus, \nwho is to judge the living and the dead, and by His appearing and His \nkingdom: preach the Word, be ready in season and out of season, \nreprove, rebuke, exhort, with great patience and instruction.\n  ``For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine; \nbut wanting to have their ears tickled, they will accumulate for \nthemselves teachers in accordance to their own desires and will turn \naway their ears and will turn aside to myths.\n  ``But you, be sober in all things, endure hardship, do the work of \nthe evangelist, and fulfill your ministry.''", "turn": 20, "speaker": "Mr. ROUZER", "itemno": 21}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "L000564", "text": "  Mr. LAMBORN.

And we have been \nhearing America speak tonight, so I think that is very special.\n  Now, there are some who would prefer to gloss over the vital role \nthat the Bible has had in the founding of our Nation and the \nimplementation of this unique form of government, but none of our \nFounding Fathers were perfect. Indeed, there are times in our Nation's \nhistory when Biblical principles were not acted upon.\n  Yet, listen to what President Harry Truman said during his address to \nthe Attorney General's conference on law enforcement problems: ``The \nfundamental basis of this Nation's law was given to Moses on the Mount. \nThe fundamental basis of our Bill of Rights comes from the teachings \nwhich we get from Exodus and St. Matthew, from Isaiah and St. Paul.

Mr. Speaker, this past Sunday was the International Day of \nthe Bible, and this week we are celebrating the National Bible Week \nacross the United States.\n  It is very fitting that we take time today on the floor of the \nPeople's House to draw our nation's attention to the Bible. In his book\n\n\nReading the Bible with the Founding Fathers, Dr. Daniel Dreisbach \nreminds us of the influential role the Bible served in the lives, \nthoughts and ideas of our nation's Founding Fathers.\n  The Bible was the most accessible book to our Founding Fathers and \ngave them insights on human nature, civic virtue, political authority, \nand the rights and duties of citizens that informed them as they \nformulated established the structures of government.\n  On a more personal level, I believe that the Bible is not simply an \ninspirational book or a comforting book--although it is that. But, I \nbelieve the Bible to be the holy word of God. It tells us the story of \nGod's love for us. It is a story of redemption for those who would put \ntheir faith and trust in Christ alone.\n  John 3:16 tells us that ``God so loved the world that he gave his \nonly begotten son, that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, \nbut have everlasting life.''\n  For me, as a follower of Jesus Christ, this is not only comforting \nand inspiring but it is True and the Bible is a guide for my life.\n  Each day--and the older I get--I am reminded of the comforting Truth \nin Job Chapter 19. Written centuries before the birth, crucifixion and \nresurrection of Jesus, we were told of our redeemer. The one who would \nsave us.\n\n     For I know that my Redeemer lives,\n     And He shall stand at last on the earth;\n     And after my skin is destroyed, this I know,\n     That in my flesh I shall see God,\n     Whom I shall see for myself,\n     And my eyes shall behold, and not another.\n     How my heart yearns within me!\n       Job 19:25-27\n\n  This promise reminds me of the Lord's love for me--no matter what the \ncircumstances of life.\n  Maybe it's been a while since you poured over the pages of the Bible. \nMaybe it's been collecting dust on a shelf. Take it down and read once \nagain the truthful and comforting words of God preserved for us and \ngiven to us as a gift.\n  I thank my colleagues for reserving this time for me to join you in \nsharing what the Bible means to me and hundreds of millions of others \nacross the world.\n", "turn": 22, "speaker": "Mr. BABIN", "itemno": 23}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 24}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "186", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H9247-H9253", "wkday": "Tuesday", "day": "14", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "CELEBRATING NATIONAL BIBLE WEEK", "id": "CREC-2017-11-14-pt1-PgH9247", "title": "CELEBRATING NATIONAL BIBLE WEEK"}
