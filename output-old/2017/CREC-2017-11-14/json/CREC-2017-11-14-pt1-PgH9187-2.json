Madam Speaker, it is always an honor to speak \nhere in the well of the House of the Congress of the United States of \nAmerica. I do want to compliment you, Madam Speaker. I heard your \nstatements earlier, and I would like to associate myself with the \nportion of your statement that dealt with transgender persons.\n  Madam Speaker, I stand before the world today with an impeachment \nupdate. I have previously indicated that\n\n\nthere will be a vote on an impeachment resolution before Christmas. I \nstand by this. To this end, I will be meeting with appropriate members \nof House leadership this week to discuss the notification process. I \nwant people to understand how this process works.\n  I will have the opportunity to read the Articles of Impeachment from \nthe well of the House. After this is done, there will be a time set for \nme to present them again before the House. It must be done twice. When \nthat time is set, I will have to be notified of the time. I don't set \nthe time. I have to respond at the appropriate time. For me to respond \nat the appropriate time, appropriate notice has to be given to me.\n  This is why I will be meeting with House leadership so that we can \ndiscuss the means by which appropriate notice will be given to me. We \nwant to make sure there is no confusion about this process and no \nconfusion as to how the notice is to be accorded to me.\n  I will meet with leadership to ascertain how the appropriate notice \nwill be accorded to me so that I may present the Articles of \nImpeachment a second time so that, thereafter, there will be a vote on \nthese Articles of Impeachment.\n  Because the system is such that it can be difficult to understand how \npeople have actually voted, I want you to know that those who vote with \nme and those who are supportive of advancing the cause of impeachment, \nI will be proud to announce who they are, and I will give Members \nfurther updates as to how this will take place.\n  But I want to assure every American that this vote on Articles of \nImpeachment will take place before Christmas, and that this vote will \nbe about the incitement of hate, about how the country is being pushed \nback, and how America is better than the direction that someone seeks \nto push us forward into.\n  This is a great country, and we cannot tolerate hate. This may be one \nof the few times in the history of the country that persons will be \ngiven the opportunity to take a stand against hate by casting the \nappropriate vote in the Congress of the United States of America.\n  I will give future updates on impeachment from this podium. I am \nalways honored to stand in the well of the United States House of \nRepresentatives.\n", "turn": 1, "speaker": "Mr. AL GREEN of Texas", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "186", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H9187-H9188", "wkday": "Tuesday", "day": "14", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "IMPEACHMENT PROCESS UPDATE", "id": "CREC-2017-11-14-pt1-PgH9187-2", "title": "IMPEACHMENT PROCESS UPDATE"}
