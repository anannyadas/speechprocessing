Mr. Speaker, I rise to pay tribute to Debbie Williams of \nMonroe County, Kentucky for her philanthropy in the revitalization of \ndowntown Tompkinsville and her entrepreneurial achievement in \nattracting new private investment into the Tompkinsville/Monroe County \narea.\n   Debbie Williams' first experience in business in Tompkinsville was \nwith Page Brothers--her parents' clothing store located on Main Street \nwhich operated next door to my father's dental office until 1979.\n   Like most of rural America, the 1980's and 1990's saw a massive \nexodus from downtown retail and office storefronts. Most rural Kentucky \ndowntown areas were filled with vacant, aging buildings badly in need \nof repair.\n   Around 2010, Debbie Williams took her entrepreneurial success as co-\nowner of Bluegrass Dairy and made it her passion to purchase many of \nthe depressed, vacant downtown Tompkinsville storefronts and renovate \nthem. She purchased the building where Page Brothers was located and \nopened Family Circle Clothing Store. Mrs. Williams also opened and \noperates Brass Bell in downtown--a home furnishing store.\n   In two other buildings purchased by Debbie Williams, she has \npartnered with young entrepreneurs to provide funding for The Flower \nCart and Moments in Monroe which are two new start up businesses.\n   In addition to her downtown Tompkinsville investments, Debbie \nWilliams also owns Spinout Body Shop and Monroe County's only motel--\nThe Tompkinsville Inn.\n   Despite Tompkinsville being a small town in an economically \ndepressed region, thanks to Debbie Williams, Tompkinsville is now a \nhotbed of new investments, and it has one of the most beautiful \ndowntown areas in Kentucky.\n   Debbie Williams is not just a female entrepreneur success story, she \nis a hometown hero for her downtown revitalization efforts and her \nachievement in attracting new private investment into the great town of \nTompkinsville, Kentucky.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. COMER", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 3}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "186", "extension": true, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "E1564", "wkday": "Tuesday", "day": "14", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "HONORING DEBBIE WILLIAMS", "id": "CREC-2017-11-14-pt1-PgE1564", "title": "HONORING DEBBIE WILLIAMS"}
