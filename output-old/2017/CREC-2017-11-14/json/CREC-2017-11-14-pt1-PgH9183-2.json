Mr. Speaker, it usually takes time to uncover a tax scam, \nbut this graph tells the whole story of the Republican tax bill in a \nglance.\n  If the House bill passes, in 2018, taxes will probably go down, taxes \nfor individuals; and that is the blue line. Income taxes will probably \ngo down. So far so good.\n  But follow the blue line for average U.S. taxpayers after 2019 and \nyou will see income taxes from 2020 to 2027, the end of the time frame \nfor this bill, go up. In fact, from 2019 to 2027, we see tax increases \nfor average taxpayers. There is the blue line, and we see these \nincreases take off steeply for average taxpayers.\n  Now follow the red line for business income taxes. Business income \ntaxes, like individual taxes, start off by going down, too. That means \ntax cuts. There they go. By 2020, business taxes, like individual \nincome taxes, are still mostly level or going down.\n  Then at 2020, business income taxes increase--the same with \nindividual income taxes. Both go up.\n  Then comes 2024. This is the divide line; the great divide between \nbusiness income taxes and individual income taxes. Business income \ntaxes turn abruptly down--there they go; there is the red line--while \nindividual income taxes, just as abruptly, turn steeply up. There is \nthe blue line. Individual tax increases.\n  The graph showing individual income taxes going up is this blue line, \nbut it represents what is happening in blue States and red States \nalike.\n\n\n  The bottom line for individual taxpayers--less than half of taxpayers \nget anything approaching a permanent tax cut, and an additional one-\nthird have their tax liability changed by $100 or less. That adds up \nfor most Americans to tax increases.\n  Business taxes go down. Here is the red line. Individual taxes, your \ntaxes, you pay more, they go up, your taxes and mine.\n  The Republican plan is a tax increase bill for average Americans. \nDefeat the Republican tax bill to keep taxes from going up for average \nAmericans who pay taxes in our country today.\n", "turn": 1, "speaker": "Ms. NORTON", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "186", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H9183-H9184", "wkday": "Tuesday", "day": "14", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "THE REPUBLICAN TAX PLAN", "id": "CREC-2017-11-14-pt1-PgH9183-2", "title": "THE REPUBLICAN TAX PLAN"}
