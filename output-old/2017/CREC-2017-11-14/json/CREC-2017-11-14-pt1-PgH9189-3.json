Mr. Speaker, the White House Council of \nEconomic Advisers issued a report recently asserting that, by cutting \nthe corporate rate from 35 to 20 percent, every American household will \nsee their income increase by $4,000 to $9,000 next year and those years \nafter.\n  The U.S. Treasury Secretary also said that these tax cuts would pay \nfor themselves and produce $2 trillion in growth over the next decade. \nIn fact, Mr. Speaker, tax cuts have never paid for themselves--not once \nor ever--in human history.\n  The White House has a problem in that nobody believes them, not the \nCongressional Budget Office, not the Tax Policy Center, not the \nUniversity of Pennsylvania Wharton Business School, and not even \nGoldman Sachs, from which both the Treasury Secretary and the National \nEconomic Adviser came to the White House.\n  In fact, each of these nonpartisan institutions that studies and \nreports on tax and economic policy have stated explicitly that these \ncorporate tax cuts will have near zero impact on future economic growth \nand add at least $1.5 trillion in new deficit over the next decade.\n  Once again, Mr. Speaker, this is fraud being perpetrated against \nmiddle America.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. HIGGINS of New York", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "186", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H9189", "wkday": "Tuesday", "day": "14", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "TAX CUTS HAVE NEVER PAID FOR THEMSELVES", "id": "CREC-2017-11-14-pt1-PgH9189-3", "title": "TAX CUTS HAVE NEVER PAID FOR THEMSELVES"}
