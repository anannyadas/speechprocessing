Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize Transgender \nAwareness Week to bring attention to the challenges that transgender \nindividuals still face today.\n  Our great country was founded on the values of opportunity and \nfreedom. Unfortunately, we hear about bills and a public discourse that \nonly seek to divide and discriminate against this vulnerable \npopulation.\n  Transgender individuals are active members of our community. They are \nour friends, our neighbors, and our children.\n  As the mother of a transgender son, I know that there is a great need \nfor public understanding of gender identity. These are Americans who \nhave the same hopes, the same dreams as everybody else, and should not \nbe treated differently from their peers.\n  Mr. Speaker, the reality is that transgender Americans around the \ncountry work hard and want to succeed and provide for themselves and \ntheir families. They deserve to be fully protected under our laws.\n  We must come together as a country to say no to prejudice, no to \ndiscrimination, and no to harassment. That begins by respecting, by \naccepting, and by embracing each individual.\n\n\n                 Congratulations to Dr. Eduardo Padron\n", "turn": 1, "speaker": "Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "R000435", "text": "  Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN.

These \nare just a few of the examples of the real consequences of sea level \nrise, which is a direct consequence of climate change.
