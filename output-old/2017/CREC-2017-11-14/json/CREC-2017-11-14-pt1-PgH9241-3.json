Mr. Speaker, I would love \nto vote for a bipartisan tax reform that supports middle class \nfamilies, ensures the wealthiest Americans pay their fair share, \ninvests in the next generation, and protects small businesses.\n  However, I can't vote for legislation that would raise taxes for 13 \nmillion middle class households next year; or that would give the top \n0.1 percent of Americans an average tax cut of over $320,000 while \nraising taxes on 36 million families by 2027; or that would provide \nmore tax benefit to the richest 1 percent than the lower 95 percent of \nAmericans combined.\n  Saddling the next generation with $1.7 trillion in debt while \nprioritizing millionaires and billionaires at the expense of everybody \nelse is irresponsible and cruel.\n  Mr. Speaker, I could spend countless hours describing how this bill \nharms middle class families, students, the elderly, and businesses in \nmy home State of New Mexico, but since I only have 1 minute to address \nthe floor today, I will be back tomorrow to talk about how this bill \ndevastates investment and job creation in the quickly growing renewable \nenergy industry in my home State of New Mexico.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Ms. MICHELLE LUJAN GRISHAM of New Mexico", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "186", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H9241", "wkday": "Tuesday", "day": "14", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "TAX REFORM", "id": "CREC-2017-11-14-pt1-PgH9241-3", "title": "TAX REFORM"}
