Mr. Speaker, today I rise to honor the outstanding career \nof Dr. Theodore Davies.\n   It all began in the mountains of eastern Kentucky, making house \ncalls with his Father. Often, there was no road to help them travel \nwhere they needed to go; but, still, they found a way or made their \nown. This would become the story of young Theodore Edwin Clyde Davies' \nlife. A life spent in dedication to others.\n   His formal education began at the prestigious McCallie School \nlocated on Missionary Ridge in Chattanooga, Tennessee. Founded in 1905, \nMcCallie is highly regarded as a private, Christian based college \npreparatory school for young boys and men, grades 6 through 12. Here, \nthe virtues of honor, truth, and duty would be fostered, and he would \nencounter the question, ``What is man's chief end?''\n   Young Theodore next found his way to Vanderbilt University and \ngraduated in 1967. Answering the call to follow in his Father's \nfootsteps, he then attended the University of Louisville School of \nMedicine and graduated in 1971. His surgical internships and residency \nin Neurosurgery would take him to the Indiana Medical Center, and \nMontreal, Canada. In Montreal, he would train on the first CT scanner \nin North America. Later, during his training in Louisville, he would \nbegin treating patients with the first CT scans in the United States.\n   The next leg of his journey would lead to the service of his country \nin the United States Navy. Reporting to both Portsmouth, Virginia, and \nOkinawa, Japan, he would leave the service with the rank of Lt. \nCommander.\n   Finally, on to Paducah, Kentucky, answering the need for a private \nNeurosurgical practice. Here, he would make his home with his wife, \nDebbie--the most beautiful nurse he had ever seen. That home would \neventually include the blessings of Ann, Teddy, Ellen and Emily. Now, \n37 years later, they continue to be blessed with new additions, \nincluding 4 grandchildren.\n   As he concludes his active practice and retires this December, he \nlooks forward to traveling and spending time with family, reading all \nthose books that have been on his ``to do list'' for years, and hitting \nthe greens every chance he gets. He will also be able to reflect upon \nhis work as a physician and surgeon and know that he has upheld his \nOath to others. He knows well, and has shared with countless others, \nthat the answers to man's chief end is ``to glorify God and to enjoy \nHim forever.'' I thank Dr. Davies; well done, Sir.\n\n\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. COMER", "itemno": 2}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 3}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "186", "extension": true, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "E1564-E1565", "wkday": "Tuesday", "day": "14", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "THEODORE EDWIN CLYDE DAVIES, MD", "id": "CREC-2017-11-14-pt1-PgE1564-5", "title": "THEODORE EDWIN CLYDE DAVIES, MD"}
