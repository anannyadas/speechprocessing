Mr. Speaker, today I recognize Alfred ``Ray'' Coe of \nChester County, Pennsylvania, for his life dedicated to serving his \ncommunity and our country. Mr. Coe honorably served the United States \nArmy during Vietnam in three Calvary units in addition to serving his \ncommunity of Kennett Square, Pennsylvania as a volunteer Scoutmaster \nwith the Boy Scouts of America. Mr. Coe has also worked with his local \ngovernment in various positions.\n  Mr. Coe received three promotions during his tour in Vietnam. He was \ninjured when his vehicle was blown up by a mine, but courageously \nreturned and rescued his Sergeant from the vehicle. For these and other \nefforts he earned numerous awards for his honorable service. Among the \nhonors were the Purple Heart, Bronze Star, and Army Commendation for \nValor, of which he is most proud. Upon returning home, Mr. Coe began \nvolunteering with the Boy Scouts of America, eventually becoming \nScoutmaster. Mr. Coe continued his service to his community through the \nScouts working as his district's Unit, Training, and Roundtable \nCommissioner.
