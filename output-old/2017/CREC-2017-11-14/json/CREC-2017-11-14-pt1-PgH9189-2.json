Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Mr. Brian \nLacefield, who was recently confirmed by President Trump as Kentucky's \nnew Farm Service Agency director. I am thrilled to recognize such a \nprolific member of the agriculture community as Kentucky's new FSA \ndirector.\n  Brian Lacefield was a successful area agriculture banker and \nagribusiness leader, most recently serving as market president of FNB \nBank in Cadiz, Kentucky. A Hopkinsville native, Lacefield previously \nserved as director of Commonwealth Agri-Finance with Hopkinsville \nElevator, and he currently serves on the Kentucky Corn Growers board of \ndirectors, the Kentucky FFA Foundation, and the Kentucky Agricultural \nLeadership Program.\n  I commend President Trump's selection of Lacefield to serve in such \nan important capacity.\n  The FSA plays a vital role in the Commonwealth's agriculture \nundertakings. Just last year, the agency was responsible for more than \n$330 million of payments and loans to Kentucky farmers.\n  I am grateful our new director brings with him a wealth of experience \nin agriculture, and I am confident he will serve Kentucky's farmers \nwell. I look forward to working with Director Brian Lacefield in the \nyears to come and continuing to serve Kentucky's agriculture community.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. COMER", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "186", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H9189", "wkday": "Tuesday", "day": "14", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "CONFIRMATION OF BRIAN LACEFIELD AS KENTUCKY FARM SERVICE AGENCY DIRECTOR", "id": "CREC-2017-11-14-pt1-PgH9189-2", "title": "CONFIRMATION OF BRIAN LACEFIELD AS KENTUCKY FARM SERVICE AGENCY  DIRECTOR"}
