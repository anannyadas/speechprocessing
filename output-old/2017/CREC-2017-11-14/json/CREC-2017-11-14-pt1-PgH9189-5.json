Mr. Speaker, $1.5 trillion--no, I guess it is actually \ncloser to $2.3 trillion with interest--that is the amount this partisan \ntax reform plan plans to add to our debt and deficit.\n  I have had a few folks say: ``Well, we have had $10 trillion added to \nthe debt over the last 8 years.'' With all due respect, Republicans \ncontrolled Congress during 6 of those 8 years.\n  Where are my conservative Republican friends who railed for 8 years \non the deficits? Was that just while a Democrat was in the White House? \nAre we such shallow, political, hypocritical people that we now ignore \nthe greatest threat to our country, our national debt and deficit, just \nbecause a Republican is in the Oval Office?\n  Furthermore, the idea that we will grow our way out of that $2 \ntrillion hole is fantasy. Let's look at the growth rate after the last \nbig tax cut at the end of 2015.\n  Since we have passed that tax cut, the growth rate remains steady at \n1.5 to 2 percent, no change, that huge tax cut financed with $650 \nbillion in debt to our kids.\n  The Wharton School of Business, not exactly a liberal bastion of \ntheology, now estimates that growth factor from this tax reform bill to \nbe less than 1 percent.\n  Let's get real. Vote against this package. Let's do real tax reform \nthat is deficit neutral at least--for our kids' sake.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. SCHRADER", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "186", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H9189", "wkday": "Tuesday", "day": "14", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "LET'S GET REAL", "id": "CREC-2017-11-14-pt1-PgH9189-5", "title": "LET'S GET REAL"}
