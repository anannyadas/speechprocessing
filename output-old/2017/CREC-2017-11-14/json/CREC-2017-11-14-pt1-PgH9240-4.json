Mr. Speaker, the only time I hear some of my colleagues \nexpress their concern about the deficit is when this body is \nconsidering policies to let hardworking American families keep more of \ntheir hard-earned money.\n  This is not the government's money. It is the people's money. They \nearned it. If tax revenues to the government are a concern, then \ncertainly we should pass tax cuts.\n  After President Kennedy cut tax rates, revenues to the government \nincreased from $95 billion to $280 billion. After President Reagan cut \ntax rates, revenues to the government increased from $600 billion to \n$1.35 trillion.\n  Furthermore, annual GDP growth rates increased into the 4 to 5 \npercent range following these tax cuts. We are going to witness this \nincrease in economic growth again under President Trump with a tax bill \nthis House will consider later this week.\n  As Ronald Reagan said: ``We don't have a trillion-dollar debt because \nwe haven't taxed enough. We have a trillion-dollar debt because we \nspend too much.''\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. BLUM", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "186", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H9240", "wkday": "Tuesday", "day": "14", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "PASSING TAX CUTS", "id": "CREC-2017-11-14-pt1-PgH9240-4", "title": "PASSING TAX CUTS"}
