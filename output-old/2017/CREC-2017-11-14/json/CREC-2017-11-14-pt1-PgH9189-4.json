Mr. Speaker, last week, in a column by \nHeritage Foundation President Ed Feulner in The Washington Times, it \nsadly identified November 7, 1917, as a day of infamy. This day marks \nthe overthrow of the Russian Government by the Bolsheviks, led by \nLenin, and the establishment of the murderous communist dictatorship \n100 years ago.\n  This revolution led to horrific deaths. Ed Feulner notes historians \nestimate that, according to Richard Pipes, 9 million were deceased. \nRichard Conquest says at least 20 million and, likely, as many as 30 \nmillion died in the Great Terror.\n  Ed Feulner continued: ``Its legacy is also one of grinding poverty. \nMost of the 88 countries that score `repressed' or `mostly unfree' on \nthe Heritage Foundation's Index of Economic Freedom are either \ncommunist, former communist, or some type of socialist economy. They \nare also the world's poorest nations.''\n  Americans still hope for democratic reform in Russia, which, with its \nextraordinary culture and limitless resources, should be one of the \nwealthiest nations on Earth.\n  In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget \nSeptember the 11th in the global war on terrorism.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. WILSON of South Carolina", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "186", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H9189", "wkday": "Tuesday", "day": "14", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "COMMUNISM'S CENTURY OF DEVASTATION", "id": "CREC-2017-11-14-pt1-PgH9189-4", "title": "COMMUNISM'S CENTURY OF DEVASTATION"}
