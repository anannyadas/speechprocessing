Madam Speaker, today I rise to thank and honor an \nintegral member of my community, Director Glenn Costie of the Dayton VA \nMedical Center, and congratulate him on his retirement.\n  Director Costie turned the Dayton VA into one of the top medical \nfacilities for our veterans in the country. Director Costie's success \nas a director of the VA Medical Center in Dayton has gained him \nnational recognition. He has been sent throughout the country to save \nmultiple VA medical facilities plagued with issues, particularly \nincluding veteran patient backlogs.\n  Furthermore, Director Costie has worked tirelessly to integrate the \nDayton VA into our community to serve our veterans in a way that it \nhadn't in several decades. Director Costie's time at the VA has been \ndedicated to bettering the lives of our veterans.\n  I was very honored to work with Director Costie on the issue of \nbringing creative housing options for Dayton's veterans, a place known \nas Lyons Place II. We also worked together on the successful campaign \nto bring the VA National Archives to Dayton.\n  Director Costie's leadership and expertise will be deeply missed at \nthe Dayton VA. I wish to thank him, give him all the best, and look \nforward to what he will be doing in his leadership in the future in our \ncommunity, and I thank him again for everything he has done for Dayton \nveterans.\n", "turn": 1, "speaker": "Mr. TURNER", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "186", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H9185", "wkday": "Tuesday", "day": "14", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "CONGRATULATING DIRECTOR GLENN COSTIE", "id": "CREC-2017-11-14-pt1-PgH9185", "title": "CONGRATULATING DIRECTOR GLENN COSTIE"}
