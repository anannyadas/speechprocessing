Mr. Speaker, this tax bill is not about the future. \nIt is about our past. Millions of Americans, middle class families, \nwill have increased taxes under this tax scam.\n  In fact, in the State of Texas, 230,000-plus Texans will pay an \naverage of over $6,000 more in taxes. That is a tax scam.\n  In addition, Mr. Speaker, this is not a futuristic tax bill. This is \nnot a tax bill for our times. This is a tax bill that implodes higher \neducation. For instance, it does not allow the deduction of student \nloans or interest payments on those loans or tuition or expenses, \neliminating the opportunity for educational growth.\n  It eliminates the tax credit for research and innovation; again, \nstymieing the growth of the United States as it relates to research and \ninnovation. Then to the large universities, the endowments that are \nused to help our students to build complexes to educate the best and \nthe brightest are eliminated.\n  This is a tax scam. It is a tax scam on higher education. It is a tax \nscam on hardworking middle class Americans. It deserves a resounding \n``no'' vote because we don't want to go back. We want to go toward the \nfuture.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Ms. JACKSON LEE", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "House", "num": "186", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "H9240", "wkday": "Tuesday", "day": "14", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "NOT A TAX BILL FOR OUR TIME", "id": "CREC-2017-11-14-pt1-PgH9240-3", "title": "NOT A TAX BILL FOR OUR TIME"}
