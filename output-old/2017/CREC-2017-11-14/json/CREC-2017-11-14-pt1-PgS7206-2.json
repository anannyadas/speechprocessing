Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, the Senate has just invoked cloture on the nomination \nof David Zatezalo, of West Virginia, to be the Assistant Secretary for \nMine Safety and Health. Mr. Zatezalo is uniquely qualified to lead the \nU.S. Department of Labor's Mine Safety and Health Administration \nbecause he knows the industry inside out. He has spent his career in \nmining, starting as a miner. He is a member of a union. He worked his \nway up to general superintendent in Southern Ohio Coal and was a \ngeneral manager at AEP.\n  The Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee approved his \nnomination on October 18, and I am glad the Senate will have the \nopportunity to vote on his confirmation.\n\n\n                               Tax Reform\n\n  Mr. President, for a few minutes I would like to turn to another \nsubject. Congress has turned its attention to tax reform, and our \nprincipal challenge is to find tax breaks and loopholes to eliminate so \nthat we can lower rates for taxpayers.\n  I have a nomination. The top of the list should be ending the wind \nproduction tax credit. Congress has already recognized the need to end \nthe wind production tax credit by passing legislation to phase out the \ncredit by 2020.\n  The draft House tax proposal reduces the amount available for new \nwind turbines by returning the credit to its original value instead of \nadjusting it for inflation, but we should do better. Instead of phasing \nit out, we should end the wind production tax credit this year. Ending \nthe wind production tax credit on December 31, 2017, would save over $4 \nbillion, which we could then use to lower tax rates for the American \npeople.\n  The wind production tax credit has been in place for 25 years. It has \nbeen extended 10 different times by Congress. It was originally set to \nexpire in 1999.\n  Tax credits are best used to jump-start new and emerging \ntechnologies. It has been a quarter of a century. Wind turbines are no \nlonger a new technology.\n  President Obama's Energy Secretary, Steven Chu, testified that he \nbelieves that wind is a mature technology. It is time to end this \nwasteful and expensive subsidy for a clearly mature technology.\n  To date, the wind production tax credit has already cost the \ntaxpayers billions. For 8 years--from 2008 to 2015--the wind production \ntax credit cost taxpayers $9.6 billion. That is more than $1 billion \nper year.\n  According to the Congressional Research Service, the wind production \ntax credit is expected to cost taxpayers over $23 billion between 2016 \nand 2020, and the cost to taxpayers will continue until 2030. That is \nbecause when you extend the wind production tax credit for 1 year, it \nis really for 10 years.\n  To benefit from the tax credit, wind developers must just begin \nconstruction of a wind project before December 31, 2019. Then those \ndevelopers can reap the tax benefits for a decade.\n  Despite the billions Congress has provided in subsidies, wind energy \nstill produces only 6 percent of our country's electricity and 17 \npercent of our country's carbon-free electricity. By contrast, nuclear \nis 20 percent of our electricity and 60 percent of our emissions-free, \ncarbon-free electricity.\n  The wind blows only about one-third of the time. Until there is some \nway to store large amounts of wind, a utility still needs to operate \nnuclear, gas, and coal plants when the wind doesn't blow.\n\n\n  On average, wind turbines are over two times as tall as the skyboxes \nat the University of Tennessee's Neyland Stadium and taller than the \nStatue of Liberty. The blades on the windmills can be as long as a \nfootball field, and their blinking lights can be seen for 20 miles.\n  This isn't the first time that I have been to the Senate floor to \nexpress my concern about the wind production tax credit, but I believe \nthat the conversation about energy subsidies and taxes is bigger than \nthe wind production tax credit. As Congress examines ways to reduce tax \nrates and to broaden the base, we must be willing to look at all tax \nsubsidies from mature technologies. That includes oil and gas \nsubsidies. I am here today to challenge my colleagues to be willing to \nconsider all energy subsidies from mature technologies--wind, solar, \noil, gas--as candidates for elimination in a tax reform bill. Those \ndollars could be better spent to lower rates for taxpayers.\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.", "turn": 2, "speaker": "Mr. ALEXANDER", "itemno": 3}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.", "turn": 3, "speaker": "The PRESIDING OFFICER", "itemno": 4}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "M001111", "text": "  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to highlight \nyet another dangerous nominee who has been put forth by this \nadministration.\n  During the campaign, President Trump made promise after promise to \nworkers. He said he would put them first. He said he would bring back \ngood-paying jobs to our struggling communities. While he made this \npromise to all workers, he specifically called out miners on more than \none occasion, so it would stand to reason that President Trump would \nprioritize the Mine Safety and Health Administration and nominate a \nleader who is committed to the agency's core mission.\n  MSHA is critically important to ensuring that mining jobs are safe \nand that mining companies aren't unnecessarily endangering their \nworkers' lives and safety. MSHA is responsible for inspecting mines and \nholding companies accountable when they violate safety and health \nstandards. MSHA's top priorities are to eliminate fatal mining \naccidents, reduce the frequency and severity of accidents, and minimize \nhealth hazards for workers through inspection enforcement.\n  Unfortunately, we are already seeing MSHA safety standards lapse \nunder the Trump administration. Earlier this year, MSHA was set to \nimplement a rule that would require safety exams of mines prior to the \nstart of a miner's shift. Ensuring mines are safe before miners are put \nat risk should not be controversial. Yet the Trump administration has \ndelayed implementation of that rule and proposed changes to actually \nweaken it.\n  Given this concerning record so far, it is so critical--absolutely \ncritical--that the MSHA Administrator is committed to standing up for \nour miners. But instead of nominating an advocate for workers' health \nand safety, President Trump nominated one of the industry's worst \noffenders.\n  David Zatezalo is a mining industry executive who has made it clear \nthat he cares more about corporate profits than workers. When he was \nthe CEO of Rhino Resources, one of the mines under Mr. Zatezalo's \ncontrol received unprecedented safety penalties. A Rhino mine was the \nfirst in history to be cited twice for a pattern of violations, an \naction that is only taken when there is a clear and demonstrated \ndisregard for workers' health and safety.\n  When the Obama administration issued commonsense rules to improve the \npattern of violations process, the Ohio Coal Association, where Mr. \nZatezalo sat on the board of directors, sued to block the rule.\n  Under Mr. Zatezalo's leadership, two separate mines owned by Rhino \nResources had injury rates that far exceeded the national average.\n  As a mining executive, Mr. Zatezalo refused to play by the rules. His \ncompany violated the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act by giving \nadvance notice of an MSHA inspection, meaning employees had the \nopportunity to cover up potential health and safety violations.\n  Rhino Resources was sued by the EEOC for creating an unlawful, \nhostile work environment by allowing an employee to be targeted based \non his national origin. The EEOC said Zatezalo's company allowed \ndiscrimination to ``continue unchecked in the workplace'' and cited \nRhino for retaliating against the employee instead of reprimanding \nthose who were doing the harassing.\n  It is clear to me that Mr. Zatezalo is wholly unqualified to serve as \nthe Mine Safety and Health Administrator, and I believe that if he is \nconfirmed, he will put thousands of miners' lives and safety at risk.\n  I am very disappointed that President Trump and congressional \nRepublicans are once again breaking promises to workers. I urge my \ncolleagues to join me in standing up for our miners across the country \nand vote against Mr. Zatezalo's nomination.\n  Once again, the contrast with Democrats' vision couldn't be starker. \nUnder the leadership of Senator Casey, Democrats are advocating for \nstronger enforcement abilities for MSHA so we can hold operators who \nshow a repeated disregard for miner safety accountable.\n  I really want my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to join us \nand pass these commonsense reforms that will help prevent further \nmining accidents and deaths. We will strengthen our economy if we start \nprioritizing workers' health, safety, and well-being over corporate \nprofits. I believe that must begin with rejecting President Trump's \nextreme agenda and these nominees who appear all too willing to \nimplement it without concern for the workers and families they are \nsupposed to serve.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.", "turn": 4, "speaker": "Mrs. MURRAY", "itemno": 5}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Rubio). The Senator from Utah.\n\n\n                          Blue Slip Procedure\n", "turn": 5, "speaker": "The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Rubio)", "itemno": 6}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "L000577", "text": "  Mr. LEE. Mr. President, I wish to speak for a few minutes about the \nSenate blue slip.\n  As my colleagues know, when the President nominates someone who will \nbe processed by the Senate Judiciary Committee, home State Senators \nreceive a letter informing them of the nomination and asking whether \nthey approve of the nominee in question. The letter is printed on blue \npaper--thus the name. That is why we call it the blue slip.\n  The question on the table is, What should happen if one or both of \nthe home State Senators do not approve the nomination?\n  In previous years, the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee has \ntreated the blue slip as a de facto veto, but that is not how the blue \nslip originally functioned. Between 1917, when the blue slip was first \nused, and 1955, the blue slip was never treated as a veto. Instead, it \ngave the home State Senators a special ability to state their \nobjections about a nominee during a hearing. The committee could then \ndecide how to proceed.\n  When James Eastland, a Democrat from Mississippi, became chairman of \nthe Senate Judiciary Committee in 1955, he took a different approach. \nWhy did Eastland implement this new policy? No one knows for sure, but \none scholar has written that Eastland, an ardent segregationist, might \nhave been trying in part to ``keep Mississippi's federal judicial bench \nfree of sympathizers with Brown v. Board of Education.''\n  We are evaluating the strength of a custom. It is a custom of \nrelatively recent vintage, and its origin story surely matters in how \nwe evaluate its ongoing relevance to the Senate today.\n  Eastland kept that policy in place for the whopping 22 years he \nserved as chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee. When Senator Ted \nKennedy took over from Eastland in 1979, he immediately changed the \nstatus and functioning of the blue slip procedure. As the Congressional \nResearch Service reports, Kennedy determined that the blue slip ``did \nnot have the same power to automatically stop committee action as \nbefore.'' Rather, Kennedy affirmed his right to move forward with a \nnomination regardless of the blue slip.\n  To make a long story short, since 1955, there have been eight \nchairmen of the Senate Judiciary Committee, including Eastland. By my \ncount, two have treated the blue slip as a veto; the other six have \neither said the blue slip was not a veto or have at least not treated \nthe blue slip as a veto.\n  What to make of this history? For one thing, we often hear that the \nblue slip is a 100-year-old tradition. In my view, it should be equally \npowerful to note that the blue slip originated 128 years after the \nfirst Congress. That is\n\n\npart of the Senate's history, too, and that, too, shouldn't be ignored.\n  But there is an even more fundamental point, and that is that even in \nmodern times, there isn't exactly an unbroken and lengthy practice of \ntreating the blue slip procedure as if it were a veto. The practice is \neven sparser when you consider that the blue slip takes on a different \nfunction depending on whether the President's party is in control of a \nmajority of the seats in the Senate. When the President's party does \nnot control the Senate, the blue slip is an efficient way to negotiate \nwith the opposition party, which, after all, can vote down the \nPresident's nominees.\n  When you look at the relevant circumstances, here is what you find: \nThe blue slip has been treated as a veto for a grand total of 28 years \nwhen the President's party controlled the Senate. Fourteen of those \nyears occurred under Senator Eastland, who was waging a personal \nvendetta against civil rights, including with respect to judicial \nnominees processed by the Judiciary Committee.\n  So if the Senate blue slip procedure is not a veto, what function \nshould it play? As I have said, the blue slip is the chairman's \nprerogative. But if I were advising the chairman, here is what I would \nsay: The blue slip should not be a veto of a nomination so long as the \nexecutive branch has sufficiently consulted with the home State \nSenators in advance of making this nomination. That rule is consistent \nwith the appointments clause of the Constitution, which establishes \njoint shared responsibility for appointments to Federal office.\n  It is important to note that, contrary to what some of my colleagues \nhave suggested, the appointments clause does not grant individual \nSenators the right to pick nominees, whether processed by the Judiciary \nCommittee or otherwise.\n  That rule is also consistent with the best reading of Senate custom. \nIt is roughly consistent with the practice that unfolded between 1917, \nwhen the blue slip was first adopted, and 1955, when Senator Eastland \nbrought about some changes. It has at least as much support in modern \npractice.\n  What counts, then, as sufficient consultation? It is hard to come up \nwith a precise rule, with a single mathematical definition, but in my \nview, the White House has an obligation to let the home State Senators \nknow whom the White House might be considering for a vacancy. The home \nState Senators have the right to review the candidate's record and \nshare any concerns they have about the candidate. Qualifications count. \nCharacter counts. Home State ties and ties to the community count. I \ndon't think home State Senators have the right to demand someone who \nshares their particular approach to the law necessarily, but they do \nhave the right to insist that the candidate believe in the law as \nsomething independent from politics, particularly where the candidate \nis being nominated to a life-tenured position in an article III court.\n  There is a final point to make. As we move forward, my colleagues \nacross the aisle will charge us with hypocrisy just as predictably as \nour prediction that the Sun will come up in the east tomorrow. There \nare two things to say about this.\n  First, my approach to the blue slip has remained consistent since I \ntook office. I have followed the approach that I have just described.\n  Second, until 2013, the blue slip was a lot less important because \nthe minority party could filibuster. That is no longer an option \nbecause the Democrats changed the rules in 2013. When you change the \nrules--the actual written protections upon which we rely--when those \nare changed, then you are left reliant on customs. Customs can always \nbe changed. In this case, the custom we are dealing with isn't even a \nparticularly strong one. It is not even a particularly long-lasting \none.\n  More broadly, in the Senate we are trying to figure out how to \nprocess the President's nominees. We have improved the pace of \nconfirming nominees recently, but we are still significantly behind in \nmodern historical terms from where we should be and from where other \nSenates have been during the first year of other Presidential \nadministrations. We need to find a solution to improve the pace, \nincluding by remaining in session longer so that we can complete this \nimportant work.\n  It is essential that we understand the difference between, on the one \nhand, the Constitution and, on the other hand, the rules; and, on the \none hand, the rules and, on the other hand, the custom. There is a \nsignificant difference here. In this case, the custom isn't even all \nthat long, not nearly as long as some have suggested, and it certainly \nhasn't been consistent. We can do better, and do better we must.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.", "turn": 6, "speaker": "Mr. LEE", "itemno": 7}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, as we cut taxes, there is one goal that is \nthe most important: We need more good-paying jobs, and we need bigger \npaychecks for hard-working Montanans.\n  It was just announced that the Senate's draft tax bill will repeal a \ntax that fundamentally targets those of low to middle income in my \nState and across the Nation. In fact, in Montana alone, 75 percent of \nthe people who pay this tax make less than $50,000 a year. In fact, in \nMontana, 32.5 percent make less than $25,000 a year. This is not just \nanecdotal. In 2015, if you looked across the Nation, 79 percent of \nthose who paid this tax made less than $50,000 a year. In fact, a \nlittle over 37 percent made less than $25,000 a year.\n  The IRS pickpocketed over $3 billion from approximately 6.5 million \nAmericans in 2015 alone, a majority of whom made less than $50,000 per \nyear. This is a tax that is targeted at those who are in poverty.\n  What is this tax, you might ask? Where in the world did it come from? \nI will tell you where it came from. It came from ObamaCare. It is the \nObamaCare poverty tax.\n  Otherwise known as the individual mandate, which forces people to \npurchase health insurance or pay a fine, the poverty tax systematically \ntaxes those who make less than $50,000 a year. If it were not enough \nthat ObamaCare plans were already too expensive for some of these \nfolks, the IRS adds insult to injury by fining them, taxing them, for \nnot being able to afford it. Some say that ObamaCare steals from the \nrich to give to the poor, but, honestly, ObamaCare's individual mandate \nis really Robin Hood in reverse. ObamaCare's poverty tax is like Robin \nHood stealing from the poor to pay King John.\n  It is unthinkable that we would leave such a provision in the law \nwhen we have the opportunity to repeal it. By repealing it, we would \nsave $338 billion over 10 years. That is over $300 billion that we \ncould put toward additional tax relief for small businesses and \nfamilies.\n  Alternatively, if we do nothing, the CBO projects that we will \nincrease taxes by $43 billion because of this poverty tax and that \nthose taxes will be paid primarily by America's low- and middle-income \nfamilies--$43 billion in taxes on those who can afford it the least.\n  ObamaCare's poverty tax must go, and there is no better time to get \nrid of it than right now. I urge my colleagues on both sides of the \naisle to join me in fighting on behalf of the low and middle classes of \nour Nation.\n  Benjamin Franklin is credited with this phrase: Just two things in \nlife are certain--death and taxes.\n  That may be so, but we do not need to make them both quite so \npainful. That is why I am glad to see that a repeal of the ObamaCare \npoverty tax has been included in the current Senate draft tax \nlegislation.
