Nowhere are those qualities more evident than \nin our State's commitment to end the scourge of homelessness.\n  This effort has taken a significant step forward through the \nestablishment of a single continuum of care for the State of Maine. The \nmerger of the Portland Continuum of Care and the Maine Balance of State \nContinuum of Care will better enable local service providers, the \nstatewide homeless council, and State and Federal agencies to address \nhomelessness throughout Maine while accommodating specific local needs. \nThis consolidation began in 2012 with the merger of the Bangor/Greater \nPenobscot Continuum with the Maine Balance of State Continuum of Care. \nI particularly commend the Maine State Housing Authority for its \nleadership during this process.\n  Maine's unified continuum of care will create greater efficiencies in \nthe use of Federal funding under the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance \nAct of 1987, the first major national response to homelessness. As \nchairman of the Housing Appropriations Subcommittee, I am confident \nthat this unification will enhance the ability of Maine's service \nproviders to help guide Federal policies and programs that assist low-\nincome Americans, families with children, young people, seniors, and \nour veterans in obtaining safe shelter and affordable housing.\n  With a 9-percent reduction in homelessness from fiscal year 2016 to \n2017, Maine is making great progress in aiding our most vulnerable \ncitizens. The creation of a unified continuum of care will accelerate \nthis progress, and I congratulate all who made it possible.", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Ms. COLLINS", "itemno": 0}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "K000383", "text": "  Mr. KING. Mr. President, I would like to recognize the efforts of the \nmany organizations that have agreed to come together to establish a \nsingle continuum of care for the State of Maine. Continuums of Care are \nsupported by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development to \npromote a communitywide commitment to the goal of ending homelessness. \nThey are a vital partner in the works to quickly rehouse homeless \nindividuals and families to minimize trauma and dislocation; promote \naccess to and effective use of mainstream programs; and optimize self-\nsufficiency among individuals and families experiencing homelessness. \nContinuums of Care make important decisions about priorities for \nFederal funding of programs that provide significant services.\n  Prior to establishing this single continuum of care for Maine, there \nwere three separate entities that existed: the City of Portland, \nGreater Penobscot, which was centered on Bangor, and everything else \nfell under the ``Balance of State'' Continuum. While receiving funding \nto operate a continuum of care funding requires a competitive \napplication process, these three groups have consistently worked \nclosely together and coordinated their means. In 2012, the Greater \nPenobscot Continuum and ``Balance of State'' merged together to create \nthe Maine Continuum of Care. Then, in 2017, the Portland Continuum \nconsolidated with the Maine Continuum--achieving a single continuum of \ncare--an effort that greatly advanced the level of collaboration among \nthe member agencies and has proven to be an important step in \nstreamlining efforts and assuring available resources are meeting the \nneeds of those who become homeless. The merger of the two continuums \nhas resulted in more accurate collection and management of data about \nthe extent and characteristics of homelessness in Maine.\n\n\n  A single continuum of care has achieved efficiencies in \nadministrating the responsibilities delegated by the Federal Government \nto meet the challenge of ending homelessness in Maine. As a unit, they \nidentify the homeless service priorities and distribute resources \naccordingly. The organizations and agencies that participate in \ncontinuum of care include: Maine's network of 37 emergency shelters \nserving the entire State; MaineHousing and the Department of Health and \nHuman Services; homeless youth providers; veterans groups; mental \nhealth and substance abuse service providers; supportive housing \ndevelopers; local governments and public housing authorities; and \nhomeless advocacy organizations. In addition to providing housing and \nservices, the members of the Maine Continuum of Care play a major role \nin several other statewide initiatives, including participating in the \ndata collection and entry for the annual homeless assessment report \nAHAR, and new system performance measure reports.\n  This significant merger was a collaborative endeavor involving \nMaine's homeless provider organizations, social service providers, and \nState and Federal agencies. I especially want to thank the leadership \nand guidance provided by MaineHousing, the State's housing authority, \nand the chairs of Maine's continuums throughout the merger process. I \nam honored to recognize all who were involved and to thank them for \nplacing the individuals and families who are struggling to meet this \nbasic human need for a warm, safe, and stable home at the center of our \ncollective efforts to end homelessness in the State of Maine.\n", "turn": 1, "speaker": "Mr. KING", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}], "header": {"chamber": "Senate", "num": "186", "extension": false, "year": "2017", "vol": "163", "pages": "S7211-S7212", "wkday": "Tuesday", "day": "14", "month": "November"}, "doc_title": "RECOGNIZING MAINE'S CONTINUUM OF CARE", "id": "CREC-2017-11-14-pt1-PgS7211", "title": "RECOGNIZING MAINE'S CONTINUUM OF CARE"}
