Mr. President, it was 16 years ago that I introduced a \nbill known as the DREAM Act. The purpose of the DREAM Act was to give \nundocumented young people brought to the United States under the age of \n18 an opportunity to go through a background check and to earn their \nway to legal status--16 years ago. The bill passed the Senate at \nvarious times and it passed the House, though never quite in the same \nyear at the same time.\n  Now we face a crisis, literally. It is a crisis involving hundreds of \nthousands of these young people across America. It was just September 5 \nwhen the President of the United States announced that he was going to \neliminate DACA.\n  DACA was the Executive order of President Obama that allowed these \nDreamers to come forward, pay a filing fee of about $500 or $600, \nsubmit themselves to a criminal background check, and, after that \nbackground check, if they cleared it, to be given a 2-year allowance to \nlive in the United States without fear of deportation--2 years at a \ntime--and the legal capacity to work. That was what DACA was about.\n  So 780,000 young people did it. They came forward. They surrendered \nthe information about themselves and their families. They submitted \nthemselves to criminal background checks, and they ended up getting the \nprotection of DACA. They went on to go to school, to go to work, to \nbecome teachers or engineers, to go to medical school, and to do things \nthat really mean that they will have a future in this country that will \nbe a benefit to them and to all of us.\n  So President Trump said that program will end on March 5, 2018, and \nhe established a deadline, for those who were going to see their DACA \neligibility end during that period of time, for them to renew. The \ndeadline was October 5. It meant that they had to come forward with the \nfiling fee and at least apply to go through the process again. It was \nquite a hardship on many of these young people to come up with the \nmoney for the filing fee and to realize that the clock was ticking in a \nvery meaningful way about their ability to protect themselves. Many of \nthem stepped forward and asked for help from families, from churches, \nand from friends to come up with the filing fee to make sure that they \nrenewed their DACA eligibility in time.\n  Let me tell you what happened to some of them who went through this \nprocess.\n  Here is one case. On September 14, Allison Baker, a lawyer for the \nLegal Aid Society in New York, sent one of these young individuals' \napplication to renew this permit that would let him stay and work in \nthe United States legally as part of DACA. The date of September 14 \nshould be remembered because the deadline for filing was October 5. To \nbe sure, this lawyer sent this renewal application for this young man \nby certified mail. Back in the day when I practiced law, that was one \nway to make sure you had written proof of when you actually mailed \nsomething far in advance of a deadline. Tracking data from the U.S. \nPostal Service showed that the envelope arrived in Chicago on September \n16. It was mailed from New York on September 14 and arrived in Chicago \nSeptember 16, on its way to a regional processing warehouse of the U.S. \nCitizenship and Immigration Services, the agency that administers the \nprogram known as DACA.\n  Then the packet started circling the Chicago postal system in a \nmysterious holding pattern. From September 17 to September 19, it was \nin transit to destination, according to the Postal Service. Then its \ntracking whereabouts disappeared until October 4, where, once again, \nthe Postal Service assured the sender that it was ``on its way.''\n  On October 6, the day after the deadline, this certified application, \nwhich was sent on September 14, arrived, and the application for this \n24-year-old man was rejected by our government.\n  He wasn't alone. We know of at least 33 other cases just like this. \nCongressman Luis Gutierrez, of my State of Illinois, told the story of \nanother application renewal sent on September 13 for an October 5 \ndeadline. It arrived on October 6, as well. Another sent their \npaperwork on September 21. It wasn't received until October 9. What \nCongressman Gutierrez said is very obvious: Because somebody else did \nnot do their job correctly, we are taking innocent young immigrants and \nmaking them deportable. That is unacceptable, Congressman Gutierrez \nsaid.\n  What does the U.S. Postal Service have to say about what I just read \nto you, those two or three cases? On Thursday, in a rare admission from \na Federal agency, the U.S. Postal Service took the blame. David \nPartenheimer, a spokesman for the Postal Service, said that there had \nbeen ``an unintentional temporary mail processing delay in the Chicago \narea.''\n  Remember what I am saying here. Young people, undocumented had \napplied successfully and had been accepted into the DACA Program. The \nPresident announced he was going to end\n\n\nthe program, and those--many of them--had to re-sign up, renew, by \nOctober 5. They did it. They mailed it. Their application didn't arrive \nin time.\n  It doesn't take a big leap of faith or intelligence to realize what \nshould be done. Clearly, this agency should be giving these young \npeople a chance. Once again, they have done everything they can think \nof to comply with the law and trust our government. They trusted our \ngovernment to give them DACA status to allow them to stay in the United \nStates, and they trusted the Postal Service, in a matter of 2 weeks, to \nbe able to deliver a letter.\n  Yesterday I spoke to the USCIS Director, Francis Cissna, and I asked \nhim about this. I said to him: There must be a way for us to \nacknowledge the obvious. These young people, in good faith, did \neverything we could ask of them to comply with the law, and now they \nhave been rejected. Now they are subject to deportation because the \nPostal Service didn't do its job. I asked him: Are you prepared to at \nleast reconsider this decision and give them a chance to renew their \nDACA status?\n  He said he was aware of the situation and that it was being \nconsidered at the highest levels of the Department of Homeland \nSecurity.\n  I raise this issue because real lives are at stake. These are real \npeople. These are young men and women who are doing everything they can \nthink of to become part of America's future. They are hiring lawyers, \nthey are raising money, and they are filing the documents that are \nasked of them in the hopes they can stay in the United States of \nAmerica, and the system is fighting them every step of the way. In this \nsituation, this is totally unfair.\n  Our government is better than this. Our people are better than this. \nOur values are better than this. I am pleading with the Department of \nHomeland Security and those who are seeking positions in that \nDepartment to show some common sense and a little bit of heart when it \ncomes to these young people who are simply trying to make a future for \nthemselves and a better United States of America.\n\n\n                          Republican Tax Plan\n\n  Mr. President, this week, Republicans in Congress are determined to \nbarrel ahead at full speed in a rushed, partisan effort to pass a tax \nplan at any cost. Make no mistake, for working families in Illinois and \nacross the United States, this is a mistake.\n  Preliminary analysis from the nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation \nrevealed that by 2019, more than 13 million Americans who make less \nthan $200,000 a year will experience not a tax cut but a tax increase \nunder the Senate Republican plan. That number jumps from 13 million to \n21 million by the year 2025.\n  In my State of Illinois, taxpayers at every income bracket are going \nto see their taxes increase for this tax reform that is being pushed \nthrough at the last minute of this session.\n  Fourteen percent of the middle fifth of taxpayers in Illinois--those \nwho are the very definition of middle income--will see an average tax \nhike under the Senate plan of $1,400. So much for a tax cut. It is a \ntax increase. Mr. President, I don't know about taxpayers in your \nState, but in my home State of Illinois, a $1,400 tax hike is a gut \npunch to a working family.\n  That is not all. Further analysis from the Center on Budget and \nPolicy Priorities shows that in addition to the millions of households \nwhich will see their taxes rise under this Senate Republican plan, 53 \nmillion households--that is 40 percent of all households earning less \nthan $200,000 per year--will see no significant tax change under the \nnew plan.\n  Let's be clear. If you are a middle-income family listening to that \nand you are thinking you might want to take your chances under this \nRepublican plan, please look at the facts. Even if you are one of the \nlucky ones who manage not to pay more under the Republican tax plan, \nmake no mistake, when this plan blows a $1.5 trillion hole in our \nNation's deficit, it will be working families who end up paying the \nbill.\n  When Republicans' fake math indeed falls short and the deficit is \nskyrocketing, the Republican budget has already identified how they are \ngoing to pay for these tax cuts in the future. Are you ready? They are \ngoing to do it with an additional $470 billion in cuts in Medicare \nbenefits--Medicare. They are paying for a tax cut for wealthy people by \nreducing the benefits paid out under Medicare to retired Americans and \nanother $1 trillion cuts in Medicaid. Remember Medicaid? That is the \nprogram where the major expense is to maintain the lives and health of \ntwo-thirds of Americans who are in nursing homes.\n  So the Republicans want to give a tax break to the wealthy. They are \ngoing to ask seniors who are retired to pay more or receive less from \nMedicare and make a dramatic cut in Medicaid as well. There is no \nhiding. Congressional Republicans have made clear that one way or \nanother, working families in America are going to pay for what they \ncall tax reform. At the heart of the Republican playbook for how to \nbankroll massive tax cuts for the wealthy few and the largest \ncorporations is the elimination of three vital tax breaks for working \nfamilies.\n  The House Republican plan will be voted on this week. They are dead \nset to get this done in a matter of days, and they are going to \neliminate in the House plan the medical expense deduction. What does \nthat mean? It means, if someone in your family is diagnosed with a \nserious illness--God forbid, cancer or whatever it is--and your family \nends up incurring massive debts, making sure that person survives, if \nyou incur those debts, you currently can deduct them from your taxes \nthat you pay, but the House Republican plan eliminates the deduction.\n  In my State of Illinois, 370,000 or more used the medical expense \ndeduction. Their medical bills are that high. The Republicans in the \nHouse eliminate that deduction. That isn't going to help working \nfamilies. It puts them at risk of bankruptcy. The No. 1 reason for \nbankruptcy in America is medical bills. The House Republican tax plan \nmakes it tougher. More than 370,000 Illinoisans claim an average of a \n$10,000 deduction for medical expenses, for hospital care, long-term \nnursing home care, prescription drug costs. That is just wrong.\n  There is more. The House plan also eliminates the student loan \ninterest deduction. Think about that for a second. Here, we have 1.5 \nmillion young people in Illinois paying off student loans. You know \nwhat they face: $20,000, $40,000, $60,000, $80,000 in debt. Some of \nthem are still living in their parents' basement because of their \nstudent loans. We give them one little break. You know what it is? The \ndeductibility on the interest on student loans, and yet here comes the \nRepublicans to eliminate that deduction.\n  Why would we ever want to make it harder for these students and their \nfamilies to pay off that mountain of debt that they incur going to \ncollege? But that is part of the so-called Republican tax reform.\n  They also include the one provision I know my colleague from New \nYork, the Democratic leader, feels very intensely about because our \nStates share the same problem. This compromise proposed in the Senate \neliminates the State and local property tax deduction for State income \ntax, sales tax, and property tax currently in New York and Illinois and \nmany other States. We hold to the basic principle, Americans should not \nhave to pay a tax on a tax.\n  Unfortunately, the Republicans in the Senate believe they want to \nchange that. The net result of that is to increase dramatically the \nburden so many taxpaying families already face. We have seen increases \nin our State income tax. We face regular increases in property taxes. \nThis is the one deduction that gives these families a little bit of \nhelp, and Republicans are eliminating it.\n  It was a week ago when I had a press conference with the Realtors in \nmy State and the homebuilders, who are dramatically opposed to the \nelimination of this deduction and other changes that are being made \nwhen it comes to purchasing homes and homeownership. They have told me: \nIf you want real economic growth in Illinois or any State, you start \nwith people who are building and buying homes. Sadly, the Republican \napproach, when it comes to tax reform, refuses to take that into \nconsideration.\n  We need to stand up for working families in our States of Illinois \nand New York and across this Nation. This tax reform plan that has been \nproposed by the Republicans, who are determined to get it done in just \na matter of a few\n\n\ndays, is going to be damaging to so many, and it is not going to help \nAmerica grow. Middle-income families are going to pay for the cost of \ngiveaways to the wealthiest taxpayers in America.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                   Recognition of the Minority Leader\n", "turn": 3, "speaker": "Mr. DURBIN", "itemno": 6}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, first, let me thank my dear friend and \ncolleague from Illinois. As I have always maintained, he is one of the \nmost articulate and eloquent Members of this Senate, on either side of \nthe aisle, and it is a joy to listen to him--not the subject but the \nway he articulates it, the subject we are interested in but not happy \nabout, which is the tax bill.\n\n\n                          Republican Tax Bill\n\n  Now, Mr. President, Senator McConnell always comes down and says: I \nhope the Democrats will join us in the tax reform bill. Mr. Leader, Mr. \nRepublican leader, we want to join you, but that doesn't mean you write \na bill behind closed doors and then say support it.\n  The way we have done tax reform successfully in the past--I was there \nin 1986--is Democrats and Republicans sat down together and came up \nwith a bill that maybe a few in each party wouldn't support, but the \nmainstreams of both parties would. It avoids the secrecy. It also \navoids one or two Members saying: Unless I get this, I am not going to \nbe for the bill--which pulls the bill in many different directions.\n  So, Mr. Leader, yes, Democrats do want to join this, but it is \ntotally disingenuous, not honest of you, to say that without letting us \nsit at the table, without letting us see the bill. So let's knock it \noff. You want to do a bill with just Republicans, fine. You tried it \nwith healthcare. You are trying it with tax reform. It is a lose-lose. \nYou will either not pass the bill or you will pass the bill that was \nenshrouded in secrecy that will have so many problems every Republican \nwho votes for it will regret it.\n  Yesterday's markup in the Finance Committee indicated the same thing. \nThe markup of the Republican tax bill wasn't the actual bill. It was \n``a preliminary draft.'' How do we know it wasn't the real bill? Well, \ntoday the Finance Committee has notified us that instead of continuing \nthe markup as usual, the committee will recess after a morning session \nbecause the Republicans are not ready with their replacement bill--the \nreal one.\n  This is crazy. The President, who doesn't know what is in the bill--\nwe all know that--has set an arbitrary deadline, and to meet that \ndeadline, our Republican colleagues are sacrificing the integrity of \nthe process and the quality of the bill.\n  We are 2 days into a markup, halfway, and Democrats haven't even seen \na real bill yet. In their desperate rush to get this bill through \nCongress, Republicans started by marking up a bill that is not even the \none they intended to pass. It is a bait and switch. It is the perfect \nexample of the problem with rushing a bill of this magnitude through \nCongress.\n  Republicans can't keep up with their own reckless, breakneck pace, \nand they are going to have to delay the markup. This same problem is \ngoing to repeat itself over and over again on issues of greater \ncomplexity and consequence.\n  What happens when Republicans realize their new international tax \nregime encourages scores of new tax savings and avoidance schemes? What \nhappens if the independent analysts say their new loophole for \npassthrough businesses doesn't have enough guardrails? What happens if \nthe House and Senate are unable to reconcile their disparate approaches \nto slashing State and local deductions?\n  In the New York Times this morning--I commend all my Republican \ncolleagues to read it--they identified new potential problems in this \nRepublican tax bill, problems the writers hadn't thought about, but \ncorporate lawyers by the dozens, by the scores, by the hundreds will \nfind a way to walk through these loopholes, even though our Republican \ncolleagues didn't intend those loopholes to exist. You can be sure that \nfor every 1 of these loopholes, these misadventures, the Times \nidentified, there are 5 or 10 more lurking in the print, in the fine \nprint. The only question is whether our Republican colleagues find them \nnow or find them out later when it is too late after the bill passes.\n  Instead of rushing through a bill of such enormous complexity, \nsunlight is the great fermenter of this type of legislation. If it lies \nout there for a little while, people come in and say: This is wrong or \nthat is wrong. Those will be individuals, those will be pundits, those \nwill be the companies our Republican friends are trying to help. They \nwill say: Wait a minute; this doesn't quite work because no one has had \na chance to really see it, examine it, and let it stew.\n  Now we are asked for other significant changes. What happens if, as \nwe have seen, every few days President Trump tweets, asking the \nRepublicans to change their bill, and this time they repeal the \nindividual mandate and drop the top rate, as he asked them to do \nyesterday? Each of these decisions has enormous, drastic consequences \nfor American families and American industries.\n  President Trump's crazy idea to repeal the individual mandate as a \npart of this bill, according to CBO, would boot 13 million people from \nthe health insurance rolls and cause premiums to skyrocket, all to pay \nfor a bigger tax cut at the top bracket--the wealthiest people in \nAmerica. What a toxic idea. Are any Republicans going to go home and \ncampaign on that? We are going to get rid of the individual mandate, \nkick 13 million people off healthcare, and raise premiums so we can \nlower the top rate when no one--no one but the hard right--is clamoring \nfor it?\n  Income distribution is a problem in America. We all admit that we \nhave different solutions for it. So be it. But I haven't heard, as I \ndid in the 1980s, 1990s, or even the early 2000s, a clamoring to lower \nthe top rate, even among those who pay it. They know they are doing \nwell. Wealth has gone way up in America, and it has gone to the top. \nThat is not what we need. It is a toxic idea. Yet Republicans may have \nto consider adding it to the bill to placate a restless and uninformed \nPresident, who, we all know, knows very little of what is in this bill. \nHe just tweets. Somehow our Republican colleagues, instead of ignoring \nthe tweets, pay attention to too many of them.\n  Yesterday, the nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation said that they \nwould not be able to properly analyze the effects of the Republican tax \nbill in the time they have planned for it. So we are not even having \nthe JCT--nonpartisan, respected for decades--analyze the bill before we \nare going to vote on it in the committee and maybe on the floor.\n  Again, the Republican leadership in the House and Senate will ask \ntheir Members to vote on a major bill without knowing the consequences. \nIn no world is this proper legislative procedure. No party has ever \ndone this before--Democrats, Republicans, Whigs, Anti-Federalists, \nDemocratic-Republicans, Federalists. We have never seen this before. It \nis so wrong.\n  We see so many things that ail this country, and I have to say a lot \nof them stem from the top--from the President. Yet our Republican \ncolleagues are still fearful of ignoring him, of not listening to ideas \nthey know are ludicrous.\n  The rush is because my Republican friends, fearful of the President \nand his self-imposed deadline, are trying to hide a bill that would \ntransfer even more wealth to the superwealthy while raising taxes on \nmillions of middle-class Americans.\n  According to the Joint Committee on Taxation, of all taxpayers making \nless than $200,000 a year, 13 million would see a tax hike in 2019, and \n20 million would see a tax hike by 2027. Both Leader McConnell and \nSpeaker Ryan said that they would not raise middle-class taxes. They \nhad to back off. For working Americans who do get a tax cut, the \naverage is so small compared to what folks at the top are getting. \nAmericans making $40,000 to $50,000 a year get an average cut of $480, \nwhile folks making over $1 million will get a tax cut of $50,000--100 \ntimes more than what working families get. They can say: Well, that is \nbecause the wealthy are richer. But that is not what we need in America \nright now. The wealthy are getting wealthier. They are doing fine, even \nunder the present\n\n\ntax regime. Middle-class people's median income has been going down \nover the last decade. It is harder for middle-class people to average--\nit shouldn't be OK for them to get $500 and the wealthy to get $50,000. \nWe ought to be directing the tax cuts at the middle class.\n  Republicans--Trump's organization--had an ad on TV. They said that \nwealthy people's tax rates remain the same, while the middle class gets \na cut. That is false advertising because, when we compare apples to \napples, the wealthy get a much larger cut than the middle-class people.\n  We have known for weeks that the longer this bill is in effect, the \nworse it gets for the middle class. To stay within deficit numbers, the \nJCT confirmed that under the revised House bill, entire middle-income \ngroups will see a tax hike, on average, just a few years down the road. \nSpeaker Ryan and other Republicans say that those tax hikes will not \nhappen because future Congresses will extend certain tax breaks in \nperpetuity. If that is true, all the deficit hawks ought to pay \nattention. There is a gigantic hidden cost to the bill if we are going \nto make these tax cuts temporary in this bill and then make them \npermanent.\n  The scores this week will say that these bills blow a $1.5 trillion \nhole in the deficit over the next decade. That is bad enough. But if a \nbunch of breaks, deductions, and expansions that are now temporary are \nmade permanent, as the Speaker says they will be, the real cost will be \nhundreds of billions, if not trillions, more. All of my Republican \nfriends who care about the deficit should be wary of this gain.\n  We do need permanence. We need corporate America in particular to be \nrelying on a permanent change. But you can't do a permanent change \nwithout blowing a hole in the deficit, so you do a temporary change. \nThere is a simple solution, which, if Democrats and Republicans work \ntogether, we could do: Close corporate loopholes, lower the top rate, \nkeep the corporate reduction deficit-neutral and permanent. My guess is \nmost corporate leaders would prefer that. They would prefer less of a \ntax decrease and more permanence because you can't build a factory or \nmake a major investment if you know that the decrease is going to \nvanish.\n  We shouldn't be rushing through such an ill-conceived, backward \nbill--breaking the fine traditions of this body, busting the deficit, \nbreaking the backs of millions of middle-class families, making the \nfunding of defense far more difficult when there is so much agreement \nbetween our two parties on tax reform. On healthcare, it is hard to \nagree; the visions are diametrically opposed. But on tax reform, that \nis not true. Our Republican friends are just bollixing this up. Somehow \nthey had in their heads that they had to do it through reconciliation. \nThey had to do it without Democrats, and the result is a very poor \nproduct that most Americans already don't like and even more will not \nlike as they learn more about it.\n  We all want to reduce the burden on small businesses. We all want to \nencourage companies to locate jobs here. We could put together a bill \nthat does those things. This bill doesn't.\n  If Republicans turn their backs on this deeply flawed approach, my \ncommitment to so many of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle--\nwho I know are squirming about this bill--is that we will come together \nand put a good bill together that a majority of both parties can \nsupport--both parties. That is how it ought to be done.\n\n\n                        President's Trip to Asia\n\n  As President Trump returns from his week-long trip to several Asian \nnations, it is worth asking: What did America get out of his trip?\n  Did he forcefully confront the Chinese leaders about our imbalanced \nand unfair trade system, where we play by the rules and the Chinese do \nnot? No. He said that China's behavior was not their fault and blamed \nAmerican leaders instead for China's trade abuses.\n  Even if he believes that, what is the point of saying it? He is \nencouraging China to keep doing what they have been doing all along if \nhe thinks they are not to blame--letting them off the hook. Why? \nBecause Xi gave him a red carpet?\n  I have never been so ashamed of a foreign trip in my years. It is \njust inside out. We attack our friends, and the people who have given \nus the most trouble--China and Russia--we mollycoddle. That is so bad \nfor the future of this country.\n  Did President Trump engage the various regional powers in a project \nof great importance, curtailing and containing the rogue North Korean \nregime? No. He settled for a sophomoric exchange of insults on Twitter, \nfar below the dignity of the office. Then he came back and bragged \nabout the great ceremony and how well he was treated. Xi played the \nPresident. He played the President. Every American should be \nembarrassed.\n  I heard one commentator say this morning that this trip cemented \nChina as the leading power of the world, not because they have more \neconomic power, not because they have greater intellectual ideas, not \nbecause they are better people but because Xi is dominating and smart, \nand the President so susceptible to flattery. It is demeaning to the \nUnited States and its role in the world.\n  Then, to add insult to injury, he seems to have a love for dictators. \nIn the Philippines, where a strongman leader is engaged in a vicious \ncampaign of extrajudicial killings, did Trump admonish him? Did Trump \nuphold the beacon of the United States as the noblest power in the \nworld? No. He lectured and unsettled our allies while emboldening our \nadversaries, like China and Russia, by treating them with kid gloves \nand making it clear that all they have to do is say a few flattering \nwords and the United States will drop the interests that our people are \nso dependent on.\n  All in all, President Trump's trip was a colossal flop and \nembarrassment. He seemed far more interested in pomp and circumstances, \nred carpets, fancy meals, and the flattery of foreign leaders than in \nadvancing vital American interests in a region that is increasingly \nlooking to China for leadership. After the President's performance, \nthose countries are going to turn more to China. At least they have \nstrength and direction, even though China will take advantage of them, \nfor sure, as they have taken advantage of us.\n  It is a sad state of affairs when the simplest of strategies--\nflattery--can derail an entire foreign trip and undercut American \ninfluence in the world. President Trump was played for a fool by \nChina's leaders, and he enthusiastically accepted the role.\n  The President of the United States--this great, grand country we \nlove--is supposed to be the single strongest voice and advocate for our \nnational interests.

Mr. President, thank you. I rise to speak about the tax \nreform issue and the tax reform effort that is front and center for \nthis Congress and for all Americans. Particularly, I want to point out \nthe fact that Congress has not undertaken this difficult task for over \n30 years, and for anyone who has been involved in this, they now \nrealize how difficult it really is.\n  In the years since the last major overhaul, Congress has, by \npatchwork, added numerous carve-outs and special interests, passed \nshort-term tax extenders, which have made planning for families and \nbusinesses very difficult, and has generally contributed to a tax code \nthat today is extremely complex, burdensome, and unpredictable.\n  My colleague from Idaho Senator Crapo has stated that we couldn't \nhave done worse if we had set out intentionally to do worse. Many of my \ncolleagues and I have heard story after story from our constituents who \nhave said the same thing. The Tax Code makes it hard for families and \nbusinesses, especially small businesses, to comply and plan ahead, let \nalone grow and prosper. This conversation hasn't gone away, so clearly \nthe system, as it stands, is not serving the American people as it \nshould.\n  It is imperative for the continued growth of the American economy \nthat\n\n\nwe simplify the system, reduce complexity, and create certainty. Tax \nreform will bring relief to American families. Under the plan released \nby the Senate Finance Committee, middle-class Americans will see a \nbenefit in the form of a lower tax bill, which means more money for \nhouseholds to bring home. In addition to keeping more money in the \npockets of hard-working Americans, the Senate plan nearly doubles the \nstandard deduction, increases the child tax credit to help families \nwith the very real costs associated with raising a family, and \npreserves an existing tax credit to help care for elderly family \nmembers. This tax plan would also make it easier for individuals and \nfamilies to avoid a time-consuming and expensive tax-filing nightmare \nby simplifying the Tax Code and eliminating deductions.\n  The aim of this entire exercise is to make the Tax Code simpler, \nfairer, and easier to comply with, reducing the burden on taxpayers and \ncreating an environment that enables families and businesses to thrive.\n  Tax reform will help grow small businesses. As chairman of the Senate \nSmall Business Committee, I have focused on highlighting small business \nissues in this tax reform process. The ranking member, Senator Shaheen, \nand I held a bipartisan hearing in June to talk about tax policies that \nwould most benefit small businesses across the country. As a result, we \nsent a bipartisan letter to the Senate Finance Committee, which was \ndrawing this bill, to outline the policies we determined were most \nimportant. The topline issue was the need to address the individual Tax \nCode along with the corporate Tax Code. Most of the Nation's small \nbusinesses are organized in a way that they pay taxes through the \nindividual code. It is amazing they managed to create the majority of \nnew jobs in America, despite facing this higher tax rate, with the \nadded burden of spending time and money away from businesses to comply \nwith this complex Tax Code. Thankfully, Ranking Member Shaheen and I \nare not the only ones who heard this message, and lower rates for small \nbusinesses is part of this conversation.\n  Small businesses have identified tax policies that work for them, \nalong with changes that could be made to help more of them across the \ncountry. Two of the examples are the cash method of accounting and \nsection 179 expensing. Cash method accounting is a simpler way for \nsmall businesses to keep their books, and section 179 expensing allows \nsmall businesses to immediately deduct the cost of investing in their \nbusiness up to a certain amount. Both of these commonsense policies \nwill reach more business owners in tax reform.\n  I am encouraged by the plan the Senate Finance Committee released \nlast week and the process they are undertaking this week to move this \nbill forward. With tax reform, we have a real opportunity to make \nchanges that will have a tangible, positive impact on the American \npeople and create an environment for our Nation's job creators to \nprosper. I am excited to see the kind of job creation that will result \nfrom the changes we are considering, and I look forward to working with \nmy colleagues to make this a reality.\n  Thank you.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.", "turn": 9, "speaker": "Mr. RISCH", "itemno": 12}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, my colleagues, cholera is a truly awful \nway to die. It is a manmade disease, a man-caused disease that this \nworld could easily eradicate from existence. You become so dehydrated, \nyou vomit so much liquid, your body dispenses so many nutrients, so \nmuch water through unending diarrhea, that your body is thrown into \nshock. You literally die from vomiting and diarrhea, sometimes over the \ncourse of hours, sometimes over the course of days, sometimes over the \ncourse of weeks.\n  Inside Yemen today, by the end of this year, there will be 1 million \npeople diagnosed with cholera.\n  This picture I have in the Chamber is a hard image to see. I will \nreplace it with this one.\n  One million people will be diagnosed with cholera. Thousands and \nthousands inside Yemen today are dying because of this disease. There \nis a humanitarian catastrophe inside this country--which very few \npeople in this Nation can locate on a map--of absolutely epic \nproportions. This humanitarian catastrophe, this famine--one of four \nfamines across the world today--is being caused in part by actions of \nthe United States of America, and it is time that we do something about \nit as a body.\n  As we speak today, the Saudi-led coalition that has been engaged in \nan incessant 2-year bombing campaign in Yemen is blockading Yemen, not \nallowing any humanitarian relief, not allowing fuel or food or water to \nget into the country.\n  The coalition's blockade has grounded U.N. flights. It has prevented \nhumanitarian workers from flying in and out of the country. It has \nbarred ships from delivering lifesaving food, fuel, and medical \nsupplies. A 25,000-metric-ton World Food Programme ship is currently, \nas we speak, being denied access to the port. As we speak today, \nhospitals and aid organizations inside Yemen are shutting down because \nthey do not have enough fuel to continue operating. Vaccines will run \nout in the country by the end of the month. Prices for food and \nmedicine are spiking such that they are unaffordable to the majority of \nYemenis. Because of cholera alone, 2,000 people have died. Thousands of \nother civilians have died because of other humanitarian nightmares, \nincluding a lack of access to the medical system.\n  I mentioned that the blockade is being run by the Saudi-led \ncoalition. The United States is a member of that coalition. For 2 \nyears, the United States has been aiding the Government of Saudi Arabia \nin a bombing campaign of the Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen. That \nbombing campaign caused this outbreak of cholera. Why is that? The \nbombing campaign deliberately targeted the electricity grid of Yemen in \nand around Sana'a, the capital controlled today by the Houthis. The \nwater treatment facility runs on the electricity from that grid.\n  As you can read in a lengthy story in the New York Times from 2 days \nago, the country no longer has the ability to treat water that goes to \nits capital because the Saudi-led bombing campaign has knocked out \nelectricity. The fuel that has helped temporarily run the water \ntreatment facility is no longer available either because the Saudi-led \nbombing campaign has targeted the infrastructure that allows for fuel \nto be delivered. So today the water is undrinkable. It is toxic. Yet, \nbecause there aren't other supplies of water, millions of Yemenis are \ningesting it. They are eating food that is also toxic because of the \ninability to treat water, because of the flow of sewage and feces \nthroughout the capital city, and almost 1 million people have \ncontracted cholera.\n  That bombing campaign that targeted the electricity infrastructure in \nYemen could only happen with U.S. support. It is the United States that \nprovides the targeting assistance for the Saudi planes. It is U.S. \nrefueling planes flying in the sky around Yemen that restock the Saudi \nfighter jets with fuel, allowing them to drop more ordnance. It is \nU.S.-made and transferred ordnance that is carried on these planes and \ndropped on civilian and infrastructure targets inside Yemen.\n  The United States is part of this coalition. The bombing campaign \nthat has caused the cholera outbreak could not happen without us. The \nofficial position of the State Department with respect to the \nblockade--which was imposed by the Saudis about a week ago--is that \nthey should end it, at least for the purposes of allowing humanitarian \nresources into the country. That has not happened.\n  As I mentioned, there is literally a World Food Programme ship right \nnow with 25,000 metric tons of food waiting to get into the capital to \nhelp families like this. So although that may be the official position \nof the State Department, we clearly aren't articulating that position \nto the Saudis because the Saudi blockade--which happens with U.S. \nmilitary support--continues. Maybe that is because the State Department \nand the White House are simply operating on two different planets.\n\n\n  While on his trip to Asia, President Trump said that he has full \nconfidence in the Saudi King, that he knows what he is doing. Let me \ntell you what he is doing. He is using starvation and disease as a \nweapon of war, which is in contravention of international human rights \nlaw. You cannot use starvation. You cannot intentionally cause this \nkind of disease in order to try to win a military conflict. So maybe \nthe Saudis do know what they are doing, but what they are doing is a \ngross violation of human rights law.\n  It would be one thing if the United States were a mere observer, but \nwe are a participant in this. This horror--I am sorry, it is hard to \nsee--is caused in part by our decision to facilitate a bombing campaign \nthat is murdering children and to endorse a Saudi strategy inside Yemen \nthat is deliberately using disease and starvation and the withdrawal of \nhumanitarian support as a tactic.\n  Last night, the House of Representatives passed a nonbinding \nresolution making clear that there is no legal authorization for U.S. \nparticipation in the Saudi-led campaign against the Yemeni people. \nImportantly, the resolution also made clear that there are multiple bad \nactors in Yemen today. The vast majority of cholera cases today--I \nthink upwards of 80 percent--are in Houthi-controlled areas. But the \nHouthis do not have clean hands, and their patrons, the Iranians, do \nnot have clean hands. There have been human rights abuses and attacks \non civilian targets by the Houthi forces as well.\n  The Iranians should stand down immediately, as should the Saudis, as \nthey continue to whip up this proxy war between regional powers that is \nkilling civilians inside Yemen, but without U.S. leadership in the \nregion, there is no hope for that stand-down to happen.\n  In the Obama administration, at least Secretary Kerry was actively, \npersonally engaged in trying to bring some resolution to the civil war \ninside Yemen. But since President Trump took office and Secretary \nTillerson became Secretary of State, there is zero U.S. leadership on \nthis question. We don't have an Assistant Secretary of State for the \nMiddle East. We don't have any envoy for this crisis. All we have is a \nPresident who says that the Saudi Government knows what it is doing.\n  That kind of unconditional endorsement of intentional humanitarian \npain is un-American. We have stood up time and time again for human \nrights all across the world. We have been the people who deliver \nhumanitarian salvation to people who are at risk of disease and famine \nand death. And instead of rescuing the people of Yemen during this \nmoment of blockade, we are contributing to the deterioration of the \nquality of life inside that country.\n  The Saudi blockade needs to end today. And a partial lifting of the \nblockade is not enough. This morning, the coalition did say they are \ngoing to allow some humanitarian access to the ports they control, but \nwe need access to the ports near where the majority of the population \nactually lives--Hudaydah and Saleef. Allowing access to the ports that \nthe Saudis control--which are not the ports where the majority of \nhumanitarian aid flows through--is not sufficient. It will not do the \njob. Medicine and vaccinations will continue to dry up. Price spikes \nwill continue to go through the roof. The cholera epidemic will \ncontinue.\n  We have a responsibility as a nation to ensure that the coalition, of \nwhich we are a part, is not using starvation as a weapon of war. This \nwill be a stain on the conscience of our Nation if we continue to \nremain silent. I hope the Senate takes the same action that the House \ndid. I hope we make clear that there is no legal authorization for the \nUnited States to be part of a war inside Yemen. Congress has not given \nthe authorization for this President to engage in these military \nactivities.\n  By the way, the civil war inside Yemen has aided the enemies we \nactually have declared war against. Al-Qaida is getting stronger inside \nYemen because, as more and more of the country becomes ungovernable \nbecause of this war, al-Qaida is moving into that territory. ISIS--\nagainst which we have not declared war, but we are engaged in active \nmilitary activity in the region--is getting stronger there too.\n  So even if you don't believe there is a humanitarian imperative \nattached to U.S. withdrawal from this coalition, there is a national \nsecurity imperative because we are just strengthening the most lethal \nelements of the extremist movement worldwide.\n  I know many other Members of this body on both sides of the aisle \nfeel as strongly about this as I do. We are not going to get leadership \non this question from the administration. They have given a blank check \nto the Saudis. They have turned a blind eye to this epidemic inside \nYemen--an epidemic that is getting worse by the day since the Saudi \nblockade began. Leadership will have to come from this body.\n  We need to make clear to the administration that they do not have the \nauthority to continue to participate in this military coalition. We \nneed to press the administration to tell the Saudis to end this \nblockade. We need to start using our ability as appropriators and \nauthorizers to send messages to the Saudis that this kind of conduct \ncannot continue. We have tools at our disposal to lead as a Congress on \nthis question--the world's worst humanitarian catastrophe happening \nright now, as we speak, getting worse by the hour inside Yemen. This \nCongress, this Senate, cannot remain silent.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.", "turn": 13, "speaker": "Mr. MURPHY", "itemno": 17}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to oppose Steven Bradbury's \nnomination to serve as general counsel at the Department of \nTransportation.\n  The general counsel position at DOT oversees and makes critical \njudgments about legal work that impacts public safety, development, and \ninnovation that drives our economy. Unfortunately, Mr. Bradbury's \nprevious actions during his time at the Department of Justice showed \nthat he lacks the judgment and commitment to our shared values that are \na prerequisite for any lawyer privileged to serve the people of the \nUnited States of America.\n  During his time as the acting head of the Department of Justice's \nOffice of Legal Counsel, Mr. Bradbury was one of three primary lawyers \nwho helped lay the groundwork for the Bush administration's defense of \nwhat they described as ``enhanced interrogation techniques.'' The so-\ncalled torture memos that Mr. Bradbury helped write were used to \njustify the Bush administration's decision to use torture that included \nextreme sleep deprivation, cramped confinement, and waterboarding. Mr. \nBradbury helped find legal loopholes that were an affront to our \nAmerican values. And he failed to fulfill the special responsibility \nall lawyers have to the quality of justice in our legal system.\n\n  Mr. Bradbury's past government service reflects a lack of sound legal \njudgment. In fact, a 2009 review by the Department of Justice raised \nquestions about the objectivity and reasonableness of the conclusions \nfound in the memos he authored. Rather than standing up for our values \nand laws, Mr. Bradbury deferred to the wishes and pressure of the \nPresident he was serving.\n  Furthermore, during his confirmation hearing, when referring to his \nlegal justification for these so-called enhanced interrogation \ntechniques, Mr. Bradbury stated: ``If I had my druthers, I wouldn't \nhave engaged in having to address those issues.''\n  If Mr. Bradbury preferred to not engage in tough legal questions at \nthe time, then he should not have been serving in the Office of Legal \nCounsel, and he should not be confirmed for a general counsel position \nnow. By definition, the job of general counsel is to deal with \ndifficult legal questions.\n  It is clear Mr. Bradbury is unwilling to provide the sound legal \njudgement and impartiality necessary for this role. He has \ndemonstrated, in the past, that his legal analysis is flawed, he lacks \na commitment to America's values, and his actions have had truly \ndangerous implications for our Nation.\n  I will oppose this nomination, and I urge my colleagues to do the \nsame.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n\n\n\n                       Confirmation of Derek Kan\n", "turn": 17, "speaker": "Ms. HASSAN", "itemno": 22}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "T000250", "text": "  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to note last \nnight's strong bipartisan vote of 90 to 7 to confirm Derek Kan's \nnomination. I am very happy that Mr. Kan is now able to take up the \nduties of Under Secretary for Transportation Policy at the Department \nof Transportation after a long, entirely unnecessary delay. As I stated \non the floor last week, it is truly unfortunate that it took 4 months \nand the engagement of the cloture process to confirm this well-\nqualified nominee, who obviously has strong bipartisan support.\n  I hope that last night's vote will signal to those who are holding \nother well-qualified nominees to the Department--including the \nnomination of Ronald Batory to be Administrator of the Federal Railroad \nAdministration and the nomination of Adam Sullivan to be Assistant \nSecretary of Transportation for Legislative Affairs--over funding for \nthe multibillion dollar Gateway Project in New York and New Jersey that \ntheir strategy is misplaced and depriving the Department of the very \nexpertise needed to make progress on Gateway and a host of other \ncritical issues.\n  Mr. President, I have also sought recognition to voice my strong \nsupport for the nomination of Steven Bradbury to be general counsel at \nthe U.S. Department of Transportation. Mr. Bradbury has had an \nextraordinary legal career in both the private and public sector, and \nhe is well prepared to address the many challenging legal questions \nthat will come before the Department.\n  Mr. Bradbury is currently a litigation partner at the Dechert law \nfirm here in Washington, DC, and his practice focuses on regulatory \nenforcement and investigations, rulemakings, and judicial review of \nagency actions, as well as appellate cases and antitrust matters.\n  From 2005 to 2009, Mr. Bradbury headed the Office of Legal Counsel at \nthe Department of Justice, the office that provides essential legal \nadvice to the President and the heads of executive departments and \nagencies.\n  In that role, he received the Edmund J. Randolph Award and the \nSecretary of Defense Medal for Outstanding Public Service, among other \nawards. Before serving in the Justice Department, he worked in private \npractice for 10 years and clerked for Justice Clarence Thomas on the \nU.S. Supreme Court and for Judge James L. Buckley on the D.C. Circuit.\n  On June 28, 2017, the Commerce Committee held a hearing on his \nnomination, and we reported his nomination favorably on August 2. Last \nnight, the Senate invoked cloture on his nomination.\n  At his nomination hearing, a number of our Democrat colleagues raised \nconcerns over Mr. Bradbury's suitability for this position, mostly \nfocusing on a number of opinions he wrote regarding interrogation \npolicies while at the Justice Department.\n  I do not doubt the sincerity of those who question the Bush \nadministration's approach to detainee treatment in the wake of the \nhorrific attacks of 9/11. I know that these concerns are not limited to \na single party.\n  Nevertheless, I would suggest that Mr. Bradbury has demonstrated a \nwillingness to reexamine the difficult decisions made at that time in a \nmanner that underscores the thoughtfulness he would bring to the \nposition to which he has been nominated.\n  For example, after he became the head of the Office of Legal Counsel \nin 2004, he participated in decisions to withdraw and supersede \nprevious legal opinions addressing interrogation policies that had been \nissued by his predecessors.\n  In response to questions for the record from some of my committee \ncolleagues, Mr. Bradbury elaborated on this topic. Specifically, he \nsaid:\n\n       I support the McCain-Feinstein Amendment, enacted by \n     Congress in 2015, which mandates that all agencies of the \n     U.S. government are limited to use of the Army Field Manual \n     in the interrogation of detainees and which prohibits the use \n     of physical coercion. I believe the McCain-Feinstein \n     Amendment represents a historic policy decision and a moral \n     judgment for the United States, and it reaffirms America's \n     leadership on interrogation policy and practice. The clear \n     mandate of the McCain-Feinstein Amendment appropriately \n     elevates and vindicates the compelling principle of \n     reciprocity in the treatment of captured U.S. service men and \n     women.\n\n  Mr. Bradbury went on to say:\n\n       Twelve years ago, when I was called upon to advise on the \n     legality of proposed interrogation policies for use by \n     intelligence officers, the McCain-Feinstein Amendment had not \n     been enacted, and it was understood at that time that \n     intelligence agencies operated under a different, less well \n     defined, legal regime from the U.S. Armed Services. I did my \n     best to pull back previous OLC opinions that were overly \n     broad or otherwise flawed; to limit OLC's advice to the \n     narrowest grounds necessary and avoid reliance on expansive \n     interpretations of presidential power; to spell out very \n     clearly the specific factual assumptions on which the advice \n     depended, including the particular conditions, limitations, \n     and safeguards that were required as part of the policies; \n     and to describe in detail the specifics of those policies so \n     that the senior decision makers on the Principals Committee \n     of the National Security Council would be fully apprised of \n     precisely what they were being asked to approve.\n       The OLC opinions I prepared on these issues are no longer \n     operative, and the law has changed. I welcome the statutory \n     changes enacted by Congress.\n\n  In sum, I believe that Mr. Bradbury has fully addressed these \nconcerns.\n  It is also worth noting that Mr. Bradbury's nomination has received \nthe endorsement of many bipartisan leaders. During his confirmation \nprocess, the committee received letters of support signed by more than \n50 former government officials, including former Transportation \nSecretaries Rodney Slater and Norm Mineta; former Attorneys General Ed \nMeese, William Barr, and Michael Mukasey; former counsel to the \nPresident Fred Fielding; former National Security Advisor Stephen \nHadley; former Solicitors General Ted Olson, Paul Clement, Greg Garre; \nand many others. He also received the support of nearly 20 State \nattorneys general from across the country.\n  Finally, I would also like to address the concerns raised about Mr. \nBradbury's representation of the U.S. subsidiary of Takata in \nconnection with the airbag inflator ruptures before the National \nHighway Traffic Safety Administration.\n  Mr. Bradbury has agreed to go beyond the requirements of his ethics \nagreement to recuse himself from all aspects of the Takata airbag \ninflator recalls for the duration of Mr. Bradbury's tenure as general \ncounsel at the Department of Transportation.\n  Because Mr. Bradbury has agreed to go well beyond what is required by \nfederal ethics laws and regulations, and well beyond the ethics \nagreement he signed with the Office of Government Ethics with respect \nto the Takata airbag inflator recall, I am satisfied that he has more \nthan adequately dealt with conflict of interest concerns and recusals.\n  Moreover, as I have noted, Mr. Bradbury has received bipartisan \nsupport for his nomination, including from former Transportation \nSecretary Rodney Slater and former Transportation Secretary Norm \nMineta.\n  Accordingly, I urge my colleagues to support the nomination of Steven \nBradbury to be general counsel for the Department of Transportation.", "turn": 18, "speaker": "Mr. THUNE", "itemno": 23}, {"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "H001076", "text": "  Ms. HASSAN.
