{"kind": "speech", "speaker_bioguide": "C001078", "text": "  Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize the Oakton Library on \nthe occasion of its 10th anniversary. This project represents the \nfulfillment of a promise I made to this community more than a decade \nago, during my time as both Providence District Supervisor and Chairman \nof the Fairfax County Board of Supervisors.\n   Working with engaged citizens, we identified a need for new meeting \nspace as well as a new library in the Oakton community. But we didn't \nstop there. We rolled up our sleeves and went to work. We worked with \ndevelopers to secure the necessary land, with my colleagues on the \nBoard to secure and pass the necessary bond referendums and with the \ncommunity to raise awareness and support for this necessary addition. \nThese efforts bore fruit and in 2007 we celebrated the dedication of \nthe new Oakton Library. Ten years later, the library stands as a pillar \nof the Oakton community and I am confident that it will continue to \nserve that role for many more decades to come.\n   I wish to give special recognition to the members of the Friends of \nOakton Library, who worked with myself and others side by side on every \nstep of this project. Together, we guided what was once just a concept \ninto a brick-and-mortar reality.\n   We are incredibly fortunate in Fairfax County to have such dedicated \ncitizens, who go out of their way for the betterment of the lives of \nothers. I have often said that local government is where the rubber \nmeets the road. The level of accountability is absolute. You either \nsolved the problem or you didn't . . . and everyone knows where you \nlive and has your phone number! My colleagues on the Board of \nSupervisors and I accomplished a lot together during my time in Fairfax \nCounty government, but the completion of the Oakton Library remains one \nof my proudest moments in local government. A testament to what can \nhappen when like-minded individuals are willing to back up their words \nand desires with concrete, often unglamorous actions. The Oakton \ncommunity and indeed all of Fairfax County is better off today because \npeople were willing to put in the work.\n   Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating the \nFriends of Oakton Library and the entire Oakton community on this \nimportant anniversary. I commend them for their contributions to \nFairfax County and wish them great success in all their future \nendeavors. I am confident that we will be observing many more \nanniversaries of this library still to come.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. CONNOLLY", "itemno": 2}
