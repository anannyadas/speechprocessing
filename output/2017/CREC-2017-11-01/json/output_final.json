Mr. Speaker, I rise today to ask the United States \\nHouse of Representatives to join me in recognizing Meredith Corey-\\nDisch, a leader and business owner in my district, who was a recipient \\nof a spot at the James Beard Foundation's Inaugural Class of the \\nWomen's Entrepreneurial Leadership Fellowship program. This program, \\nhosted at the prestigious Babson College, aims to help female chefs and \\nowners grow their businesses by cultivating women's leadership in the \\nculinary industry.\\n   Meredith Corey-Disch and her business partner, Sarah Bogdanovitch, \\nare exceptional entrepreneurs. Their business was founded on the belief \\nthat it should be local, community focused space that provides organic, \\ntraditional foods with shared work and fair pay. ``Community Loaves'' \\nbegan in 2011 in Jacksonville, as an organic bike-delivered \\nsubscription bakery. The pair then opened a bread shop in 2014, where \\nthey served all-organic bread and pastries for breakfast and lunch. \\nThey kept the business community focused by holding special pizza \\nnights and farm to table dinners in their garden and invited \\nsurrounding neighbors to these events.\\n   Meredith began her love of bread making through an apprenticeship in \\na bakery, while brainstorming ways she could start a business people \\nwould enjoy back in her hometown of Jacksonville. She can be described \\nas thoughtful, kind, generous, and creative. With these skills, along \\nwith her passion of bread making, Meredith will continue to spread her \\npassion throughout Northeast Florida. We need more creative small \\nbusiness owners like Meredith. She has been a true example of \\nleadership for women in Northeast Florida and I look forward to seeing \\nher future culinary successes.\\n   Mr. Speaker, I applaud Meredith Corey-Disch for her leadership in \\nnot only the culinary community, but in Northeast Florida as well.\\n\", u'turn': 0, u'speaker': u'Mr. RUTHERFORD', u'itemno': 2}, {u'kind': u'linebreak', u'speaker_bioguide': None, u'text': u'                          ____________________\\n\\n\\n', u'turn': -1, u'speaker': u'None', u'itemno': 3}], u'header': {u'extension': True, u'vol': u'163', u'wkday': u'Wednesday', u'chamber': u'House', u'num': u'177', u'year': u'2017', u'month': u'November', u'pages': u'E1485', u'day': u'1'}, u'doc_title': u'HONORING THE ENTREPRENEURIAL SPIRIT OF MEREDITH COREY-DISCH, OWNER OF COMMUNITY LOAVES', u'id': u'CREC-2017-11-01-pt1-PgE1485', u'title': u'HONORING THE ENTREPRENEURIAL SPIRIT OF MEREDITH COREY-DISCH, OWNER OF  COMMUNITY LOAVES'}{u'content': [{u'kind': u'linebreak', u'speaker_bioguide': None, u'text': u'                                 ______\\n', u'turn': -1, u'speaker': u'None', u'itemno': 0}, {u'kind': u'title', u'speaker_bioguide': None, u'text': u'                            HON.

Mr. Speaker, I have a map beside me. It is not a Verizon \\nor an AT&T map showing its coverage. What this is is a snapshot, a \\nmoment in time, of the number of airplanes in the United States' \\nairspace at any moment, over 90,000 flights a day. Think about that. \\nThat is over 200,000 takeoffs and landings.\\n  We, in the United States, have the safest and the busiest airspace in \\nthe world; yet there are some in Congress who want to privatize this to \\na board made up of 13 members only. I personally think it is more of a \\nmonopolization, not a privatization of our airspace.\\n  This is the taxpayers' airspace. This is not the airspace that we \\nshould be giving away to a 13-member board, or the control of.\\n  Those who want to pass this AIRR Act, H.R. 2997, want us to compare \\nit to Canada. Well, I have flown in Canada. Look at the map: below the \\nline in the United States, above the line in Canada. It is not even \\napples to apples. It is not apples to oranges. It is apples to \\nelephants.\\n  And you say, well, that makes no sense. No, it doesn't. It does not \\nmake any sense to give control of this airspace, where our wonderful \\nmen in uniform and women who fly the military aircraft, the pilots like \\nmyself, but, more importantly, the carriers that carry all of us to \\nhere and there, the ability to control this airspace.\\n  I am a small-government guy, Mr. Speaker, but there are three \\ninstances where government needs to be involved in the lives of our \\ncitizens: national defense, national intelligence, and national \\nairspace.\\n  I would argue that I have probably been in more control towers than \\nany Member of Congress, and when you walk in, there are wonderful \\ncontrollers who are looking at modern equipment, computer screens, \\ndisplay lights, who are moving aircraft here and there, very \\nefficiently, very professionally.\\n  There are those who have stood at this podium, Mr. Speaker, and held \\nup pieces of paper like this and have scared our people into saying: \\nOh, this is the way controllers transfer control of airplanes from \\nairspace to airspace.\\n  That is a gross mischaracterization of what is happening. They use \\nthis as a backup if a grid goes down, but they don't use it to move \\ntraffic. They use modern computers.\\n\\n  The NextGen, or what we call the next generation of modernization of \\nFAA, is called ADS-B, Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast. It \\nallows separation of aircraft to come down. It has saved billions--that \\nis with a B--in fuel and other costs, and yet we want to give all this \\nmodern equipment to the control of a 13-member board? I think not.\\n  We have all had delays in airports. Most of them, I will tell you, \\nare weather. But how many of us have pulled up in a plane and we are \\nwaiting for another plane to back out of a gate? That is not an air \\ntraffic control issue. That is an issue with controlling the gates at \\nthe airport, and that goes back to the airlines.\\n  How many of us have been delayed because they come on and when we are \\njust fixing to board the plane, oh, you have a maintenance issue, or we \\nare waiting for another pilot crew to get off one aircraft to pilot \\nyour aircraft? Again, those who would want to pass this act would make \\nyou believe that that is air traffic control's fault. No, it does not \\nhave to do with air traffic control.\\n  CBO has said that if we give this airspace control to a 13-member \\nprivate board, it will cause a $100 billion deficit addition--$100 \\nbillion. The Congressional Review Service has said that if we do that, \\nthat automatically allows sequester to take place. We don't need that. \\nWe are trying to get out of that now. Our wonderful men and women in \\nuniform are having a hard enough time meeting quotas, meeting \\nequipment, meeting training, everything, because of the sequester.\\n  This would hurt military retirement funding. This would hurt our \\nBorder Patrol, men and women there protecting us from terrorist \\nactivity on a daily basis.\\n  Mr. Speaker, we need modernization, but we don't need privatization. \\nIt is a bad idea any way you look at it.\\n  We do need to pass a long-term FAA reauthorization act. I am all for \\nthat. Our FAA needs to have the stability of funding where they can \\nlook down the road more than 6 months at a time and plan for what is \\ncoming down and what they need to do to keep our airspace safe.\\n  So, Mr. Speaker, we don't need this H.R. 2997 passed. We need just to \\nfund FAA for a long time.\\n\", u'turn': 1, u'speaker': u'Mr. ABRAHAM', u'itemno': 1}, {u'kind': u'linebreak', u'speaker_bioguide': None, u'text': u'                          ____________________\\n\\n\\n', u'turn': -1, u'speaker': u'None', u'itemno': 2}], u'header': {u'extension': False, u'vol': u'163', u'wkday': u'Wednesday', u'chamber': u'House', u'num': u'177', u'year': u'2017', u'month': u'November', u'pages': u'H8303', u'day': u'1'}, u'related_bills': [{u'type': u'HR', u'congress': u'115', u'context': u'FIRSTPARAGRAPH', u'number': u'2997'}, {u'type': u'HR', u'congress': u'115', u'context': u'OTHER', u'number': u'2997'}], u'doc_title': u'SETTING THE RECORD STRAIGHT ON OUR AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL SYSTEM', u'id': u'CREC-2017-11-01-pt1-PgH8303'}{u'content': [{u'text': u'  (Mr. DENHAM asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \\nminute and to revise and extend his remarks.)', u'kind': u'Unknown', u'speaker': u'Unknown', u'itemno': 0, u'turn': -1}], u'header': {u'extension': False, u'vol': u'163', u'wkday': u'Wednesday', u'chamber': u'House', u'num': u'177', u'year': u'2017', u'month': u'November', u'pages': u'H8307', u'day': u'1'}, u'doc_title': u'CHAMPIONING HEALTHY KIDS', u'id': u'CREC-2017-11-01-pt1-PgH8307-6', u'title': u'CHAMPIONING HEALTHY KIDS'}{u'title': u'CLIMATE SOLUTIONS CAUCUS', u'content': [{u'kind': u'speech', u'speaker_bioguide': None, u'text': u\"  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today as a member of the Climate \\nSolutions Caucus to speak on the issue of climate change. The caucus is \\na bipartisan group of members committed to implementing economically \\nviable options to reduce climate risk.\\n  The caucus has a ``Noah's Ark'' membership rule. Members can only \\njoin in pairs, one from each party. Under the leadership of co-chairs \\nMr. Curbelo and Mr. Deutch, the caucus is helping to break the partisan \\ngridlock on this issue and show that promoting climate solutions can be \\ntruly bipartisan.\\n  The formation and rapid growth of the Climate Solutions Caucus \\nrepresents a recognition of both the challenges and opportunities and \\nhas demonstrated that there is bipartisan will to take action.\\n  In recognition of the fact that 60 Members of Congress have come \\ntogether to fight climate change in a bipartisan fashion, I organized \\nthis time for my colleagues to join me on the floor to let the American \\npeople know what we, as their elected leaders, are doing to address \\nclimate change.\\n  We know, from scientific evidence, that our climate is changing. The \\nglobal average temperature has increased by about 1.4 degrees \\nFahrenheit over the last 100 years. Sea levels are rising, the ocean is \\nbecoming more acidic, precipitation patterns are changing, and heat \\nwaves are becoming more frequent and longer in duration.\\n  Each of these changes produces a cascade of effects that impact our \\nlives and livelihoods, including flooding, changes in crop yields, \\npower shortages, declines in fisheries, and increases in cardiovascular \\ndisease.\\n  Recent events in our own country, such as devastating hurricanes in \\nthe Southeast and wildfires in the West have brought this issue to the \\nforefront of everyone's minds. Now climate\\n\\n\\nchange can't be directly blamed for all these problems, but the \\nevidence strongly suggests that it contributes to each of them, and \\nthere are things that we can do to limit its effects.\\n  Climate change also has a significant impact on public health. A \\ngroundbreaking study published just this week in a medical journal, The \\nLancet, unequivocally showed that climate change is a serious public \\nhealth threat. The study involved 24 institutions from around the world \\nand included staggering statistics, such as the fact that air pollution \\ncaused 1.9 million premature deaths in Asia in 2015, and that the range \\nof common disease-transmitting mosquitoes increased 9.5 percent since \\n1950.\\n  We know that high temperatures exasperate health problems and that \\nburning fossil fuels creates pollution that causes cardiovascular \\ndisease. The National Academies estimate that air pollution causes \\naround $120 billion per year in health-related damages, including \\nhealthcare costs, missed days of work and school, and premature death.\\n  We also know that changing climate has altered the range, in some \\ncases accelerated the spread of vector-borne diseases likes Zika and \\nthe West Nile virus. Responsibly transitioning to a clean energy \\neconomy will not only reduce the greenhouse gas emissions that \\ncontribute to climate change, but it will also reduce air pollution and \\nhelp all Americans breathe easier.\\n  What I want to talk about for a few minutes, before I turn to some of \\nmy colleagues, is a very common misperception about the relationship \\nbetween implementing climate solutions and growing jobs.\\n  Some people think that this is a zero-sum game. That is, they think \\nif you have more of one, you get less of the other. But that is simply \\nnot true.\\n  Implementing climate solutions can grow jobs, especially new high-\\npaying jobs. The U.S. needs to take advantage of these economic \\nopportunities. Regardless of what we do here in the U.S., the rest of \\nthe world has committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions and \\nreaching the targets laid out in the Paris Agreement, as have many \\ncities, States, and companies here at home.\\n  To achieve that goal, significant technological development and \\ninnovation will be needed, as well as infrastructure, markets, and \\ndistribution channels to get that technology to the people and places \\nthat need it.\\n  The national economies that produce this clean energy technology will \\nbenefit greatly. The U.S. still leads the world in technology and \\ninnovation. Countries around the world try to recreate the innovation \\nethos that exists in Silicon Valley and in other places across our \\nNation.\\n  The United States also has the workers who are needed to build these \\ninnovations. So we have what it takes, and if we seize the opportunity \\nto invest in clean and climate-resilient technologies, then our economy \\nand the American people will benefit as the world adapts to climate \\nchange and America grows good-paying jobs all across our Nation.\\n  But if we let this opportunity pass us by, then profits and jobs will \\ninstead flow to foreign countries that develop the technologies the \\nworld needs, and American cities and States will be forced to buy \\nforeign products as they upgrade to climate-resilient infrastructure.\\n\\n\\n  That is why I will soon be introducing a bill called Challenges and \\nPrizes for Climate Act. This bill will establish five or more prize \\nchallenges overseen by the Department of Energy to harness the \\ningenuity of the research community in the private sector to solve big, \\ncomplex climate problems.\\n  Challenges have been used in the past by a wide range of \\norganizations, including the XPRIZE, who used the challenge to jump-\\nstart the commercial space transportation industry. This industry is \\nnow flourishing.\\n  I was just recently at SpaceX in California and saw their impressive \\nmanufacturing facility they have there. The U.S. is now relying on \\nSpaceX in order to bring supplies up to the International Space Station \\nand their plans to soon be flying astronauts. This commercial space \\ntransportation industry began with those who reached to try to meet \\nthis challenge and get the XPRIZE.\\n  The Federal Trade Commission also used the prize challenge to help \\nbring a robocall blocking service to the market, something that we can \\nall very much appreciate. That is why I am going this direction.\\n  My bill will create challenges that fall under five themes: carbon \\ncapture and reuse, energy efficiency, energy storage, climate \\nadaptation and resiliency, and data analytics for better climate \\npredictions.\\n  Using authority from the America COMPETES Act, the Department of \\nEnergy will convene working groups from across agencies, universities, \\nnonprofits and the private sector to help plan the challenges, and even \\nto contribute to the prizes.\\n  The goal of the challenge is not just to reward the winner of the \\nbest solution, but also to bring visibility to the range of innovations \\ncompeting for the prize and to help society envision the future. This \\nbill will help us see what our clean energy future will look like, and \\nI urge all of my colleagues to support it.\\n  Mr. Speaker, I want to begin hearing from the bipartisan group of \\nclimate leaders who have joined me here on the floor this evening.\\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. \\nFitzpatrick), my Republican colleague.\", u'turn': 3, u'speaker': u'Mr. LIPINSKI', u'itemno': 4}, {u'kind': u'speech', u'speaker_bioguide': u'F000466', u'text': u\"  Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague, Mr. Lipinski, for \\nhis leadership on this issue.\\n  Mr. Speaker, serving as good stewards of our environment is something \\nthat each and every one of us are called to do no matter who we are or \\nwhere we come from.\\n  It is critical in order to preserve public health. The reality is \\nclimate change is real and humans are a contributing factor. Congress \\nmust take serious and reasonable steps to combat it.\\n  As an Eagle Scout and a conservationist who grew up in Bucks County, \\nPennsylvania, I have always been captivated by the natural beauty of \\nour open spaces and wild places. We have it all in Bucks County: \\npreserved farmland, amazing parks, expansive forests, and historic \\nrivers. I believe that with these natural treasures comes a special \\nresponsibility to care for and protect our natural resources at the \\nlocal, State, and Federal level.\\n  Climate change and the irresponsible management of our resources put \\na strain on the health of our communities and our children. Clean air \\nand clean water are essential to the health, safety, and well-being of \\nthe next generation of Americans.\\n  Mr. Speaker, protecting our Nation's open spaces unites us as \\nAmericans. That is why I joined 16 other House Republicans on House \\nResolution 195 to encourage American innovation to improve \\nenvironmental policy and to protect, conserve, and be good stewards of \\nour environment.\\n  I introduced the Udall-Eisenhower Arctic Wilderness Act, H.R. 1889, \\nwith Congressman Jared Huffman from California. This bill designates \\nthe 1.5 million-acre land of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge as a \\ncomponent of the National Wilderness Preservation System to protect it \\nfrom damaging activities like oil and gas drilling.\\n  I have voted to protect the methane rule for stream protections.\\n  The Climate Solutions Caucus will continue to be the group that shows \\nWashington how to forego the political gamesmanship and get to work on \\nways we can improve our environment, address the realities of climate \\nchange, and increase innovation with an eye towards sustainability.\\n  Protecting our environment cannot be partisan, Mr. Speaker. We have \\nto come together to get this done as Americans.\", u'turn': 4, u'speaker': u'Mr. FITZPATRICK', u'itemno': 5}, {u'kind': u'speech', u'speaker_bioguide': u'L000563', u'text': u'  Mr. LIPINSKI.

Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Lipinski for his leadership on \\nthis.\\n  Mr. Speaker, I want to talk a little bit about climate. We know that \\nclimate is changing, and we have seen it.\\n\\n\\nIn California, we had horrific wildfires that claimed 40 lives and \\ndestroyed thousands of structures. We have seen hurricanes more \\nfrequently, more devastating, and more powerful than ever before. So \\nthe effects are there. We see it happening.\\n  Now, the thing that we are faced with is that there is a significant \\nsection of people that deny climate change. You can sort of see why \\nthey are denying it. I mean, if something is in your interest, you are \\ngoing to be able to talk yourself into just about anything.\\n  The big benefit of denying climate change is that we can continue to \\nuse fossil fuels. If you are a company that uses fossil fuels or \\nproduces fossil fuels, yeah, this is what you want. But there are costs \\nof denial, and the costs of denial are clear.\\n  We are seeing weather. We just talked about that. We are seeing \\nhealth effects. We have seen that both in terms of elevated \\ntemperatures, causing people to have heat problems. We are seeing \\ndisease vectors moving to the temperate zones from the Equator. We are \\nalso going to see significant infrastructure costs, like we see in \\nPuerto Rico now. These are real costs that we are going to pay for the \\ndenial of climate change.\\n\\n  Now, what are the benefits of climate change?\\n  Well, there are significant benefits, from my point of view.\\n  First of all, we have been spending American taxpayer dollars to \\ndevelop technology to fight climate change, or to reduce carbon \\nemissions.\\n  I will tell you a little story about my own career. I was working at \\na company called U.S. Wind Power. With some amount of taxpayer dollars, \\nwe developed the leading technology for wind energy. Of course, what \\nhappened was that the funding stopped, tax credits ended, and that \\ntechnology that we developed with taxpayer dollars went to Europe. They \\nbuilt thousands of windmills in Germany, and they made a lot of money \\nbased on that technology that we developed and paid for right in the \\nUnited States of America.\\n  We also know that renewable energy production creates more jobs than \\nfossil fuel production for the same amount of energy. We are talking \\nabout a potential to create millions of jobs in this country. Not only \\nthat, but renewable energy has a stable price market feature. Unlike \\nfossil fuels, which have highs and lows over a 10-year cycle, fossil \\nfuels are going to be nice and stable, will be predictable. And \\nbusinesses love predictability. So I think this is also another very \\ngood argument.\\n  Lastly, if we reduce fossil fuels and go to clean energy, we are \\ngoing to have cleaner air and cleaner water, a healthier environment, \\nand we can reach sustainability. I think the benefits are pretty clear.\\n  So where are we now?\\n  Well, there are still significant resources out there determined to \\nmuddy the waters and confuse people about climate change. I have three \\npublications here I want to illustrate. One is called ``Clexit for a \\nBrighter Future.'' Now, the point of this is that we need to exit the \\nParis and United States climate treaties because fossil fuels are what \\nwe need to power the future.\\n  Another one is called ``The Mad, Mad, Mad World of Climatism.'' This \\none, if you look it up, is biased, and it seems to be paid for by oil \\ninterests.\\n  The last one I want to show is a respected magazine that is called \\nNational Geographic. And the cover page shows ``The War on Science.''\\n  So I think we have a pretty good case to make for moving forward with \\naction on climate change.\\n  There will be significant costs if we don't. Renewable energy is more \\nthan cost competitive these days. As I mentioned, I worked in the wind \\nenergy business. We see wind and solar being more cost competitive--\\nmore than cost competitive, really--with coal and oil for energy \\nproduction.\\n  So we have the technology, we have the means, and we have the desire \\nto do this, yet we are still hung up here in Washington in terms of \\nfollowing through with government support that is needed with the right \\nsort of policies that will encourage us to reduce fossil fuel \\nreduction.\\n  Now, one of the great bright spots we see--as Mr. Lipinski, my friend \\nfrom Illinois, pointed out--is that there is a bipartisan Climate \\nSolutions Caucus that has been formed over the last two terms. In order \\nto join, you have to have a Member of the other party. If I am a \\nDemocrat, I have a Member of the Republican Party join.\\n  What we are doing in that caucus is creating legislation that will \\nhelp reduce carbon emissions in an economic and prosperous way. I think \\ngood things have a potential to happen. I encourage the caucus to \\ncontinue, and I hope it continues to grow.\", u'turn': 6, u'speaker': u'Mr. McNERNEY', u'itemno': 7}, {u'kind': u'speech', u'speaker_bioguide': u'L000563', u'text': u'  Mr. LIPINSKI.

Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman Lipinski, my friend from \\nIllinois, for holding this Special Order this evening, to highlight the \\nimportant work being done by the Climate Solutions Caucus, to develop \\neconomically viable solutions to address climate change.\\n  Mr. Speaker, changing weather patterns and extreme weather events \\nthreaten nearly every aspect of New York State's economy, including our \\nagricultural and outdoor recreational sectors. The recreational economy \\nalone generates $42 billion in consumer spending each year, while \\nsupporting over 300,000 Empire State jobs. As we work to address \\nclimate change in a bipartisan manner, we must employ a variety of \\ntechniques that both mitigate impacts and support economic growth.\\n  I am currently working with my Agriculture Committee colleagues on \\nconservation legislation for the next farm bill that will provide \\nimportant data points on conservation programs and outcomes, allowing \\nlegislators and regulators to most efficiently use taxpayer dollars to \\nachieve real conservation results for our farms. These incentive \\nprograms support farming practices that, among other benefits, like \\nincreasing yield, lowering the amount of fertilizers that are employed, \\npull carbon from the air and sequester it in the soil.\\n  In addition to sequestering carbon in the soil. We can also work to \\nreduce emissions through greater efficiency in the transportation \\nsector. Indeed, the transportation sector is one area where \\nCO2 emissions have risen in the last 20 years, unlike, for \\ninstance, the electric generation sector.\\n  One easy fix would be to modernize the air traffic control system to \\nfly planes on more direct satellite guided routes because direct routes \\nsave fuel. When Canada switched to a modern air traffic control system, \\nthe national fleet was able to reduce emissions in that nation by \\nmillions of tons per year.\\n  These commonsense changes are great steps forward in combating \\nclimate change, but our work is far from over. We must address the real \\nimpacts of man-made climate change and emphasize the need to develop \\nand create jobs with a goal of protecting our environment. It is \\ncritical that we work together to develop smart solutions that will \\nconserve our natural resources and protect our communities and \\ninfrastructure for future generations.\\n\\n  Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to be a member of the Climate \\nSolutions Caucus, and I look forward to working with my colleagues. I, \\nparticularly, want to applaud our distinguished friend from Illinois, \\nMr. Lipinski, for organizing this Special Order tonight on a bipartisan \\nbasis so that we can address this issue and allow the folks at home and \\nall around the United States to better understand the work that is \\nbeing done here in Congress on a bipartisan basis to address climate \\nchange.\", u'turn': 8, u'speaker': u'Mr. FASO', u'itemno': 9}, {u'kind': u'speech', u'speaker_bioguide': u'L000563', u'text': u'  Mr. LIPINSKI. Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Faso for his work, \\nunderstanding that we are only going to make progress on this through \\nbipartisan action. I am very happy to join working with him on the \\nClimate Solutions Caucus to bring that action forward.\\n  Mr. Speaker, my next speaker is a woman who I work with on the \\nScience, Space, and Technology Committee, who has done some fantastic \\nwork on that committee, especially when it comes to the issue of \\nclimate change and dealing with climate change.\\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Oregon (Ms. Bonamici).\\n\\n', u'turn': 9, u'speaker': u'Mr. LIPINSKI', u'itemno': 10}, {u'kind': u'speech', u'speaker_bioguide': u'B001278', u'text': u\"  Ms. BONAMICI. Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Lipinski for yielding and also \\nfor\\n\\n\\norganizing this Special Order for the Climate Solutions Caucus. I also \\nwant to thank the founders of the Climate Solutions Caucus, Congressman \\nTed Deutch from Florida and Congressman Carlos Curbelo also from \\nFlorida, where they can see at their doorstep what issues like sea \\nlevel rise mean to their communities.\\n  Mr. Speaker, I am really pleased to join with my colleagues from the \\nbipartisan Climate Solutions Caucus this evening to highlight the \\nimportance of taking action on climate change, something that matters \\nso much to my constituents at home in Oregon, but also to the country \\nand to the planet.\\n  This is an important issue that really is a moral imperative. This is \\nabout preserving our natural resources for our children, our \\ngrandchildren, and for generations to come. Addressing climate change \\nis also vital to our Nation's economy, as we have had some discussion \\nabout that this evening, and also to national security, but, really, \\nthe health of the planet.\\n  Now, the district I am honored to represent out in Oregon is \\nbreathtakingly beautiful, and it is really full of potential. The \\nmajestic Columbia River is the northern boundary of the district, and \\nthe rugged Pacific Ocean is on the western boundary. It has a thriving \\noutdoor recreation economy. As my colleague from New York mentioned, \\nthat is an important sector that cares a lot about the changing \\nclimate.\\n  I also have in my district the heart of Oregon wine country. People \\nin my district fish. They fish in our rivers, our lakes, and our ocean. \\nThey hike in our forests. They ski in our back country and on our \\nmountains. We rely on those natural resources in our backyard to \\nsupport a significant part of our economy, but we are very vulnerable \\nto the effects of climate change.\\n  My constituents are already experiencing challenges: Our wine and \\nagricultural industries are concerned about drought as global \\ntemperatures continue to rise. Coastal communities are worried about \\nthe vitality of the commercial fishing and shellfish industries as high \\nlevels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere change ocean chemistry.\\n  I was really thrilled that we had an Oregonian from Oregon State \\nUniversity come to the Climate Solutions Caucus and talk about adapting \\nto ocean acidification.\\n  Our region has faced higher spring and summer temperatures and \\nearlier snowmelt, and, as a result, a snowboard shop in my district is \\nnow selling more skateboards and fewer snowboards.\\n  Climate change is not a partisan issue. Nationwide, fishers, farmers, \\nsmall-business owners, and our servicemen and -women are changing the \\nway they do their jobs because of climate change, regardless of \\npolitical affiliation.\\n  The economic, health, and environmental consequences of climate \\nchange are well known, and our understanding about how to address \\nclimate change continues to improve.\\n  People in the United States and around the world are facing threats \\nfrom rising sea levels, from ocean acidification, from more frequent \\nand severe weather events from record droughts and flooding and rising \\nglobal temperatures. We can no longer sit back and debate whether we \\nshould take action. The time is now. It is critical that we support \\nscientific research about the climate and that we build on, rather than \\nbreak down, decades' worth of progress on this issue.\\n  Now, one important area of research is the connection between extreme \\nweather events and climate change. Although it is not possible to say \\nthat climate change causes one particular extreme weather event, it is \\ncritical that we know more about climate change and how it increases \\nthe frequency and the severity of these events. Learning more about \\nthis correlation can help families, communities, and businesses make \\ninformed choices and adopt climate strategies.\\n  Now, this year has seen poignant example after example with so many \\ndevastating extreme weather events. We need to do everything we can to \\nmake sure our communities are prepared to keep families safe.\\n  We have had wildfires in the Western United States for a long time, \\nbut since the mid-1980s, they have been increasing in frequency and in \\nduration, threatening lives, threatening public health and property. It \\nhas been unusually hot and very dry in the Northwest.\\n  Fires and severe smoke create dangerous conditions for all \\npopulations. In Portland, Oregon, on Labor Day, the sky was gray, full \\nof smoke from wildfire. This is especially problematic for pregnant \\nwomen, for seniors, for children, for anyone with chronic health \\nconditions like asthma. Residents and communities miles away from the \\nwildfires saw ash falling on their homes, their cars, and throughout \\ntheir neighborhoods.\\n  This year's hurricanes have devastated communities, of course, across \\nTexas, across the Southeast, and in the U.S. islands. About 70 percent \\nof our fellow citizens in Puerto Rico are still without power.\\n  These storms are increasing in frequency and severity, and lives are \\nbeing lost every year.\\n  Mr. Speaker, it is so important that we take action, and that is why \\nI am so pleased to be here today to help highlight the importance of \\nthis issue.\\n  As Representative Lipinski noted and others have, Mr. McNerney and \\nothers, we can take action to address climate change and grow the \\neconomy. It is not an excuse to say this will be bad for the economy, \\nbecause we can grow those renewable energy industries. There is so much \\npotential in wind power, wave energy, solar energy. Those are good, \\nhigh-paying, family-wage jobs. We can grow those economies and address \\nclimate change at the same time.\\n  Mr. Speaker, addressing climate change is going to save lives; it is \\ngoing to save property. I am so pleased to be part of this bipartisan \\ngroup that is working together in equal number of Democrats and \\nRepublicans to call attention to this important issue, and I will \\ncontinue to work with the caucus to emphasize the importance of \\ncongressional action.\\n  Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues on the bipartisan Climate \\nSolutions Caucus for their dedication to this effort. I know it is \\nquite a relief to my constituents back home in Oregon to know that \\nthere are bipartisan Members who are committed to addressing this \\ncritical issue.\\n\\n  Again, Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues for their dedication to \\nthis effort. I look forward to the progress that we will make together \\non behalf of our constituents, our communities, our country, and our \\nplanet.\", u'turn': 10, u'speaker': u'Ms. BONAMICI', u'itemno': 11}, {u'kind': u'speech', u'speaker_bioguide': u'L000563', u'text': u'  Mr. LIPINSKI.

Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend, Mr. Lipinski, for \\nyielding and for his thoughtful and passionate leadership in combating \\nclimate change, and thanks to the strong bipartisan cross section of \\nMembers who have come to the floor tonight to talk about the importance \\nof tackling climate change.\\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today to call on my colleagues, all of them, to \\njoin the bipartisan Climate Solutions Caucus. I started this caucus \\nwith my fellow Floridian, Congressman Carlos Curbelo, to start a new \\ndialogue around climate and Congress because we are already facing \\ndifficult challenges. We can't ignore it. We can't bury it in political \\nfights. We need to have an open discussion not only for our future, but \\nfor the impact of climate change that we are facing today.\\n  It is no coincidence that this project started with two Members from \\nsouth Florida. A 2015 study projected that some south Florida cities \\ncould be underwater within this century. The study's author said some \\ncities appear already to be lost.\\n  Climate change is already here for Floridians. The effects have hit \\nFlorida first.\\n  Scientists have warned of warming average global temperatures and the \\nchanging climate for decades. Dr. Andrew Clarke of the British \\nAntarctic Survey has spent 40 years at the bottom of the planet \\nwatching it disappear. Dr. Clarke said: ``You can see the entire \\nenvironment changing in front of your eyes.''\\n  We now have climate change right before our eyes in south Florida. We \\nsee the rate of sea level rise outpace the global rate tenfold. We see \\nthe high-water mark jump 1 inch every\\n\\n\\nyear. Just this week, we see the tides flooding our neighborhoods.\\n  The limestone that serves as the foundation of our State is porous. \\nSaltwater pushes up through the limestone from below the surface.\\n  Lower bridge heights will block boats from reaching open waters. With \\n165 miles of canals, Fort Lauderdale faces significant threats of \\nrising seas. Who in south Florida hasn't driven around their \\nneighborhood and noticed more puddles, more water accumulating on the \\nsidewalks and streets?\\n  While many Americans might be able to ignore climate change, ignore \\nthe science, based on their own personal experience and your own \\npersonal experience at home, we can't. Looking out our windows, we see \\nwhat is already there.\\n  By the year 2100, almost 300 U.S. cities would lose at least half of \\ntheir homes, and 36 American cities could be completely destroyed. One \\nin eight Florida homes could be underwater. Those Florida homes \\nrepresent half of the total expected loss in housing value caused by \\nclimate change over the next 84 years. These aren't risks of a distant \\nfuture. These are the burdens we are placing on our children and on our \\ngrandchildren.\\n  In response, and through the work of the South Florida Climate \\nCompact, Miami Beach has initiated a sea level rise plan to lift roads, \\nbuild up seawalls, and install pumps to clear water in the streets. \\nFort Lauderdale is fixing roads and drains and sending vacuum trucks \\ninto the streets to prevent saltwater damage, upgrading building codes \\nand flood elevation requirements, and requiring higher seawalls.\\n  In Florida, you can't put climate change out of sight or out of mind, \\nbut it is not just hitting Florida and it is not just the sea level \\nrise or increasing temperatures.\\n  The National Climate Assessment has documented regional climate \\nimpacts hitting every area of the United States:\\n  In the Northeast and Midwest, dramatic increases in heavy \\nprecipitation events overwhelm drains and levies, causing flooding and \\naccelerating erosion;\\n  In the Great Plains and Southwest, drought and wildfires strain \\ndemands for scarce water resources;\\n  In Alaska, receding sea ice and melting glaciers are damaging \\ninfrastructure;\\n  On the coasts, increases in carbon dioxide and warming seas lead to \\ncoral bleaching and ocean acidification that is taking its toll on \\nfisheries and the ecosystems.\\n  The diverse and interconnected impacts that we already see throughout \\nour country explain why we already have 60 Members who belong to this \\nnew dialogue, the Climate Solutions Caucus, 30 Democrats and 30 \\nRepublicans committed to changing the conversation and pushing \\nsolutions that will create more resilient communities.\\n  We are committed to understanding the impacts of climate change, the \\nimpact on our national security; to investing in clean, innovative \\nenergy protection; to protecting our public health; and to overcoming \\nthe political obstacles that hold up public policy solutions.\\n  It is time for Congress to come together and admit the challenges \\nthat our constituents are already facing at home. It is time to build \\nconsensus.\\n  Through the bipartisan Climate Solutions Caucus, we have brought \\ntogether Members from regions in every part of the country who are \\nexperiencing their own climate change challenges. I invite every Member \\nof the House of Representatives to join us. Lift up the voices of your \\nconstituents, your farmers, your city officials, your developers, \\ndoctors, scientists, and, most importantly, the families whom you \\nrepresent.\\n  If you are watching at home, call your Member of Congress and urge \\nthem to join the Climate Solutions Caucus and help us start the \\ndifficult work of building truly bipartisan consensus that will help us \\ntackle climate change together and help us create resilient American \\ncommunities of the future.\\n  Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my friend, Mr. Lipinski, again for \\norganizing tonight's discussion.\", u'turn': 12, u'speaker': u'Mr. DEUTCH', u'itemno': 13}, {u'kind': u'speech', u'speaker_bioguide': u'L000563', u'text': u'  Mr. LIPINSKI.

Mr. Speaker, I applaud my colleague, Mr. Lipinski, for \\npulling this effort together this evening.\\n  Mr. Speaker, climate change is real, and I applaud my colleagues on \\nthe Climate Solutions Caucus for working together in a bipartisan \\neffort to try and find common ground and to seek to work together to \\npass legislation to address this very real threat.\\n  I believe the greatest opportunity we have here is to include efforts \\nto move our Nation toward a greener economy as part of a comprehensive \\ninfrastructure bill.\\n  We must address climate change for three reasons: first, the Earth is \\npart of the divine creation, and we have an obligation to preserve and \\nprotect our precious gift; second, moving toward a green economy that \\nretrofits homes and buildings and installs solar and wind farms will \\ncreate good jobs at good wages that simply cannot be exported; and, \\nthird, the main topic I wish to address this evening, is moving toward \\na green economy, reducing our dependency on foreign oil, and addressing \\nclimate change is essential to our national security.\\n\\n\\n  Americans rarely talk about it and sometimes forget, but we supported \\nOsama bin Laden against the Russians in Afghanistan. We supported \\nSaddam Hussein in Iraq after we lost the Shah after the Iranian \\nRevolution. We supported the Assads in Syria. And we still maintain a \\nclose relationship with the Saudis, despite their support for \\nWahhabism. Why? Because our national economic strategy and security has \\nrelied for decades on access to foreign oil.\\n  Our meddling in local affairs to ensure the oil spigot flowed freely \\nhas sowed distrust across generations throughout the Middle East.\\n  By moving towards a green economy and eliminating our dependence on \\nforeign oil, we can clearly say to the Middle East: We never wanted \\nyour land, we never wanted your money, and now we don't need your oil. \\nAll we want is for people of the region to stop trying to kill each \\nother. It will take some time, but moving towards an economy \\nindependent of foreign oil is the best way to get there.\\n  In addition to eliminating our dependence on foreign oil, we must try \\nto stall the rapid rise in extreme weather events, droughts, and \\ndesertification that is destabilizing huge swaths of the Middle East \\nand Africa. The number of refugees in the world has grown from 35 \\nmillion only 10 years ago to 65 million today. War and violence are \\nexacerbated by the instability caused by climate change.\\n  One of the most violent regions in the world today is Syria. The \\ninstability in Syria began with droughts that destroyed the livelihoods \\nof the Syrian people that rely upon an economy which is 85 percent \\nagrarian. When people lost their farms, they fled to the cities looking \\nfor work, but, of course, they could not find it. Then they looked to \\nthe Assad government, but, of course, were ignored. Fomented by the \\nArab Spring, they began to revolt. The result? The Syrian Government \\nhas killed almost a half million of its own people and millions more \\nrefugees. This story is being repeated throughout the region.\\n  Although the people suffering are thousands of miles away from the \\nUnited States, our national security is threatened by these failing \\nstates. The rise of ISIS in Syria and Iraq is a prime example of the \\nimpact of failed states on Western security. Mass migrations by those \\nseeking to alleviate suffering, millions seeking political and economic \\nreforms place pressure on corrupt and incompetent governments that are \\nunable to respond to the needs of a population seeking opportunity and \\nhope.\\n  Our enemies who wish to foment instability--Russia, Iran, North \\nKorea, and violent terrorist factions--are aided by the effects of \\nclimate change and the instability it causes. We must do everything we \\ncan to stall the growth of this nefarious trend.\\n\\n\\n  The good news is that there is a growing bipartisan consensus in the \\nClimate Solutions Caucus and the armed services community that we must \\nact. The Armed Services Committee in the 2008 National Defense \\nAuthorization Act acknowledged that ``climate change is a direct threat \\nto the national security of the United States,'' and that ``the \\nDepartment of Defense must ensure that it is prepared to conduct \\noperations both today and in the future, and that it is prepared to \\naddress the effects of changing climate on threat assessments, \\nresources, and readiness.''\\n  Secretary of Defense Mattis has said, ``Climate change can be a \\ndriver of instability, and the Department of Defense must pay attention \\nto the potential adverse impacts generated by this phenomenon.''\\n  Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Joseph Dunford has said \\nthat climate change and rising sea levels pose serious long-term \\nthreats to the country. The number of natural disasters will increase \\nin the coming years, along with ``the requirement for humanitarian \\nassistance'' and the response required for the military for civilian \\ndisasters.\\n  Mr. Speaker, I want to thank again my colleagues for the work that \\nthey have done to try and bring the issue of climate change to the \\nAmerican people, and to try and find solutions to this very real \\nproblem that is not only affecting us here at home, but our national \\nsecurity throughout the world.\", u'turn': 16, u'speaker': u'Mr. SUOZZI', u'itemno': 17}, {u'kind': u'speech', u'speaker_bioguide': u'L000563', u'text': u'  Mr. LIPINSKI.

Recently, each year has brought \\nwith it record-breaking droughts, hurricanes, and natural disasters.\\n  My home State of California just experienced our deadliest wildfire \\nseason yet. This year alone, natural disasters will cost more than $22 \\nbillion in recovery efforts. That is why I am proud to work with my \\ncolleague and cofounder of the Climate Solutions Caucus, Mr. Curbelo, \\nto introduce the bipartisan Coastal State Climate Preparedness Act, \\nH.R. 3533, which will help coastal States better plan for extreme \\nweather events and implement climate change adaptation strategies.\\n  We can save lives, homes, and billions of tax dollars by encouraging \\nthese vulnerable communities to prepare their infrastructure for the \\nimpacts of climate change.\\n  After severe weather events like Hurricanes Maria and Harvey, it is \\nimperative that we invest in readying our infrastructure for the next \\nextreme weather event. Moreover, we also need to invest in developing \\nrenewable energy sources.\\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues in the House to join me and Mr. \\nCurbelo in this effort.', u'turn': 18, u'speaker': u'Mr. CARBAJAL', u'itemno': 19}, {u'kind': u'speech', u'speaker_bioguide': u'L000563', u'text': u'  Mr. LIPINSKI.

Mr. Speaker, I am grateful to my colleague \\nfrom Illinois for leading this special discussion tonight. I am \\ngrateful to have the opportunity to come here for a few minutes. And \\nmore than anything, I thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, \\nRepublicans and Democrats, who have stepped up and said: Enough of the \\ndemagoguery, enough of the fact-less conversation. Let's focus on what \\nis happening in the world, on how human beings are contributing to it, \\nand let's try to make the situation better.\\n  I oftentimes say that, on this climate issue, neither the deniers nor \\nthe alarmists have much to offer. It is the men and women who are \\nwilling to sit at the table and have a sober conversation that can \\nreally help solve this problem. There are a lot of people who are \\ncounting on us to solve this problem.\\n  Sea level rise is a reality. It is happening all over the world. Mr. \\nSpeaker, you might understand why this might be important to me. I \\nrepresent a community where most people live near sea level and near \\nthe sea. This is a real concern, especially in the Florida Keys, one of \\nthe most attractive and dynamic parts of the country, an area that is \\nrecovering. We hope our fellow Americans will help us continue \\nrecovering after Hurricane Irma.\\n  The Florida Keys and most of south Florida are significantly exposed \\nto this sea level rise challenge, and we know that human activity is at \\nleast, in part, responsible for this dynamic. The Climate Solutions \\nCaucus is not about blaming people. It is not about pointing the \\nfinger. It is about coming up with solutions.\\n  I think there are really three phases to our caucus and our work. The \\nfirst phase was to bring Republicans and Democrats together, sit at the \\ntable, have a discussion about our different perspectives on this \\nissue, invite in some key witnesses to help inform us. We have done \\nthat. We have done a good job. Caucus members have a very good \\nrelationship, a good rapport.\\n  The next phase has been to block anti-climate legislation. We have \\ndone that successfully here with some appropriations amendment where \\nthe caucus has come together and said: No. We are not going to prohibit \\nthe Defense Department from assessing the risks associated with climate \\nchange.\\n  Again, this is critical in my district. I happen to represent Naval \\nAir Station Key West, where the men and women of the Navy work hard to \\ntrain and prepare to defend our country overseas. That is a facility \\nthat is exposed to this threat.\\n  We came together and we defeated an amendment that would have \\nprohibited the Defense Department from assessing these risks.\\n  I am really excited for the next phase of the caucus, which I hope we \\ncan reach during this Congress, which is to find legislation that we \\ncan all get behind and say that these are reasonable solutions that not \\nonly help the environment and help guarantee that we are going to hand \\noff to our children and grandchildren the same beautiful Earth that we \\ninherited, but also that we are going to provide opportunities for \\nAmerican innovation and growth, and new good jobs, high-paying jobs, \\nfor young men and women from all over this country. That is going to be \\nvery exciting, and we are all working together to get to that day where \\nwe can promote an agenda in this Congress that will bring Republicans \\nand Democrats together behind a pro-environment, pro-growth policy that \\nwill save this planet and keep our country on the cutting edge of \\ninnovation, leading the world.\\n  This is a not an issue that we should shy away from. We should rise \\nto this occasion. This is the country that has led the entire world \\nthrough a host of different challenges over the last couple centuries. \\nWe can also do it on this climate issue, but I think we can only do it \\nif we do it together.\\n  Mr. Speaker, I thank all of my colleagues, but especially my \\nDemocratic colleagues tonight who have led this Special Order, \\norganized this Special Order. I think we all would like to invite our \\ncolleagues from both sides of the aisle to join the caucus, especially \\non my side. We are up to 30 Republicans, 30 Democrats. That is very \\nexciting. When I arrived here a couple years ago, I probably had only \\ntwo or three Republican colleagues who were even willing to discuss \\nthis issue, and now there are 30 on the record. Let's keep the caucus \\ngrowing, let's keep it strong, let's work together, and let's change \\nthe world for the better.\", u'turn': 20, u'speaker': u'Mr. CURBELO of Florida', u'itemno': 21}, {u'kind': u'speech', u'speaker_bioguide': u'L000563', u'text': u'  Mr. LIPINSKI.

There will be plenty more to come as we grow this caucus and \\ndo the work that we are here to do.\\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr. Panetta), \\na freshman Member who is already making a big splash here getting a lot \\ndone in Washington, working especially on a bipartisan basis on a lot \\nof these issues, getting some good things done.\\n', u'turn': 21, u'speaker': u'Mr. LIPINSKI', u'itemno': 22}, {u'kind': u'speech', u'speaker_bioguide': u'P000613', u'text': u\"  Mr. PANETTA. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate Mr. Lipinski's kind words, but \\nI\\n\\n\\nthink he and I know best that we had good teachers to help us \\nunderstand what it takes to get things done here in the United States \\nCongress, and, most importantly, that is the ability to work together.\\n  Mr. Speaker, I am proud to stand here today with all of my \\ncolleagues, Republicans and Democrats, who are on the Climate Solutions \\nCaucus. As you have heard tonight, and as we know, the Climate \\nSolutions Caucus is a bipartisan caucus that gives Democrats and \\nRepublicans the opportunity to sit down and to discuss ways not only to \\nprotect our environment, but to protect our homes, our Nation's \\neconomy, and our Nation's security.\\n  Yes, this caucus consists of people from separate political parties, \\nbut all of us are united in our belief that we must have this dialogue \\nto defend our future.\\n  Being from the central coast of California, where we have over 120 \\nmiles of stunning coastline in my district, we understand the \\nvulnerability that comes with rising sea levels, something that can \\nimpact our economy, our security, and, of course, our daily lives.\\n  The co-chairs of the Climate Solutions Caucus, Florida \\nRepresentatives Carlos Curbelo and Ted Deutch, they understand and they \\nappreciate that threat, for earlier this year Florida was pummeled by \\nHurricane Irma and the subsequent severe flooding, a storm that \\naffected the lives of millions of Americans and cost billions in \\nrecovery and cleanup efforts.\\n  We have seen that at times of crisis like that, despite the damage \\nand despite our differences, our government and even this Congress can \\ncome together and put back together those communities. That is our \\ngovernment during an emergency, and at times where there are storms, \\nwhere there is damage, we are motivated to come together and govern.\\n  This year, my district saw this type of governing due to damage it \\nsuffered during the major winter storms earlier in 2017.\\n\\n\\n  Every county in my district saw devastation. One county in \\nparticular, Monterey County, suffered an extreme amount of damage--the \\ntown of Big Sur, along the coast of California, in particular. The \\nnorthern route of Highway 1, going into Big Sur, suffered a knockout of \\na major bridge. The southern route had a major landslide, leaving that \\ncommunity isolated.\\n  But I can tell you, 2 weeks ago, I stood on the brand-new bridge that \\nwas built. And as I was standing there, to me, it was a story of the \\npeople of Big Sur, very resilient, always coming back from these types \\nof situations. But it was also the story of government working, people \\nand government coming together, getting things done to help people.\\n  Now, just prior to that, I had read a New York Times editorial, where \\nthe title of that editorial was, ``We Used to Build Things.'' And it \\nwas by David Brooks, and he talked about this big fire called the Big \\nBurn, back in the early 1900s, that started in Washington and Oregon \\nand spread throughout the upper West, all the way into Montana. And \\nfrom that devastating fire arose something, and that was the U.S. \\nForest Service.\\n  When I read that article, it reminded me that, throughout the history \\nof this Nation, we have always built things to help people. We have \\nengineered infrastructure to energize our economy, and we have expanded \\nagencies to embolden and to empower our communities and the people who \\nlive there.\\n  So now, after the storms on the West Coast, after the flooding in the \\nMidwest, and after the hurricanes on the East Coast, it is our turn. It \\nis time for this generation, our generation, to build things in a smart \\nand resilient fashion, so that future generations are secure and safe \\nin their homes and in their communities. And we need to start by \\nfocusing on and building infrastructure that is strong and stable to \\nsustain the inevitable intense storms of the future.\\n  Now, we know, and what has been confirmed by the nonpartisan Federal \\nGovernment Accountability Office, that extreme weather events are \\nalready costing U.S. taxpayers billions and billions of dollars each \\nyear. According to that GAO report, the Federal Government spent more \\nthan $350 billion over the last decade on losses to private property \\nand disaster assistance programs from natural disasters.\\n  Now, that amount doesn't even include the massive price tag on the \\nrecovery effort from this year's hurricanes and fires that are expected \\nto be amongst the costliest in our Nation's history. And we know that \\nit is going to get worse as storms are more intense, and recovery \\nefforts are going to cost more. So we need to recognize and we need to \\nrealize the need for smart rebuilding.\\n  Now, after the 2012 hurricane up in New York, Hurricane Sandy, there \\nwas a Rebuilding Task Force that was put together, and it recommended \\nthat Federal flood protection measures should entail that projects \\nreceiving Federal dollars, they should comply with elevation and flood-\\nproofing measures to avoid rebuilding them after future storms. The \\nreport wanted to ensure that we do not need to pay multiple times to \\nrepair for flooding damages in flood-impacted areas.\\n  In 2015, the administration put forward the Federal Flood Risk \\nManagement Standard. That was a standard that set out that federally \\nfinanced infrastructure projects must be built to withstand future \\nstorms and flooding. That standard was meant to ensure that taxpayer \\ndollars are spent wisely and communities are protected.\\n  However, in August, this administration decided to roll back the \\nFederal Flood Risk Management Standard, a decision that was compounded \\nby its poor timing, as it was announced 2 weeks before the hurricanes \\nthat ripped apart Houston, Florida, and Puerto Rico.\\n  So last month, Congressman Curbelo and I introduced the Federal \\nInfrastructure Flood Resiliency Act, a bipartisan bill that ensures \\nthat Federal agencies complete implementation of a Federal Flood Risk \\nManagement Standard; such a standard that will not just benefit our \\ncoastal communities, it will help our government, and it will help our \\ncountry, because we know that every dollar that is invested in flood \\nmitigation efforts results in $4 in saved flood recovery costs. This is \\nsomething that Republicans and Democrats understand.\\n  After Hurricane Harvey, the Governor of Texas, Mr. Abbott, stated: \\n``As we go through the build-out phase, and rebuilding Texas, part of \\nour focus must be on rebuilding in a way that will prevent a disaster \\nlike this from happening again.''\\n  Mr. Speaker, by investing in more resilient project designs, our \\ncommunities will be able to recover quickly, and they will be protected \\nagainst any future flooding. Taking these prudent steps will save \\ntaxpayer dollars and prevent future loss of life and property. It is a \\ncommonsense step that we can take toward responsible, bipartisanship \\ngoverning; and it is this type of governing that needs to happen all \\nthe time.\\n  Now, when I stood on that bridge, and I was there celebrating the \\nreopening of that bridge, the reopening to Big Sur, I also thought that \\nthis was government at its best, where the government came together, it \\nresponded, it reacted in record fashion, and it reconstructed a major \\nbridge.\\n  So yes, it made me proud, but it also made me realize that we need to \\nstop just governing by crisis. We need to start governing with \\nleadership. We need to come together to get things done, not just in \\nemergency situations, not just for natural disasters of today, but we \\nneed to start governing for tomorrow.\\n  The Climate Solutions Caucus understands and believes that we, in \\nCongress, need to lead. We need to do that by coming together. We do \\nthat by talking about the effects of climate change. We do that with \\nFlood Risk Management Standard legislation, and we don't necessarily do \\nit for us. We do it for our children.\\n  That is leadership, and that is why I am proud to be on the Climate \\nSolutions Caucus.\", u'turn': 22, u'speaker': u'Mr. PANETTA', u'itemno': 23}, {u'kind': u'speech', u'speaker_bioguide': u'L000563', u'text': u\"  Mr. LIPINSKI. Mr. Speaker, at this time, I just want to thank all my \\ncolleagues for their leadership on this issue. The time to take action \\non climate is now. We can't leave this problem to future generations to \\nsolve for us. As we heard this evening, there is no shortage of good \\nideas for how to do so.\\n\\n\\n  I want to close by reading the mission statement of the Climate \\nSolutions Caucus, which reminds us of the many reasons why our \\nbipartisan group has come together to take action:\\n  ``The members of the Climate Solutions Caucus acknowledge the fact \\nthat, if left unaddressed, the consequences of a changing climate have \\nthe potential to adversely affect the health of all Americans and the \\nstrength of our economy, consequently imposing substantial costs on \\nboth State and Federal budgets.\\n  ``By seeking to reduce climate risk, we will, in turn, ensure the \\nprotection of our economy, infrastructure, and public safety, all while \\nattaining energy independence from the world's most volatile regions. \\nTherefore, it is our goal to take a market-based approach to \\nsubstantially reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the United States in \\norder to leave a better planet and stronger economy for future \\ngenerations.''\\n  Mr. Speaker, this is something that all Americans can endorse and \\nsupport. It is a better world and a better country.\\n  So I thank, again, all my colleagues for joining me here tonight, and \\nfor their work, all of the 60 members--30 Democrats, 30 Republicans--\\nfor their work on the Climate Solutions Caucus.\\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\\n\", u'turn': 23, u'speaker': u'Mr. LIPINSKI', u'itemno': 24}, {u'kind': u'linebreak', u'speaker_bioguide': None, u'text': u'                          ____________________\\n\\n\\n', u'turn': -1, u'speaker': u'None', u'itemno': 25}], u'header': {u'extension': False, u'vol': u'163', u'wkday': u'Wednesday', u'chamber': u'House', u'num': u'177', u'year': u'2017', u'month': u'November', u'pages': u'H8374-H8381', u'day': u'1'}, u'related_bills': [{u'type': u'HRES', u'congress': u'115', u'context': u'OTHER', u'number': u'195'}, {u'type': u'HR', u'congress': u'115', u'context': u'OTHER', u'number': u'1889'}, {u'type': u'HR', u'congress': u'115', u'context': u'OTHER', u'number': u'3533'}], u'doc_title': u'CLIMATE SOLUTIONS CAUCUS', u'id': u'CREC-2017-11-01-pt1-PgH8374'}{u'content': [{u'text': u'  (Mr. POE of Texas asked and was given permission to address the House \\nfor 1 minute.)\\n\\n\\n', u'kind': u'Unknown', u'speaker': u'Unknown', u'itemno': 0, u'turn': -1}], u'header': {u'extension': False, u'vol': u'163', u'wkday': u'Wednesday', u'chamber': u'House', u'num': u'177', u'year': u'2017', u'month': u'November', u'pages': u'H8368-H8369', u'day': u'1'}, u'doc_title': u'STOP HABITUAL ILLEGAL BORDER CROSSERS', u'id': u'CREC-2017-11-01-pt1-PgH8368-3', u'title': u'STOP HABITUAL ILLEGAL BORDER CROSSERS'}{u'title': None, u'content': [{u'kind': u'recorder', u'speaker_bioguide': None, u'text': u'           By Mr. MARSHALL:', u'turn': -1, u'speaker': u'The RECORDER', u'itemno': 0}, {u'kind': u'title', u'speaker_bioguide': None, u'text': u'       H.R. 4213.\\n       Congress has the power to enact this legislation pursuant \\n     to the following:\\n       The ability to regulate interstate commerce pursuant to \\n     Article 1, Section 8, Clause 3.\\n\\n', u'turn': -1, u'speaker': u'None', u'itemno': 1}], u'header': {u'extension': False, u'vol': u'163', u'wkday': u'Wednesday', u'chamber': u'House', u'num': u'177', u'year': u'2017', u'month': u'November', u'pages': u'H8386', u'day': u'1'}, u'related_bills': [{u'type': u'HR', u'congress': u'115', u'context': u'TITLE', u'number': u'4213'}], u'doc_title': u'Constitutional Authority Statement for H.R. 4213', u'id': u'CREC-2017-11-01-pt1-PgH8386-4'}{u'content': [{u'kind': u'linebreak', u'speaker_bioguide': None, u'text': u'                                 ______\\n', u'turn': -1, u'speaker': u'None', u'itemno': 0}, {u'kind': u'title', u'speaker_bioguide': None, u'text': u'                       HON.

Mr. Speaker, I rise to congratulate the City of \\nBell on its 90th anniversary. I am deeply honored to represent this \\ncity as part of California's 40th Congressional District, and I ask my \\ncolleagues to join me in paying tribute to Bell and its residents on \\nthe city's anniversary.\\n  The foundation of the City of Bell can be traced back to the arrival \\nof the first group of settlers in the mid-1870s. Among the settlers \\nwere the city founder James George Bell and his wife and children. They \\nmoved to a property on Gage Avenue that is now known as the Bell House. \\nThe house is now a historic landmark filled with antique furnishings, \\nvintage clothing, and photographs, and is open for the public to visit.\\n  In 1898, the town's name was officially changed from Rancho San \\nAntonio to Bell, in honor of its pioneer founders. The City of Bell was \\nincorporated in 1927 and is a small, vibrant community composed of \\nyoung families, small businesses, and an industrial district.\\n  Between 1920 and 1935, Bell experienced a growth spurt where schools, \\nbusinesses, and community organizations were established, such as the \\nBell Chamber of Commerce and Bell High School.\\n  Since its incorporation, the city has expanded its facilities, \\nobtained land for public parks and recreational areas, and acquired \\nbasic amenities such as a city hall, parks, a fire department building, \\nand a police department.\\n  The city has recently enhanced transparency and accountability within \\nthe city government. In 2013, the city's website earned an A- from a \\nnon-profit organization that examines state and local government \\ntransparency. Through the city website, the public can now watch live \\nstreaming council meetings, look up city contracts, view warrant \\npayments and public officials' salaries and compensations, and review \\nbudget information.\\n  Over the years, Bell has become a vibrant city with an innovative \\napproach to enhancing its services and infrastructure in order to \\nsupport its growing community. Bell encourages programs that provide \\nrecreational activities and community services, preserve and improve \\nthe environment, and protect the safety of Bell residents.\\n  In 2016, the Bell City Council adopted a five-year strategic plan, \\nwhich outlines the top five targets for the city: economic development, \\ncommunity outreach, public image, developing and improving strong city \\nmanagement, and fiscal sustainability.\\n  Currently, the City of Bell is mostly composed of a large Latino \\npopulation and a growing Lebanese American community. Bell's commitment \\nto community engagement can be seen through the various programs it \\noffers to youth, adults, and seniors.\\n  Over 700 children are participating in the city's soccer program and \\nparents turn out in large numbers to support their kids. Some parents \\neven become team coaches. The city has also developed new adult sports \\nprograms, and has been renovating parks by establishing maintenance \\nprocedures for the synthetic fields.\\n  Ernest Debs Park, which is home to the youth soccer program, includes \\na synthetic soccer field with covered bleachers and a covered fitness \\nzone that are available to residents every day of the week. The largest \\npark in the city is Veterans Memorial Park, which commemorates the \\ncontributions of war veterans to our country and our freedom. Veterans \\nMemorial Park includes a veterans monument, a rose garden, a baseball \\nfield with stadium seating, two large park pavilions, and batting \\ncages.\\n  Family events such as the city's annual street festival, the Summer \\nConcert Series, and the Bell 5K Run/Walk have also been developed to \\npromote community, health, and fitness in the city. The city's \\nsmartphone application has made it possible for its residents to report \\nstreet improvements, pickup of bulky items, and graffiti removals \\nthrough the touch of a button.\\n  The new City of Bell Technology Center has provided a safe learning \\nenvironment where both adults and youth can access computers. This \\nTechnology Center provides free afterschool computer skills training \\nclasses, which include introductions to computer equipment and \\noperation, word processing techniques, e-mail correspondence, and \\nfundamental skills required for safe web access.\\n  As the City of Bell celebrates its 90th anniversary this month, the \\ncommunity will also be celebrating some of the following achievements: \\na ``Certificate of Achievement for Excellence in Financial Reporting'' \\nby the Government Finance Officers Association of the United States and \\nCanada; the establishment of a Planning Commission; the initiation of a \\n``Business of the Month'' effort to highlight local businesses; a \\npartnership with the Bell Chamber of Commerce to establish the Bell \\nFamily Food Truck Night; and adoption of the city's Strategic Plan and \\nthe new city logo.\\n  That new logo is shaped by a bell design, and includes the city's \\nmotto: ``Home . . . in the center of it all'' to inspire civic pride \\nand civic engagement in the community.\\n  The City of Bell has made huge strides in the past couple of years \\nand does not show any sign of slowing down. I ask my colleagues to join \\nme in sending our best wishes and congratulations to Bell on its 90th \\nanniversary. This small, diverse, vibrant community makes residents \\nproud and visitors feel at home. I expect more great things to come in \\nBell's future.\\n\", u'turn': 0, u'speaker': u'Ms. ROYBAL-ALLARD', u'itemno': 2}, {u'kind': u'linebreak', u'speaker_bioguide': None, u'text': u'                          ____________________\\n\\n\\n', u'turn': -1, u'speaker': u'None', u'itemno': 3}], u'header': {u'extension': True, u'vol': u'163', u'wkday': u'Wednesday', u'chamber': u'House', u'num': u'177', u'year': u'2017', u'month': u'November', u'pages': u'E1486', u'day': u'1'}, u'doc_title': u\"CELEBRATING THE CITY OF BELL'S 90TH ANNIVERSARY\", u'id': u'CREC-2017-11-01-pt1-PgE1486', u'title': u\"CELEBRATING THE CITY OF BELL'S 90TH ANNIVERSARY\"}{u'content': [{u'kind': u'linebreak', u'speaker_bioguide': None, u'text': u'                                 ______\\n', u'turn': -1, u'speaker': u'None', u'itemno': 0}, {u'kind': u'title', u'speaker_bioguide': None, u'text': u'                          HON.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Mr. Albert O. \\nOrta for his selfless service to our nation.\\n   Albert Orta's extensive career began in 1947 after completion of his \\nentry level training at Lackland Air Force Base as a member of the \\nUnited States Air Force. There, he tracked and noted weather cycles. \\nSoon thereafter, he was promoted to work on the base's radar and \\ncommunication equipment as an electronics technician.\\n   After his service with the United States Air Force, Mr. Orta \\ncontinued to serve his country as an engineer with the United States \\nDepartment of Defense at Lackland Air Force Base. His talents for \\nengineering were well recognized and his responsibilities increased. \\nEarly in his career, he found himself traveling to well over fifty \\ncountries briefing Commanding Generals and U.S Embassy Ambassadors on \\ncommunicative data and command post installation projects on behalf of \\nthe United States Military. His missions took him to Europe, the \\nPhilippines, Indo-China and to countries in Africa and South America, \\njust to name a few.\\n   Mr. Orta also worked on military aircraft as a radar engineer and \\nfound himself assisting on the improvements and installation of radar \\nsystems in the early B series military aircraft: B29, B36, B47 and B52. \\nMr. Orta's work was so noted as a leader and accomplished engineer that \\nhe was assigned to equipping and testing radar systems in the early F \\nseries military aircraft: F84, F86A, F89, F102 and F106. His proud \\naccomplishment was his role as the lead engineer in the development and \\ninstallation of new radar technology for the United States Air Force's \\nF102 Delta Dagger, a $6 million project at the time of his assignment.\\n   Mr. Orta's outstanding accomplishments and his willingness to serve \\nour nation faithfully and to the best of his abilities in all positions \\nwas recognized by President Jimmy Carter and a host of Generals and \\nAmbassadors acknowledging his incredible service to our nation through \\nhis work with the U.S. Department of Defense.\\n   Albert Orta and Mary Louise Guerrero married in June of 1949 and are \\nblessed with 12 children, 31 grandchildren, and 29 great-grandchildren. \\nThroughout his career and travels he recognized that sharing stories of \\nhis travels were important life lessons. There is no greater devotion \\nof a father who returned home from a mission to share the experiences \\nhe encountered of a different life, different culture and hardships to \\nemphasize the importance of hard work, the importance of quality \\neducation, to learn to be resilient and to appreciate the freedoms we \\nenjoy today. He stands proud that his children and grandchildren are \\nsuccessful in their own professional careers; some educators, leaders \\nin the private industries, medical field, financial advisors, some with \\na heart for public service and some who proudly served our country in \\nthe military.\\n   Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues in the United States House of \\nRepresentatives to join me in honoring Albert O. Orta for his \\ndistinguished career and his proud service to our country; and to Mary \\nLouise Orta for her service in standing alongside her husband, \\nsupporting him and their family throughout his missions.\\n\", u'turn': 0, u'speaker': u'Mr. GARAMENDI', u'itemno': 2}, {u'kind': u'linebreak', u'speaker_bioguide': None, u'text': u'                          ____________________\\n\\n\\n',

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize an individual \\nwho has had a tremendous impact on Northern Virginia. Eileen Curtis, \\nPresident and CEO of the Dulles Regional Chamber of Commerce, is \\nretiring after leading the Chamber since 1994.\\n   During her tenure, the Dulles Chamber has established itself as one \\nof the leading business advocacy groups in the region, adding to the \\nquality of life for our residents in the Dulles Corridor and beyond. I \\nhave been proud to work with the Chamber on a host of issues, perhaps \\nmost significant being Rail to Dulles. The Chamber was instrumental in \\nthe foundation of the Dulles Corridor Rail Association, which helped \\nlobby for federal funding which was eventually secured to help \\nconstruct the Silver Line. The 23-mile long Silver Line has spurred \\nmajor economic development along the Dulles Corridor and has been \\nsingled out by Fairfax County executives as one of the main reasons \\nbehind Fairfax County's continued economic success.\\n   In addition to Rail to Dulles, Eileen has worked with the Chamber to \\nenhance the region in other ways including advocating for STEM \\neducation in our schools, forging partnerships with the business and \\neducation communities, creating greater opportunities for our immigrant \\ncommunity, and establishing new local festivals and events to bring the \\ncommunity together. These efforts are among the many reasons why \\nNorthern Virginia is routinely recognized as one of the best places in \\nthe United States in which to live, work, raise a family, and start a \\nbusiness.\\n   Eileen's efforts have been drawn recognition from across the region. \\nThe Chamber's efforts in education have been honored by Fairfax County \\nPublic Schools on multiple occasions and the Washington Business \\nJournal routinely lists the Dulles Chamber as being one of the largest \\nin membership. Eileen herself has been recognized as Woman of the Year \\nby the Herndon Business & Professional Women and as Executive of the \\nYear by the Virginia Association of Chambers of Commerce Executives. \\nThese accolades speak to the strength of Eileen as a leader and the \\ndedication that she has shown to our community. There can be no doubt \\nof the positive impact that she has had on our community and our region \\nis better for her efforts.\\n   Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating Eileen \\nCurtis on her retirement and in thanking her for her outstanding \\nservice to Fairfax County and Northern Virginia.

The State of Iowa would \\nlike to remove the trails center from its responsibility and possibly \\ntransfer the property to the city of Council Bluffs.\\n  The National Park Service currently does not own or directly manage \\nany of the land associated with the 1989 Act.

Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 3279, the Helium \\nExtraction Act of 2017. This straightforward piece of legislation will \\nincentivize helium production on Federal lands, help ensure the future \\nof America's helium supply, and provide a fair return to the taxpayer.\\n  Under existing law, the Mineral Leasing Act only permits helium \\nextraction as a by-product of an existing oil or natural gas lease. As \\na result, if oil and gas production on a Federal site is not \\neconomically viable, the lease will expire, regardless of the revenue \\nbrought in by helium sales. The Helium Extraction Act of 2017 would \\ncorrect this error and authorize helium production activities where \\neconomically viable.\\n  Helium is used for much more than balloons. It is a rare and unique \\nelement which has become an indispensable part of our medical, space, \\nand defense industries, such as its use in MRI machines, \\nsemiconductors, and air-to-air missile guidance systems.\\n  Unfortunately, the future of our domestic helium supply is uncertain. \\nThe Helium Stewardship Act of 2013, which details a commonsense \\nprivatization process of the Federal helium reserve, also specifies \\nthat all helium in the Federal reserve must be auctioned off by \\nSeptember 30, 2021, and the facility closed.\\n  This crucial source of helium has been relied upon for almost half a \\ncentury, but in a few short years, it will no longer be available. Our \\ncountry needs another way to access this critical natural resource; \\notherwise, we will be relying on hostile interests such as Qatar, \\nAlgeria, and Russia. Each of these countries presents security and \\ngeopolitical challenges made even more apparent by recent unrest among \\nQatar and its regional neighbors.\\n  Unless something changes, foreign facilities are predicted to become \\nour chief source of helium by the end of the decade. This is why H.R. \\n3279 is such a necessary piece of legislation.\\n  By authorizing the Bureau of Land Management to lease land for this \\nvaluable nonrenewable resource, this legislation will raise $9 million \\nfor the American taxpayer and help secure our supply of helium for \\nyears to come.\\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of this measure, and I reserve the \\nbalance of my time.\", u'turn': 4, u'speaker': u'Mr. COOK', u'itemno': 11}, {u'kind': u'speech', u'speaker_bioguide': u'T000474', u'text': u\"  Mrs. TORRES. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\\n  H.R. 3279 would correct a problem in our Federal oil and gas leasing \\nlaws that makes it more difficult for companies to commercially produce \\nhelium from Federal lands. Helium is a critical element for high-tech \\nresearch and modern medicine, and because of its unique properties, \\nthere are simply no substitutes.\\n  On the Natural Resources Committee, we have spent many years \\noverseeing the Federal Helium Program, culminating in the bipartisan \\nHelium Stewardship Act signed into law 4 years ago.\\n  While the Helium Stewardship Act improved the management and sale of \\nFederal helium, it didn't do much to promote the development of new \\nsources of helium, which are in high demand. By allowing companies to \\nhold onto Federal oil and gas leases if they are producing commercial \\nquantities of helium and only helium, then the problem that kept \\npotentially valuable helium resources under lock and key is resolved. \\nThis is only one small step, but it is a very useful one.\\n  Mr. Speaker, I thank the sponsor of this legislation for introducing \\nit.\\n  I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 3279, and I yield back the \\nbalance of my time.\", u'turn': 5, u'speaker': u'Mrs. TORRES', u'itemno': 12}, {u'kind': u'speech', u'speaker_bioguide': u'C001094', u'text': u'  Mr. COOK.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate the important \\nmark that Ioannis Ioannopoulos had on American society, as the original \\nfounder of one of the oldest known wooden school houses in the country. \\nIn order to fully understand the cultural motivation to establish this \\nhistoric treasure, one must examine Ioannopoulos's early life. A \\ncarpenter by trade, Ioannis Ioannopoulos was the son of George and \\nMaria-Canelas and hailed from the Petalidi area in Messinia that was \\nthen known as ``Koroni'' (the village of Skoutari, Mani). He was known \\nby the Spanish as Juan Genopoly. Ioannopoulos--at the age of 13--was \\none of a group of indentured laborers brought to the New World by \\nAndrew Turnbull to work an indigo plantation at New Smyrna. This group \\nof 1,403 Minorcans, Greeks and Italians suffered mistreatment, \\nstarvation and overextended servitudes at Turnbull's plantation. The \\npeople were reduced to slavery, and treated with great cruelty by \\nTrumbull, whose partner in the enterprise was the English Governor of \\nthe territory, who kept the colonists in subjection with English \\ntroops. This slavery lasted nine years, during which time nearly two-\\nthirds of these colonists perished; but large crops of indigo were \\nraised for the company--one year 30,000 lbs. it is stated.\\n  In 1776, a new Governor having arrived, the petitions of these people \\nfor relief were listened to, and they were released from the tyranny of \\ntheir master. One year later six hundred refugees, led by Ioannis \\nIoannopoulos, Francisco Pellicer and Antonio Llambias, walked to St \\nAugustine and were granted asylum by Governor Tonyn. They became the \\nlargest group of immigrants to settle in America in one group at one \\ntime. Collectively called ``Minorcans'', they were an important part of \\nthe fabric of St. Augustine history. It was on Saint George Street \\nwhere the survivors of the New Smyrna Colony first settled after their \\nescape. Since that time, this area of Old St. Augustine has been called \\n``the Greek Quarter'' and alternately ``the Minorcan Quarter.''\\n  Ioannis Giannopoulos built a little house out of red cedar and \\ncypress and put it together with wooden pegs and handmade nails, \\nsometime around 1800. This building was a home first but, as early as \\n1811, members of the Genopoly family taught the children of other \\nMinorcan families in the first floor ``schoolroom'' of this building. \\nAs the story goes, Genopoly, in typical Greek fashion, was worried his \\nchildren would grow up without an education. Genopoly and his daughter \\nMaria Manuela Barbara ``Mary'' Genopoly Darling were the first \\nteachers. Then Genopoly hired a school teacher, and generations of \\nchildren from St. Augustine went to school in this building. Juan \\nGenopoly died in 1820.\\n  Today, this preserved building is recognized as one of the oldest \\nschoolhouses in North America. It has become the symbol of their hard \\nwork and perseverance. It's now the main attraction of the historical \\nprecinct in St. George Street, Saint Augustine, Florida. John \\nGiannopoulos left a deep imprint in the educational history of St. \\nAugustine by establishing a school in his house. Now restored, it \\nstands as one of the oldest school buildings in the United States.\\n\", u'turn': 0, u'speaker': u'Mr. BILIRAKIS', u'itemno': 2}, {u'kind': u'linebreak', u'speaker_bioguide': None,

Mr. President, I rise today to add my voice and my \\nstrong support for the confirmation of Colorado Supreme Court Justice \\nAllison Eid as the next U.S. court of appeals judge for the Tenth \\nCircuit Court, which, of course, is housed in Denver, CO.\\n  There is no doubt that Justice Eid is superbly qualified for this \\nposition. For the past decade, she has served Colorado as a justice on \\nthe supreme court. In 2008, Justice Eid was overwhelmingly retained by \\nthe people of Colorado. We have a system where every decade the voters \\nof Colorado vote to retain or dismiss a judge, and every time that has \\ncome before the people of Colorado, she has been overwhelmingly \\nretained by the people of Colorado.\\n  Prior to her appointment, Justice Eid represented the State of \\nColorado before the State federal courts as our State solicitor \\ngeneral. She served as a tenured member of the faculty at the \\nUniversity of Colorado Law School, where she taught courses in \\nconstitutional law, legislation, torts, and she has published scholarly \\narticles on topics such as constitutional federalism and tort law, in \\naddition to being a clerk on the Supreme Court. She also practiced \\ncommercial and appellate litigation at the Denver office of the \\nnational law firm Arnold and Porter.\\n  She began her legal career as a clerk to Judge Jerry E. Smith on the \\nU.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. Her law experience took \\nher to the U.S. Supreme Court under Clarence Thomas. Prior to attending \\nlaw school, Justice Eid was a special assistant and speechwriter for \\nthe U.S. Secretary of Education, Bill Bennett. She received her law \\ndegree from the University of Chicago Law School, where she was the \\narticles editor of the Law Review. She graduated with high honors and \\nas a member of the Order of the Coif. She received her degree in \\nAmerican studies from Stanford University, graduating with distinction \\nas a member of Phi Beta Kappa.\\n  What her resume clearly shows is that whatever Justice Eid does, she \\ndoes it at the highest level, with the best results. She has \\nspecialized knowledge of federalism, water law, and Indian law, among \\nother important areas of the law. Indeed, the National Native American \\nBar Association has even noted that she has ``significantly more \\nexperience with Indian law cases than any other recent Circuit Court \\nnominee.''\\n  We have had some pretty doggone good circuit court nominees in the \\npast, including Justice Neil Gorsuch, whose seat she will be filling on \\nthe Tenth Circuit Court. These are concepts that are critical to my \\nhome State of Colorado, and her expertise will prove to be invaluable \\nto the Tenth Circuit Court, as well as to the Nation and the people of \\nthis country.\\n  But as impressive as her credentials are, it is her demeanor and her \\napproach to the law that make her ideally suited for the court. Justice \\nEid has been called a ``mainstream, commonsense Westerner.'' She is \\nalso, as her former law clerks have noted, ``fiercely independent,'' \\nand she will decide cases ``as she believes the law requires.'' At the \\nsame time, she seeks out different viewpoints and wants to understand \\nall sides of the issue she addresses.\\n  That is the law professor I know from my days at the University of \\nColorado School of Law. I can say from that experience that while \\nJustice Eid has her perspectives on the law, she cares very deeply \\nabout robust debate and hearing the views of others. And I know from my \\nclassmates who had Justice Eid as their professor--those classmates \\ndidn't always agree with her perspectives, but Justice Eid was open to \\ntheir debate and hearing their views. She engaged them, and she was \\nnever biased against differing perspectives but always applying the law \\nas the law required, not as opinions suited.\\n  I also know that ``fiercely independent'' jurist whom her former \\nclerks spoke so highly of. Justice Eid will follow the law regardless \\nof the popular wind, regardless of personal opinion. Whether \\nconsidering the plain meaning of a statute, discerning the proper role \\nof the courts, the legislative branch, or the executive and its \\nagencies, or evaluating the relationships between the Federal \\nGovernment and the States, Justice Eid will side with what the law \\nsays, and she will do it in that commonsense, western way that clearly \\nand articulately tells the American people what the law is.\\n  I am privileged to know Justice Eid. I have known her for a number of \\nyears now from my days as a student at the University of Colorado \\nSchool of Law and through her work in the State of Colorado at the time \\nthat I served in the State legislature. She is an incredible human \\nbeing with a delightful demeanor that will suit the court well.\\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \\nseveral letters in support of Justice Eid's nomination: a letter to \\nChairman Grassley and Ranking Member Feinstein from former law clerks \\nof Justice Eid's, as well as a letter from various supporters in \\nColorado and one letter from the Southern Ute Indian Tribe.\", u'turn': 2, u'speaker': u'Mr. GARDNER', u'itemno': 2}, {u'kind': u'recorder', u'speaker_bioguide': None, u'text': u'  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in ', u'turn': -1, u'speaker': u'The RECORDER', u'itemno': 3}, {u'kind': u'recorder', u'speaker_bioguide': None, u'text': u\"the Record, as follows:\\n\\n                                                    July 13, 2017.\\n       Dear Chairman Grassley and Ranking Member Feinstein: We are \\n     all of Justice Eid's former law clerks (except those \\n     currently clerking for a federal judge and not permitted to \\n     sign) since she began her tenure on the Colorado Supreme \\n     Court in 2006, and we write to give our fullest support to \\n     her nomination to be a judge on the United States Court of \\n     Appeals for the Tenth Circuit. We come from a diverse set of \\n     geographic, economic, cultural, and political backgrounds, \\n     yet we are united in our belief that Justice Eid is a jurist \\n     and a person of the highest caliber and character. We have \\n     each learned so much from her.\\n       Justice Eid was raised by a single mother in Spokane, \\n     Washington under challenging circumstances, after her father \\n     abandoned her family. Justice Eid began college at the \\n     University of Idaho, but with the support and encouragement \\n     of her mother and a professor there, Justice Eid transferred \\n     to Stanford University where she graduated with distinction \\n     and was a member of the Phi Beta Kappa honor society. After \\n     Stanford, she served as a speechwriter to President Ronald \\n     Reagan's Secretary of Education, William Bennett, and then \\n     went on to attend the University of Chicago Law School, where \\n     she served as Articles Editor on the Law Review, graduated \\n     with High Honors, and was elected Order of the Coif. Justice \\n     Eid began her legal career as a law clerk for Judge Jerry \\n     Smith on the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth \\n     Circuit. She then served as a law clerk to Justice Clarence \\n     Thomas on the United States Supreme Court.\\n       In private practice at Arnold and Porter following her \\n     clerkships, Justice Eid practiced both commercial and \\n     appellate litigation for a variety of clients. She departed \\n     private practice and joined academia where she became a \\n     tenured professor at the University of Colorado Law School, \\n     teaching Legislation, Constitutional Law, and Torts, and \\n     serving as the faculty clerkship advisor. During her time at \\n     the University of Colorado, Justice Eid continued her service \\n     in\\n\\n\\n     the Colorado legal community as President of the Colorado \\n     Association of Corporate Counsel. In 2005 she was appointed \\n     by Colorado Attorney General John Suthers to serve as the \\n     Solicitor General of Colorado. One year later, Governor Bill \\n     Owens appointed Justice Eid to the Colorado Supreme Court \\n     where she has served for 11 years and was successfully \\n     retained by the voters of Colorado on a statewide ballot.\\n       As law clerks we had the distinct privilege and opportunity \\n     to learn by observing Justice Eid throughout her decision \\n     making process. We learned that she never fails to provide \\n     her full attention and dedication to each individual case, \\n     mastering the relevant facts and carefully analyzing the law, \\n     whether the text of a statute or the words of a contract. As \\n     Justice Eid is so fond of saying, she ``goes where the law \\n     takes her.'' In other words, she treats each case \\n     individually without any preconceived notion of desired \\n     outcome.\\n       As young lawyers, we took particular note of the respect \\n     that Justice Eid shows the parties and their attorneys both \\n     in her written work product and during oral argument. We also \\n     observed her belief in the importance of respect and \\n     collegiality with her colleagues, particularly during times \\n     of disagreement. Her chambers are always open, and she wants \\n     to hear different viewpoints (even ours), but she remains \\n     fiercely independent, ultimately deciding cases as she \\n     believes the law requires. And her opinions do just that--in \\n     clean and succinct prose, time and again, Justice Eid \\n     resolves the dispute between the parties and announces a \\n     clear rule of law that can be readily discerned by future \\n     litigants. Her majority opinions in particular are a \\n     testament to the care, dedication, and consensus-building \\n     attitude she brings to her role as a Judge.\\n       While serving as a Justice on the Colorado Supreme Court, \\n     Justice Eid has continued to teach at the University of \\n     Colorado. She also serves as the Chair of the Supreme Court \\n     Water Court Committee, which works to identify rule and \\n     statutory changes to achieve efficiencies in water court \\n     cases, while maintaining quality outcomes for all. Justice \\n     Eid was appointed by Chief Justice John Roberts to serve on \\n     the Federal Advisory Committee on Appellate Rules--a \\n     prestigious appointment where she has served alongside \\n     federal judges, law professors, and lawyers to craft \\n     revisions to the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure--and by \\n     President George W. Bush to the Permanent Committee for the \\n     Oliver Wendell Holmes Devise (an organization that writes the \\n     history of the United States Supreme Court and sponsors the \\n     Oliver Wendell Holmes Lecture).\\n       Justice Eid is active in her community and church, and as \\n     the mother of two children, Justice Eid has also been \\n     involved in her children's school over the years. In addition \\n     to her service on the Colorado Supreme Court, these other \\n     responsibilities connect her to the Colorado community, \\n     specifically the challenges and issues facing citizens of \\n     this State and will allow her to bring an important \\n     perspective and diverse set of experiences to the United \\n     States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit.\\n       Her qualifications to serve are unparalleled and speak for \\n     themselves. At each stage of her education and career Justice \\n     Eid has excelled at the highest levels and has received \\n     praise, awards, and the utmost respect of her colleagues and \\n     those who have worked for her. This is in no small part due \\n     to her incredible work ethic and her leadership by example. \\n     And we as law clerks have carefully observed and learned from \\n     her simultaneous and unfaltering commitment to both her \\n     family and her position on the Colorado Supreme Court.\\n       We close by reflecting on our fond memories of our \\n     experiences as law clerks under Justice Eid, whether it was a \\n     lunch to celebrate a birthday, officiating numerous of our \\n     weddings, or the annual holiday and summer parties that she \\n     hosts. We all remember the genuine interest and support \\n     Justice Eid provided to us as people and new lawyers. We will \\n     never forget her heartfelt appreciation for our hard work and \\n     the care and time she has taken to guide us through our \\n     clerkships and beyond. She has been an important and \\n     steady mentor in each of our lives. We urge the Senate to \\n     take swift action on her nomination and are available to \\n     speak to any member or their staff about Justice Eid and \\n     her qualifications to serve on the United States Court of \\n     Appeals for the Tenth Circuit.\\n       Sincerely,\\n        Marie Williams, Clerk for Justice Eid, 2006-07; Holly E. \\n     Sterrett, Clerk for Justice Eid, 2006-07; Jared Butcher, \\n     Clerk for Justice Eid, 2007-08; Clark Smith, Clerk for \\n     Justice Eid, 2008-09; Kate Field, Clerk for Justice Eid, \\n     2009-10; Tim Zimmerman, Clerk for Justice Eid, 2010-11; Lee \\n     Fanyo, Clerk for Justice Eid, 2011-12; Jon Gillam, Clerk for \\n     Justice Eid, 2011-12; Jake Durling, Clerk for Justice Eid, \\n     2012-13; Doug Marsh, Clerk for Justice Eid, 2013-14; Jamen \\n     Tyler, Clerk for Justice Eid, 2014-15; Ben Fischer, Clerk for \\n     Justice Eid, 2014-15; Chris Chrisman, Clerk for Justice Eid, \\n     2006-07; Catherine Bazile, Clerk for Justice Eid, 2007-08.\\n       Katie Yarger, Clerk for Justice Eid, 2008-09; Sara Rundell, \\n     Clerk for Justice Eid, 2009-10; Maranda Compton, Clerk for \\n     Justice Eid, 2010-11; Trina Ruhland, Clerk for Justice Eid, \\n     2010-11; Victoria Cisneros, Clerk for Justice Eid, 2011-12/\\n     2012-13; Kate Cahoy, Clerk for Justice Eid, 2012-13; Lidiana \\n     Rios, Clerk for Justice Eid, 2013-14; Ayesha Lewis, Clerk for \\n     Justice Eid, 2013-14; Matt Mellema, Clerk for Justice Eid, \\n     2014-15; Emma Kaplan, Clerk for Justice Eid, 2015-16; Julie \\n     Hamilton, Clerk for Justice Eid, 2016-17; Rob Rankin, Clerk \\n     for Justice Eid, 2016-17; Mairead Dolan, Clerk for Justice \\n     Eid, 2016-17.\", u'turn': -1, u'speaker': u'The RECORDER', u'itemno': 4}, {u'kind': u'linebreak', u'speaker_bioguide': None, u'text': u\"                                  ____\\n\\n                                                    July 27, 2017.\\n     Re Support for the Confirmation of Justice Allison Eid to the \\n         Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals.\\n       Dear Senators Bennet and Gardner: As members of the \\n     Colorado legal community, we are proud to support the \\n     nomination of Justice Allison Eid to serve as a Judge on the \\n     Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals. We hold a diverse set of \\n     political views as Democrats, Republicans, and Independents. \\n     Our practices range from litigation, including both \\n     plaintiffs' and defense work, to transactional work to \\n     administrative law to child welfare advocacy and from \\n     employment law to water rights and from government affairs to \\n     minerals development, immigration, healthcare, law \\n     enforcement, environmental justice, federal Indian law and \\n     civil rights. This incredibly diverse group of attorneys \\n     agrees on one thing: we all agree that Justice Eid is \\n     exceptionally well qualified and should be confirmed.\\n       We know Justice Eid to be a person of integrity, \\n     professional competence, and judicial temperament. She has \\n     received the highest possible `Well Qualified' rating from \\n     the American Bar Association. Her private practice work, \\n     scholarship, law teaching, and service as Colorado's \\n     Solicitor General have all demonstrated her superb abilities \\n     over many years. Her service on the Colorado Supreme Court \\n     has earned her a reputation as an excellent jurist. Her \\n     strong work ethic is renowned. She is a preeminent member of \\n     the legal profession, not only in Colorado, but in the United \\n     States more broadly, with outstanding legal ability and \\n     exceptional breadth of experience. We also know her to be a \\n     compassionate and caring person, deeply involved in the \\n     broader community and called to service, not only in her day \\n     job, but through her extensive volunteerism toward the \\n     betterment of the profession. Throughout her tenure on the \\n     bench, she has hired numerous diverse law clerks and \\n     continuously sought to ensure that the diverse voices of \\n     Coloradoans are heard, evincing a very strong commitment to \\n     diversity and inclusion. We are excited to see her bring her \\n     spirit and skill set to the Tenth Circuit.\\n       We ask that Colorado's Senators join together and support \\n     this very highly qualified nominee from Colorado.

As a Colorado \\n     Supreme Court Justice, Justice Eid has demonstrated expertise \\n     in a broad spectrum of legal matters including the field of \\n     federal Indian law. Justice Eid's judicial record evidences \\n     her understanding of tribal sovereignty and other matters \\n     that are acutely important to the Tribe. Because these \\n     matters are often resolved in the Supreme Court following a \\n     decision in a federal appellate circuit in the West, it is \\n     critical that the judges on those circuit courts possess a \\n     working understanding of Indian law issues. Because she is \\n     well-versed in the established principles of federal Indian \\n     law, as well as many other areas of the law, the Tribe \\n     supports the nomination of Justice Eid.\\n           Sincerely,\\n                                                 Clement J.

Mr. President, I wish to spend some time talking about a \\nletter dated July 27, 2017. This letter was sent to me and my \\ncolleague, Senator Bennet from Colorado. This letter was titled \\n``Support for the Confirmation of Justice Allison Eid to the Tenth \\nCircuit Court of Appeals,'' which I have\\n\\n\\nsubmitted for the Record, but I want to highlight some of the people \\nwho have signed this letter because when it comes to the courts and \\nnominations, I think it is very important that we listen to the voices \\nof those people who are closest to the court over which the nominee may \\nbe presiding. It is also important that those who are closest to a \\npracticing lawyer provide their opinions of a lawyer who has been \\nnominated for the bench who is not already on the bench.\\n  In the case of Justice Eid's supporters, there is an incredible list \\nof people from across the political spectrum--both sides of the aisle--\\nsupporting Justice Eid. Let me talk about a few of Justice Eid's \\nsupporters, because we will hear a lot of debate about groups who \\nsupport or oppose Justice Eid, but the people who know her the best, \\nthe people who have practiced before her court, the people who have \\nworked with her over the many years of public service that she has \\nprovided don't just fall on the Republican side of the aisle or the \\nDemocratic side of the aisle, the support she has gathered is from \\nacross the political spectrum.\\n  There is Michael Bender, former Colorado Supreme Court justice; \\nJustice Rebecca Love Kourlis, one of the most respected jurists in \\nColorado, who served on the State supreme court and is one of the most \\nhighly regarded justices not only in Colorado but across the country, \\nquite frankly; Justice Mary Mullarkey. Justice Mullarkey is no longer \\non the Colorado Supreme Court, but she served as the chief justice of \\nthe Colorado Supreme Court. She was appointed by a Democratic Governor. \\nShe is someone who believes Justice Eid would be an incredible addition \\nto the court. There is Neal Katyal, a former Department of Justice \\ncivil servant for the Obama administration--a U.S. Solicitor General, \\nin fact. If we look at the other supporters she has, we see that \\nMelissa Hart, who has run for office as a Democratic candidate, \\nsupports the nomination and confirmation of Justice Allison Eid.\\n  As you can see, the Tenth Circuit has an incredible nominee before it \\nwhom I hope this body will soon confirm. I urge my colleagues to move \\nquickly during this cloture time so that we can actually approve \\nsomebody who I know will do an outstanding job. I urge their support.

Mr. President, I come to the floor today for the \\n184th time to ask us to at least wake up to our duty as a Congress to \\nenact prudent policies to address the effects of climate change. The \\nPresiding Officer is well aware of what Alaska faces from ocean \\nacidification and ocean melting and sea level rise and all of that.\\n  For the generations who will look back at this, I have tried in these \\nspeeches to chronicle the political tricks and bullying that have put \\nCongress--the Congress of the United States--in tow to a massively \\nconflicted special interest, such that we are incapacitated on this \\nvital subject. The shamelessness of the fossil fuel industry and the \\nspinelessness of Congress under its sway will provide a long lesson in \\nmodern-day corruption and political failure.\\n  The Trump administration has been particularly loathsome, threatening \\nthe emissions standards for cars and trucks, pressing for the Keystone \\nXL tar sands pipeline, disbanding science advisory committees, lifting \\nthe moratorium on Federal coal leasing, trying to expand offshore \\ndrilling, and open national marine monuments and sanctuaries to energy \\ncompanies. The Environmental Protection Agency is working to eliminate \\nrules on the leaking and flaring of methane and has rescinded \\nrequirements for reporting methane emissions. The President has \\nannounced his intention to withdraw the U.S. from the Paris climate \\nagreement.\\n  One particular target of this corrupted administration is the Clean \\nPower Plan, the 2015 EPA rule to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from \\nAmerican powerplants--a rule that many utilities and States supported. \\nBut it is the industry's bottom-dwellers who have the President's ear, \\nand they want to undo even this flexible framework for meeting \\nemissions-reduction targets.\\n  When EPA balanced the costs and benefits of the Clean Power Plan \\noriginally, it offset things, like between $14 billion and $34 billion \\nin health benefits in the form of preventive illnesses and deaths, \\nagainst the costs of industry compliance.\\n  The net benefits of the Clean Power Plan came out to between $26 \\nbillion and $45 billion every year.\\n  So with its official proposal to rescind the Clean Power Plan, EPA \\nadministrator and fossil fuel operative Scott Pruitt had to cook the \\nbooks to wipe out this public benefit. Here is how he did it. There \\nwere two tricks. One derives from the fact that harms, injuries, and \\nlosses caused by carbon pollution can take place many years after the \\npollution is emitted. In financial matters, future costs and benefits \\nare balanced against present costs and benefits, using what is called a \\ndiscount rate. It is more valuable to receive $1 million now than $1 \\nmillion 20 years from now. That is the theory.\\n  But even the George W. Bush administration recognized for healthcare \\nrulemaking that ``[s]pecial ethical considerations arise when comparing \\nbenefits and costs across generations,'' and they urged care about \\nusing a discount rate when a rule is expected to harm future \\ngenerations.\\n  In 2015, the United States settled on a 3-percent discount rate to \\nestimate the out-year costs of carbon pollution to society. Scott \\nPruitt jacked that up to a 7-percent discount rate so out-year harms, \\ninjuries, and losses would count for less. Mind you, our children and \\ngrandchildren will still suffer the exact same costs at 3 percent or at \\n7 percent. It is just that present-day polluters--Scott Pruitt's \\nmasters--get a way-big discount.\\n  Pruitt's second trick is only to count the carbon pollution harm \\nwithin our borders. You might say: That is OK; we are Americans, after \\nall. But it is worth taking a look at what this rule does if all \\ncountries were to use it because there is a trick hidden in the middle \\nof it. The fact is that we are harmed by other countries' carbon \\nemissions, and they in turn are harmed by our carbon emissions. On the \\nflip side, we harm other countries with our emissions, and they harm us \\nwith theirs.\\n  There is a total amount of global emissions, and there is a total \\namount of global harm. If you call the total global emissions X and the \\ntotal global harm Y, what happens when every country follows the Pruitt \\nmethod of only pricing local emissions and local harms?\\n  For purposes of illustration, let's say there are three countries in \\nthe world, and each emits one-third of the total carbon pollution and \\nsuffers one-third of the global harm from the collective global \\nemissions. If each country only counts its own emissions and the harms \\nonly to its own country, guess what happens. All that cross-border harm \\nnever gets counted. It never gets counted. It disappears off the \\nbalance sheet. It vanishes into this trick of calculation. If you are \\nthe tool of the fossil fuel industry, how rewarding it must be to \\nimplement a trick that just vanishes so much of the fossil fuel \\nindustry's harm to the world.\\n  In this hypothetical, how much harm simply vanishes? Two-thirds of it \\ndoes. Two thirds of the harm simply vanishes, never to be accounted \\nfor--not in the real world. Nothing has changed in the real world. In \\nthis three-country hypothetical, the total emissions is still X and the \\ntotal harm is still Y. None of that has changed. This Pruitt trick of \\naccounting just wiped two-thirds of the harm off the books. A happy day \\nfor polluters, and a happy, happy day for the polluters' tool, for \\nthere will no doubt be rewards for implementing this trick.\\n  Those fossil fuel industry bottom-dwellers no doubt think that this \\nis pretty cute and that this is pretty clever stuff, indeed. There are \\nhigh-fives in the corporate boardrooms that they have a tool in office \\nwho will pull such a trick of magical, vanishing carbon pollution \\nharms. But the problem with these crooked little schemes is that the \\nwhole world is actually watching. Anybody can do the analysis that I \\njust did and show that this is nothing more\\n\\n\\nthan a trick, and sooner or later, consequences do come home to roost.\\n  Out in the real world, the Pacific Island nation of Kiribati is \\nbuying up land in Fiji so it can evacuate its people there when rising \\nseas engulf its islands and eliminate the nation. It is on its way to \\nbecoming a modern-day Atlantis, lost forever to the waves. You can \\nreplicate that risk along the shores of Bangladesh, Burma, Malaysia and \\nthe Maldives.\\n  You can add in the risk of lost fisheries that left a country's EEZ \\nfor cooler waters. If you think that is just a hypothetical, ask \\nConnecticut and Rhode Island lobstermen about their catch. Add in the \\nexpansion of the world's desert areas in the Sahel and elsewhere that \\nforces farmers' crops and shepherds' flocks away from their historic \\nhomes.\\n  Add unprecedented storms powered up over warming seas. As bad as \\nthings have been in Houston, Florida, and Puerto Rico, we are rich \\nenough to rebuild, to throw billions of dollars at the problem, and we \\nare. Other places do not have those resources. Without the help, \\nimagine that suffering.\\n  To those who will suffer in the future, what do we say? On that day \\nof reckoning, on that judgment day, what do we tell all those people \\nwho suffered? Ha-ha-ha, do we say? We came up with this little trick \\nthat wiped most of your suffering off our books. We used a discount \\nrate that discounted your suffering to virtually zero. Is that the kind \\nof America we want to be? Remember the saying: The power of America's \\nexample is more important than any example of our power. Some example \\nwe would be, some city on a hill, if that was the way we behaved.\\n  The natural world does not care about self-serving or ideological \\narguments. The natural world is governed by immutable laws of physics, \\nchemistry, biology, and mathematics. Scott Pruitt's polluter-friendly \\nmathematics just doesn't add up. As Michael Greenstone, an economist at \\nthe University of Chicago who helped develop the social cost of carbon, \\nput it, Pruitt's plan was not evidence-based policymaking. This was \\npolicy-based evidence making.\\n  There is enormous pressure in the Trump administration to get rid of \\nthe social cost of carbon. What is bizarre about the Trump \\nadministration is that they don't try to get rid of the social cost of \\ncarbon by getting rid of its social costs, by lowering carbon \\nemissions, by addressing the harms that it causes. They try to get rid \\nof the social cost of carbon by getting rid of the scoring mechanism \\nthat counts all of that. It is like saying: My team is winning because \\nI tore down the scoreboard.\\n  Well, no, the world is getting clobbered out there by carbon \\npollution and the climate change that causes it, and tearing down the \\nscoreboard doesn't help change the game on the field. You cannot just \\ncook the books and reduce the social cost of carbon.\\n  For one thing, the social cost of carbon analysis is too well \\nestablished in the honest world. Courts have instructed Federal \\nagencies to factor the social cost of carbon into their regulations. \\nStates are using the social cost of carbon in their policymaking. Most \\nmajor corporations, even ExxonMobil, factor a social cost of carbon \\ninto their own planning and accounting.\\n  The social cost of carbon pollution is at the heart of the \\nInternational Monetary Fund calculation, for which the fossil fuel \\nindustry gets an annual subsidy in the United States of $700 billion a \\nyear. Even to protect a multihundred-billion-dollar annual subsidy, \\nScott Pruitt can't just wish the social cost of carbon away and just \\ncan't stop counting it. Courts will take notice.\\n  They may take notice that these stunts are arbitrary and capricious \\nunder the Administrative Procedure Act. They may take note that Pruitt \\nhas massive conflicts of interest with his fossil fuel funders. They \\nwill surely note that the Supreme Court has said greenhouse gases are \\npollutants under the Clean Air Act, and that EPA is legally obligated \\nto regulate them. They will surely note that the EPA itself has \\ndetermined that greenhouse gas emissions endanger the public health and \\nwelfare of current and future generations, a determination that the DC \\nCircuit resoundingly upheld.\\n  But we are not in an ordinary situation. Pruitt has a long history of \\ndoing the bidding of the fossil fuel industry. In the recent Frontline \\ndocumentary, ``War on the EPA,'' Bob Murray of Murray Energy, a strong \\nPruitt supporter, bragged about giving this administration a three-page \\naction plan on environmental regulations and bragged that the first \\npage was already done. That is the world we live in now, where the \\nregulated industry brags that it controls its regulator, gives it \\ndirection, and that its work is already being done.\\n  Courts that look at any rule proposed by Scott Pruitt must recognize \\nthat there is a near zero chance that he is operating in good faith. \\nOur Nation's environmental regulator went in captured and has stayed \\ncaptured by our Nation's biggest polluters. Scott Pruitt is not their \\nregulator; he is their instrument. That is a conflict of interest.\\n  I recently hosted my eighth annual Rhode Island Energy Environment \\nand Oceans Day, bringing together members of our business community \\nfrom the public sector, from government, and academia, to hear directly \\nfrom experts about the latest environmental news and initiatives. I was \\nvery excited to be joined by excellent keynote speakers, including \\nformer Secretary of State John Kerry, who has done such magnificent \\nwork on oceans particularly but on climate change generally, leading us \\ninto the Paris climate agreement. Also, there was former U.S. Special \\nEnvoy for Climate Change Todd Stern, who has labored in these vineyards \\nso many years, and ocean advocate and Oceana board member Sam \\nWaterston. They were all great, but one phrase stood out.\\n  Sam Waterston called on us to tackle today's ocean and environmental \\nproblems with what he called a ``battle-ready kind of optimism''--a \\n``battle-ready kind of optimism.''\\n  So let us go forward with a ``battle-ready kind of optimism'' to \\nclean the polluter swamp at EPA, to clean our Earth's atmosphere and \\noceans of unbridled carbon emissions, and to clear the reputation of \\nour beloved country of the obloquy it is rapidly earning at the hands \\nof a corrupting industry.\\n  I yield the floor.\", u'turn': 5, u'speaker': u'Mr. WHITEHOUSE', u'itemno': 9}, {u'kind': u'speech', u'speaker_bioguide': None, u'text': u'  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burr).

Mr. President, I rise to talk about the Children's Health \\nInsurance Program. We all know that healthcare is the most important \\nthing in any person's life and in their family's life, and there is \\nprobably no healthcare issue that is more intense than a parents' \\nconcern about the health of their children. I think all of the offices \\nin this building have heard from parents about the health of their kids \\nover the course of the number of months we have been debating what to \\ndo about the Affordable Care Act.\\n  I rise today to talk about another critical program, which I hope we \\nwill act in a bipartisan way to reauthorize: the Children's Health \\nProgram, or CHIP. CHIP builds on Medicaid, and it gives families who \\nearn too much to be eligible for Medicaid an insurance option for their \\nkids. In talking to families who avail themselves of this option--in \\nVirginia, years ago we didn't do a very good job of enrolling kids in \\nCHIP, and we have become an awful lot better at it. It is interesting \\nto hear the way parents talk about it. They will often talk about how \\nimportant CHIP is to them when their child is sick or when their child \\nis injured, but what is interesting to me is how important it is to \\nthem when their child is perfectly fine--not sick, not injured. But if \\nyou are a parent, you are going to have anxiety when you go to bed \\nevery night if your child doesn't have insurance or coverage: What if \\nsomething happens tomorrow? This is a program that provides not just \\nhealthcare but peace of mind for parents and their kids.\\n  Between Virginia's separate CHIP program and the Family Access to \\nMedical Insurance Security and CHIP-funded Medicaid, the State provides \\ncoverage to nearly 193,000 children. CHIP alone--the specific CHIP \\nprogram--covers 66,000 kids in Virginia and also pregnant moms; 1,100 \\npregnant moms are covered right now. The coverage is important. It \\nincludes doctor visits, hospital care, prescription medicines, \\neyeglasses--which are critical to being successful in school--\\nimmunizations, and checkups for kids up to age\\n\\n\\n19, with minimal cost sharing and without premiums.\\n  In Virginia, since 2009, when I was Governor, we extended CHIP to \\nalso allow dental coverage. That has been really important to children \\nand their families. The program is one of the success stories in this \\nbody because it has been strongly bipartisan in support since its \\ncreation in 1997. But as the President knows, this program expired on \\nSeptember 30. Despite bipartisan work on the Finance Committee, we \\nstill have not seen a reauthorization bill come to the Senate floor.\\n  The uncertainty surrounding CHIP has already started to have an \\ninfluence on my constituents and the constituents of every Member of \\nthis body. According to our Virginia Department of Medical Assistance \\nServices, the State will be forced to send letters on December 1, 2017, \\nnotifying families that there is an impending loss of coverage. If \\nthere is not a reauthorization bill done by that time, imagine the \\nanxiety of all these families in the weeks before Christmas getting a \\nletter in the mailbox saying that this CHIP program, which covers \\n66,000 kids and 1,100 pregnant women, is about to expire. This will, at \\na minimum, cause a great deal of anxiety and confusion, even if we then \\ncome back and fix it. But if we don't fix it, obviously, the anxiety \\nand confusion becomes much more catastrophic for the families.\\n  After we send out letters on December 1 telling families that they \\nhave to prepare for the elimination of this program, enrollment will \\nfreeze on January 1. No new children can come into the program. By the \\nend of January--and this differs in different States--Virginia will \\nhave insufficient funds to continue the program. There are some States \\nthat are already experiencing running out of the funds they have for \\nthe program. Virginia has a little cushion, but that will take us only \\nthrough the end of January if we don't reauthorize.\\n  Here is something that makes matters worse in Virginia, and I think \\nit is the case in most States. Our legislature is a part-time \\nlegislature. The legislature is not in session. The legislature does \\nnot come back in until January, and that will make it really difficult. \\nWe can't find time for solutions before then because the legislature is \\nnot in session. When the legislature comes back, that would be a lot to \\nface in 2 weeks, which is when this program is going to expire.\\n  Needless to say, the kids who use CHIP in Virginia are in all parts \\nof the State. Just to give you some examples, the Hampton Roads area, \\nthe second largest metropolitan area in the State--Virginia Beach, \\nNorfolk, and the Northern Neck--has over 5,000 kids who rely on CHIP. \\nIn far southwest Virginia, where my wife's family is from--Appalachia--\\nnearly 6,000 kids rely on CHIP. It is a high poverty area, and in those \\nparts of the State where poverty is high, CHIP is used in a very \\nimportant way by families. The Shenandoah Valley, an agricultural area \\nin western Virginia, has about 6,400 kids who rely on CHIP. There is \\nnot a county, there is not a city in Virginia where there isn't a child \\nand a pregnant woman who rely on this program.\\n  On September 18--now to the good part of my talk, the positive words \\nfrom my colleagues--Senators Hatch and Wyden introduced the bipartisan \\nKeeping Kids' Insurance Dependable and Secure Act, which is a \\nbipartisan compromise in the best traditions of this body, to extend \\nthe CHIP program for 5 years to give States sufficient time to plan \\ntheir budgets and make sure that families don't face the uncertainty \\nrelated to getting notice letters saying that the program may \\nterminate.\\n  I rise today to urge my colleagues to strongly support bringing this \\nbill to the floor and providing certainty to the families and children \\nwho rely on CHIP. The possibility of all these families getting letters \\non December 1 saying that the program is possibly going to expire is \\njust a needless uncertainty, and we should try to avoid that if we can, \\nnot just in Virginia but in every State.\\n  My senior Senator, Mr. Warner, is also a strong supporter of the \\nprogram. I will give him some props. When he was Governor of Virginia--\\nhe preceded me as Governor--he was the one who focused on doing a \\nbetter job of enrolling kids in the program. I give him credit for \\nthat, and I will take credit for my teamwork and for adding dental \\ncoverage to CHIP. But he was a great leader. He and I have together \\nsent a letter to the Senate leader, Mr. McConnell, asking if he would \\nbring a bipartisan bill to the floor quickly on behalf of Virginia's \\nchildren.\\n  This bill was bipartisan in its introduction, and with the number of \\ncosponsors and the historic, bipartisan nature of support for this \\nprogram, if we can get a floor vote on this bill, I think we can pass \\nit today and send it to the House and do so in a way that we would \\navoid the need to start sending out termination letters to families, \\nneedlessly increasing their anxiety.\\n  I will conclude by saying that if we can bring this to the floor, I \\nthink we can get it passed. It is an urgent issue for children across \\nthe country--and even more than children in some ways. The children \\naren't wandering around every day thinking about their healthcare, but \\ntheir parents are wondering every day, worrying desperately about their \\nhealthcare. This would be a bill that would help both children and \\nparents.\\n  I yield the floor.\\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\", u'turn': 7, u'speaker': u'Mr. KAINE', u'itemno': 11}, {u'kind': u'speech', u'speaker_bioguide': None, u'text': u'  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, this week we are moving to confirm four \\nFederal circuit judges. Because of that, it is a good week to talk \\nabout the critical role the judiciary plays and actually about the \\nunique power our Constitution gave the courts to do the job they are \\nsupposed to do.\\n  They are to provide a check and balance on the other two coequal \\nbranches of government--the executive branch and the legislative \\nbranch. Most importantly, the Federal judiciary provides Americans with \\nan avenue with which to seek the rule of law, an avenue to know that \\none is going to be impacted by what the law says and what the \\nConstitution says. It is a fundamental right of how we conduct \\nourselves, how we seek justice, how people should be able to make \\ndecisions about their families and about their businesses and about \\ntheir financial futures as well as their personal futures.\\n  That is why judges who believe in the rule of law and what the law \\nsays and what the Constitution says are so important and why it is \\nimportant to have qualified and well-grounded judges--not just people \\nwho are really good lawyers but people who have an appreciation for how \\nimportant it is that others can absolutely rely on the law and the \\nConstitution. Those can be changed. There is a way to change them, but \\nthe way to change them is seldom on the Federal bench.\\n  According to the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts, as of this \\nmorning, there are 148 vacancies on the Federal judiciary. That \\nincludes two vacancies on the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals. It \\nincludes the circuit judges of whose nominations we have not yet fully \\ncomplied and approved this week, but there are 148 vacancies--jobs that \\nare to be filled for as long as the people are able to serve. That is \\nwhy healthy judges, younger judges, and judges who are well grounded \\ncan have such an impact for so long. The first major judicial \\naccomplishment this year, in terms of the nominating process, was Judge \\nGorsuch, who 29 years from now will be younger than three of the judges \\nwith whom he is currently serving. These are decisions that will last \\nwell beyond a Presidency and well beyond the tenure of the Senators who \\nwill vote to confirm, and we have a chance to do that.\\n  Of these judicial circuits, the Eighth Circuit is one my State of \\nMissouri is in. As a matter of fact, the most recent data shows that \\nwhile there are a handful of States in that circuit, one-third of all \\nthe cases that had been filed in the Eighth Circuit from September 2015 \\nto September 2016 had come from our State, and I imagine that number \\nwill be about the same again this year. Reshaping the judiciary, \\ngenerally, as well as what happens in the Eighth Circuit are important.\\n  At the start of President Trump's term, 12 percent of all of the \\npositions\\n\\n\\nin the Federal judiciary were vacant. The Congressional Research \\nService found that not since President Clinton took office has a \\nPresident had the constitutional obligation to fill more judicial \\nvacancies at the start of his term than President Trump. I, certainly, \\nbelieve he made the right choice when he selected Judge Gorsuch to \\nserve on the Court, and I have been enthusiastic about the other judges \\nwhom he has nominated, including the four we have had a chance to talk \\nabout and will continue to have a chance to talk about this week.\\n  I think President Trump will continue to nominate judges who will, \\nfirst of all, pay attention to the Constitution and what it says, who \\nwill apply the rule of law, and will not legislate from the bench. \\nThose three hallmarks of how this Senate should define, and how this \\nPresident has so far defined, what a judge is supposed to do not only \\ncan happen but can happen at this moment for--or at least as of January \\n20--12 percent of the judicial positions, and that number will continue \\nto grow as judges, for whatever reason, leave the bench as judges \\ndecide to take early retirement. If at the end of the 4 years of this \\nadministration we have filled all of the vacancies that will have \\noccurred, we will have filled more than 12 percent of those lifetime \\nappointments. So it is really important that the Senate act to confirm \\nthese nominees and fill as many vacancies as are there to be filled.\\n  Last month, the Federalist reported: ``Democrats are forcing more \\ncloture votes than any early Presidency and demanding the full 30 hours \\nof floor time per nominee that the Senate rules allow.''\\n  Yesterday, at the press stakeout that we had outside of this room, I \\nsaid that the Senate was designed to protect the rights of the \\nminority, and that is a good thing. Just the fact that it would take 6 \\nyears to replace the entire Senate means that the country has to stay \\nfocused on one set of ideas if all of the Senators are going to reflect \\nthat one set of ideas much longer than the 2-year opportunity to change \\neverybody in the House. Also, the understanding that the Senate \\nprovides that protection for minorities to be heard in a big and \\ndiverse democracy like we have is a good thing. In the points that we \\nwere making yesterday, I also said that the protections for the \\nminority are always held onto, appreciated, and protected until the \\nminority decides to abuse those protections. When that happens, the \\nminority always loses the protection.\\n  What we have had over and over again--47 times this year as compared \\nto 1 time with President Obama for nonjudicial appointments, 5 times in \\nthe entire first Obama year up until this time in October, I believe, \\nno times for either President Bush, and 1 time for President Clinton--\\nis that the minority has taken a judicial nomination or another \\nnomination and said we are going to insist on 30 hours of debate \\nbecause the rules allow for 30 hours of debate. Well, the rules allow \\nfor 30 hours of debate for contentious nominees. The rules allow for 30 \\nhours of debate when there is really going to be a debate. Last week, \\nwe had 30 hours of debate on a judge, but 20 minutes were spent talking \\nin support of him while zero minutes were spent in opposing him. The 30 \\nhours that could have been used for other purposes was gone.\\n  Frankly, I think that was the reason the 30 hours was demanded--so \\nthe other work of the Senate had to be set aside so we could do the \\nequally important work of letting the President put people in vacant \\npositions that needed to be filled. That 30 hours will be changed if \\nthe minority continues to abuse it. It has happened in the entire \\nhistory of the Senate, but that is what happens when you abuse these \\nrules that protect you and give you rights. It will happen again here \\nif this does not change.\\n  We see the same thing happening this week. We have had lots of time \\nthis week--30 hours of debate, a final vote, and Democrats and \\nRepublicans vote. In fact, regarding the judge I mentioned a minute \\nago, 28 Democrats voted for that judge. There were 30 hours of debate, \\nand not a single critical word was spoken in debate about the judge. A \\nmajority of the Democrats and virtually all of the Republicans voted \\nfor that judge. That is not an acceptable way to stop the Senate from \\ngetting to the other work the Senate needs to do. This is not \\nbasketball without a clock, where they used to effectively play the \\ndelay game. The delay game got abused, and the clock became part of the \\nsystem. The clock will run faster here, too, if our colleagues do not \\nbegin to see the importance of what we do here.\\n\\n\\n                       Nomination of David Stras\\n\\n  Mr. President, while these nominees have had cloture votes--again, \\nPresident Obama, I think, only had one on a judge in his first year--\\nthere is one nominee, Minnesota Supreme Court Justice David Stras, in \\nthe Eighth District, which is the district again that Missouri is in, \\nwho has had his nomination held up. There is a rule sometimes that has \\nbeen used in the Senate--almost always if a judge is being replaced \\nthat only affects your State--whereby a Senator can say: I am really \\nopposed to that. In most of the history of the Senate, that kind of \\nhold has been honored. It has not been honored on judges who represent \\nanother State, many States, or will be a judge in the circuit for many \\nStates just because they happen to come from your State.\\n  The American Bar Association has said that Justice Stras is ``well \\nqualified.'' It is its very highest rating. He received his bachelor's \\ndegree, with the highest distinction, from the University of Kansas, \\nwhich is another State in this circuit. He received his MBA from the \\nUniversity of Kansas and his law degree from the University of Kansas. \\nHe clerked on the U.S. Supreme Court before practicing law and teaching \\nat the University of Minnesota. Not only was he appointed to fill a \\nvacancy on the Supreme Court in Minnesota, but he was elected. In fact, \\nhe was elected and received more votes than the person who is holding \\nhis nomination received when he was elected to that job.\\n  I urge my colleagues to not only support his nomination but to do \\nwhat we need to do to get these nominees to the floor and let everybody \\nexpress their opinion and be given the time needed to do that, not to \\ncontinue to abuse the rules, not to continue to hold these important \\nvacancies hostage to getting anything else done because we have 30 \\nhours of debate in which nobody decides to come and debate.\\n  By the way, if we want to continue to allow Senators to hold \\nnominations in circuits that their States happen to be a part of, in \\nthe Eighth Circuit, most of the work before that court comes from \\nMissouri more than any other State. We would be glad to have an \\nadditional judge, and there is nothing that would prevent that.\\n  The right thing to do here is to let the nomination of a well-\\nqualified person come to the Senate floor and be debated, if there is \\ndebate to be had, and be voted on and to take one of those significant \\n140-plus vacancies on the Federal judiciary and fill it with a person \\nwho is well qualified, just like this week. In four other circuits, we \\nintend to put three women and one man on those courts who will \\nhopefully be able to serve long and well and will take their important \\nphilosophies to the courts with them when they go.\\n  I yield the floor.\", u'turn': 11, u'speaker': u'Mr. BLUNT', u'itemno': 16}, {u'kind': u'speech', u'speaker_bioguide': None, u'text': u'  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, thank you.\\n  As we heard my colleague from Missouri saying, we have a great \\nopportunity this week to confirm four outstanding individuals to the \\nFederal circuit courts. These nominees are well-qualified individuals \\nwho have demonstrated a strong understanding of the proper role that a \\njudge plays in our constitutional system.\\n\\n  I am especially pleased that we are considering three exceptionally \\ntalented women for the Federal bench. Federal circuit court nominations \\nare extremely important. Circuit courts sit directly below the Supreme \\nCourt in our judicial system. Because the Supreme Court reviews \\nrelatively few or a smaller number of cases, many times the circuit \\ncourts have the last word in the majority of those cases, so it is \\nessential that we have judges on the circuit court who will treat all \\nlitigants fairly.\\n  When I think about what I want in a judge, I think fairness is the \\nfirst thing that comes to mind. We want someone who treats litigants \\nfairly, who shows respect for our Constitution, our statutes, and the \\ncontrolling precedents.\\n\\n\\nWe need somebody knowledgeable in the law. That sort of goes without \\nsaying but certainly is a top attribute of a judge. Every party before \\nour Federal courts has the right to expect evenhanded, fair judges and \\nfair justice from those judges who are handling their case.\\n  Each of the four nominees being confirmed this week have a strong \\nrecord and impeccable qualifications. They respect the rule of law. All \\nwere given a high rating by the nonpartisan American Bar Association.\\n  Yesterday I was very pleased to support Amy Barrett's confirmation to \\nthe Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit. Despite obstruction by my \\ncolleagues on the other side, I am pleased that yesterday we confirmed \\nMs. Barrett, but I still have deep concerns about some of the debate \\nand some of the questions that were raised about her religious beliefs \\nthroughout the confirmation process.\\n  The Constitution clearly states that there can be no religious test \\nfor any Federal office. The Senate has a responsibility to consider \\nqualifications and fitness for office of individuals nominated by the \\nPresident, but that does not include an evaluation of a nominee's \\nreligious beliefs. Our Constitution fundamentally protects religious \\nliberty for all Americans. That principle is deeply rooted in our \\nNation's history and allows individuals of all faiths the freedom to \\nexercise their religious beliefs.\\n  Ms. Barrett's credentials clearly demonstrate her ability to serve on \\nthe Federal bench, which she will be doing, and I hope future nominees \\nare questioned by this body on their record, their qualifications, and \\ntheir jurisprudence, not on their faith.\\n  Today we confirmed the nomination of Michigan Supreme Court Justice \\nJoan Larsen for the Sixth Circuit, a supremely qualified individual. A \\nformer clerk for Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, she served as a \\nDeputy Assistant Attorney General and as a law professor at the \\nUniversity of Michigan before joining her State's highest court, the \\nsupreme court.\\n  We are now considering the nomination of Colorado Supreme Court \\nJustice Allison Eid for the Tenth Circuit. Justice Eid served as \\nColorado's solicitor general and is a law professor at the University \\nof Colorado. She clerked for Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas and \\nwas appointed by Chief Justice John Roberts to serve as a member of the \\nadvisory committee on Federal appellate rules.\\n  Finally, we will consider the nomination of Stephanos Bibas to the \\nThird Circuit. Mr. Bibas is a law professor at the University of \\nPennsylvania and clerked for Justice Anthony Kennedy after earning \\ndegrees from Columbia, Oxford, and Yale.\\n  This is a supremely qualified slate of nominees, as their impressive \\ncredentials make clear. My colleagues who are familiar with these \\nnominees have given praise to these nominees in earnest and honest \\ndiscussion, which very much lends itself to my support. Without \\nquestion, their fitness for the Federal bench is evident.\\n  The fact that Democrats have been holding up these qualified \\nindividuals is totally misguided. We heard from Senator Blunt in his \\nremarks about the numbers. There are currently 21 circuit court \\nvacancies and 120 district court vacancies in the Federal judiciary. \\nWhile the Senate has an important role in examining nominees to fill \\nthese vacancies, Democrats have required virtually every potential \\njudge to go through a time-consuming floor process that is simply not \\nsustainable, even when there are no objections raised against the \\nindividuals. In fact, Democrats have used political tactics to delay \\nvirtually every one of President Trump's judicial nominees, \\ncontroversial or not.\\n  Every Senator has the right to vote against a judicial nominee if \\nthey believe that person to be unfit or unqualified--we all have that \\nright--but engaging in a de facto filibuster against virtually every \\njudicial nominee is an abuse of the rules, I believe, especially when \\nthe nominee has overwhelming bipartisan support.\\n  The American people expect the Senate to confirm well-qualified \\nnominees. They also expect us to advance a legislative agenda that will \\nimprove our economy and our security. By filibustering against \\nqualified nominees, Democrats are keeping the Senate from tackling our \\nimportant legislative work.\\n  Starting with Justice Neil Gorsuch to the nominees being considered \\nthis week, President Trump has nominated mainstream judges who will \\nserve our country for years in the judiciary. I commend the President, \\nthe chairman, Senator Grassley, and the members of the Judiciary \\nCommittee for their work in advancing these talented individuals. We \\nshould confirm these judges and act promptly to fill other judicial \\nvacancies.\\n  I thank the Presiding Officer.\\n  I yield the floor.\", u'turn': 13, u'speaker': u'Mrs. CAPITO', u'itemno': 18}, {u'kind': u'speech', u'speaker_bioguide': None, u'text': u'  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cotton).

Mr. President, tomorrow morning the Senate will vote on \\nthe nomination of Colorado Supreme Court Justice Allison Eid. She is \\ngoing to be voted on to serve on the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals. \\nShe is an eminently qualified and exceptional nominee who has received \\nwidespread, bipartisan praise and support.\\n  Justice Eid has spent over a decade on the Colorado Supreme Court. \\nBefore her appointment, she served as the Colorado State solicitor \\ngeneral. In that role, she represented the State before both Federal \\nand State courts. She also served as a tenured faculty member at the \\nUniversity of Colorado School of Law, where she taught courses in \\nconstitutional law, legislation, and torts. Justice Eid practiced \\ncommercial and appellate litigation at Arnold and Porter. At the \\nbeginning of her legal career, Justice Eid served as a clerk for Judge \\nJerry Smith on the Fifth Circuit and as a law clerk for Supreme Court \\nJustice Clarence Thomas.\\n  Justice Eid was raised by a single mother, whom Eid credits for her \\nsignificant personal and professional achievements. She earned a \\nscholarship to Stanford and graduated with distinction and is a member \\nof Phi Beta Kappa. Justice Eid received her law degree from the \\nUniversity of Chicago, where she graduated with high honors and Order \\nof the Coif. She has had an impressive legal career, and she has an \\nimpressive life story.\\n  In her long and celebrated tenure on the Colorado Supreme Court, \\nJustice Eid has heard roughly 900 cases and written approximately 100 \\nopinions. In 2008, 75 percent of Colorado voters retained Justice Eid \\nto the Colorado Supreme Court.\\n  Her nomination has also received wide, bipartisan support. As an \\nexample, Justice Eid's former clerks, who noted that they ``come from a \\ndiverse set of geographic, economic, cultural and political \\nbackgrounds,'' wrote a letter to the Judiciary Committee supporting her \\nnomination. Judges work closely with their law clerks every day. Law \\nclerks understand a judge's deliberative process and approach to the \\nlaw better than anyone. How did these clerks describe Justice Eid? They \\nsaid: ``She never fails to provide her full attention and dedication to \\neach individual case, mastering the relevant facts and carefully \\nanalyzing the law, whether the text of a statute or the word of a \\ncontract.'' Her law clerks also wrote that she goes ``where the law \\ntakes her'' and that in their decade of collective experience in over \\n900 cases, Justice Eid ``treats each case individually without any \\npreconceived notion of desired outcome.''\\n  The National Native American Bar Association also endorsed Justice \\nEid. In their letter to the committee, they noted that she ``has \\ndemonstrated deep understanding of Federal Indian law and policy \\nmatters, as well as significant respect for the tribes as governments. \\nSuch qualities and experiences are rare among nominees to the federal \\nbench.'' They went on to note that ``while we do not expect that \\nJustice Eid will agree with tribal interests on every issue, we also \\nbelieve that she is immensely well qualified and we are confident that \\nJustice Eid is a mainstream, commonsense Westerner who will rule fairly \\non Indian Country matters.'' That is from the National Native American \\nBar Association. I think ``mainstream, commonsense Westerner'' is the \\nperfect way to describe Justice Eid.\\n  Despite this bipartisan support and her professional achievements, \\nall the Democratic members of the Judiciary Committee voted against her \\nnomination in committee, and I suspect most of the minority will vote \\nagainst her\\n\\n\\nconfirmation when it comes up. That surprised me. Justice Eid received \\na majority ``well qualified'' rating from the American Bar Association, \\nan outside group who evaluates judicial nominees. My colleagues on the \\nother side claim that this group's ratings weigh very heavily in their \\ndecision to support or oppose a judicial nominee. In fact, my \\nDemocratic colleagues claim that these ratings should carry a great \\ndeal of weight with Senators, and they argue that the Judiciary \\nCommittee shouldn't hold hearings on nominees who have not yet received \\nABA ratings.\\n  This week, we are voting on four circuit court nominees--including \\nthree women--who received ``well qualified'' ratings from the ABA. The \\nAmerican Bar Association rated two of these individuals unanimously \\n``well qualified.'' Yet the vast majority of my Democratic colleagues \\nvoted against the two nominees on whom we have already voted, and I am \\nwilling to bet that the other two nominees will see similar opposition \\nfrom my Democratic colleagues.\\n  Why do my Democratic friends profess such admiration for the American \\nBar Association's evaluation process and then vote against nominees who \\nreceived the American Bar Association's ``well qualified'' rating? I \\nwould like to see them put their money where their mouth is or maybe, \\nbetter yet, their vote where their mouth is. If my colleagues believe \\nso strongly in the ABA evaluations, they should start voting for \\nnominees who receive ``well qualified'' ratings, but I suspect they \\nwill not.\\n  When the Judiciary Committee voted on Justice Eid's nomination, my \\nDemocratic colleagues really stretched to find reasons to oppose that \\nnomination. One of the chief reasons given for opposition to her \\nnomination centered on a quote in a Denver Post article that said \\nJustice Eid has ``earned a reputation of one of [the Colorado Supreme \\nCourt's] most conservative members.'' I find that statement to be \\nmisleading. Of the seven justices on the Colorado Supreme Court, \\nJustice Eid is one of only two justices appointed by a Republican \\nGovernor. To argue that she is somehow extreme just because she was not \\nappointed by a Democratic Governor is very unfair.\\n  Furthermore, the Denver Post published a subsequent article that \\ndisagreed with this characterization. By contrast, the more recent \\narticle stated that ``appointment by a Republican or Democrat does not \\nalways dictate the ideology of the justice. . . . Even categorizing \\njustices as either conservative or liberal is generally an error.'' I \\nwould agree with the Denver Post on this point.\\n  Justice Eid should not be evaluated by her ideological reputation \\nbut, rather, by how she approaches issues before her judiciary. That is \\nhow I have evaluated Justice Eid and other judicial nominees, and that \\nis why I strongly support her confirmation today.\\n  I am very proud to support the nomination of Justice Allison Eid. She \\nis the third in a series of distinguished female circuit court nominees \\nwe have had the opportunity to vote on this week. Her impressive \\nexperience and numerous accomplishments speak to her qualifications for \\nthis role. I commend the President for nominating these outstanding and \\naccomplished women to our circuit courts. Justice Eid is an exceptional \\nnominee, and her record overwhelmingly supports her nomination. As a \\nresult, I will support her confirmation tomorrow, and I urge all of my \\ncolleagues to do the same.\\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\", u'turn': 15, u'speaker': u'Mr. GRASSLEY', u'itemno': 20}, {u'kind': u'speech', u'speaker_bioguide': None, u'text': u'  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, this week we have been talking about some \\nsterling nominees for our Nation's circuit courts of appeals. These are \\nour intermediate appellate courts in the country, one step above the \\ntrial courts where cases are tried and one step below the Supreme Court \\nof the United States.\\n  What most people don't realize is that the Supreme Court only decides \\nroughly 80 cases a year. In other words, there is no guarantee that if \\nyour case is tried in the trial court, it will go beyond the circuit \\ncourt of appeals. So in many instances, our circuit courts are the \\n``supreme court,'' or the court of last resort. These sterling nominees \\nthat the President has nominated include Professor Amy Barrett, who \\nyesterday was confirmed to the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals by a \\nbipartisan vote of 55 to 43. For some reason, our friends across the \\naisle have decided it is to their advantage to inexplicably drag out \\nthe clock against a really accomplished scholar--and to boot, a mother \\nof seven--but, of course, to no avail.\\n  What is worse is our colleagues across the aisle have seemed to have \\nforgotten some of their own priorities when it comes to judges. For \\nexample, the senior Senator from Minnesota has said in the past: ``It \\nis time to get women on the bench.'' Well, we just did that yesterday, \\nand we are going to do it again. ``They should get an up-or-down vote . \\n. . that is what women deserve.'' I would say that is what the \\nPresident's nominees--whether they be women or men--deserve, but, \\nunfortunately, that hasn't always been the case.\\n  There is still time, however, for our Democratic colleagues to honor \\ntheir previous statements and to put more women on the circuit courts \\nwithout needlessly stringing them along with unnecessary delays.\\n  Joan Larsen was the first. She was confirmed earlier today. She \\nfulfills the desire of the senior Senator from Vermont to ``confirm \\nwomen practicing at the pinnacle of the legal profession.''\\n  That is certainly where Joan Larsen works. She has been a justice on \\nthe Michigan Supreme Court and was nominated to the Sixth Circuit, \\nwhich handles Federal appeals from Michigan, Kentucky, Ohio, and \\nTennessee. Justice Larsen graduated first in her class from \\nNorthwestern University's law school. She then clerked for the \\nprestigious DC Circuit Court of Appeals, right here in Washington, DC. \\nShe then went on to serve as a law clerk to Justice Antonin Scalia of \\nthe U.S. Supreme Court.\\n  Since then, she has worked in public service at the Office of Legal \\nCounsel at the Department of Justice during the George W. Bush \\nadministration and has taught at the University of Michigan Law School.\\n  Both of our Democratic colleagues from Michigan have returned their \\nblue slips, which is the piece of paper which says they are OK with the \\nnomination going forward, signaling their approval. Given her \\ncredentials, my question would be, How could they not?\\n  Ms. Larsen will make an excellent judge. She already has been, but \\nshe will make an excellent addition to the circuit court of appeals, \\nand I am glad we have now confirmed her.\\n  Another nominee is on the way. Justice Allison Eid of the Colorado \\nSupreme Court has been nominated to the Tenth Circuit post formerly \\nheld by Justice Neil Gorsuch, who was recently confirmed to the U.S. \\nSupreme Court. The Tenth Circuit sits in Denver and includes Colorado, \\nNew Mexico, Kansas, Oklahoma, Utah, and Wyoming.\\n  As in the case of Professor Barrett and Justice Larsen, Allison Eid \\nis exceptional in every respect. She attended Stanford University and \\nthe University of Chicago Law School, where she was elected to the \\nOrder of the Coif and graduated with high honors. She clerked for the \\nFifth Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans and then went on to clerk \\nfor Justice Clarence Thomas on the U.S. Supreme Court.\\n  As with Justice Larsen, Justice Eid has received the blue slips from \\nboth of her home State Senators, which means they are willing to let \\nthis confirmation go forward. So I look forward to her quick \\nconfirmation.\\n  Finally, the fourth judge who will be confirmed this week is \\nprofessor Stephanos Bibas, who teaches at the University of \\nPennsylvania Law School. He has been nominated for the Third Circuit \\nCourt of Appeals, which covers Delaware, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania. \\nStephanos Bibas was educated at Columbia, Oxford, and Yale Law School. \\nHe, likewise, clerked for the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals and then \\nwent on to clerk for Justice Anthony Kennedy on the U.S. Supreme Court. \\nHe has worked both in private practice and as a prosecutor. Now he\\n\\n\\nhas distinguished himself as an academic, teaching and publishing in \\nthe realm of criminal law and procedure.\\n  In their ringing endorsement of his nomination, a diverse group of \\nmore than 100 law professors noted Professor Bibas's ``fair-mindedness, \\nconscientiousness, and personal integrity.'' Those are the sort of \\nqualities we should all want in a circuit court judge.\\n  We are going to confirm Stephanos Bibas and the other nominees I \\nmentioned, no matter how long it takes, this week. The majority leader \\nhas put our friends across the aisle on notice, and there is nothing \\nthey can do to stop those confirmation votes before we call it a week.\\n  Once again, the administration has demonstrated its skill at picking \\nbright nominees for the right reasons. This week's nominees will read \\nthe law faithfully. They will honestly interpret its text, and they \\nwill apply it to cases with a sense of humility no matter what their \\npreferred outcome might be.\\n  I appreciate President Trump, Leader McConnell, and the chairman of \\nthe Senate Judiciary Committee, Senator Chuck Grassley, for the hard \\nwork in bringing these nominees to the floor. Now let's get them on the \\nFederal bench.\\n\\n\\n                               Tax Reform\\n\\n  Mr. President, the other issue I wish to bring up in my remarks today \\nis tax reform, because we all know that the House of Representatives \\nwill release the Ways and Means Committee's beginning bill for tax \\nreform--something we have promised for a long time and that the country \\nis anxiously awaiting.\\n  This will be the culmination of months--if not years--of hard work, \\nof meetings, white papers, listening sessions, and the like so that we \\ncan deliver on our shared goal of a simpler, fairer tax system that \\nboosts jobs and puts more money in the pockets of every American. Those \\nare our goals.\\n  We know that many hard-working Americans have had a rough time in \\nrecent years. Sending their kids to college and securing retirement \\nseems to be harder and increasingly out of reach for some of my \\nconstituents back in Texas and people around the country. I hear about \\ntheir concerns and their anxieties--economic anxieties--every time I go \\nhome. It is not acceptable that 50 percent of Americans are finding \\nthemselves living from paycheck to paycheck and that a third of voters \\nare one trip to the mechanic shop away from a household financial \\ncrisis.\\n  Last week, several of my colleagues and I sat down with the \\nPresident--we were members of a bipartisan group of the Senate Finance \\nCommittee--and discussed our objectives in achieving meaningful and \\nlasting changes to our Tax Code. The President agreed that we should \\ncut taxes for hard-working Americans and that we should nearly double \\nthe standard deduction, which reduces the number of people who will \\nhave to itemize deductions on their tax return, thus, making compliance \\nwith the Tax Code much simpler and cheaper. We agreed that we would \\nsignificantly increase the child tax credit and reduce taxes on \\nbusinesses and job creators.\\n  This last objective--reducing taxes on businesses and job creators--\\ndeserves a little bit more discussion.\\n  Ireland represents an interesting point of comparison for the United \\nStates. We have the highest tax rate in the world--35 percent for \\nbusinesses that do business all around the globe. Ireland has a \\ncorporate rate of 12.5 percent. That is 35 percent to 12.5 percent. \\nBecause of that, it has become a haven for large American companies, \\nespecially in the high-tech sector.\\n  Ireland has since ended its so-called ``double Irish'' tax scheme, \\nwhich allowed it to benefit from taxes on income that should have been \\ntaxed in the United States. In other words, there is some rivalry and \\ncompetition when businesses do business worldwide as to where their \\nprofits will be taxed. We want to make sure that those profits are \\ntaxed in the United States and not in countries abroad, where we would \\nenjoy no benefit from.\\n  This example illustrates what happens when we keep our tax rate so \\nhigh. Sadly, companies leave. They go elsewhere, because they know that \\nthe difference between a 35-percent tax rate and a 12.5-percent tax \\nrate in Ireland may be the difference between making a profit for your \\nshareholders--whether it is the teachers retirement system or the \\nfirefighters pension fund--or ending up in the red and not making a \\nprofit at all. Savvy companies will leave, and they will go elsewhere. \\nThey know to create new entities and search the globe for better rates. \\nIt is really a matter of their competitiveness in a global economy.\\n  Of course, when they do this, it is legal. It is rational because \\nthey want the best deal they can get for their shareholders. They also \\nwant to make sure they can achieve a profit for their shareholders and \\nnot a loss, frankly, due to the differential in tax rates.\\n  When companies dodge U.S. taxes, it means we here in the United \\nStates miss out on revenue that we would otherwise reap. One thing is \\nfor sure. With $20 trillion in debt, we want to make sure that our Tax \\nCode is fair and simple and is competitive and will help us grow our \\neconomy in a way that will help us pay down those deficits and that \\ndebt.\\n  Now, our Democratic friends have been known to demagogue this issue a \\nlittle bit, saying: Who wants to cut these corporate tax rates \\noverseas? Corporations shouldn't get a tax cut, even though they know \\nwhat the facts are.\\n  Well, they should simply listen to people like Barack Obama. In 2011 \\nhe was speaking to a joint session of Congress and called on \\nRepublicans and Democrats alike to lower the U.S. corporate tax rate \\nbecause he knew--and he was right--that this was hurting our global \\ncompetitiveness in a global economy and that companies, out of sheer \\nself-interest, were keeping the profits they had earned overseas rather \\nthan bringing them back and suffering from double taxation, meaning \\nthat workers here in the United States didn't get the benefit of that \\ninfusion of extra cash in their paycheck, and the investment that \\nshould occur here in the United States was occurring overseas strictly \\nbecause of our Tax Code.\\n  My colleague, the senior Senator from Oregon, described corporate \\ninversions. That is what happens when an American company shifts its \\nlegal address to a foreign country, such as Ireland, for tax purposes. \\nHe called it a ``contagion'' that has affected the Tax Code with ``the \\nchronic diseases of loopholes and inefficiency.'' He went on to call \\nthe Tax Code an ``anti-competitive mess.'' He is right.\\n  The senior Senators from Maryland and Ohio have also made similar \\nstatements in past years.\\n  We all realize that simplifying our Tax Code will reduce tax \\ncompliance costs, which currently run for small business owners at \\naround $19 billion a year. Our Tax Code has simply gotten to be too \\ncomplex and too convoluted for honest, law-abiding small business \\nowners to do it on their own. So they have to hire somebody else to \\nhelp them sort it out.\\n  The less money that a small business pays in tax compliance is the \\nmore they can spend on their employees or on expanding their business \\nor on investing in new equipment or simply giving their workers a pay \\nraise. Let's give them the relief that they need. Let's reduce the \\ncorporate rate, as President Obama and our colleagues on the other side \\nused to argue for. With our proposals, we can also get moving on fixing \\nthe rest of the Tax Code to let the hard-working people of Texas and \\nAmerican families keep more of what they earn, improve their standard \\nof living in the process, and to make our Tax Code more competitive in \\na global economy so that businesses that operate internationally will \\nbe incentivized to bring that money back here to the United States to \\nmake and manufacture products that are stamped ``Made in America'' and \\nto improve the wages and quality of life and income of American \\nworkers. It just strikes me as a no-brainer, and that is exactly what \\nwe are going to set out to accomplish to.\\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\", u'turn': 19, u'speaker': u'Mr. CORNYN', u'itemno': 24}, {u'kind': u'speech', u'speaker_bioguide': None, u'text': u'  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, thank you.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                          Freedom to Negotiate\\n\\n  Labor unions and strong labor laws have helped build the middle class \\nin America and protect the rights of workers for generations.\\n  In the 1970s, union participation was around 30 percent, and it was a \\ngolden era for the American middle class. Wages went up. Families had \\nbenefits and vacations. Parents could pay for college. They could put \\nfood on the table and have money left over. The vast, thriving middle \\nclass was built on the blood and sweat of labor unions and those who \\norganized the labor unions, often at their physical peril, back in the \\nthirties.\\n  Unfortunately, over the last few decades, union membership has \\ndeclined and, along with it, middle-class wages and opportunities. In \\nthe seventies, union membership was near 30 percent, but it had fallen \\nto just 11 percent of all workers by 2014. That decline is mostly \\nbecause the union movement and, concurrently, the middle class, with \\nwhich it is allied, have been under attack from big corporate special \\ninterests and the conservative movement for the better part of the last \\nthree decades. It is well funded by a small group of very rich and, I \\nmight say, greedy people, and it is patient.\\n  Their goal is to, by any means necessary--Congress, the courts, \\nwhatever--break up existing unions and prevent new unions from forming. \\nThey will pursue any avenue in order to disrupt the ability of workers \\nto organize and collectively bargain for a fair share of the profits \\nthey create so that they can make an extra buck.\\n  These forces will do whatever it takes to keep rigging the system in \\ntheir favor, like asking the Supreme Court to rule on Janus v. AFSCME, \\na case backed by the Koch brothers--$40 billion each, maybe more; \\nplenty of money--but they hate giving any money to workers. And there \\nis no record evidence of a single lower court ruling in its favor.\\n  If anyone doubts the politicization of the Supreme Court, just look \\nat their being willing to hear this case twice, which comes with a \\ncrazy legal theory that a First Amendment basis should be used to \\ndestroy collective bargaining. It is merely designed to eliminate the \\nfreedom of people to come together in unions. If the Supreme Court \\nendorses the arguments of Janus, it will be a dark day for the American \\nworker.\\n  Chief Justice Roberts, who said he would be fair and call balls and \\nstrikes, in my view, has lost all pretence of fairness. He wants to \\nkeep the Court nonpolitical, but he keeps pushing cases like this. \\nSince his confirmation, under Chief Justice Roberts, the Court has \\nmethodically moved in a pro-corporate direction in its constantly and \\nconsistently siding with the big corporate interests over the interests \\nof workers. Already, it has been the most pro-corporate Court since \\nWorld War II. A decision in favor of Janus will be a shameful capstone \\non that already disgraceful record.\\n  I would say to all of those wealthy people who have plenty of money \\nand to all of those corporate executives who get paid in the tens of \\nmillions, who are desperate to take money away from middle-class people \\nwhose incomes are declining, that you are creating an anger and a \\nsourness in America that is hurting our country in so many different \\nways.\\n  American workers deserve a better deal, and Democrats are going to \\noffer it. We are calling it freedom to negotiate. We are offering the \\nmiddle class, and those who are struggling to get there, a better deal \\nby taking on companies that undermine unions and underpay their \\nworkers, and beginning to unwind a rigged system that threatens every \\nworker's freedom to negotiate with their employer.\\n  Our plan would, among other things, strengthen penalties on predatory \\ncorporations that violate workers' rights; ban State right-to-work laws \\nthat undermine worker freedoms to join together and negotiate; \\nstrengthen a worker's right to strike for essential workplace \\nimprovements; and provide millions of public employees--State, local, \\nand Federal--with the freedom to join a union and collectively bargain \\nwith their employers.\\n  Over the past century, labor unions have fought to stitch into the \\nfabric of our economy a basic sense of fairness for workers. Each \\nworker left on his or her own has no power against the big corporate \\ninterests that employ them, but together unions and workers who unite \\nin unions can have some say.\\n  No one taught me better about the lack of fairness than a 32BJ worker \\nI met several years ago at the JFK International Airport, who was named \\nShareeka Elliot. When I first met Shareeka, she was a mother of two \\nchildren who was struggling to make ends meet. She was working the \\ngraveyard shift cleaning the terminals at JFK and serving hamburgers at \\nMcDonald's during the day. She was forced to rely on public assistance \\nsince she had gotten so little in wages from those jobs. She lived in a \\nhouse with six other family members to be able to pay the rent. She was \\nnot a freeloader. She was working two jobs, but she got minimum wage \\nand could hardly support herself. She barely saw her children and spent \\nmost of her free time in getting to this job--this poorly paid, minimum \\nwage job. She had to take a bus for 2 hours from East New York to the \\nJFK International Airport.\\n  She was not angry, by the way, as she was a churchgoing lady. She had \\nfaith in God to provide, but she suffered so.\\n  By the way, 30 years ago, if you had cleaned bathrooms at an airport, \\nyou would have been employed by the airlines or by the terminal. But \\nbecause these companies have learned to farm out the labor to \\nsubsidiaries, to franchises, and to other corporations that have no \\naccountability, now cleaning those toilets is a minimum wage job.\\n  Over the last 4 years, though, I have seen Shareeka and her coworkers \\nstart to rebuild their dreams. She said to me: Senator, if I only could \\nget minimum wage, I might be able to take my kids out to a restaurant--\\nI never could--or buy them toys for Christmas. I never could do that.\\n  Shareeka joined the union, and they fought for a $15 minimum wage. In \\nsome parts of the country, that may seem like a lot of money. In New \\nYork City, I can tell you that it does not go that far. Costs are \\nhigher. Shareeka was able to quit her second job and spend time with \\nher daughters, like all parents want to do. Shareeka and her coworkers \\nwon a union contract, and now they are able to gain the tools they \\nneeded to protect themselves and do their work in a safer environment.\\n  Shareeka is a metaphor for ``American workers,'' so many of whom have \\nlost good-paying jobs that have gone overseas or that have been closed \\ndue to automation. When they organize in these new types of jobs, they \\ncan get the kinds of wages people used to get in the jobs that have \\ngone away.\\n  It is pretty simple: When workers have the freedom to negotiate with \\ntheir employers, they have safer working conditions, better wages, and \\nfairer overtime and leave policies. Shareeka's story is a testament to \\nthat fact.\\n  Our better deal, the freedom to negotiate, will do for so many \\nAmericans what Shareeka's union did for her in New York. It will turn \\nthings around for our country. Maybe middle-class wages will start \\ngoing up, and maybe people will start having faith in the future again. \\nWe Democrats--hopefully, maybe, joined by a few courageous \\nRepublicans--are going to fight to get it done.\\n  I yield the floor.\\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\", u'turn': 23, u'speaker': u'Mr. SCHUMER', u'itemno': 28}, {u'kind': u'speech', u'speaker_bioguide': None, u'text': u'  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I am very proud to join him to highlight the contributions \\nunions have made to our middle class, to the economy, and to our \\ncountry. I want to express my commitment to stand up against any \\nattempts to undermine workers' rights to join a union and bargain \\ncollectively.\\n\\n\\n  Since day one, President Trump has broken his campaign promise, which \\nwas to put our workers first, by rolling back worker protections and \\nputting corporations and billionaires ahead of our working families, \\nand now we are seeing corporate special interests doubling down on \\ntheir attempts to undermine the rights of workers to band together. So \\nit is critical now more than ever that we are committed to protecting \\nour workers and their ability to advocate for safe working conditions, \\nbetter wages, and a secure retirement.\\n  Unions helped create the middle class in this country and helped a \\nlot of our families in the last century become financially secure. But \\nover the last few decades, as workers' bargaining power and union \\ndensity have declined, we as a country have seen a decline in the \\nmiddle class and a rise in income inequality in this country. As we all \\nknow, too many families today are struggling to make ends meet. \\nMeanwhile, corporations' profits are at an alltime high.\\n  I will continue to fight back against any attempts by this \\nadministration and by special interests to rig the rules against the \\npeople who go to work every day. I will keep fighting for policies that \\nwill help families save just a little more in their bank account, \\nwhether it includes raising the minimum wage or fighting for equal pay \\nfor equal work or strengthening our workers' rights to seek out and \\njoin a union and bargain collectively.

Mr. President, I am here to speak out in favor of \\nworking families and how we can empower American workers to obtain good \\njobs, to secure a safe retirement after a lifetime of hard work, and to \\ngive them the freedom to join together to negotiate for better pay and \\nsafer working conditions.\\n  Unions in the United States are important for our families and for \\nour Nation's economy. Organized labor is one of the greatest forces \\ndriving the middle class, which is especially important for our \\nveterans and members of the military. Union jobs help provide our \\nservicemembers and veterans with the economic opportunities that they \\nhave earned. Union jobs help working moms and dads put food on the \\ntable, and union jobs help power the engine of our economy--our middle \\nclass. That is why I am working every day to protect the rights of \\nworking people and why I stand shoulder to shoulder with organized \\nlabor.\\n  We must work together to combat the assault on the protections that \\nworkers have fought so hard to secure. It is more important than ever \\nthat we here in Washington work to expand economic opportunity for \\nhard-working Americans, many of whom come from a union home. That means \\npassing labor law reform to make it easier, not harder to join a union. \\nThat also means expanding the use of project labor agreements for major \\nconstruction projects and opposing efforts to repeal prevailing wage \\nlaws. It also means defending the Davis-Bacon Act. The Federal \\nGovernment can and should be a model employer that encourages companies \\nto pay fair wages.\\n  It is important to note the great progress that collective bargaining \\nis making for all people. More families today have two working parents \\nthan ever before, and women's growing role in our unions have increased \\nto nearly half of the labor workforce. In Illinois alone, 44 percent of \\nunion workers are women. The labor movement, which had a pivotal role \\nin creating national minimum wage, the 40-hour workweek, overtime pay, \\nand standards for workplace health and safety, is now also impacting \\nwomen workers and their families in a significant way.\\n  The collective voice that working Americans have is responsible for \\nimproving sick leave and paid family leave policies at the State and \\nlocal levels. These efforts can also lead to reducing our Nation's \\nlong-lasting wage gaps between gender and race. Labor unions tend to \\nraise wages and improve benefits for all represented workers, \\nespecially for women, and women of all major racial and ethnic groups \\nexperience a wage advantage when they are in a union. There is still a \\nlong way to go in the wage gap fight, but unions are leading the way to \\nmake those gaps smaller.\\n  Unfortunately, organized labor is under attack. In Illinois, the \\nanti-union surge is on the rise. Nationwide, so-called right-to-work \\nefforts are growing. We need to be clear on one thing: These laws do \\nabsolutely nothing to strengthen workers' rights, despite their \\nmisleading names and rhetoric.\\n  Make no mistake, opponents of organized labor are well funded and \\nrelentless in advancing union-busting campaigns. We must work together \\nand challenge these growing dangers to America's middle class.\\n  The U.S. Supreme Court will soon decide a case that could determine \\nthe future of American unions. A slim majority of conservative Justices \\nmay hand down an anti-worker decision that would dramatically undo \\nexisting precedent and sabotage the ability of unions to effectively \\nrepresent hard-working, everyday Americans. Workers should not be able \\nto reap all the benefits of union negotiations while refusing to pay \\ndues that made those efforts possible. Make no mistake, a decision \\nsanctioning this practice would strip away freedom from millions of \\nAmericans. It would steal their freedom to join together to bargain for \\nbetter wages, it would steal their freedom to join together to insist \\non worker protections, and, ultimately, it would betray middle-class \\nAmerica, which relies on organizing to effectively negotiate with \\npowerful corporations.\\n  Another way we can support our union workers is by making a serious \\ninvestment in our Nation's infrastructure, which leads to more good-\\npaying jobs and greater economic opportunity for working families. \\nImproving our Nation's infrastructure is really just common sense. That \\nis why I introduced a bill, which was passed into law, to cut redtape \\nand reduce delays on construction projects in Illinois and our \\nsurrounding States. Upgrading our transportation systems will help \\nIllinoisans and all Americans who depend on our roads and transit \\nsystems to get to work every day, as well as businesses that need our \\nairports, highways, and our freight network to ship their products.\\n  I am working each day to support our hard-working, middle-class \\nfamilies. Through organizing, unions have become champions for working \\nfamilies both in and out of the Federal Government.\\n  I thank our union representatives for all the work they do for our \\nfamilies, our communities, and our Nation.\\n  Thank you.\", u'turn': 33, u'speaker': u'Ms. DUCKWORTH', u'itemno': 40}, {u'kind': u'speech', u'speaker_bioguide': None, u'text': u'  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, last year, powerful corporate interest \\ngroups actually stole a Supreme Court seat and handed it over to their \\nhandpicked choice, Neil Gorsuch. Now those powerful corporate groups \\nare about to use that seat to deal a devastating blow to hard-working \\nteachers, firefighters, nurses, and police all across this country.\\n  On September 28, the Supreme Court announced that it would hear a \\ncase called Janus v. AFSCME Council 31. AFSCME 31 is a union \\nrepresenting public sector workers in Illinois. This case will \\ndetermine whether the public sector unions that represent teachers, \\nnurses, firefighters, and police officers in States and cities across \\nthe country can collect fees from all the employees in the workplaces \\nthey represent.\\n  Many expect that Justice Gorsuch will deliver the deciding vote in \\nthat case, that he will force unions to represent employees who do not \\npay dues and, in doing so, cut off sustainable funding for public union \\norganizing.\\n  Judges are supposed to be impartial, but there is no reason to expect \\nthat Justice Gorsuch will be impartial in this case. On the afternoon \\nof September 28--the very same day that the Supreme Court announced \\nthat it would hear the Janus case--Justice Gorsuch attended a luncheon \\nat the\\n\\n\\nTrump International Hotel. And he didn't just attend an event at a \\nhotel that makes money for the President. Nope. He gave the keynote \\nspeech for a rightwing group funded by one of the Koch brothers and by \\nthe Bradley Foundation--billionaires and wealthy donors who are pumping \\nmoney into the people behind the Janus case.\\n  It is no surprise that these rich guys want to break the backs of \\nunions. After all, unions speak up, unions fight back, and unions call \\nout billionaires who rig the system to favor themselves and to leave \\neveryone else in the dirt.\\n  What is at stake in the Janus case is basic freedom--the freedom to \\nbuild something strong and valuable, the freedom to have a real voice \\nto speak out, the freedom to build a future that doesn't hang by a \\nthread at the whim of a billionaire. And just as the Supreme Court \\ndecides to take up a decision that puts the freedom of millions of \\nworking people in jeopardy, Justice Gorsuch shows up as the star \\nattraction for a billionaire-sponsored outing to celebrate an \\norganization that is sponsoring an operation to put workers' freedom on \\nthe chopping block.\\n  With this kind of brazen disregard for fairness and impartiality, it \\nis no wonder that Gallup Polls have found that fewer than half of all \\nAmericans approve of the way the Supreme Court is now handling its job. \\nIn a shameless decision to abandon even the appearance of neutrality, \\nJustice Gorsuch makes it clear that he is on the attack against \\nAmerican unions and American workers.\\n  In the Trump administration, workers have been under repeated attack. \\nSince taking office, President Trump has signed several laws sent to \\nhim by the Republican Congress, laws that directly undermine the wages, \\nbenefits, health and safety of American workers. In just 10 months, \\nthey have rolled back rules designed to make sure that Federal \\ncontractors don't cheat their workers out of hard-earned wages. They \\nhave delayed safety standards that keep workers from being exposed to \\nlethal, carcinogenic materials. They have given shady financial \\nadvisers more time to cheat hard-working Americans out of billions of \\ndollars in retirement savings, and the list goes on.\\n  This is a democracy, and in a democracy, the government in Washington \\nis supposed to work for the people who sent us here. So why is it that \\nthe Federal Government seems to be working against the interests of 150 \\nmillion Americans who work for a living? Well, there is one reason--\\nmoney.\\n  Money slithers through Washington like a snake. Its influence is \\neverywhere. There are obvious ways that we know about--the campaign \\ncontributions from giant corporations and their armies of lawyers and \\nlobbyists--but it is also the think tanks and the bought-and-paid-for \\nexperts who are funded by shadowy money, whose point of view seems \\nalways to help the rich and powerful get richer and more powerful.\\n  Powerful interests invested vast sums of money in electing President \\nTrump, and with each of his anti-worker actions, their investments are \\npaying off. Powerful interests also spent vast sums of money to push \\nFederal judges who will tilt our courts even further in favor of \\nbillionaires and big businesses.\\n  They did it when they spent millions of dollars to hold open a \\nSupreme Court seat for over a year. They did it when they spent \\nmillions more to promote Neil Gorsuch to fill that seat. Now that the \\nCourt is poised to deliver a massive blow to public sector unions and \\nworkers, their investment is paying off big time.\\n  The stakes here couldn't be higher. Millions of teachers, nurses, \\nfirefighters, and police officers are looking to the Court for a fair \\nhearing of the case. They are holding out hope that their freedom to \\ncome together and to stand up for themselves in the workplace, their \\nfreedom to fight for higher wages, their freedom to fight for more \\ngenerous benefits, and their freedom to fight for a better future for \\nthemselves and their children will be preserved.\\n  Unless we make real change, working people are just going to get \\nkicked again and again, and we can make change. We can make the change \\nright here in Washington. We can stand up and fight for our democracy, \\nand we can start by demanding that everyone in our government is \\naccountable, including the President of the United States and the \\nSupreme Court of the United States.\\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\\n  I yield the floor.\\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\", u'turn': 35, u'speaker': u'Ms. WARREN', u'itemno': 42}, {u'kind': u'speech', u'speaker_bioguide': None, u'text': u'  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, 40 years ago, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled \\nthat nonunion public workers who benefit from the work conducted by a \\nunion to negotiate contracts that they benefit from should have to pay \\na fee to cover costs associated with this work. If all workers benefit, \\nit is only right that everyone contributes a fair-share fee.\\n  However, in recent years, there has been a well-funded effort by \\nspecial interest groups backed by corporate billionaires to dismantle \\nunions and silence the voice of workers. There have been a number of \\nattempts to overturn the 1977 decision in Abood v. Detroit Board of \\nEducation. Other efforts have targeted State legislatures where they \\nhave had success in many States. In other States like Pennsylvania, \\nthese efforts were blocked.\\n  Workers already have the right to decide whether to join a union. \\nThey have the right to decide. It is common sense that if these workers \\nbenefit from the higher wages and better working conditions that result \\nfrom contract negotiations undertaken by the union, that those workers \\nshould have to chip in for the cost of these negotiations. That is just \\nfair. These negotiations get results and they benefit workers. They \\nbenefit workers who are in the union and benefit workers who are not in \\nthe union.\\n  The right to bargain collectively has been an integral part of \\nraising income and growing the middle class over the course of the last \\ncentury. Being able to organize and bargain collectively allows workers \\nto demand higher wages and salaries and of course boost their incomes. \\nThese workers have more money to provide for their families, to \\nincrease consumption, which in turn increases both production and \\nemployment. Putting more money in the hands of workers is good for \\nworkers and for the country.\\n  Over the last several decades, we have seen the balance of power \\nacross our Nation tilt more and more in favor of the wealthy and the \\nlargest corporate interests at the expense of working Americans.\\n  The Supreme Court has not been immune from this trend. Under Chief \\nJustice Roberts, the Court has become an ever more reliable ally for \\nbig corporations. A major study published in the Minnesota Law Review \\nin 2013 found that the four conservative Justices currently sitting on \\nthe Court--Justices Alito, Roberts, Thomas, and Kennedy--are among the \\nsix most business-friendly Supreme Court Justices since 1946. So four \\nof the six most business-friendly are serving on the Court at the same \\ntime.\\n  A review by the Constitutional Accountability Center--which is an \\nongoing review and is updated with every case the Supreme Court \\ndecides--shows the consequences of the Court's corporate tilt, finding \\nthat the chamber of commerce has had a success rate of 70 percent in \\ncases before the Roberts' Court--a significant increase over previous \\ncourts.\\n  These are all critical cases. These are cases of critical importance \\nto everyday Americans. These are cases involving, for example, rules \\nfor consumer contracts, challenges to regulations ensuring fair pay and \\nlabor standards, attempts by consumers to hold companies accountable \\nfor product safety, and much more.\\n  Well-funded corporate special interests do not have the best \\ninterests of working families at heart. They are pushing these efforts \\nto reduce their bottom line by reducing the incomes of working \\nfamilies.\\n  That is why we are standing today to make sure that the voice of \\nworking Pennsylvanians and Americans are heard. To increase incomes and \\nstrengthen the middle class, we need to\\n\\n\\nstop the assault on workers and labor unions, whether it happens in \\nCongress or in State legislatures or, indeed, in the U.S. Supreme \\nCourt.\\n  I yield the floor.\\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\", u'turn': 41, u'speaker': u'Mr. CASEY', u'itemno': 49}, {u'kind': u'speech', u'speaker_bioguide': None, u'text': u'  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to speak in proud support of \\nAmerica's workers--the men and women who build our cars and our homes, \\nwho move American-made products across oceans, lakes, and highways, who \\nteach our children every school day, who take care of our families when \\nthey get sick, and who keep us safe in our communities. I have seen \\nfirsthand the importance of unions, both in my home State, where I grew \\nup, and across the country.\\n  This is deeply personal for me. My father Herb was a public school \\nteacher and an active member of the Michigan Education Association. My \\nfather-in-law Raul was a proud member--and continues to be a proud \\nmember--of the United Auto Workers.\\n  My mother Madeleine found economic opportunity as a nurse's aide. As \\npart of providing the best care possible to patients, she fought for a \\nbetter workplace for her colleagues, and then she went on to help \\norganize her workplace. She later served as a union steward with the \\nSEIU.\\n  My parents raised me in a middle-class, union household. They \\ninstilled in me the need, both, to stand up for rights and to never \\ntake those rights for granted.\\n  Standing together for fair wages, safer workplaces, and better hours, \\nMichigan's strong labor movement built the American manufacturing \\nsector and a middle class that made the United States a global economic \\npowerhouse.\\n  My parents and their fellow union members embraced the union values \\nthat built Michigan: the ability to earn a good life where you grow up, \\nhard work, fairness, and looking out for your neighbor--whether it is \\nyour neighbor on the assembly line or in your neighborhood. These are \\nnot just union values. These are American values, and I learned to \\ncherish them at a very young age. Now, I am sorry to say, these values \\nare under attack, and I can't help but to take it personally.\\n  This year we have seen new and unprecedented attempts to undermine \\nour Nation's workers and their ability to collectively bargain. Earlier \\nthis year, my Republican colleagues passed legislation to repeal \\nFederal rules that simply required businesses to disclose previous \\nworkplace safety and fair pay violations before they could contract \\nwith the Federal Government. The reason for this rule was fairly \\nstraightforward: We should not be sending taxpayer dollars to employers \\nthat can't keep their employees safe or that cheat them out of their \\nhard-earned dollars. Yet Republicans repealed the rule.\\n  Now, across the country, we are seeing a wave of so-called right-to-\\nwork legislation, which in practice means you can work more hours for \\nless pay. In Michigan we are seeing the impact of this misguided \\nlegislation.\\n  Supporters of these policies told us that wages and job growth would \\nincrease if Michigan just passed laws to crack down on union \\nmembership. Well, Michigan has the law, but workers and their families \\naren't seeing any of the promised benefits.\\n  In the years since passage of the law, the economic data clearly \\nshows that, yes, corporate profits are up but not wages. In fact, when \\ncomparing Michigan to States that haven't attacked union membership, \\nstudies suggest that we have fallen behind pro-union States when it \\ncomes to worker pay.\\n  I am deeply concerned by the ongoing efforts to implement national \\nanti-union laws, including the Janus v. AFSCME case that the U.S. \\nSupreme Court will rule on in the very near future. A negative ruling \\nin this case would be a huge loss for American workers and would \\nundermine the right to collectively bargain.\\n  We should be doing everything we can to support American workers and \\ntheir right to fight for better working conditions, fair pay, and the \\nability to care for their families. Instead of attacking our Nation's \\nlabor unions, we should be celebrating them.\\n  For generations, unions have helped America build the world's most \\nrobust middle class and a powerful economy, second to no other nation. \\nUnions have not only helped workers to take home more pay and have a \\nsafe place to work, but they have also built communities. Unions teach \\ntheir members valuable skills and help them earn a secure retirement \\nand have quality healthcare.\\n  Big corporations are not trying to undermine unions because they are \\nlooking out for newly hired employees. They are fighting against unions \\nbecause of what unions stand for--the right to collectively bargain for \\nbetter pay, increased workplace safety, hard-earned retirement \\nbenefits, and quality healthcare.\\n  I ask my colleagues to take a moment to consider our history and the \\nhard-working men and women who built this great Nation of ours. Union \\nmembers are our neighbors, our firefighters, our police officers, our \\nteachers, our nurses, our brothers and sisters, our moms, and our dads. \\nThey build our cars, our homes, and our infrastructure.\\n  I urge all of my colleagues to honor these men and women by opposing \\nany and all efforts to expand harmful policies designed to undermine \\nAmerican workers.\\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\", u'turn': 45, u'speaker': u'Mr. PETERS', u'itemno': 53}, {u'kind': u'speech', u'speaker_bioguide': None, u'text': u'  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I wish to thank my colleagues for joining \\nme on the floor today to stand with American workers. We organized a \\ngroup of close to a dozen Senators who have heartfelt and strong views \\nabout the dignity of work, who understand so well that workers are \\nworking harder and smarter but earn less and less money, in spite of \\ntheir hard work, in spite of their commitment.\\n  I have been joined on the floor already by Senator Schumer from New \\nYork, Senator Murray from Washington State, Senator Duckworth from \\nIllinois, Senator Warren of Massachusetts, Senator Casey from \\nPennsylvania, and Senator Peters from Michigan, and speaking after I \\nspeak will be Senator Whitehouse of Rhode Island and Senator Merkley of \\nOregon and Senator Durbin of Illinois. I thank them for standing up for \\nAmerican workers.\\n  People in Ohio and around the country, as I said, work harder, and \\nthey work longer than ever, but they have less and less to show for it. \\nOver the last 40 years, GDP has gone up, corporate profits have gone \\nup, executives' salaries have gone up all because of the productivity \\nof American workers. Again, GDP goes up, corporate profits go up, \\nexecutive salaries explode upward. Workers are more productive, but \\nworkers have not shared in the economic growth they have created. Hard \\nwork just doesn't pay off like it did a generation ago.\\n  It is no coincidence that over that same timeframe, we have seen \\nattack after attack after attack on the labor movement. Corporate \\nspecial interests have spent decades stripping workers of their freedom \\nto organize for fair wages and for benefits. The case the Supreme Court \\njust agreed to take up, Janus v. AFSCME, is yet another attempt to chip \\naway at workers' power in the workplace.\\n  These are public service workers. These are public schoolteachers, \\nlibrarians, police officers, school nurses, firefighters, and postal \\nworkers. They are not looking to get rich in these jobs. They are just \\nlooking to be paid what they earn, the same as any other worker in this \\ncountry.\\n  Make no mistake, an attack on public sector unions is an attack on \\nall unions. An attack on unions is an attack on all workers, whether \\nthey belong to a union or not, and I mean all workers, whether you \\npunch a timeclock or whether you fill out a timesheet or swipe a badge, \\nwhether you make a salary or earn tips, whether you are on payroll, a \\ncontract worker,\\n\\n\\na temp, working behind a desk, cutting hair, working on a factory \\nfloor, or working behind a restaurant counter. I mean all workers.\\n  The fact is, all workers across this country--as profits go up, as \\nGDP goes up, as executive compensation goes up, as workers get more \\nproductive, all workers across this country are feeling squeezed. Work \\ndoesn't pay off the way it used to.\\n  We have seen what happens when workers have no power in the \\nworkplace. Increasingly, corporations view American workers as a cost \\nto be minimized instead of a valuable asset in which to invest.\\n  Look at the news we got last month. This piece of news, when I \\nmention this to some of my colleagues, when I mention it around the \\nState of Ohio, peoples' mouths drop. The Bank of America, Merrill Lynch \\ndowngraded the fast food restaurant Chipotle because the company pays \\nits workers too much.\\n  Remember what happened with American Airlines a few months ago. \\nAmerican Airlines announced it was doing a companywide pay increase, \\nand the stock market punished them by knocking their stock down. \\nImagine that. So when a company wants to do the right thing, Wall \\nStreet says: No, you are not going to do the right thing. Wall Street \\nis saying: We want all the money. Don't give any of this money to \\nworkers--workers making $10 or $12 or $15 an hour. Think about that. \\nWall Street and Merrill Lynch didn't say they paid their workers too \\nlittle, they paid their workers too much. That is why the labor \\nmovement matters.\\n  Pope Francis spoke about how unions perform ``an essential role for \\nthe common good.'' He said that the labor movement ``gives voice to \\nthose who have none . . . unmasks the powerful who trample on the \\nrights of the most vulnerable workers, defends the cause of the \\nforeigner, the least, the discarded.''\\n  I just had the pleasure, for the last few minutes in my office, to \\nspeak with Bishop Murry of Youngstown, OH, and we were talking about \\nthe Pope and about steelworkers in Youngstown and about the struggles \\nof workers and wages and layoffs and all the things that have happened \\nto--where the winds of globalization have buffeted the workers in that \\ncommunity. Bishop Murry, as does Pope Francis, understands what too \\nmany in this town don't; that workers feel invisible, entire \\ncommunities feel invisible. They feel like they are getting used and \\nabused and some other words I can't say on the Senate floor.\\n  What, exactly, is the point of creating economic growth if workers \\ndon't share in it, if ordinary families still can't get ahead?\\n  Everybody here loves to talk about tax reform and bring the corporate \\nrate down, but nobody is talking about paying workers more or giving \\nworkers more job security or what we should be doing--in working with \\ncompanies and creating good jobs.\\n  My legislation, the Patriot Corporation Act, says if corporations do \\nthe right thing--if they pay their workers well, if they pay benefits, \\nif they do the kinds of things American corporations should do--then \\nthey get a lower tax rate because they have earned it.\\n  We seem to have forgotten that all work has dignity. We have \\nforgotten, as the Pope said, that ``the person thrives in work. Labour \\nis the most common form of cooperation that humanity has generated in \\nits history.'' Think about that. ``Labour is the most common form of \\ncooperation that humanity has generated in its history.''\\n  What Washington and Wall Street don't seem to understand is that \\nworkers drive our economy, not corporations. You focus on the middle \\nclass, you grow the economy from the middle out, not cut taxes on the \\nrichest people and expect the money to trickle down into more money in \\nworkers' pockets and more people are hired. You grow the economy by \\ntreating workers well, by investing in workers. That is why we need \\nunions to ensure that we spread economic growth to the people creating \\nit, to the people working too many hours for too little pay.\\n  I think about workers like Stephanie in Columbus. She has worked for \\n25 years as a childcare attendant for students with special needs. She \\nwrote, saying: ``Every day I wake up before the sun rises to prepare \\nfor three daily shifts aiding students with special needs on their way \\nto and from school.''\\n  That is the person whom--because she belongs to a union, that is the \\nperson whom corporate America, that the rightwing of the Republican \\nParty wants to attack? That is the kind of person--Stephanie in \\nColumbus--they want to attack?\\n  She worries that cases like this that undermine her union ``could \\nseverely limit our voice on the job and hurt our ability to best serve \\nthe children we care so much about.'' She said: ``Unions provide a \\npathway to the middle class for all people.''\\n  Think about a janitor I met in Cincinnati. I was speaking at a \\ndinner. There was a table down front with seven middle-age women--a \\npretty diverse group. There was one empty seat at the table. It was \\ntold to me by some others that this group of women were janitors, \\ncustodians in downtown Cincinnati, southwest Ohio, and these women had \\nsigned their first union contract with downtown Cincinnati business \\nowners. So there were 1,200 janitors working in these downtown \\nbusinesses--in these big buildings downtown--and they had signed their \\nfirst union contract.\\n  I asked if I could sit at their table, and they said yes. I said to \\nthe woman next to me: What is it like to have a union?\\n  She said: I am 51 years old, and this is the first time I will have a \\n1-week paid vacation in my life.\\n  Think about that. We don't think--I am guessing that most of my \\ncolleagues think: Well, you know, people have paid vacations and people \\nhave paid sick leave. Well, much of the country doesn't, No. 1; and No. \\n2, those who do often have that because they had a strong union--a \\nunion that negotiated sick leave pay for them, a union that negotiated \\nvacation days for them, a union that negotiated family leave for them, \\nand then, when those workers at a company get it, the other \\nnonunionized workers and companies get it, and then those companies \\ncompete with other companies.\\n  So the fact is--there is a bumper sticker that says: ``If you enjoy \\nyour weekend, thank a labor union.''\\n  Labor unions brought to this country things like weekends and more \\nleisure time and decent pay and all that. That is why unions matter. \\nThat is why this decision in the Supreme Court matters.\\n  If the Supreme Court rules against AFSCME, it will starve the union \\nfor resources they use to organize and grow and advocate for more \\nworkers. At the risk of being disrespectful, it would be nice if those \\nnine members of the Supreme Court would follow the admonishment of Pope \\nFrancis, the words of Pope Francis, who admonished his parish priests \\nto go out and smell like the flock. Find out where people live and \\nwork. Find out what people do.\\n  Find out the living conditions of people.\\n  Abraham Lincoln in the White House one day was talking to his staff. \\nHis staff said: You have to stay here in the White House. You have to \\nwin the war. You have to free the slaves. You have to preserve the \\nUnion.\\n  Lincoln said: No, I have to go out and get my public opinion baths.\\n  It could be important if the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court--who \\nhas an Ivy league education, went to the best colleges and the best law \\nschools, grew up in a wealthy family, has done very well as a \\nprofessional, and is a very smart man--if he would go out and smell \\nlike the flock, if he would go out and get his public opinion bath, \\nmaybe he would hear some stories, as I have heard in my time in the \\nSenate.\\n  He would hear stories from people who talk about how important it is \\nthat Stephanie has union protection. He probably has never really \\nthought much about the fact that janitors, who have worked 30 years as \\njanitors--35 years for some of those women--but never had a paid day \\noff, never had a paid vacation. He might learn something from them and \\nthink a little differently about this.\\n  If the Supreme Court rules against AFSCME, it is the opposite of what \\nwe need. We should be making it easier, not harder, for workers to come \\ntogether and negotiate. That is why, this week, I am introducing \\nlegislation to strengthen the National Labor Relations Act, to make it \\nharder for employers to deny workers the freedom to collectively \\nbargain by playing games with their job titles and classifications.\\n\\n\\nInstead of stacking the deck even further in favor of corporate CEOs, \\nwe need to make it easier for workers to organize. That is how we make \\nhard work pay off.\\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\", u'turn': 49, u'speaker': u'Mr. BROWN', u'itemno': 57}, {u'kind': u'speech', u'speaker_bioguide': None, u'text': u'  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, the Janus decision coming up in the \\nU.S. Supreme Court, which Senator Brown has just spoken about, is one \\nthat merits the attention of people who are concerned about the country \\nand the Court.\\n  I wish to make two points in my remarks. The first has to do with the \\nvery difficult to explain--or at least very difficult to comfortably \\nexplain--pattern of 5-to-4 decisions of the U.S. Supreme Court, in \\nwhich the five consist entirely of Republican appointees.\\n  The Supreme Court makes a lot of decisions, of course. But there is \\nsomething that is particularly interesting about the 5-to-4 decisions, \\nwhere the five Republican appointees line up and roll the other \\nappointees. When we start looking at those decisions, there are some \\nreally significant patterns that emerge. The first pattern goes to \\nissues in which the court is treading into the world of politics.\\n  Bear in mind that when Sandra Day O'Connor left the Court, it lost \\nits only member who had ever run for office. What Justice O'Connor left \\nbehind was the first Court in the history of the United States that had \\nexactly zero experience with elections and politics. There has never \\nbeen as ignorant and green a Court in the history of the United States \\nwhen it comes to politics; yet there has rarely been a Court so \\nflagrantly eager to jump into politics and make very consequential \\ndecisions.\\n  When we look at the 5-to-4 decisions--which I think are probably the \\nbulk of those--each one aligns with the political interests of the \\nRepublican Party--each one. It is not one or two or even three. It goes \\non and on and on.\\n  The oldest one in the series is probably Vieth v. Jubelirer, which \\nwas the decision in which the five Republicans said: This whole \\ngerrymandering thing is just too difficult for us. We are going to \\ndeclare open season. There is going to be no judicial remedy. We can't \\nfigure out one, so we don't have one.\\n  It is not just me who is saying that. The ABA section on election law \\nsaid in its volume: Look, basically, it is game over for court review \\nof gerrymandering. What immediately happened after that was the \\nRepublican Party went to work with that green-light signal and did the \\nREDMAP project, which created massive, bulk gerrymandering through the \\nbattleground States. This was not an easy plan because, in some cases, \\nthey had to spend millions of dollars to win one or two State \\nlegislative seats, so they could then control the State legislature, so \\nthey could then change the districts consistent with the bulk \\ngerrymandering scheme.\\n  The result is what happened in States like Senator Brown's, where, \\nwhen he was reelected, he was on the ballot with President Obama, who \\nwas also reelected, and the majority of the votes cast in his State for \\nMembers of Congress were cast for Democrats, but against that \\nbackground, many more Republicans than Democrats actually went to \\nCongress in that election.\\n  A similar thing happened in Pennsylvania. My recollection is that on \\nthe same set of facts, Senator Casey, a Democrat, was reelected; \\nPresident Obama, a Democrat, was reelected; a majority of Pennsylvania \\nvotes were cast for Democratic Members of Congress; the delegation was \\n13 Republicans and 5 Democrats. Somebody is messing around, and it was \\na 5-to-4 Republican Supreme Court that opened that can of worms and \\nunleashed REDMAP on the political landscape.\\n  They have a chance to review that now. Senator McCain has written a \\nbipartisan brief asking them to wake up and smell the coffee about what \\nhas gone wrong here. We will see if they do or not, but, clearly, that \\nwas a decision that benefited the Republican Party's polls, and, \\nclearly, it was 5 to 4.\\n  Then you go to the Voting Rights Act cases. There were two of them. \\nIn the first one, Bartlett v. Strickland, the five Republican members \\nteed up a new standard, which they mentioned, but they didn't really \\nact on it. Then, when it came to the home run pitch, Shelby County v. \\nHolder, they created this new theory about which very conservative \\njudges, like Posner, said that, basically, it stands on thin air. It \\nhas no basis whatsoever in any real legal theory. They knocked out the \\npart of the Voting Rights Act that requires States with a wretched \\nhistory of abuse of minorities and Democratic voters at the polls to \\nget preclearance from the Department of Justice or from a court before \\nthey can change their State laws to scare people or keep people away \\nfrom the polls.\\n  With that knocked out, guess what. All these legislatures across the \\nSouth went straight to work. They passed law after law after law to \\ndeny people access to the polls, and over and over again, the courts \\nthat reviewed those and the appellate courts that reviewed the district \\ncourt decisions found that the laws had been intentionally \\ndiscriminatory, that the legislature had intended to keep people away \\nfrom the polls, that they had intended to discriminate against Democrat \\nand minority voters, and that they had chosen to do that deliberately.\\n  Of course, you can go back after all that litigation and clean it up \\nand try to get the laws stricken and all of that. But in the meantime, \\nyou have had election after election in which the effect at the polls \\nwas had.\\n  They couldn't have been more wrong about the notion that if you \\nlifted the preclearance requirement, everybody was going to be fine. \\nThose were just the bad old days; it was a whole new America; racism \\ndidn't exist; efforts by one party to keep the other parties away from \\nthe polls weren't anything to worry about. Move along, move along; \\nnothing to see here, folks. They were just plain dead wrong. They had \\nabsolutely no clue, and they have been proven dead wrong since. But, \\nagain, both of those cases were 5 to 4, all Republicans together.\\n  Then, of course, the big whammy came when the big special interests \\nthat so often are the core backers of the Republican Party decided that \\nthey felt really constrained by having to live under campaign finance \\nlimits. They wanted to be able to spend unlimited money in elections. \\nWell, that is fine. It reminds me a little bit of the story of the \\nFrench philosopher who touted the majesty and equality of the French \\nlaw, which forbid both rich and poor alike from sleeping under bridges \\nand begging for bread. Well, guess who actually sleeps under bridges \\nand begs for bread. It is not rich and poor. And guess who can take \\nadvantage of a rule that you can spend unlimited money in politics. \\nOnly those who meet two conditions: One, they have unlimited money to \\nspend, and, two, they have a good reason to spend it. In other words, \\nreally big special interests.\\n  The Court's decision, presuming that this spending was going to be \\neither independent or transparent, has been turned into a mockery by \\nevents since. They obviously did not know what they were talking about. \\nFacts have borne out that they did not know what they were talking \\nabout. They were completely dead wrong.\\n  Interestingly, since then, despite the presumption of their decision \\nhaving been cut completely out from underneath it, the Court has shown \\nno interest in a correction. They have shown no interest in correcting \\ntheir error. They seem completely happy, the 5 to 4--the five \\nRepublican appointees--completely happy to have the landscape of \\nAmerican politics polluted with this money.\\n  There again, it wasn't just one decision. It was a bunch of them. \\nCitizens United was the big one; Tradition Partnership, Inc. v. Bullock \\nanother; McCutcheon v. FEC yet another; Davis v. FEC yet another; \\nArizona Free Enterprise Club's FreedomClub PAC v. Bennett yet another--\\nall 5 to 4, all the Republicans lining up, all throwing out precedent \\nor laws that had stood for 100 years.\\n  So Janus fits right into this pattern of 5-to-4 decisions. Indeed, it \\nis actually a little bit worse because something weird happened early \\non when one of those 5 to 4--the Republican five Justices on the \\nSupreme Court--signaled to the corporate supporters of\\n\\n\\nthis ideology that he was interested in taking a whack at unions in a \\nparticular way.\\n  There is a pet peeve of the union-busting rightwing and the corporate \\nsector, which was a decision from 1977 called Abood v. Detroit Board of \\nEducation. That decision allows unions to collect some dues from \\nnonmembers on the grounds that their work for their members has benefit \\nto other members. So you break out their wages work, which helps \\neverybody, from their political work, which you can disaggregate from, \\nand it allows you to collect certain dues--not complete dues, but \\ncertain dues--from nonunion members. What Abood did was to help unions \\nkeep revenues from the service that they give to nonmembers who benefit \\nfrom their work. Without that rule, employees would be encouraged to be \\nfree riders and just get the benefit of what the union is doing without \\nmaking any contribution to support it whatsoever. Of course, if that \\nwere to happen, the balance of power between corporations and unions \\nwould shift further toward corporations.\\n\\n  The story is told quite well in the New York Times by a reporter \\nnamed Adam Liptak, who is a Supreme Court reporter. I will read his \\nstory.\\n\\n       In making a minor adjustment to how public unions must \\n     issue notifications about their political spending, Justice \\n     Alito digressed to raise questions about the \\n     constitutionality of requiring workers who are not members of \\n     public unions to pay fees for the unions' work on their \\n     behalf. . . . Justice Sonia Sotomayor saw what was going on. \\n     ``To cast serious doubt on longstanding precedence,'' she \\n     wrote in a concurrence, ``is a step we historically take only \\n     with the greatest caution and reticence. To do so, as the \\n     majority does, on our own invitation and without adversarial \\n     presentation is both unfair and unwise.''\\n       Michael A. Carvin, a leading conservative lawyer, also saw \\n     what was going on. He and the Center for Individual Rights, a \\n     libertarian group, promptly filed the challenge Justice Alito \\n     had sketched out.\\n\\n  I would say that he had invited.\\n\\n       Indeed, Mr. Carvin asked the lower courts to rule against \\n     his clients, a Christian education group and 10 California \\n     teachers, so they could high-tail it to the Supreme Court.\\n\\n  Let me interrupt my reading of the story for a second and make the \\npoint that this lawyer wanted to lose his case in the lower courts. It \\nis rare for lawyers to go into a court wanting to lose. You have to \\nhave kind of a weird motive to take a case into court that you want to \\nlose. The obvious motive here is that Mr. Carvin had heard the signal \\nfrom Justice Alito that he was willing to rule his way if he would just \\nbring the right case. So it didn't matter whether he won or lost. \\nLosing is actually quicker. It gets you right up to the Supreme Court. \\nHe is not interested in litigating the matter truly on the merits; he \\nis only interested in getting as quickly as possible to the Supreme \\nCourt. Why? Because he knew that 5 to 4, he would get the right \\ndecision.\\n  When you are a lawyer, the most sickening feeling you can have is to \\ngo into court with the belief that the judges you are going to argue \\nbefore are prejudged against you. The confidence that Carvin must have \\nhad to want to lose a case deliberately below so that he could hightail \\nit at high speed up to a court that he knew was going to rule his way \\nbecause they told him they would--that is not American justice in the \\nway it should be delivered.\\n  As it turned out, they took up the case. It was called Friedrichs. It \\nwas going to be 5 to 4, just as expected, and then Justice Scalia \\nunexpectedly passed away. If you read about how the press took that, it \\nwas very clear that the fix had been in on this case.\\n\\n       ``Corporate America had high hopes,'' the Journal said, \\n     because ``the Supreme Court appeared poised to deliver long-\\n     sought conservative victories.''\\n\\n  Since when should a court be poised to deliver long-sought \\nconservative victories, not fair, dispassionate adjudication? But that \\nis the reporting of the friendly Wall Street Journal. And those long-\\nsought conservative victories were going to take the form of `` `body \\nblow[s] that business had sought against consumer and worker \\nplaintiffs.' The cases `had been carefully developed by activists to \\ncapitalize on the court's rightward tilt.' ''\\n  Come on. This is not adjudication any longer; it is just the exercise \\nof political power. And these 5-to-4 partisan decisions by the Supreme \\nCourt are degrading the reputation of the Supreme Court, they are \\ndegrading the integrity of the Supreme Court, and they are degrading \\nthe role of the judiciary in our vaunted scheme of constitutional \\ngovernment in the United States of America.\\n  With that, I yield to my distinguished colleague from Oregon.\", u'turn': 53, u'speaker': u'Mr. WHITEHOUSE', u'itemno': 61}, {u'kind': u'speech', u'speaker_bioguide': None, u'text': u'  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, our Nation was founded on a powerful \\nprinciple encapsulated by the first three words of our Constitution: \\n``We the People.'' We are meant to be a nation, in the words of Abraham \\nLincoln, ``of the people, by the people, and for the people,'' not a \\nnation by and for the most powerful, not a nation by and for the most \\nprivileged. Yet time and time again, we are seeing a complete and total \\ncorruption of the vision of our Constitution.\\n  We saw this earlier this year with one TrumpCare bill after another \\ndesigned to rip healthcare away from 20 to 30 million Americans to \\ndeliver tax giveaways to the richest in America. We have seen it just \\nrecently in the consideration of a budget that reversed that and said \\nthat in order to give $4.5 trillion of tax giveaways almost entirely to \\nthe richest Americans, we will take $1 trillion out of Medicaid and \\nhalf a trillion out of Medicare. We have seen this powerful conversion \\nof standing our Constitution on its head, and now we have the Supreme \\nCourt fully participating in this effort in a case called Janus v. \\nAFSCME. It is the very epitome of the principle of a nation so \\ncorrupted that it honors the opposite of what our Constitution stands \\nfor.\\n  The sole purpose of this case, Janus v. AFSCME, is to undercut the \\nability of workers to organize. This is an assault on the freedom of \\nworking Americans to associate with their coworkers. It is an assault \\non the freedom of working Americans to negotiate a fair wage. It is an \\nassault on the freedom of Americans to fight for fairer benefits and a \\nsafe workplace. Bottom line: It is an assault on the freedom of workers \\nto participate in the wealth they work so hard to create.\\n  In short, this is the right to exploit that our Supreme Court--\\nmajority of five--is so determined to elevate. I have read the \\nConstitution, and I have never seen embedded in it a right to exploit, \\na right to cheat, a right to take advantage of. Yet here is the \\nmajority of the Court prepared to fight for exploitation on behalf of \\nthe 1 percent of Americans at the very top.\\n  The key strategy in this case is to attack the finances of workers \\nwhen they organize. Former President Jimmy Carter once said: ``Every \\nadvance in this half-century--Social Security, civil rights, Medicare, \\naid to education, one after another--came with the support and \\nleadership of American labor.'' It has been workers banding together to \\nsay: We can create a better foundation for families to thrive. And that \\nhasn't just created a better foundation for those who belong to unions; \\nit has created a better foundation for all workers. We saw them \\nsuccessfully band together and fight for a 40-hour workweek, fight for \\nminimum wage, fight for sick leave, and fight for healthy and safe \\nworking conditions--again, benefits that every worker enjoys because \\nworkers were able to organize and fight to receive and win these \\nprovisions.\\n  What is really going in the Janus case? Any organization, in order to \\nfunction, has rights and responsibilities. Rights are the rewards you \\nget for participating, and responsibilities are the requirement that \\nyou be part of the team and you contribute to the effort.\\n  When I was small, probably just 2 or 3 years old, my mother had a \\nbook she would read to me that involved the animals in the barnyard. \\nAnimal after animal was asked to participate in making the bread, and \\nanimal after animal turned it down, but when the bread was baked, they \\nwanted a full share even though they had refused to participate in the \\neffort to create it. This is what Janus is all about. It is about the \\nright to the rewards, divided from any responsibility to get the work \\ndone.\\n  When workers organize, they say: We are going to have to be able to \\nhave the finances to drive this organization, and to do that, we need \\nto have every worker contribute a fair share. Those fair share fees \\nmean that all the workers\\n\\n\\nare in it together, they are all contributing, and they all benefit \\nfrom the rewards.\\n  Forever, the courts have said: Yes, with the reward goes the \\nresponsibility. That is true of any organization. It is fundamental in \\nhow organizations work. If you don't show up here on the floor, you \\ndon't get to vote. Every organization has its responsibilities that go \\nwith its rewards. But the 1 percent have chosen a strategy that says: \\nWe will take one organization in America--and that is workers \\norganizations--and we will drive an absolute wedge between the \\nresponsibility and the reward.\\n  These fees that we are talking about, these fair share fees, are not \\nfees that go to political purposes. They don't go to donations to \\ncandidates. They don't go to organizing campaigns walking door-to-door \\nfor candidates. They don't go to advertising on the television or the \\nweb. They are simply the cost of having a team that works to negotiate \\nan agreement with a company.\\n  I find it absolutely evil that a majority of the Supreme Court is \\nexcited about embracing this right to exploit other workers by saying \\nin this one case in America, you get the rewards without the \\nresponsibilities. If the Court was applying that to a stockholder in a \\ncompany, the equivalent would be to say that the stockholder doesn't \\nhave to contribute to the costs of the management of the corporation, \\nso they can demand back their share of what the management spends on \\ntheir salaries, on their office spaces, on their private jets, and on \\ntheir trips to do whatever they do, of the time they spend negotiating \\nacquisitions to build the size of the company or striking deals to sell \\ntheir products. That would be the equivalent, that a stockholder gets \\nthe rewards of all of that negotiation without having to participate in \\nthe cost. But this is not a situation in which five Justices want to \\napply consistent principle because their goal isn't to honor the \\nConstitution, and their goal is not fairness; their single goal is to \\ndemolish the ability of workers to organize, to get a fair share of the \\nwealth they work to create.\\n  We can see that already our Nation is in trouble on this principle. \\nFor the three decades after World War II, we had workers who had the \\nstrong ability to organize and demand a fair share, and we saw a \\nrevolution in the prosperity of workers in those three decades from \\n1945 through 1975. Individuals who had lived in shacks, individuals who \\nhad been wiped out by the Great Depression suddenly were able to buy, \\non a single worker's income--it didn't even take two incomes--a three-\\nbedroom ranch house with a basement and a single-car garage and were \\nstill able to save money for an annual camping trip and perhaps to save \\nsome to help their children launch themselves into life. That is what \\nwe had when workers got a fair share.\\n\\n  Yet, in the midseventies, the multinational companies said: Do you \\nknow what? Let's undercut the American worker by making our goods \\noverseas in China and importing them. That way, we will demolish the \\njobs here in America, and we, the company, will have made things at the \\nlowest price in the world, have sold them at the world market price, \\nand have made a lot more money. This strategy worked for the \\nmultinational companies. They made vast sums of money for their \\nstockholders and for their executives.\\n  This application of different rules for foreign workers and domestic \\nworkers really gave a huge advantage to our competitor overseas and to \\na company that spanned both shores and could move its production \\noverseas. So we saw the loss of 50,000 factories; we saw the loss of 5 \\nmillion factory jobs; we saw the loss of an enormous number of supply \\nchain jobs; and we saw, without those payrolls being spent in the \\ncommunity, an enormous loss of retail jobs in the community, but it \\nmade the wealthy wealthier, and that was the goal of the strategy.\\n  So here we are, facing this case that will come before the Court \\nlater this year, but the members of the Court have, essentially, \\nalready declared their positions. Four members of the Court were on the \\nprevious version of this when the Court tied 4 to 4, and Neil Gorsuch, \\nwho was added to the Court, has been very clear on which side of this \\nhe stands.\\n  Should we put an asterisk by Neil Gorsuch's name? Should a 5-to-4 \\ndecision, with Gorsuch being in the majority, even carry weight here in \\nour society? This is the seat that for the first time in U.S. history \\nwas stolen from one President and delivered to another. The majority of \\nthis body right here stole the seat, undermining the integrity, \\ndishonoring the oath, the responsibility for advice and consent, and \\ndamaging the legitimacy of the Supreme Court. It was done because it \\nwas a strategy to enable the 1 percent to rip off ordinary working \\nAmericans. The prize for that was a position on Citizens United that \\nnow allows the wealthiest Americans to continue to fund campaigns \\nacross this country to drown out the voices of ordinary people and a \\nposition on this case, the Janus case, that says that we will take one \\norganization in America, that of the workers, and divide the rewards \\nfrom the rights.\\n  We know who is behind this strategy. It is the Koch brothers through \\ntheir organizations, the National Right to Work Foundation and the \\nLiberty Justice Center. They were behind the strategy for the theft of \\nthe Supreme Court seat. They were behind the massive increase in third-\\nparty spending that polluted the campaigns across this country. They \\nare behind this strategy to destroy the vision that is embedded in our \\nConstitution.\\n  Eleanor Roosevelt once said: I am opposed to this legislation because \\nit gives employers the right to exploit. Eleanor Roosevelt was a real \\nchampion for workers, and she called a spade a spade. The right to \\nexploit is not a right that any Member of this body should pursue, and \\nit certainly should not be pursued by the Supreme Court.\\n  We know that there is a chapter 2 to this strategy. The first is to \\nget the Supreme Court so that you can divide the rights from the \\nresponsibilities; therefore, you as a worker do not have to contribute \\nto the cost, but you will benefit from the rewards. Pretty soon, very \\nfew people will be contributing; therefore, it will undermine the \\nfinancial ability of the union to negotiate.\\n  Then they have a second strategy. This fundraising letter was sent \\nout last year by the State Policy Network. By the way, the State Policy \\nNetwork is an alliance of 66 State-based think tanks that are designed \\nand funded by the Koch brothers and their friends to undercut the \\nability of workers to get a fair share of the wealth that they create. \\nThey said: Here is our plan to defund and defang our opponent, the \\nunions--to deal a blow to the left's ability to control government.\\n  Ah, they are fancy words, but what they really meant was our goal is \\nto take and undo the ability of workers to organize so as to get a fair \\nshare of the wealth they create. It is one evil act after another that \\nis funded by the Koch cartel.\\n  In our Nation, we have stood up to this type of abuse time and again. \\nThe American historian who created the phrase the ``American dream'' \\nsaid, in each generation, there is a group of Americans who rises up to \\ntake on the forces that appear to be overwhelming us. We need to call \\non the people of the United States who believe in the vision of our \\nConstitution, to be that group to rise up and take on this effort to \\nturn our Constitution on its head--to strip ``we the people'' out of \\nour Constitution and replace it with ``we the powerful''--and to stand \\nup against this type of right to exploit, whether it is a bill here on \\nthe floor of the U.S. Senate or it is a begotten majority of the \\nSupreme Court.\", u'turn': 55, u'speaker': u'Mr. MERKLEY', u'itemno': 63}, {u'kind': u'speech', u'speaker_bioguide': None, u'text': u'  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I am not the first guy to stand up here \\nand make this observation, but I have serious concerns with how the \\nnominee confirmation process has been going in this Congress.\\n  There is a blatant lack of respect for the Senate nomination process \\nand an unprecedented level of obstructionism. I have been here for a \\nnumber of years, so I know what to compare it with. I have never seen \\nso many people being delayed in their confirmations, knowing that they \\nare, ultimately, going to be confirmed and that they are well-qualified \\ncivil servants.\\n  The Democrats are forcing cloture votes on nominees who have well \\nover 60 votes in support. Last week, we held a cloture vote on Scott \\nPalk. Scott Palk is from Oklahoma. He is a guy who everybody likes. He \\ndoesn't have\\n\\n\\nany enemies out there. In fact, he was actually nominated by President \\nObama. He was not even nominated by this President. He ended up getting \\n79 votes. Still, the stall was there, and we had to wait and wait and \\nwait. Meanwhile, things are not getting done that should be getting \\ndone. Furthermore, the agency positions that we have hardly ever held \\nrollcall votes on are being forced to occupy floor time. There is no \\nreason for these votes except to delay the work of the courts and our \\nagencies.\\n  I am very supportive of the leader's commitment to our courts and how \\nhe has prioritized judicial nominees. These nominations are extremely \\nimportant and will ensure that the rule of law is upheld for, possibly, \\ndecades to come, benefiting all Americans.\\n\\n\\n                    Environmental Protection Agency\\n\\n  However, there is an Agency that is doing work that is also important \\nto all Americans and needs appointments, and that Agency is the \\nEnvironmental Protection Agency. If there has been one Agency over the \\nlast 8 years that has run around and expanded its authority beyond \\ncongressional intent, it is the EPA. Putting confirmed appointees in \\nplace at the EPA will allow the President and Scott Pruitt to be \\nsuccessful in their efforts to rightsize that Agency. He has talked \\nabout that quite a bit. It is a bloated Agency that needs to be \\nrightsized, and he needs help to do that.\\n  Last week, I highlighted the great things that Scott Pruitt is doing \\nas Administrator. I was able to visit with him yesterday at the EPA and \\nwitness firsthand the implementation of new policies that will bring \\nabout positive changes in an Agency that has run roughshod over the \\nAmerican people. With the repeal of WOTUS and the Clean Power Plan, \\nwith the implementation of TSCA, in reforming the Agency by ending sue-\\nand-settle processes, and by creating greater transparency on the EPA's \\nScience Advisory Committee, he is really doing a great job.\\n  By the way, yesterday, we had this event over there which had to do \\nwith the scientists. There are three Scientific Advisory Boards in the \\nEPA. These are supposed to be made up of scientists who advise the \\npolicymakers as to what they are supposed to be doing. During the last \\nadministration, we discovered in just one of these that six out of \\nseven of the appointees were actually recipients of grants from the \\nEPA. In fact, I was over there, and I gave a little talk about those \\nsix. They actually received $119 million, and they are supposed to be \\nunbiased in making policy. Obviously, this is one of the many things \\nthat he is going to make sure will no longer exist.\\n  He is making it impossible for anyone who serves on a scientific \\nadvisory board to receive any grants from the EPA. How reasonable is \\nthat? Yet that is still a practice they use and one of the many things \\nhe is cleaning up there.\\n  There is a lot of work still to do. The Agency needs its Assistant \\nAdministrators, who will work to implement many of the initiatives I \\nhave worked toward for years. The Environment and Public Works \\nCommittee has now voted out five Assistant Administrators and General \\nCounsel nominees, and I hope we can move swiftly to get these well \\nqualified nominees over to the EPA to bring their expertise to an \\nAgency that desperately needs them. Unfortunately, Democrats have \\ntargeted two of these nominees and have disparaged them, their work, \\nand their backgrounds.\\n\\n\\n                   Nomination of Dr. Michael Dourson\\n\\n  Dr. Michael Dourson will be an excellent Assistant Administrator for \\nthe Office of Chemical Safety and Pollution Prevention and will bring \\nmuch needed expertise and experience to the office in charge of the \\nTSCA reauthorization law. The TSCA bill was a huge success last year. \\nIt was done on a bipartisan basis. It is the first major reform bill in \\n40 years, and we were able to get that through. Yet we need to have a \\nperson as the Assistant Administrator to make sure it is done right.\\n  Dr. Dourson has endured a coordinated campaign against him that \\nmisrepresents who he is and his record. There are groups working to \\npaint Dr. Dourson as an ``industry scientist.''\\n  What you will not hear from these groups is that much of his career \\nexperience comes from the EPA itself, where he worked for 15 years. \\nDuring his years at the EPA, Dr. Dourson helped establish the \\nIntegrated Risk Information System, which helps identify and document \\nthe potential dangers of chemicals found in the environment. He also \\nhas the honor of having received four bronze medals from the EPA for \\nthis commendable work. Dr. Dourson also served on EPA's Scientific \\nAdvisory Board for 6 years and has held leadership roles with a number \\nof relevant toxicology organizations, receiving several awards from his \\npeers.\\n  Since his time at EPA, Dr. Dourson has devoted his career to \\nprotecting public health by founding his own nonprofit that works to \\ndevelop, review, and share risk assessments on various chemicals. His \\nnonprofit work is mostly on behalf of government, with a minority of \\nthe work done at the request of various industries--many of these \\nindustries are very pro-environmental industries--as well as providing \\npro bono assistance to those in need of help. In other words, he used \\nhis expertise to help people who needed help and were not able to get \\nit in any other way.\\n  Naturally, the industry work is the part that environmental activists \\nhave focused on to prove their claims that his research is a \\nrubberstamp for dangerous chemicals. They hold the perspective--which \\nis a myth--that working at the request of industry must mean that you \\nare evil.\\n  As always, the reality is much different. On many occasions the \\nnonprofit has developed risk assessments that did not support the \\nindustry sponsor and were the same or lower than the safe levels set by \\ngovernment. Furthermore, he has provided expert testimony against \\nindustry on several occasions. Unfortunately, the coordinated attack on \\nDr. Dourson will persist and a good man's reputation will continue to \\nbe put at risk.\\n  I ask that the leader find floor time for Dr. Dourson as soon as \\npossible so he can get back to work at an agency that he served \\ncommendably for many years and ensure that those who seek to tear him \\ndown do not win.\\n\\n\\n                       Nomination of Bill Wehrum\\n\\n  I also ask that the leader prioritize another nominee that has also \\nfaced unfair and false attacks. I have known Bill Wehrum for years, and \\nI have no doubt that he is the best choice to head the Office of Air \\nand Radiation. I regret that his first nomination to the EPA back \\nduring the George W. Bush administration was blocked by Senate \\nDemocrats. It is my hope that we can correct that wrong and confirm him \\nas one of the Assistant Administrators. He has served the public and is \\nwidely recognized for his knowledge of the Clean Air Act.\\n  The Clean Air Act has been very successful. In fact, I was one of the \\noriginal cosponsors of the Clean Air Act Amendments. It has performed \\nvery well. He was very much involved in that also. So there is no one \\nmore qualified to head that Office of Air and Radiation than Mr. \\nWehrum, and I am sure of that. He has been consistently recognized as a \\nleader and top lawyer in environmental law by such groups and \\npublications as Chambers USA, the Legal 500 United States, and \\nWashingtonian magazine.\\n  He, too, has worked at the EPA in the past and will once again serve \\nthe Agency and the American people with integrity. Mr. Wehrum is also \\nunder attack for working on behalf of industry. The environmental \\nindustry--and it is an industry, as they, too, are working to secure \\nmoney for themselves by pursuing an agenda of their sponsors--is \\nlobbying against Mr. Wehrum because he wants to make regulations \\nworkable within the scope of the statute for the regulated community.\\n  This is very curious to me because we want environmental regulations \\nto improve our air quality without putting entire industries out of \\nbusiness--a balance that is a part of the Clean Air Act. Those words \\nare used in the Clean Air Act: The rules need to be workable and \\nimplementable without undue harm to our economy.\\n  It is time that we returned some common sense and rule of law to the \\nEnvironmental Protection Agency. We have taken the first and only step \\nwith the confirmation of Scott Pruitt, and Bill Wehrum is the next step \\ntoward that goal. Right now there has only been one confirmation, and \\nthat is for Scott Pruitt.\\n  With the repeal of the Clean Power Plan sitting before the EPA, I ask \\nthat\\n\\n\\nthe leader prioritize Mr. Wehrum's confirmation vote so that we can \\ngive the Office of Air and Radiation the leadership it needs to make \\nthe important policy objectives of the President and a majority of our \\ncolleagues and States a reality.\\n  Again, we have five EPA nominees that have been voted out of \\ncommittee, and we are now into November and only have one EPA appointee \\nconfirmed. We need to do better than that, and I think this is going to \\nhappen.\\n  Let me just repeat some of the things that are going on in the \\nEnvironmental Protection Agency. Scott Pruitt in his meeting yesterday \\ncalled this to the attention of the American people. We knew it all the \\ntime, but people on the outside didn't know it and they were shocked. \\nThey found out that in the Scientific Advisory Board of the Obama \\nadministration, six of the seven on the board were direct recipients of \\ngrants from the EPA and they were making policy decisions for the EPA. \\nNow, how bad is that? In fact, we added it up. I would state to the \\nChair that it came to $119 million going to six people who are on the \\nboard making decisions that affected the grants to go out.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today because we do have a gun \\nviolence epidemic in this country, and the time to act is now.\\n  Exactly 1 month ago today, we witnessed one of the most horrific mass \\nshootings in our country's history, and Congress has done nothing. One \\nmonth later, legislation on bump stocks has stalled. There is a \\ndeafening silence from the majority on any responsible actions on this \\npublic health crisis, even though, Mr. Speaker, a majority of \\nAmericans, including responsible gun owners, support responsible gun \\nsafety legislation.\\n  Today, Mr. Speaker, I rise to share a statement written by my \\nconstituent Zach Elmore, who is here with us this morning. Zach's \\nsister, Alicia Johnson, was shot in Las Vegas. Thankfully, she \\nsurvived. This is what he wrote as he sat next to her hospital bed as \\nshe recovered:\\n  ``My sister was shot in Las Vegas. I have never been more afraid, \\nmore angry in my entire life. The problem with shootings around the \\ncountry is that, unless you know someone directly affected, it is easy \\nto say `what a tragedy,' and move on with your daily life.\\n  ``It is not so easy when you are getting ready for bed and one of \\nyour sisters calls inconsolably crying to tell you that another one of \\nyour sisters has been shot. It is not so easy when you call your mother \\nand she is terrified and crying and all you can do is try to calm her \\ndown while you figure out how to get to your sister as quickly as \\npossible. It is not so easy to see your brother-in-law with blood still \\non his hands from doing whatever he could to keep your sister alive. It \\nis not so easy to see your sister in a hospital bed, unable to move due \\nto a gunshot wound in her back and staples in her stomach from surgery \\nto check for organ damage. We are among the luckiest ones.\\n  ``I am sick and tired of thoughts and prayers. If thoughts and \\nprayers had any affect whatsoever, there would be a lot of people still \\nalive today. All these thoughts and prayers would have miraculously \\npulled bullets out of victims and healed wounds, would have stopped \\nthese massacres before they started.\\n  ``You know what is better than thoughts and prayers and lines around \\nthe block at blood banks and enormous relief funds for victims of \\ntragedy? Creating a society where we don't have to do these things many \\ntimes a year.\\n  ``We waited so long to do anything after Columbine that Virginia Tech \\nhappened. We still couldn't talk about it when the Aurora theater \\nshooting happened. That didn't change anything, and then 20 children \\nwere murdered at Sandy Hook. Even that wasn't enough to promote change. \\nWhen Dylann Roof happened, still couldn't talk about it, and then San \\nBernardino happened. We still couldn't bring ourselves to discuss gun \\ncontrol, and then the Pulse nightclub shooting happened.\\n  ``Lord knows we can't do anything about guns, and then Las Vegas \\nhappened. And we are still being told that now is not the time, let \\nhealing begin, don't politicize tragedy, but by all means send thoughts \\nand prayers to all affected by `insert massacre here.'\\n  ``There is no place in society for any weapon which has the singular \\npurpose to kill people. The man who killed and injured more than any \\nmassacre in America's history broke the mold for who commits mass \\nshootings. He would have easily passed a background check and psych \\nevaluation. He was affluent and had no known ties to terrorist \\norganizations, but he is certainly a terrorist. The system we have in \\nplace allowed him to accumulate dozens of assault weapons and thousands \\nof rounds of ammunition because, for all intents and purposes, he was \\nnot a risk to society.\\n  ``Let's keep in mind, the Second Amendment of the Constitution was \\nwritten over 200 years ago when a good gunman might get three shots off \\na minute with a musket. It is hard for me to believe the Founding \\nFathers envisioned a world where one man could or would fire 400 rounds \\na minute into a crowd of people.\\n  ``This should not be difficult. How many people have to die before \\npeople will apply a little logic to gun laws? Do more children need to \\ndie? Does a hospital need to be attacked? What is your limit? Does it \\nhave to happen to you or a loved one before you start to think \\ndifferently about gun laws?\\n  ``The people of this country have so much power. We have protested, \\npressured our Congressmen and -women, and we have seen that work. Why \\ncan't we do the same to reduce and hopefully eliminate the insane \\namount of gun violence in America?\\n  ``Excuse me for not being willing to wait to let healing begin, for \\nnot accepting that now is not the time to talk about a major problem in \\nthis country. There is never a wrong time to stand up for what you \\nthink is right.\\n  ``My sister was shot in Las Vegas in the latest of a devastatingly \\nlong line of mass shootings in this country. We are luckier than 58 \\npeople and their families, and likely luckier than many of the over 500 \\nother people who were injured. If I don't talk about it, if we don't \\ntruly take steps to effect positive change, everyone reading this will \\nforget it happened because they will be sending thoughts and prayers to \\nthe victims of the next mass shooting in America.''\\n  Mr. Speaker, that is the end of the excerpt of his letter. Zach's \\nfamily's experience illustrates why it is crucial for us to take a hard \\nlook at gun violence policies.\\n  Mr. Speaker, I hope that we will, across the aisle, in a bipartisan \\nfashion, do what is right for the American\\n\\n\\npeople and protect families like Zach's across the country.\\n\", u'turn': 1, u'speaker': u'Ms. JAYAPAL', u'itemno': 1}, {u'kind': u'linebreak', u'speaker_bioguide': None, u'text': u'                          ____________________\\n\\n\\n', u'turn': -1, u'speaker': u'None', u'itemno': 2}], u'header': {u'extension': False, u'vol': u'163', u'wkday': u'Wednesday', u'chamber': u'House', u'num': u'177', u'year': u'2017', u'month': u'November', u'pages': u'H8301-H8302', u'day': u'1'}, u'doc_title': u'GUN VIOLENCE IN LAS VEGAS', u'id': u'CREC-2017-11-01-pt1-PgH8301-2', u'title': u'GUN VIOLENCE IN LAS VEGAS'}{u'content': [{u'kind': u'linebreak', u'speaker_bioguide': None, u'text': u'                                 ______\\n', u'turn': -1, u'speaker': u'None', u'itemno': 0}, {u'kind': u'title', u'speaker_bioguide': None, u'text': u'                        HON.

This is especially true when it comes to higher education. \\nProviding the gateways for students to succeed is essential and I \\ncommend the staff of Ellucian for working to create and maintain those \\nopportunities.\\n   Mr. Speaker, to prepare the leaders of tomorrow, institutions of \\nhigher education must have the services, tools, and technologies to \\nengage and foster student success.

Mr. Speaker, I am here this evening, along with my friend \\nand colleague, Representative Brian Fitzpatrick, as we advocate for the \\npassage of the Right to Try Act. This bill, which we introduced \\ntogether, has dozens of bipartisan cosponsors, including Members here \\ntonight.\\n  We are both supportive of Senator Ron Johnson's efforts to champion \\nRight to Try in the Senate. He has been a tireless advocate of Right to \\nTry for years, and his bill has already passed the Senate with \\nunanimous consent. If you are watching the Senate very closely, you \\nwill know that nothing comes out of there, and certainly nothing with \\nunanimous consent; so that tells how strong the sentiment is in favor \\nof this bill.\\n  Our legislation allows terminally ill patients who have no further \\noptions left--I repeat that, no further options left--the opportunity \\nto try experimental drugs that could save their own lives.\\n  Yes, there are also provisions in our bill to protect both the \\npatients, as well as the pharmaceutical companies who want to \\nparticipate, but those provisions are secondary to the primary purpose \\nof this legislation. The primary purpose of the Right to Try Act is to \\ngive brave patients across this country some choice over their own \\ndestinies, when all other avenues are gone.\\n  We want to give hope to these Americans, and we should all share that \\nsame goal of doing everything we can for patients fighting to save \\ntheir lives. This policy has significant bipartisan support. The Trump \\nadministration strongly supports Right to Try, and President Trump has \\nindicated he would likely sign this bill into law.\\n  Time is of the essence, for time is one thing a terminally ill \\npatient does not have. And the status quo is not the answer. The FDA \\nand other agency officials claim that their own expanded access program \\nis working and continues to improve. There may be some truth to that, \\nbut the program is simply not enough; and I know that because I have \\ntalked to dozens and dozens of patients, family members, and advocates \\nwho tell me it is not enough. They come to my office, they call me on \\nthe phone, they write me impassioned letters.\\n  These same advocates have ensured that Right to Try has become law in \\n38 States. Think about that for a moment. With one more State, you \\ncould actually ratify a Constitutional amendment. And in half of those \\n38 States, Right to Try laws passed with unanimous support. In my home \\nState of Arizona, voters approved that initiative by 80 percent of the \\npopular vote.\\n  At a time when pundits are claiming that our politics are broken, and \\nRepublicans and Democrats can't come together on anything, here is a \\ncause that Americans of all political stripes can unite in.\\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. \\nFitzpatrick).\", u'turn': 3, u'speaker': u'Mr. BIGGS', u'itemno': 4}, {u'kind': u'speech', u'speaker_bioguide': u'F000466', u'text': u\"  Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my friend and \\ncolleague, Andy Biggs, for him joining all of us in this fight to stand \\nup for terminally ill patients across this country.\\n  Mr. Speaker, each year, more Americans receive the devastating news \\nof a terminal diagnosis. Even with the amazing work done in American \\nmedical research and development, for too many families, access to \\nthese potentially lifesaving treatments will come too late or not at \\nall.\\n  Thousands of terminally ill patients, like my constituent, Matt \\nBellina, suffer needlessly while awaiting final approval for drug \\ntherapies and other medical technologies.\\n  In April 2014, at age 30, Matt was diagnosed with ALS, otherwise \\nknown as Lou Gehrig's disease. ALS attacks nerve cells in the brain and \\nspinal cord, causing those with ALS to lose control of their muscles.\\n  Although this disease stopped Matt's career as a U.S. Navy aviator in \\nits tracks, he persisted and actively involved himself in the ALS \\ncommunity as a strong advocate for Right to Try legislation.\\n  While the Food and Drug Administration carries out its three-phase \\napproval process, which can take years and cost billions of dollars, \\nmany patients simply want the chance to try treatments that have \\nalready been demonstrated to be safe.\\n  A bill that was unanimously passed by the Senate will offer them a \\nchance to extend their lives. The Right to Try Act, S. 204, would \\nensure that terminally ill patients, together with their physicians and \\npharmaceutical manufacturers, can administer investigational treatments \\nwhere no alternative exists. In fact, this bipartisan idea is already \\nthe law in 37 States.\\n  A Federal Right to Try law would prevent the government from blocking \\naccess to potentially lifesaving medications. It would require patients \\nto first try all other available treatments and be unable to \\nparticipate in clinical trials.\\n  I want to note that these provisions only apply to terminally ill \\npatients. It does not undo the FDA approval process but provides a \\npotential lifeline for those who cannot wait. Moreover, it requires a \\nphysician to certify that other options are either exhausted or \\nunavailable.\\n  This bill requires that a product meet a demonstrated level of safety \\nby attaining FDA phase I approval. We have worked with the drug \\ncompanies to ensure adverse outcomes are not used against the ongoing \\napplication for approval. Additionally, patients, doctors, and \\nmanufacturers do not assume any additional liability under this act.\\n  For those patients caught in between the traditional drug approval \\ndelays, a clinical trial process for which they do not qualify, and \\nlimited time, the Right to Try simply establishes the freedom for \\npatients and their doctors to try therapies where the benefits far \\noutweigh the risks. It gives them the option of trying to save their \\nlife.\\n  Mr. Speaker, whether it is a father like Matt courageously battling \\nALS, or a brave child living with Duchenne muscular dystrophy, they \\ndeserve the right to try.\\n\\n\", u'turn': 4, u'speaker': u'Mr. FITZPATRICK', u'itemno': 5}, {u'kind': u'speech', u'speaker_bioguide': u'B001302', u'text': u'  Mr. BIGGS.

I would \\nalso like to thank Senator Johnson for marshaling together the \\nresources of the Senate to bring this legislation to a head.\\n  I ran for public office because I was tired of the government playing \\ntoo large a role in the decisions people make in their private lives, \\nin their homes, and in their businesses. We live in a world today where \\nthe government wants to tell you where you have got to send your kids \\nto school, what kind of healthcare plan you have got to buy, what \\nregulations you have to comply with, and how much money they are going \\nto take out of your paycheck each and every month.\\n  I certainly don't think the government ought to play a role in \\ndeciding how someone deals with treatment at the end of life. That is \\nwhy I am a proud cosponsor of the Right to Try Act with Representative \\nBiggs, Representative Fitzpatrick, and so many others. My frustration \\nlies with any regime, regulatory or otherwise, that would impair a \\npatient's decision to use any medication to be able to alleviate their \\nsymptoms or improve their quality of life in their final days.\\n  It is absolutely ludicrous to me that, in today's world, we don't \\nallow terminally ill people in every corner of this great country to be \\nable to use medical cannabis to alleviate their pain and suffering, \\nparticularly at the end of life.\\n  It is so frustrating to me that the Federal Government has lied to \\nthis country for a generation about medical cannabis, saying that it \\nhas no medical value. Well, I can tell you, Mr. Speaker, that is \\nabsolutely not true. I have met with patients in my district who have \\nreceived terminal diagnoses, who have been told by their doctors not to \\nbuy green bananas, and yet those folks courageously move forward trying \\nto be a part of their own treatment and to be a part of their own \\nclinical plan moving forward.\\n  Too often, doctors, whether it is at the VA or in private practice, \\naren't able to counsel their patients and give them advice and comfort \\nthat there is a substance in medical cannabis which has proven in some \\ncircumstances to have medical value.\\n  Stage IV of terminal cancer includes symptoms like loss of appetite, \\nwhich can be helped by cannabis, chronic pain, shortness of breath, \\ndifficulty breathing, chemotherapy-induced nausea. All of these things \\ncan be helped by medical cannabis.\\n  Those who are in stage III of AIDS have sleeplessness and weight loss \\nthat can be helped by medical cannabis.\\n  Cannabis has shown great promise in the treatment of Alzheimer's, \\nCrohn's Disease, multiple sclerosis, and epilepsy, where there are \\nrefractory seizures, at times, 30 or 40 seizures a day.\\n  Mr. Speaker, in this great country, we will have people who will \\nreceive terminal diagnoses each and every day. I say let's get the \\ngovernment out of their way. Let's let the decisions that impact the \\nhealthcare of patients be made by those patients and their family \\nmembers and their doctors, not a bunch of politicians and bureaucrats \\nin Washington.\\n  As people fall ill, it is my position that this Right to Try Act can \\nhelp them, and certainly the inclusion of medical cannabis into this \\nlegislation would make it a great deal more useful and a great deal \\nbetter for those in pain.\\n  I thank the gentleman from Arizona for yielding.\", u'turn': 6, u'speaker': u'Mr. GAETZ', u'itemno': 7}, {u'kind': u'speech', u'speaker_bioguide': u'B001302', u'text': u'  Mr. BIGGS.

But being pro-life doesn't mean that I am just \\nantiabortion. It also means that I support the right to try, because \\nlife at all stages is worth fighting for.\\n  Every year, over 1 million Americans die from terminal illnesses, \\nmany of whom pass away while waiting for the FDA to approve a drug that \\ncould dramatically change their prognosis, while others die in the \\nhopeless cycle of trying and trying again to gain acceptance into a \\nmedical trial.\\n  Think about that: we are losing millions of Americans at the hands of \\ngovernment red tape.\\n  Now, as a healthcare provider for 25 years, I know firsthand how \\nimportant innovation is to the medical community. The Right to Try Act, \\nif made into law, will give hope to the child with leukemia whose \\ndoctors have exhausted all other treatment options. It opens previously \\nlocked doors by allowing healthcare providers to try experimental drugs \\nas a last-ditch effort for survival.\\n  The experiments that the Right to Try Act will allow for have the \\npotential to lead to many more birthdays, more piano recitals, and more \\ncamping trips, and offer hope for our future, hope for years to come.\\n  But don't take my word for it. Emily Whitehead was merely 5 years old \\nwhen she was diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and her \\ndoctors quickly realized that she was among a small percentage of \\npatients whose disease was seemingly untouchable by chemotherapy. The \\nWhiteheads were at the end of their rope. The little girl's body was \\nresisting chemotherapy, and the window for many more birthdays, more \\npiano recitals, and more camping trips was wearing thin. Their only \\noption was to join a clinical trial that experimented with T-cell \\ntherapy, where Emily could be the first pediatric patient to undergo \\nthis treatment.\\n  And do you know what? It worked. Three years later, a groundbreaking \\nstudy was conducted where 63 patients received T-cell therapy for 1 \\nyear, and 52 of them became cancer free, an absolutely unheard-of \\nstatistic with this deadly strain of leukemia.\\n  Think about that: 52 lives were saved; 52 families were given another \\nbirthday, another piano recital, and another camping trip.

Mr. Speaker, in closing, I want to mention how I came to \\nreally be converted to the cause of right to try.\\n  I served in the Arizona State Legislature with Laura Knaperek, who \\nwas also serving in the legislature when I first met her. By 2014, she \\nwas no longer serving in the State legislature. She was an advocate. \\nThat year, Laura was in the fight of her life against ovarian cancer, \\nand her mission was to see right-to-try legislation passed into law.\\n  In the end, her efforts for this cause succeeded beyond everyone's \\nwildest expectations when 80 percent of the electorate in Arizona voted \\nto enact right to try. But, unfortunately, Laura is not with us because \\nshe lost her brave battle with cancer last year. Her legacy as a \\ntireless patient advocate lives on.\\n  I will continue to carry on the fight not just for Laura Knaperek, \\nbut for all those patients across this country who are battling against \\nthe odds every day.\\n  I am joined by those who are here tonight, those who have cosponsored \\nthis bill, and many other advocacy groups, such as the Goldwater \\nInstitute in Arizona that continues to fight for this.\\n  I fight for Bertrand Might. Bertrand is a very special little boy. He \\nwas the first person ever to be diagnosed with a rare, fatal genetic \\ndisorder called NGLY1 that has left this 7-year-old paralyzed. Because \\nthe disease was only identified by scientists in 2012 and only a few \\npeople worldwide have been diagnosed with it, there is no cure and no \\ntreatment available. Because the disorder is so rare, a drug may never \\nbe developed to treat it.\\n  But scientists have found that Bertrand responds to certain \\ninvestigational therapies. So Bertrand's family will have to rely on \\ntrying those new investigational medications as long as they have \\naccess to them. That is why we need this right-to-try legislation.\\n  I fight for Jordan McLinn. Seven-year-old Jordan says he wants to \\ngrow up to be a firefighter so he can save lives. He has Duchenne \\nmuscular dystrophy, which could leave him paralyzed within 5 years and \\nshortens his life expectancy to only 20 years. There is a drug now \\nbeing used in clinical trials that is helping young people like Jordan, \\nbut it could take another 7 years for that drug to be available on the \\nmarket. His parents cannot afford to wait for the FDA to give that drug \\nits final approval. He could be in a wheelchair by then. This \\ninvestigational drug could add years to Jordan's life, which would give \\nhim the chance to save others.\\n  We have already heard, when Representative Fitzpatrick discussed Matt \\nBellina, his needs and his advocacy. We fight for him, and we fight for \\nMikaela Knapp.\\n  At 24, Mikaela was diagnosed with a deadly form of kidney cancer that \\nhad already migrated into her bones before she even knew she was sick. \\nShe went through every known treatment in a matter of months and \\nnothing worked. Her high school sweetheart, Keith, heard about a drug \\nunder development that was successfully treating people with this same \\ncancer, but Mikaela was not allowed to enroll in the clinical trial. \\nMikaela and Keith launched a social media campaign to try to get access \\nto the drug, but it wasn't enough. The FDA didn't help.\\n\\n  Mikaela died on April 24, 2014. Five months later, on September 4, \\nthe FDA gave final approval to the drug that might have saved her.\\n  I fight for Diego Morris. When he was 10 years old, Diego woke up \\nwith a sore leg that his mom thought was just another sports injury, \\nbut the pain didn't go away. They knew something was wrong, but they \\nnever expected osteosarcoma, a rare form of bone cancer.\\n  After exhausting all treatments available, Diego's doctors \\nrecommended he try mifamurtide, which wasn't available in the United \\nStates but was being safely used and had been given the Prix Galien \\nAward, the gold medal for pharmaceutical development in England. The \\nMorris family wasted no time and made the move abroad to try to save \\nDiego's life. The treatments worked. Now Diego is back home in Phoenix \\nand back to playing his favorite sports.\\n  We fight unitedly for the countless other patients who deserve a \\nright to try. We must act without further delay. Again, I thank those \\nwho have been here to testify tonight.\\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\\n\", u'turn': 13, u'speaker': u'Mr. BIGGS', u'itemno': 14}, {u'kind': u'linebreak', u'speaker_bioguide': None, u'text': u'                          ____________________\\n\\n\\n', u'turn': -1, u'speaker': u'None', u'itemno': 15}], u'header': {u'extension': False, u'vol': u'163', u'wkday': u'Wednesday', u'chamber': u'House', u'num': u'177', u'year': u'2017', u'month': u'November', u'pages': u'H8381-H8383', u'day': u'1'}, u'related_bills': [{u'type': u'S', u'congress': u'115', u'context': u'OTHER', u'number': u'204'}], u'doc_title': u\"ADVOCATING FOR PATIENTS' RIGHT TO TRY\", u'id': u'CREC-2017-11-01-pt1-PgH8381'}{u'content': [{u'kind': u'linebreak', u'speaker_bioguide': None, u'text': u'                                 ______\\n', u'turn': -1, u'speaker': u'None', u'itemno': 0}, {u'kind': u'title', u'speaker_bioguide': None, u'text': u'                            HON.

Mr. President, I rise this morning with a heavy heart. \\nMy city, my dear city of New York, no stranger to terrorism, was once \\nagain its victim yesterday.\\n  Yesterday afternoon, a man deliberately drove a rented truck into \\ngroups of pedestrians and cyclists, killing eight and injuring about a \\ndozen more. Some of the injured were schoolchildren. These people were \\nbiking or walking home, enjoying a brisk and beautiful New York autumn \\nday. It is tragic. It leaves a hole in your stomach.\\n  Our hearts go out to the victims and their families, and we wish all \\nof the injured a full and speedy recovery. We are also grateful--deeply \\ngrateful--to the New York Police Department and the first responders, \\nespecially Officer Ryan Nash, 28 years old, who was the first on the \\nscene. He reacted quickly and decisively to bring down the attacker and \\nbring him into custody. Who knows how much worse the tragedy would have \\nbeen without his actions.\\n  As one of thousands of New Yorkers who regularly ride on the path \\nwhere this attack took place--in the last month, I have ridden on it \\ntwice--it hits close to home. My daughter went to the school near the \\nscene, Stuyvesant High School, and she used the bike path I don't know \\nhow many times. This is our territory, our home.\\n  The attacks are meant to confuse and terrorize, but, as the world \\nlearned after 9/11 and will learn again, New York doesn't scare easily. \\nNew Yorkers are resilient. We always bounce back. We won't let these \\nterrorists get their way or affect our way of life. We will never let \\nterror prevail.\\n  True to form--something that made my heart swell with pride--the New \\nYork City Halloween parade marched on last night. Thousands of school \\nkids went right into Stuyvesant today. The terrorists cannot stop us. \\nThey cannot change our way of life. We love New York. We love America. \\nThat bond holds us together.\\n\\n\\n                         Antiterrorism Funding\\n\\n  Now, I have seen the tweets from President Trump. After September 11, \\nthe first thing President Bush did was to invite Senator Clinton and me \\nto the White House, where he pledged to do whatever was in his power to \\nhelp our city. President Bush, in a moment of national tragedy, \\nunderstood the meaning of his high office and sought to bring our \\ncountry together.\\n  President Trump, where is your leadership?\\n  The contrast between President Bush's actions after 9/11 and \\nPresident Trump's actions this morning could not be starker.\\n  Again, President Trump, where is your leadership?\\n  I would say in closing that I have always believed that immigration \\nis good for America. I believe it today.\\n  President Trump, instead of politicizing and dividing America, which \\nhe always seems to do at times of national tragedy, should be bringing \\nus together and focusing on the real solution--antiterrorism funding, \\nwhich he proposed to cut in his most recent budget. So I am calling on \\nPresident Trump to rescind his proposed cuts to this vital \\nantiterrorism funding immediately. Our city relies on this funding to \\ntrack potential terrorists and to snuff out attacks. The NYPD, which \\nbravely and quickly responded to the scene yesterday and brought the \\nmayhem to an end, depends on this antiterrorism funding to keep our \\ncity safe day in and day out. So, again, I am calling on the President \\nto rescind his proposed cuts to this vital antiterrorism funding \\nimmediately.\\n  Instead of dividing, instead of politicizing, do something real, Mr. \\nPresident. Restore these funds now.\\n  I yield the floor.\", u'turn': 2, u'speaker': u'Mr. SCHUMER', u'itemno': 4}, {u'kind': u'speech', u'speaker_bioguide': None, u'text': u'  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, this week the Senate is moving through a \\nseries of votes to fill vacancies in the Federal appeals court. \\nPresident Trump has nominated highly qualified, mainstream judges and \\nlegal scholars to do these jobs. Now, Democrats have responded once \\nagain with delay and with obstruction. It is clear to me that we need \\nto change the rules in the Senate that govern how we debate nominations \\nin this body. All year Democrats have been putting up roadblocks to \\nnominations. They have forced the majority leader to file cloture so \\nthat\\n\\n\\nthen we can confirm nominees like these four judges.\\n  As of last Friday, Democrats have forced the Senate to file cloture \\n47 different times when we have had to have cloture votes on President \\nTrump's nominees. There were only six cloture votes at this point for \\nthe previous four Presidents--five for Obama, none for George W. Bush, \\none for Bill Clinton, and none under the Presidency of George Herbert \\nWalker Bush. These are the kind of hoops that the Democrats have been \\nmaking the Senate jump through in an effort to confirm President \\nTrump's nominees.\\n  The procedure has been set in place to allow for debate. Well, debate \\nis a good thing in the Senate, as long as debate is actually occurring. \\nIt is a chance for Senators to stand up, to say what they like or what \\nthey don't like about a nominee. Now, if no one wants to debate, we \\nshould just move things along and have the vote. There is one Senate \\nrule that allows for as much as 30 hours of debate time on Presidential \\nnominations after we have actually had the cloture vote. Now, in \\nreality, very little of that time that is spent on the Senate floor is \\nactually being used for the debate. In the past, both sides would agree \\nto waive the time requirements and to move on to other Senate business, \\nwhich is what we need to do to get the country continuing to move \\nforward. But what is happening now is that Democrats are insisting on \\ncloture votes, and then they are insisting that we use hour after hour \\nafter hour, even when there is no one here to debate what is the issue \\nor the person in front of us.\\n  It is time to end this pointless spectacle. The Senate used to be \\ncalled the world's greatest deliberative body. Democrats have turned it \\ninto the world's most paralyzed deliberative body.\\n  We have more than 125 nominees for various jobs who have had hearings \\nin committee, who have testified in committee, who have been voted on \\nin committee, who have cleared through the entire committee-vetting \\nprocess and are now waiting for a vote on the Senate floor--125 of \\nthem. Most of these people have bipartisan support. They will be \\nconfirmed easily and eventually. They should be confirmed immediately. \\nThere should be no reason for Democrats' stalling tactics except, once \\nagain, to slow down the pace of other progress in the Senate on \\nlegislative issues.\\n  Mr. President, look at what happened with one judge last week. It is \\na case you are very familiar with. Scott Palk was nominated by \\nPresident Trump to serve on the U.S. district court. He had bipartisan \\nsupport in the Judiciary Committee. He went to the committee, had a \\nhearing in the committee, and with bipartisan support was voted out of \\nthe committee. That was in June--more than 4 months ago.\\n  Now, apparently that is not good enough for the Democrats--not at \\nall. They are only interested in slowing down the work of the Senate. \\nSo we had a cloture vote on the nominee. It was 1 of the 47 cloture \\nvotes that we talked about. We had to have a cloture vote. Every \\nRepublican and 27 Democrats voted for him. So he had bipartisan \\nsupport. We still had to allow all of this wasted time for the debate. \\nWe couldn't conduct any of the other business of the Senate during the \\ntime because the Democrats insisted that we use all of the debate time. \\nNow, they could have very easily agreed to waive the rules, as we do, \\nand go straight to a vote. We wanted to do that. The Democrats refused.\\n  So how much of that time--those 30 hours--did the Democrats actually \\nspend on the floor debating this person's qualifications to be a \\nFederal judge? How many of those 30 hours did the Democrats use? None. \\nHow many minutes did they use? None. Not one Democrat came to the floor \\nof the Senate to talk about that judge. Not a single Democrat even \\nbothered to say a word against his nomination. There were fewer than 20 \\nminutes of total talk on the floor of the Senate. Through hour after \\nhour after hour of ongoing time, there were fewer than 20 minutes spent \\nactually talking about the judge, and it was all spent in praise by the \\nRepublicans. We still had to run out the clock because that is the \\ndelay game the Democrats are playing in the Senate. The Senate had to \\nwaste hours and hours when we could have finished debating in less than \\n20 minutes. The Democrats have done this same thing time after time \\nafter time, day after day, wasting day after day.\\n  Things take time in the Senate. We understand that. That is what the \\nFounding Fathers had in mind when they formed the two bodies of \\nCongress, the House and the Senate. There is no excuse, though, for \\nDemocrats abusing the process to make things take even longer. \\nDemocrats aren't using the rules for debate. They are not using the \\nrules for deliberation. It is only for delay. It hasn't always been \\nthis way, and there is no reason it should continue to be this way.\\n  The Senate had a different standard for nominations a few years ago, \\nand that was in the 113th Congress. In years 2013 and 2014, the Senate \\nallowed just 2 hours of debate after cloture was invoked on nominations \\nfor district court judges. That is 2 hours more than the Democrats \\nactually spent debating this judge's nomination last week. The rules \\nsaid that we would have up to 8 hours to debate executive branch \\nnominations below the Cabinet level. Then, for Cabinet Secretaries, for \\nJustices on the Supreme Court, and for circuit courts, it was the full \\n30 hours of debate. Thirty hours now is what we allow every nomination \\ntoday, and Democrats have shown that in most cases it is far too much \\ntime because even though we have to spend all the time, they use very \\nlittle of it talking about the nominees.\\n  We need a fair debate on every nomination. The procedure from 2013 \\nand 2014, with fair debate on nominations, is one that was fair. The \\nway the Democrats are wasting time today to keep us from doing our work \\nis not fair. I believe it is time to return to the rules for debating \\nnominees that the Senate used 3 years ago. There will still be plenty \\nof time for Senators to debate the nominees, to raise objections if \\nthere are any. Every Senator could be on the record. There are just a \\nlot of hours that we could avoid that are being wasted today that could \\nbe used to do the people's business of this country. A President's \\nnominations of qualified people to important jobs was never meant to be \\na tool for delay in the Senate or to be an obstruction the way the \\nDemocrats have been using it.\\n  Now, these rules that we used in 2013 and 2014 were the result of a \\ncompromise. Democrats controlled the Senate at the time. A Democrat, \\nBarack Obama, was in the White House making the nominations, and \\nRepublicans agreed to make these changes to the rules. It was part of a \\nbipartisan group, and I was part of that group. There were eight \\nSenators. They worked on this compromise--four Republicans and four \\nDemocrats. Senator McCain and Senator Alexander were part of this \\ngroup. Senator Schumer, who is now the Democrat leader, was part of \\nthis group. There was overwhelming support for these changes on both \\nsides of the aisle.\\n  It is time to do it again. Let's change the Senate rules and go back \\nto the process that Senator Schumer supported in 2013 and 2014. Today, \\nthe schedule allows us to do one or two nominations in a typical week. \\nIf we go back to the 2014 standard, we could clear multiple nominations \\nin a day. The Republican Senate has been busy this year, and we have \\nmade progress on behalf of the American people. We have passed 15 \\nresolutions rolling back destructive, Obama-era regulations using the \\nCongressional Review Act and signed into law by the President. We \\npassed a budget that will help give Americans at home a raise by \\ncutting their taxes and giving us an opportunity to do the kind of tax \\nrelief, tax reform, tax reductions, tax cuts that the American people \\nare looking for. We need to do more. It is time for Democrats to stop \\nabusing the rules just to delay the process. It is time to go back to \\nthe previous standard of debating nominations. It is time to pick up \\nthe pace and do the job the American people expect us to do.\\n\\n  Now, if Democrats have a different approach and don't want to accept \\nthe standard of debate that was set in the previous Congress, then I \\nbelieve it is time for us to force that change. If Democrats maintain \\ntheir lockstep opposition to real progress on judicial vacancies and \\nother nominees, we should give them a chance to vote on their continued \\nobstruction. We can vote on these nominees in a straightforward\\n\\n\\nand efficient way or we can vote to return to the precedent of the \\n113th Congress. That is the choice. Either way, it is time to vote.\\n  Thank you.\\n  I yield the floor.\\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\", u'turn': 4, u'speaker': u'Mr. BARRASSO', u'itemno': 6}, {u'kind': u'speech', u'speaker_bioguide': None, u'text': u'  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, the magnitude of this moment should be \\napparent to all. A sitting U.S. President's campaign chief and his \\nprotege have been indicted for conspiring against the United States. \\nAnother campaign adviser has pleaded guilty for lying to the FBI about \\nmeetings with Russians. At those meetings, he illegally discussed \\nobtaining dirt on the President's political opponent and emails that \\nhad been stolen.\\n  Two points need to be underscored for the American people. First, \\nthese indictments and conviction are a sober, shattering moment in \\nAmerican history. Second, all of us on both sides of the aisle should \\ncome together to support the work of the special counsel and assure \\nthat he is able to follow the facts and the law and all of the \\nevidence, wherever they may lead.\\n  This moment will stand as a landmark in American history, just as \\nmany of the moments in Watergate did. This investigation has proceeded \\nmore quickly than Watergate did. John Mitchell was indicted in 1974 for \\nconspiracy, perjury, and obstruction of justice. He was convicted a \\nyear later. That indictment took a year and a half of investigation. \\nThese indictments have occurred just 11 months after the election and \\nbarely 6 months after the beginning of the investigation.\\n  We know that the President's campaign hired two alleged criminals and \\none admitted criminal. Two of them were foreign agents, and the \\ncampaign was run by a Russian agent, unregistered, now charged with \\nconspiring against the United States. He was supported by another \\nRussian foreign agent who was also charged with the same 12 criminal \\ncounts. These two individuals, Paul Manafort and Rick Gates, were \\nsignificant people in the Trump campaign.\\n  In the case of Gates, his influence continued through the early \\nmonths of the new administration. Manafort ran Trump's campaign at its \\nmost critical point, and he organized and directed the 2016 Republican \\nNational Committee convention, including the critical delegate-\\ncorralling effort against a potential ``Never Trump'' insurrection, \\nsecuring the Republican nomination for Donald Trump.\\n  Under Manafort's leadership of the Trump campaign, the Republican \\nParty stripped language from their platform that would have called for \\narming Ukraine against Russian aggression. Ahead of the convention, \\nManafort also offered to brief a Russian billionaire on the state of \\nthe 2016 race. The convention he helped organize became a venue for a \\nmeeting between Attorney General Sessions and the Russian ambassador, \\nafter which the Attorney General misled Congress, implying--indeed \\nstating--that it never took place.\\n  The Trump campaign also worked extensively with George Papadopoulos, \\na foreign adviser whose actions constitute the most significant \\nindication of possible collusion--so far the most significant--between \\nthe Trump campaign and Russian officials.\\n  Papadopoulos was named a foreign policy adviser in March 2016 and \\nbegan communicating with Russian nationals the next month. He met with \\na professor for breakfast in London. They discussed stolen emails from \\nHillary Clinton and subsequently shuttled messages to the Kremlin and \\nback for the Trump campaign.\\n  He worked with officials at the highest level of the Trump campaign. \\nHis direct boss, in fact, was Jeff Sessions, who was then the head of \\nTrump's national security advisory committee, and he is now, of course, \\nthe Attorney General. He communicated extensively with the campaign \\nmanager and members of the national security team.\\n  President Trump tweeted today that he was a ``young, low level \\nvolunteer,'' but the President sang his praises at a meeting with the \\nWashington Post editorial board in March 2016, calling him an ``energy \\nand oil consultant, excellent guy.'' These revelations are stunning.\\n  Now the President is at a critical juncture. He can choose the course \\nof cooperation or confrontation. He is literally teetering on the brink \\nof a decision that could prove disastrous for himself and for America \\nif he chooses a constitutional confrontation.\\n  We are at a moment very much like the one that occurred in Watergate. \\nIt is still memorable to many of us in this Chamber, although we were \\nnot here at the time. Our Nation could be careening toward a \\nconstitutional crisis. Some of the actions the President has already \\ntaken, such as firing Jim Comey as FBI Director, may be evidence of \\nobstruction of justice in the investigation by the special counsel. As \\npart of our oversight responsibility, the Judiciary Committee must \\ncontinue its work in investigating that firing and other actions that \\nmay constitute obstruction of justice.\\n  Firing the special counsel himself is something only the President \\ncould try to do. It would be the ultimate act of contempt for the rule \\nof law that is rightly seen as the actions of someone who has something \\nto hide.\\n  At stake is more than just this President or this special counsel. It \\nis literally the rule of law. To this President, the rule of law may be \\nmeaningless, a facade or a fiction, but that is exactly why Congress \\nmust give the judicial branch specific, enforceable power to stop the \\nPresident from firing the special counsel.\\n  That is the purpose of legislation I have introduced, along with \\ncolleagues. I am here to call upon this body to support and pass the \\nSpecial Counsel Independence Protection Act.\\n  I called for the special counsel to be established in February of \\nthis year and was joined by 10 of my colleagues in that call. It was \\nbased on credible allegations that the Trump team had colluded with the \\nRussian Government. The Special Counsel Independence Protection Act, \\nwhich I have cosponsored along with colleagues, seeks to forestall the \\nkind of potential constitutional crisis raised by the President's \\nthreats not so long ago and his labeling the investigation a hoax and a \\nwitch hunt.\\n  The Washington Post reported today that advisers close to the \\nPresident are urging that, in fact, he take more aggressive action \\nagainst the special counsel. The specter of Presidential action against \\nRobert Mueller, designed to stop or stymie a virtually unavoidable and \\nnecessary criminal investigation of the President himself, makes \\nsafeguarding the special counsel more urgent and necessary now than \\never before.\\n  Rather than encouraging Presidential abuse of power by inaction, the \\nCongress must move forward right away to check potential malfeasance \\nand abuse before it occurs. Even the threat of such political \\ninterference constituting potential obstruction of justice undermines \\nthe special counsel's investigation. It makes witnesses less likely to \\ncooperate. It discourages the agents and investigators working for the \\nspecial counsel. It creates unnecessary confusion in the American \\npublic. Only judicial review can provide the check against such abuse \\nand ensure confidence that the special counsel will proceed \\nmethodically and systematically to uphold the rule of law and follow \\nthe facts in evidence, wherever they may lead. That is what the \\nAmerican people want him to do. That is what we should guarantee that \\nhe will do. Make no mistake, this investigation will continue and \\nconclude fairly and fully. The only question is how much turmoil and \\nhow much damage is done in the course of that investigation.\\n  Clearly, like any investigation and prosecution, this one is a \\nmosaic, consisting of many different diverse pieces and already it is \\ncoming together on the Trump campaign's contacts with Russian \\nofficials. They include, for example, campaign adviser Papadopoulos's \\ncontacts with a Russian agent who claimed he had ``dirt'' on Hillary \\nClinton; Donald Trump, Jr., and the campaign aides' Trump Tower meeting \\nwith Russian agents to obtain information on Clinton; Jared\\n\\n\\nKushner's meetings with sanctioned VEB Russian bank CEO Sergey Gorkov; \\nSessions' meetings with the Russian Ambassador; the Cambridge Analytica \\nCEO's outreach to WikiLeaks to obtain Hillary Clinton's missing emails; \\nand former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn's dining with \\nPresident Putin in Moscow. Those pieces of the mosaic are only the \\nbeginning. We are at a critical stage--the end of the beginning, not \\nthe beginning of the end.\\n  As a former prosecutor, I know investigations take time. The best \\ninvestigations are done without deadlines. In an important case like \\nthis one, and in a complex and challenging one, we must allow all the \\ntime necessary to assemble that full mosaic and put together the pieces \\nof this puzzle.\\n  The Watergate scandal took 2 years to unravel, from Bob Woodward and \\nCarl Bernstein's first piece in the Washington Post in June of 1972 to \\nNixon's resignation in August of 1974. We are less than a year into the \\nTrump Presidency and fewer than 10 months into this investigation.\\n  The first individuals to be indicted in the Watergate scandal were \\nconsidered to be generally outside the President's inner circle. They \\nwere E. Howard Hunt, G. Gordon Liddy, and the Watergate burglars in \\nSeptember of 1972. No one knew--and many denied--the conspiracy that \\ninvolved the President and his top lieutenants at the time of those \\nfirst indictments. In these cases, too--in these first indictments and \\nconviction--a lot more is to come.\\n  We cannot wait until the President potentially shuts down his special \\ncounsel to come to his defense. Already, the rule of law is under \\nthreat. On Sunday--the day before the indictments were handed down--the \\nPresident tweeted: ``DO SOMETHING!'' with regard to the Russia \\ninvestigation. Although his reference was unclear exactly what he meant \\nand whom the message was targeting, it certainly was an indication that \\nsome kind of action might be taken to thwart the investigation.\\n  Any interference in this investigation will be a red line for me and \\nfor others in this Chamber. Let the President hear that message loud \\nand clear. There is a red line that cannot be crossed. It is political \\ninterference or intrusion in the special counsel's investigation, and \\nit will be met with a firestorm, I hope, on both sides of the aisle. My \\nconversations with our colleagues on the other side of the aisle \\nindicate they would share our outrage and outcry if there is an effort \\nto stop and stymie this investigation or if there is any other kind of \\npolitical interference in it.\\n  Senators Graham, Booker, Whitehouse, Coons, and I have cosponsored \\nmeasures that will help protect the special counsel. There are two \\nmeasures now, but they are so closely similar that they should be \\nbrought together, and conversations are underway to do so. I expect we \\nwill have a single bill in the very near future.\\n  We should stand with one voice against obstruction of this \\ninvestigation. I ask that my colleagues go on the record now to state \\nthat they will absolutely resist and oppose any interference by the \\nexecutive branch into this investigation or investigations that are \\nunderway by our congressional committees--on the House side, the \\nIntelligence Committee and, in the Senate, the Judiciary Committee \\nalong with our Intelligence Committee. The congressional committees \\nhave separate purposes. In the Judiciary Committee, we have the unique \\nresponsibility of oversight over the Department of Justice and the FBI. \\nWe have the unique responsibility to prevent the obstruction of justice \\nand to uncover it, as is indicated by the firing of Jim Comey. My hope \\nis that investigation will proceed and that it will be bipartisan, so \\nwe will have hearings and subpoena witnesses with public testimony \\nunder oath and eventually some report to the American people. That is \\nmy hope, and that will be our decision here.\\n  The decision we cannot and should not make is what the outcome will \\nbe of the special counsel investigation. We must guarantee--and we have \\nthis responsibility in the Congress--that there is adequate funding and \\nauthority for the special counsel, that there is no effort to either \\ncut resources or limit the purview of the special counsel or place \\nconstraints on the time it may take for this probe to conclude. There \\nshould be no firing and no pardons, and we should speak out and stand \\nup to assure that message reaches the White House loud and clear.\\n  This moment is one of historic magnitude. I cannot emphasize how \\nstrongly I feel but also how deeply my colleagues have expressed to me \\ntheir own feelings about our responsibility in this moment.\\n  The grand jury that is bringing these indictments is an arm of the \\ncourts, which should be independent of both the executive and \\nlegislative branches. That independence gives the special counsel some \\nnew measure of permanence and protection, but the President can still \\ntry to fire the special counsel. He cannot fire the grand jury or the \\nU.S. District Court judge who impaneled the grand jury. Judicial review \\nof any firing of the special counsel, which is the core principle of \\nour measure--the Special Counsel Independence Protection Act--would add \\na highly significant protection to not just deter misguided and deeply \\nmistaken actions, throwing our Nation into turmoil, but also assuring \\nthat confidence and trust remains with the special counsel, and he can \\nfollow facts and the law with the full support of the American people. \\nThe American people can put their trust and faith in him and in our \\ncourts. We should assure that we uphold that faith and trust.\\n  Thank you.\\n  I yield the floor.\", u'turn': 8, u'speaker': u'Mr. BLUMENTHAL', u'itemno': 10}, {u'kind': u'speech', u'speaker_bioguide': None, u'text': u'  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, since day one, the President of the \\nUnited States has made it clear that his top priority, when it comes to \\nhealthcare in our country, is to score political points by attacking \\nObamaCare. He has even said repeatedly that healthcare in our country \\nwill ``implode,'' but this was not just a prediction that President \\nTrump made, it was his goal, and he has tried virtually everything he \\ncan do to make that implosion a reality.\\n  In January, he abruptly pulled funding for outreach days before the \\nend of the 2017 open enrollment period without any analysis of how that \\nmight affect patients and families, and he signed executive orders \\nspecifically designed to inject uncertainty and increased costs into \\nthe healthcare system.\\n  President Trump then dedicated the spring and summer to attempting to \\njam partisan, extraordinarily destructive legislation through the House \\nand Senate to repeal the Affordable Care Act, despite one independent \\nanalysis after another showing that each version of TrumpCare would \\ncause premiums to spike, take coverage away from millions of people, \\nrip protections away from patients with preexisting conditions, and gut \\nMedicaid.\\n  This fall--after TrumpCare failed another time in the Senate--he \\nslashed by 90 percent the investments that help inform families about \\ntheir coverage options and followed through on his year-long threat to \\ndiscontinue payments designed to lower out-of-pocket costs for low-\\nincome enrollees.\\n  This is a scenario that healthcare experts said would cause mass \\nconsumer confusion and anxiety, one that insurance companies planned \\nfor by shifting that burden of uncertainty to patients and taxpayers in \\nthe form of higher premiums and fewer options in State marketplaces.\\n  Now, this is by no means the full list of ways President Trump has \\nattempted his healthcare sabotage, but it does explain why we are here \\nnow. Today is the first day of the open enrollment period for 2018, and \\nas a direct result of this President's actions, families are going to \\nsee higher premiums, more out-of-pocket costs, and fewer coverage \\noptions. Many families will have to change their coverage if they want \\nto avoid paying hundreds of dollars more in premiums.\\n  At a time when we need to continue to do more to bend the healthcare \\ncost curve in the right direction, taxpayers are being burdened with \\nhigher\\n\\n\\nhealthcare costs to the Federal Government--not because of any \\nimprovement in quality or comprehensiveness, just because of the chaos \\nthis administration has caused.\\n  In fact, just last week, the Trump administration proposed a rule to \\ndouble down on the sabotage in 2019 that would let insurers cover fewer \\nservices in addition to raising costs. I have to say, I just truly \\nnever imagined that a President of the United States would so openly \\nand uncaringly root for the people of this country to be worse off. But \\nthat is exactly what President Trump is doing. It needs to be said, and \\nit needs to be stopped.\\n\\n  What makes this even more frustrating is that a lot of it could have \\nbeen stopped months ago if Republican leaders hadn't insisted on trying \\nto help this administration carry out its partisan, wrecking-ball \\nhealthcare strategy.\\n  Back in September, Chairman Alexander and I were very near agreement \\non a bipartisan bill to stabilize healthcare markets and protect \\nfamilies from higher premiums and out-of-pocket costs through regular \\norder, through a process that actually engaged over half the Senate. We \\nwere on the verge of reaching an agreement when Republican leaders \\nfroze our negotiations. Why? In order to jam TrumpCare through the \\nSenate one more time.\\n  Let me repeat that. Republican leaders hit the pause button on a \\nbipartisan process that could have lowered premiums and stabilized \\nmarkets, exposing our patients and families to the full impact of \\nPresident Trump's sabotage.\\n  That is the bad news, but the good news is that the legislation \\nChairman Alexander and I ultimately agreed on can and will still have \\nan impact--not just a few years from now but in 2018--if Republican \\nleaders don't stand in the way again. Our bill would, among other \\npriorities, continue out-of-pocket cost reduction payments and make \\nsure that patients and families, not insurance companies, see the \\nbenefit of that certainty in the form of rebates next year. The \\nlegislation Chairman Alexander and I have proposed, with 12 Democratic \\nand 12 Republican cosponsors, would do a lot to help us get things back \\non track. It would tie President Trump's hands on sabotage, and it \\nwould send a very powerful message that elected officials in Congress \\ncan work together to get things done when we focus on common ground \\nrather than scoring political points.\\n  I would once again urge the majority leader to allow our legislation \\nto get a vote. It has the support of 60-plus Senators, and it is \\ngrowing. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has said that it \\nprovides billions in savings and would stabilize the markets this year \\nand lower premiums in 2019. And the President told Chairman Alexander \\nthat he supports this process moving forward.\\n  There is no reason to wait. There is absolutely no excuse for \\ninaction, and I am going to continue doing everything I can to make \\nthat clear until Republican leaders finally listen to the patients and \\nfamilies they serve.\\n  Mr. President, while I am here today, I also want to take a few \\nminutes to speak on another way that I believe President Trump and \\nRepublicans are taking our country in a direction that is deeply \\nharmful; that is, by stacking our courts with extreme conservative \\njudges.\\n  The Senate this week is going to vote on four judicial nominees who \\neach have the far-rightwing seal of approval. Two are on President \\nTrump's short list for Supreme Court Justices, meaning they would \\nautomatically vote to overturn Roe v. Wade. Unfortunately, their views \\non many things--LGBTQ rights, sexual assault, criminal justice, and \\ncorporate interests--are just as deeply troubling. One of the nominees \\nwe are considering this week advocated for using electric shocks for \\ncriminal punishment, and two--Amy Barrett and Stephanos Bibas--were \\nnominated only after Republicans blocked the nominations of Myra Selby \\nand Rebecca Haywood--both who happen to be African-American women--to \\nthe respective benches.\\n  It is clear that as Republican leaders' list of legislative failures \\ngrows longer, their effort to enact their agenda by administrative \\naction and by stacking the courts is only going to accelerate. That \\nmight appeal to extreme conservatives--in fact, I am pretty sure it \\ndoes--but the truth is that whether it is healthcare or infrastructure \\nor taxes, most people across the country really want to see Congress \\nworking together.\\n  I am going to continue doing everything I can to speak out and fight \\nback against extreme, harmful steps that are being taken by this \\nadministration and allowed by Republican leaders here in Congress and \\nalso to show there is a better way to get things done--by working under \\nregular order, across the aisle, and putting people, not politics, \\nfirst. That is what families rightfully expect, and that is what we all \\nshould be focused on.\\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\", u'turn': 12, u'speaker': u'Mrs. MURRAY', u'itemno': 14}, {u'kind': u'speech', u'speaker_bioguide': None, u'text': u'  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I would like to start my remarks this \\nmorning by offering my thoughts to the victims of yesterday's \\nhorrendous act of terror in New York City, my thanks to the first \\nresponders, and I would note the resiliency of the people of New York. \\nOnce again, they are going forward with their lives today, showing the \\nworld and anyone who would do us harm that Americans stand together and \\nthat we move forward regardless of what our foes may try to do.\\n\\n\\n                               Healthcare\\n\\n  Mr. President, I also rise today to encourage Granite Staters--as my \\ncolleague from Washington did--and people across the country to take \\nadvantage of the health insurance open enrollment period, which begins \\ntoday and runs through December 15.\\n  Every citizen deserves quality, affordable health insurance coverage \\nto help them live healthy and productive lives. Access to healthcare is \\ncritical to the freedom, dignity, and well-being of our citizens, and \\nit also contributes to a productive workforce and a thriving economy.\\n  I still remember meeting with a constituent named Jo, about a year or \\ntwo ago, who has a chronic health condition. When she lost her job in \\n2009 and lost her health insurance with it, her condition deteriorated \\nto the point where she couldn't work, and a downward spiral ensued. She \\nlost her home. She couldn't get healthcare because she had no \\nresources. Because of the Affordable Care Act's Medicaid expansion, she \\nwas eventually able to get healthcare, to get the surgery and therapy \\nshe needed, and now she is working again. So healthcare is not only for \\nthe benefit of the individual who receives it; it helps that individual \\nbecome a productive member of our workforce.\\n  Affordable, quality care is also critically important to those who \\nare working but may not otherwise be able to afford health insurance \\neven if employed. It is something I have heard often this year from \\ncitizens of my State, as my Republican colleagues attempted to pass \\nTrumpCare legislation that would have led to higher healthcare costs \\nfor less care.\\n  At an emergency field hearing in June that I held with Senator \\nShaheen, we heard from a woman named Enna from Exeter, NH. Enna, who is \\nself-employed, said that prior to the Affordable Care Act, her family \\nwas unable to maintain insurance consistently. Even when she did have \\nit, her previous policy didn't cover critical preventive care that she \\nneeded. As a result of the ACA, Enna has been able to purchase \\naffordable health insurance through the marketplace in New Hampshire \\nfor herself and her family of four, giving them the peace of mind that \\ncomes with having health insurance, while continuing to grow her own \\nbusiness.\\n  Enna's story is the story of so many people in New Hampshire, and it \\nrepresents why it is essential for people across the country to take \\nadvantage of this open enrollment period.\\n  From today through December 15, Granite Staters and all Americans \\nhave an opportunity to sign up for a healthcare plan at \\nwww.coveringnewhampshire.org or www.healthcare.gov. It is also \\nimportant for people to take this opportunity to see what other plans \\nare available, to shop around and see whether other plans offer more \\nsavings than their current one does, and it is critical to educate our \\nfriends and neighbors about these options, given the Trump \\nadministration's attempts to sabotage our Nation's healthcare\\n\\n\\nsystem. These sabotage attempts include the Department of Health and \\nHuman Services slashing the Affordable Care Act's outreach and \\nadvertising budgets ahead of open enrollment, which provide key \\ninformation and resources for those who need to sign up for care. It is \\nclear that the Trump administration doesn't want people to know they \\ncan enroll, but that doesn't change the fact that the Affordable Care \\nAct is the law of the land, people can still get covered, and financial \\nassistance is available for many on the healthcare exchange.\\n  We must end this sabotage and continue to work together on efforts to \\nlower costs and build on and improve the Affordable Care Act, and that \\nis exactly what I am focused on.\\n  I was proud to join HELP Committee leaders, Senators Alexander and \\nMurray, to cosponsor bipartisan legislation that would stabilize health \\ninsurance markets and lower costs for hard-working Americans. This bill \\nincludes a provision that the New Hampshire Insurance Department could \\nuse to support its proposal to create a reinsurance pool to help reduce \\npremiums in our State's individual health insurance market. This \\nlegislation proves it is possible to work across party lines to make \\nprogress in our healthcare system. It is clear that it has the votes to \\npass. We need Republican leadership to bring it up for a vote.\\n  It is up to all of us to come together and make sure that healthcare \\nis truly available and affordable to all of our people and to encourage \\nour fellow citizens to sign up for the care they need to help their \\nfamilies thrive.\\n  The enrollment period is a critical time for the health and well-\\nbeing of our citizens and for our productivity, as well, as a country. \\nI encourage Granite Staters to take advantage of this opportunity and \\nreceive the benefits that come with affordable healthcare.\\n  Mr. President, I also want to take a moment to address the continued \\nefforts this week from President Trump and my Republican colleagues to \\npush through nominees who will truly reshape our Federal judiciary.\\n  An independent and impartial judiciary is critical to democracy and \\nto our march toward progress. Our Founders established our court system \\nto serve as an independent arbiter that would protect the rights of all \\nAmericans and ensure equal justice under our laws. Unfortunately, the \\nnominees who have been selected by the President and who have been \\nvoted on throughout this year have been handpicked by far-right groups \\nto serve a conservative agenda. We have seen judicial nominees who have \\nnot committed to upholding the precedent of Roe v. Wade and protecting \\na woman's right to make her own healthcare decisions and control her \\nown destiny in doing so, nominees who have stood against basic rights \\nand freedoms for LGBTQ Americans and who have opposed protections for \\nworkers' rights. This is unacceptable.\\n  We are voting on lifetime appointments that require a commitment to \\nequal justice, objectivity, and sound judgment. I will continue to \\noppose judicial nominees who do not live up to those standards, and I \\nurge my colleagues to do the same.\\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\", u'turn': 14, u'speaker': u'Ms. HASSAN', u'itemno': 16}, {u'kind': u'speech', u'speaker_bioguide': None, u'text': u'  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I would like to address the issue we are \\nvoting on in a few minutes. The Senate will vote on the nomination of \\nMichigan Supreme Court Justice Joan Larsen to serve on the Sixth \\nCircuit Court of Appeals.\\n  Though she currently lives in Michigan, Justice Larsen was born in \\nand hails from my State of Iowa. In fact, she and I share the same alma \\nmater, the University of Northern Iowa, for our bachelor's degrees. I \\nhave also learned, since meeting Justice Larsen, that her father was \\nthe longtime CEO of the Lutheran Services in Iowa. He is now retired, \\nbut during the time he was the CEO, he was the very same person with \\nwhom I often met for breakfast when he would come to Washington to tell \\nus about the concerns of the Lutheran Services in Iowa. At that time, I \\nnever knew I might be speaking in favor of his daughter. I didn't even \\nknow of his daughter at that time. So I am proud to see a fellow Iowan \\nand such an eminently qualified nominee be nominated to the Sixth \\nCircuit Court of Appeals.\\n  For those who may not be familiar with her career and \\naccomplishments, a few minutes will give me an opportunity to share \\nthem with you. I think you will find, as I have, that Justice Larsen is \\nparticularly well suited to serve as a Federal appellate judge.\\n  Justice Larsen has an outstanding academic record, having received \\nnumerous awards during her undergraduate and law school careers. \\nJustice Larsen was a Presidential Scholar at the University of Northern \\nIowa and graduated with the highest honors. She graduated first in her \\nclass at the Northwestern University Pritzker School of Law, where she \\nwon the Justice John Paul Stevens Award for Academic Excellence and \\nserved as editor of the Northwestern University Law Review.\\n  She began her legal career as a clerk for Judge Sentelle on the DC \\nCircuit Court of Appeals and then clerked for Justice Scalia on the \\nU.S. Supreme Court. Following her clerkships, Justice Larsen joined the \\nDC firm of Sidley Austin, one of the largest law firms in the United \\nStates. Justice Larsen spent 2 years as Deputy Assistant Attorney \\nGeneral for the Office of Legal Counsel, where she provided legal \\nadvice to the President and executive agencies on difficult issues of \\nconstitutional and statutory interpretation.\\n  Justice Larsen has taught constitutional law and criminal law at the \\nUniversity of Michigan Law School since 1998, where she has earned the \\nrespect of faculty members and students alike. She won the L. Hart \\nWright Award for Excellence in Teaching early in her teaching career. \\nIn addition to her teaching responsibilities, Justice Larsen ran \\nMichigan's clerkship program, helping hundreds of students and alumni \\npursue clerkships at the Federal and State levels. As an adjunct \\nprofessor, she continues to run the law school's Moot Court Program.\\n  Her colleagues at the University of Michigan praised Justice Larsen \\nand wrote:\\n\\n       Even among the talented and ambitious lawyers at an elite \\n     law school, Joan stands out for her ability to make the \\n     penetrating insight that untangles some knotty problem of \\n     statutory interpretation or judiciary doctrine. Especially \\n     distinctive, moreover, is the rigor and even-handedness she \\n     brings to her analysis.\\n\\n  I will share one more example from that letter because I think it \\naddresses some of my colleagues' concerns, who are on the other side of \\nthe aisle, as to her approach to the law.\\n  Her colleagues wrote:\\n\\n       For those of us who have found ourselves on the opposite \\n     side of a debate with Joan about a case, a statute, or some \\n     broader issue of constitutional history, she has demonstrated \\n     time and again that she is both a gracious and intellectually \\n     honest partner in the collaborative project of figuring \\n     things out. What matters for Joan is not winning but working \\n     out the right answer.\\n\\n  Now I bring emphasis to this last sentence.\\n\\n       Even when you disagree with her, it is impossible not to \\n     respect her and to take pleasure in the process of refining \\n     the issues actually in dispute.\\n\\n  In other words, as I see it, Justice Larsen is and will be a jurist \\nwho seeks to find the right answer, never simply one she prefers as a \\nmatter of policy.\\n  We can already see from her time on the Michigan Supreme Court that \\nJustice Larsen is a principled jurist with an impressive legal acumen. \\nShe has served with distinction on that court since she was appointed \\nin 2015. It happens that she was elected to the position in 2016, in \\nher own right, by a resounding majority, winning every county in \\nMichigan. Colleagues on the court have praised her sharp legal \\nanalysis, her clear and crisp writing, and, most importantly, her work \\nethic.\\n  Outside the courtroom, Justice Larsen is actively involved in \\nvolunteer efforts to serve disadvantaged children, and she works with \\nMichigan's veterans, drugs, sobriety, and mental health court programs.\\n  Some of my colleagues have said they will not support the nomination\\n\\n\\nbecause Justice Larsen was included on President Trump's short list for \\nthe Supreme Court. Is there anything wrong with the President \\nsuggesting whom he is going to put on the Supreme Court if he is \\nelected President? If you look at her background, it should be no \\nsurprise that she was included on that list. She is an accomplished \\nlegal academic, a mainstream jurist, and is well respected on a \\nbipartisan basis throughout the legal community.\\n  Because my colleagues have been concerned about everyone on that \\nlist, at her hearing, I asked Justice Larsen when she learned that her \\nname was on that list. She replied: ``The date it was announced . . . \\nit was a complete surprise to me.''\\n  I also asked her about judicial independence and whether she could \\nrule against the President who nominated her.\\n  She replied:\\n\\n       I would have no trouble ruling against the President who \\n     appointed me or any successor President as well. Judicial \\n     independence means one thing, one very simple thing--\\n\\n  At this point I want to emphasize--\\n\\n     and that is putting the law above everything else, the \\n     statutes passed by this body, and the Constitution of the \\n     United States. So I would have absolutely no trouble, and, \\n     indeed, that would be my duty.\\n\\n  Here is the most outrageous reason I have heard for voting against \\nJustice Larsen. This should surprise a lot of people. Some in the \\nminority have suggested that she is somehow responsible for outside \\ngroups running ads that support her nomination in Michigan. The claim \\nthat she is responsible for the action of an outside group is \\nridiculous, and the allegation that these ads are in some way a \\nguarantee of how she will rule in the future is the most absurd thing I \\nhave heard based upon her answers to my questions.\\n  I find it interesting that my colleagues who are complaining about \\nconservative groups do not seem to have the same concern for groups on \\nthe left that are spending money in opposition to these nominees. One \\nsuch group, Alliance for Justice, routinely issues reports and press \\nreleases on judicial nominees. Oftentimes, these so-called reports put \\nforward incendiary and false criticisms of these nominees. My \\ncolleagues even make the same incendiary attacks against the nominees \\nas these outside groups do. In other words, they use the same talking \\npoints. I do not hear that my colleagues on the other side are up in \\narms about their spending millions of dollars to oppose nominees.\\n  Of course, some may remember that last year groups on the left \\ncoordinated attacks on this Senator. I was followed all over Iowa by \\nthese groups and their members. They ran ads against me and put up \\nbillboards that opposed my election, and that had something to do with \\nthe Supreme Court, as one might recall. I don't remember hearing any of \\nmy colleagues on the other side of the aisle complain about all of the \\nmoney those groups were spending at that time.\\n  As I have said before, I expect that outside groups on the left and \\non the right want to have their voices heard in the nomination process. \\nIsn't that something to do with what we call democracy, representative \\ngovernment, freedom of speech, freedom of association? There is nothing \\nwrong with that, whether it is done by the right or the left, but I \\ntake issue with complaints from the other side that do not acknowledge \\nthat all sides have interest groups that are spending and engaging in \\nthe judicial nomination process. It was completely appropriate for \\nJustice Larsen not to wade in on the political debate regarding those \\npolitical ads. Her answers to those questions were exactly what I would \\nexpect an independent nominee to say, particularly if she wants to be \\nindependent of any President who appoints her when she is appointed to \\nthe bench.\\n  Justice Larsen's nomination is supported by a broad and diverse \\ncoalition of lawyers, judges, and academic colleagues. It is easy to \\nsee why, for she is an accomplished and well-respected academic. She is \\na brilliant and independent jurist. Her careful and well-reasoned legal \\nanalysis puts her squarely within the mainstream of legal thought. I \\nurge my colleagues, in a few minutes, to vote for her nomination.\\n  I yield the floor.\\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\", u'turn': 18, u'speaker': u'Mr. GRASSLEY', u'itemno': 20}, {u'kind': u'speech', u'speaker_bioguide': None, u'text': u'  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize the Annandale \\nChristian Community for Action (ACCA) on the occasion of its 50th \\nanniversary. In 1967, Fred and Emily Ruffing realized that there was a \\ngreat need for childcare services for low-income and working poor \\nfamilies who did not qualify for subsidized daycare. They decided that \\nthey needed to take action to address this problem so they organized a \\nmeeting with representatives from eight local churches to set up a day \\ncare center and ACCA was born.\\n   Since 1967, ACCA has continued to grow not only in size but in the \\nnumber of services provided. What began as a group of eight churches 50 \\nyears ago has grown to 26 member congregations. ACCA has also partnered \\nwith the Fairfax County Department of Neighborhood and Community \\nServices (NCS) and its services and programs as well as the model of \\nfaith community and government partnership begun by ACCA has been \\nreplicated all throughout Fairfax County.\\n   ACCA gives back to the community in a variety of ways. The Child \\nDevelopment Center (CDC) provides both developmental childcare and \\nearly childhood education to over 200 toddlers, preschoolers and \\ninfants. The ACCA Pantry collects from churches, schools, community \\ngroups and local businesses and delivers food and other necessities on \\nan emergency basis to area households. ACCA's Emergency Assistance \\nprogram handles financial emergencies such as payment for rent, \\nutilities, prescription drugs, and minor car repairs for low-income \\nfamilies who have few resources to fall back on in a time of crisis.\\n   The 26 partner ministries provide a safety net while the families \\nrecover stability. Furniture ministry volunteers collect and distribute \\ngently used furniture to needy recipients, while volunteers from the \\nTransportation ministry provide rides to medical appointments. Meals on \\nWheels volunteers deliver meals every weekday to elderly residents who \\ncannot fend for themselves. ACCA volunteers also spend a Saturday in \\nApril repairing houses--more than 110 homes have been repaired or \\nrehabilitated since 1990. With the exception of the CDC, all of these \\nservices are provided by volunteers.\\n   Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in thanking the staff \\nand volunteers of ACCA and in congratulating them on this incredible \\nmilestone. Civic engagement is the foundation of a healthy community, \\nand Fairfax County residents enjoy an exceptional quality of life due \\nin part to the efforts of these individuals. Their contributions have \\nbeen a great benefit to our community and truly merit our highest \\npraise.\\n\", u'turn': 0, u'speaker': u'Mr. CONNOLLY', u'itemno': 2}, {u'kind': u'linebreak', u'speaker_bioguide': None, u'text': u'                          ____________________\\n\\n\\n', u'turn': -1, u'speaker': u'None', u'itemno': 3}], u'header': {u'extension': True, u'vol': u'163', u'wkday': u'Wednesday', u'chamber': u'House', u'num': u'177', u'year': u'2017', u'month': u'November', u'pages': u'E1480', u'day': u'1'}, u'doc_title': u'RECOGNIZING THE 50TH ANNIVERSARY OF ANNANDALE CHRISTIAN COMMUNITY FOR ACTION', u'id': u'CREC-2017-11-01-pt1-PgE1480-3', u'title': u'RECOGNIZING THE 50TH ANNIVERSARY OF ANNANDALE CHRISTIAN COMMUNITY FOR  ACTION'}{u'content': [{u'kind': u'speech', u'speaker_bioguide': None, u'text': u'  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. Speaker, ever since she was a little girl, \\nSilvana loved to play hockey. In her Massachusetts hometown, hockey was \\nmore of a way of life than just a sport.\\n  Her parents knew she was talented, and supported her dream to play \\neven in college. When she was offered a scholarship in 2011, to be the \\ngoalie for the University of Connecticut, Silvana felt like all of her \\ndreams had come true, so she eagerly accepted.\\n  She pulled out of her driveway with her packed clothes and hockey \\ngear, but she could have never known that in a few days her life would \\nchange forever. She could not have foreseen how a lifetime of hard work \\nand ambition would suddenly disappear tragically.\\n  Like all new students, she was eager to immerse herself in her new \\ncollege life. On the third day at the university, Silvana went to a \\nhouse party with some new friends she met. But, after two drinks, she \\nbegan to feel dizzy, numb, and lethargic. She quickly lost the ability \\nto walk, and she became very ill. As she drifted out of consciousness, \\na male hockey player at the party instructed others to carry her to his \\nbedroom. When she woke up, she found him on top of her, sexually \\nassaulting her.\\n  She immediately turned to the university for help and reported the \\nassault at The Women's Center. But the counselor did not tell her to \\ncall the police, advise her to press charges, or help her in any way.\\n  Silvana then went to the on-campus doctor. But instead of treating \\nher like a victim and offering her the care and support she needed, the \\ndoctor told her that he didn't want to know who assaulted her. Get \\nthis, Mr. Speaker: the doctor told her, the remedy was for her to \\ntransfer to another university. This is awful.\\n  One in five women on our university campuses are sexually assaulted. \\nOf those, less than 25 percent even report the rape.\\n  It took an extraordinary amount of courage for Silvana to report that \\nsexual assault, especially to multiple people she didn't even know. She \\nwas offered no help or no support by anyone. She was alone, and she \\nfelt it.\\n  The doctor wasn't trained to deal with rape victims and made it clear \\nhe wanted nothing more to do with Silvana. The university clearly \\nviewed Silvana as a burden, just another statistic they didn't want to \\ndeal with.\\n  Mr. Speaker, universities in the United States should be required to \\nhave a victim advocate on staff, a sexual assault victim advocate. \\nAlso, to ensure that this doesn't happen to more victims at hospitals, \\nI have introduced legislation that would require a hospital to provide \\naccess to a staffer--it is called a SAFE, sexual assault forensic \\nexaminer--who is trained to provide care and be sensitive to trauma \\nrape victims, or have a plan to get that victim to a nearby hospital \\nthat does. Universities and nearby hospitals need to work together to \\nmake sure that rape victims are treated appropriately when they are \\nassaulted on campus.\\n  The bill that I just mentioned is named the Megan Rondini Act. It is \\nin honor of a college sexual assault victim on the University of \\nAlabama campus, who was a Texas student, who was denied access to post-\\nrape treatment at a hospital. The university didn't help her, and the \\nlocal law enforcement didn't help her.\\n\\n\\n  In Megan's case, because she was alone and abandoned by all three of \\nthose entities, when she returned to Texas, she later committed \\nsuicide.\\n  Anyway, after the rape of Silvana, the university left Silvana to \\npick up the pieces of her shattered life. She was traumatized and \\ndepressed. Claiming that she wasn't stable enough, the hockey coach \\nremoved her from the team. She never played a single game of hockey in \\ncollege. She withdrew from the University of Connecticut shortly \\nthereafter, but her rapist stayed on his hockey team and played for the \\nuniversity. Silvana had to successfully sue the university to get \\njustice. She had to take the matter to court, where society and our \\njustice system should have helped her initially.\\n  Mr. Speaker, rape is never the fault of the victim, yet Silvana felt \\nthat she was the one being blamed for what happened to her.\\n  We as a society must demand our universities and hospitals protect \\nand care for sexual assault victims. No longer should they be allowed \\nto suffer alone and be abandoned. No more excuses.\\n  And that is just the way it is.\\n\", u'turn': 1, u'speaker': u'Mr. POE of Texas', u'itemno': 1}, {u'kind': u'linebreak', u'speaker_bioguide': None, u'text': u'                          ____________________\\n\\n\\n', u'turn': -1, u'speaker': u'None', u'itemno': 2}], u'header': {u'extension': False, u'vol': u'163', u'wkday': u'Wednesday', u'chamber': u'House', u'num': u'177', u'year': u'2017', u'month': u'November', u'pages': u'H8299', u'day': u'1'}, u'doc_title': u'CARE FOR UNIVERSITY RAPE VICTIMS', u'id': u'CREC-2017-11-01-pt1-PgH8299', u'title': u'CARE FOR UNIVERSITY RAPE VICTIMS'}{u'content': [{u'kind': u'linebreak', u'speaker_bioguide': None, u'text': u'                                 ______\\n', u'turn': -1, u'speaker': u'None', u'itemno': 0}, {u'kind': u'title', u'speaker_bioguide': None, u'text': u'                            HON.

The \\nTSC Miami Walk brings together patients like Max Lucca and their \\nfamilies with supporters who are committed to improving their lives.\\n  Every year, the walk plays an essential role in advancing lifesaving \\nresearch and programs to increase awareness of TSC, and expanding the \\nnetwork of resources that improve the lives of patients and their \\nfamilies.\\n  Mr. Speaker, I would like to recognize the work of Vanessa Vazquez; \\nher husband, Max; and all of the other activists who are so needed from \\nthe Tuberous Sclerosis Alliance who work so hard to make this walk a \\nreality.\\n  I want to thank everyone who came out to FIU last Saturday and made \\nthis event a resounding success. Due to your efforts, due to your \\ncommitment, I am confident that we will be able to increase the \\nresearch and education needed to find a cure for this tragic disease.\\n  Meanwhile, go Max Lucca.\\n\\n\\n             Commit to Ending Pediatric HIV/AIDS Worldwide\\n\", u'turn': 1, u'speaker': u'Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN', u'itemno': 1}, {u'kind': u'speech', u'speaker_bioguide': u'R000435', u'text': u\"  Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I would like to encourage my \\ncolleagues to support H. Res. 593, a bipartisan resolution reaffirming \\nour national commitment to ending pediatric HIV/AIDS worldwide.\\n  It is a resolution that I introduced with my friend, Congresswoman \\nBarbara Lee. The fight against pediatric AIDS is a great example of how \\nour country is a positive and transformative force in the lives of many \\nacross the world. Because of our leadership here in the United States \\nover the past 12 years, there has been a 62 percent increase in the \\nnumber of women receiving mother-to-child transmissions prevention \\nservices. Wow.\\n  Thanks to positive American involvement through programs like PEPFAR, \\nmore than 11.5 million expectant mothers around the world have received \\nHIV testing and counseling, and nearly 2 million babies have been born \\nHIV-free.\\n  However, even though we have made great strides in a fight against \\npediatric AIDS over the last few years, we cannot rest, Mr. Speaker. We \\ncannot rest while more than 400 children around the world are born with \\nHIV every day; 400. We cannot rest when less than half of the children \\nsuffering from HIV have access to the lifesaving treatments they so \\ndesperately need; less than half. Indeed, we must redouble our efforts \\nto reach every single mother and child impacted by this terrible \\ndisease.\\n  For this reason, my friend, Congresswoman Barbara Lee, and I just \\nreintroduced H. Res. 593, a bipartisan resolution recommitting our \\ncountry, the United States, to eradicating pediatric AIDS worldwide and \\nsupporting those who have been impacted by this epidemic. Our \\nresolution also supports our national efforts to provide women and \\nchildren with HIV counseling, with HIV testing services, as well as \\nexpanding their access to lifesaving treatments.\\n  America's ongoing commitment has helped save the lives of many, but \\nso much more remains to be done. We are one of the greatest hopes for a \\nbetter future for countless others. Now, more than ever, it is \\nessential to ensure that we remain committed as a nation to creating a \\nfuture where no child suffers from HIV/AIDS.\\n  I urge my colleagues to support this worthwhile cause and cosponsor \\nour resolution, H. Res. 593.\\n\", u'turn': 2, u'speaker': u'Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN', u'itemno': 2}, {u'kind': u'linebreak', u'speaker_bioguide': None, u'text': u'                          ____________________\\n\\n\\n', u'turn': -1, u'speaker': u'None', u'itemno': 3}], u'header': {u'extension': False, u'vol': u'163', u'wkday': u'Wednesday', u'chamber': u'House', u'num': u'177', u'year': u'2017', u'month': u'November', u'pages': u'H8305', u'day': u'1'}, u'related_bills': [{u'type': u'HRES', u'congress': u'115', u'context': u'OTHER', u'number': u'593'}], u'doc_title': u'HIGHLIGHTING THE STEP FORWARD TO CURE TSC MIAMI WALK', u'id': u'CREC-2017-11-01-pt1-PgH8305'}{u'content': [{u'text': u'  (Mr. PAULSEN asked and was given permission to address the House for \\n1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)', u'kind': u'Unknown', u'speaker': u'Unknown', u'itemno': 0, u'turn': -1}], u'header': {u'extension': False, u'vol': u'163', u'wkday': u'Wednesday', u'chamber': u'House', u'num': u'177', u'year': u'2017', u'month': u'November', u'pages': u'H8307', u'day': u'1'}, u'doc_title': u'CONGRATULATING OAKWOOD ELEMENTARY SCHOOL', u'id': u'CREC-2017-11-01-pt1-PgH8307-4', u'title': u'CONGRATULATING OAKWOOD ELEMENTARY SCHOOL'}{u'content': [{u'kind': u'linebreak', u'speaker_bioguide': None, u'text': u'                                 ______\\n', u'turn': -1, u'speaker': u'None', u'itemno': 0}, {u'kind': u'title', u'speaker_bioguide': None, u'text': u'                        HON.

Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize my good friend Daniel \\n(Dan) Duncan as he steps down after serving for 10 years as President \\nof the Northern Virginia Labor Federation, AFL-CIO (NoVA Labor.) As \\nPresident of NoVA Labor, Dan led the largest labor council in the \\nCommonwealth of Virginia and which represents nearly 70 unions and \\nlocals. In this role, he has been responsible for consolidating the \\nmissions and concerns of the various unions and their members into one \\nunified voice while ensuring that all opinions are heard and respected.\\n   Dan has dedicated his life to improving the lives of working \\nfamilies. He is committed to the mission of NoVA Labor which is to \\nbring economic justice to the workplace and social justice to our \\ncommunities. He learned these values from an early age--his grandfather \\nwas a shop steward at a shipyard in Cleveland, Ohio and his father was \\na rank and file Machinist. Dan joined his first union, the Retail \\nClerks Union, in 1973 at the age of 17 while working for a grocery \\nstore in Tennessee.\\n   After graduating from the University of Chattanooga in 1978, Dan \\nworked as a newspaper reporter. He later became director of the Fort \\nLauderdale senior employment program with the National Council of \\nSenior Citizens (NCSC) which was formed in 1961 and evolved from the \\nSenior Citizens for Kennedy organization. Working with the \\nadministration\\n\\n\\nof President John F. Kennedy, the NCSC was instrumental in rallying \\nsupport for comprehensive health insurance for senior citizens. These \\nefforts bore fruit when President Lyndon B. Johnson signed Medicare \\ninto law in 1965. NCSC's efforts were instrumental in passing this \\nlandmark legislation and the organization, now known as the Alliance \\nfor Retired Americans continues its fight to protect and preserve \\nMedicare and Social Security.\\n   Dan then accepted a position with the Seafarers International Union \\nwhere he has served for 30 years in various positions. For the last six \\nyears, Dan has held the position of Executive Secretary-Treasurer of \\nthe Maritime Trades Department.\\n   In his roles with individual unions as well as with the Northeast \\nFlorida Central Labor Council, the Northern Virginia Central Labor \\nCouncil, and the NoVA Labor Federation, Dan has worked tirelessly to \\nadvocate for working families and support state and federal legislation \\nthat would even the playing field for the backbone of our society--the \\nmiddle and lower class who deserve a fair wage for honest work and \\nother employer related benefits.\\n   I have personally known Dan Duncan and his wife Karen for many years \\nand have thoroughly enjoyed our countless conversations and discussions \\non issues of importance. While we have on occasion disagreed, mainly on \\ntheir terrible taste in baseball teams, but also occasionally on the \\nbest way to achieve a certain objective, we both know and understand \\nthat we share the same goals. These exchanges of ideas and opinions \\nhave been invaluable to both of us as we continue to represent and \\nserve our constituencies.\\n   Mr. Speaker, I ask that my colleagues join me in commending Dan \\nDuncan for his efforts on behalf of the working men and women of our \\ncountry and in thanking him for his service. Although he is stepping \\ndown from his position of President of NoVA Labor, I am confident that \\nhe will continue his efforts to strengthen and protect the rights and \\nbenefits of all and I wish him success in all of his future endeavors.\\n\", u'turn': 0, u'speaker': u'Mr. CONNOLLY', u'itemno': 2}, {u'kind': u'linebreak', u'speaker_bioguide': None, u'text': u'                          ____________________\\n\\n\\n', u'turn': -1, u'speaker': u'None', u'itemno': 3}], u'header': {u'extension': True, u'vol': u'163', u'wkday': u'Wednesday', u'chamber': u'House', u'num': u'177', u'year': u'2017', u'month': u'November', u'pages': u'E1481-E1482', u'day': u'1'}, u'doc_title': u'RECOGNIZING DANIEL DUNCAN', u'id': u'CREC-2017-11-01-pt1-PgE1481-4', u'title': u'RECOGNIZING DANIEL DUNCAN'}{u'content': [{u'text': u\"            35TH ANNIVERSARY OF UNKER'S THERAPEUTIC PRODUCTS\\n\", u'kind': u'Unknown', u'speaker': u'Unknown', u'itemno': 0, u'turn': -1}], u'header': {u'extension': False, u'vol': u'163', u'wkday': u'Wednesday', u'chamber': u'Senate', u'num': u'177', u'year': u'2017', u'month': u'November', u'pages': u'S6966', u'day': u'1'}, u'doc_title': u\"35TH ANNIVERSARY OF UNKER'S THERAPEUTIC PRODUCTS\", u'id': u'CREC-2017-11-01-pt1-PgS6966', u'title': None}{u'content': [{u'text': u'RECOGNIZING THE 26TH ANNUAL BEST OF RESTON AWARDS FOR COMMUNITY SERVICE ', u'kind': u'Unknown', u'speaker': u'Unknown', u'itemno': 0, u'turn': -1}], u'header': {u'extension': True, u'vol': u'163', u'wkday': u'Wednesday', u'chamber': u'House', u'num': u'177', u'year': u'2017', u'month': u'November', u'pages': u'E1484', u'day': u'1'}, u'doc_title': u'RECOGNIZING THE 26TH ANNUAL BEST OF RESTON AWARDS FOR COMMUNITY SERVICE RECIPIENTS', u'id': u'CREC-2017-11-01-pt1-PgE1484-2', u'title': None}{u'content': [{u'kind': u'linebreak', u'speaker_bioguide': None, u'text': u'                                 ______\\n', u'turn': -1, u'speaker': u'None', u'itemno': 0}, {u'kind': u'title', u'speaker_bioguide': None, u'text': u'                         HON.

Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize someone who has had a \\nprofound impact on the Northern Virginia community, Ms. Mary Beth Coya. \\nI have been proud to partner with Mary Beth on many issues of \\nimportance to the residents of Northern Virginia and the quality of \\nlife we enjoy, and I consider her a good friend. This year marks 30 \\nyears since Mary Beth Coya began her career with the Northern Virginia \\nAssociation of Realtors (NVAR), beginning in 1987 as a Legislative \\nAssistant. During her career, she has steadily advanced and currently \\nserves as the Senior Vice President of Government and Public Affairs \\nfor NVAR.\\n   Prior to joining NVAR, Mary Beth began her career as a staff member \\nwith the Virginia House of Delegates Appropriations Committee in \\nRichmond. From there she took her passion for advocacy to the private \\nsector, where she lobbied at both the state and federal levels for a \\nvariety of associations and companies. Throughout her career, Mary Beth \\nhas used her knowledge and experience to advocate for policies that \\nwould improve the lives of the members of her community. This has \\nperhaps most been felt in the area of transportation, where she serves \\nas a member of the Board of Directors for the Northern Virginia \\nTransportation Alliance (NVTA), a business-citizen coalition focused on \\nadvancing highway and transit projects of major importance to the \\nregion.\\n\\n\\n   I have worked with Mary Beth and the NVTA on efforts to construct \\nthe Silver Line Metrorail extension and the establishment of the \\nVirginia Railway Express commuter rail system. In fact, NVTA was the \\nfirst private sector organization to call for a dedicated funding \\nsource for Metro, which is a goal that I share.\\n   Mary Beth's career with NVAR and her role as a Board Member for the \\nNorthern Virginia Transportation Alliance are inextricably intertwined. \\nAt NVAR, she has been an experienced and expert advocate for the \\nadvancement of major legislation in the Commonwealth of Virginia. She \\nwas instrumental in obtaining dedicated regional and statewide \\ntransportation funding and has a passion for protecting the real estate \\nindustry. Due to her strong relationships with elected leaders at all \\nlevels of government and her extensive historical knowledge of the \\nregion, she has been an effective voice in ensuring that Northern \\nVirginia remains one of the best places in the country in which to \\nlive, work, play, and raise a family.\\n   Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating Mary \\nBeth Coya on the occasion of her 30th Anniversary with the Northern \\nVirginia Association of Realtors and in commending her for her \\ndedication to the betterment of our region. I am pleased to have had \\nthe opportunity to partner with her and NVAR on numerous issues and I \\nlook forward to continuing to work with her going forward.\\n\", u'turn': 0, u'speaker': u'Mr. CONNOLLY', u'itemno': 2}, {u'kind': u'linebreak', u'speaker_bioguide': None, u'text': u'                          ____________________\\n\\n\\n', u'turn': -1, u'speaker': u'None', u'itemno': 3}], u'header': {u'extension': True, u'vol': u'163', u'wkday': u'Wednesday', u'chamber': u'House', u'num': u'177', u'year': u'2017', u'month': u'November', u'pages': u'E1480-E1481', u'day': u'1'}, u'doc_title': u'RECOGNIZING MARY BETH COYA', u'id': u'CREC-2017-11-01-pt1-PgE1480-5', u'title': u'RECOGNIZING MARY BETH COYA'}{u'content': [{u'kind': u'speech', u'speaker_bioguide': None, u'text': u'  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the Ruthie and \\nConnie LGBT Elder Americans Act, legislation I am introducing to \\nsupport our country's LGBT seniors.\\n  The LGBT senior population is growing and is estimated to include \\nnearly 6 million Americans by 2030. Unfortunately, the same generation \\nof LGBT people who fought for rights in the workplace, equal marriage, \\nand societal recognition are once again marginalized as they age.\\n  LGBT seniors have fewer support services, higher poverty rates, more \\nsocial isolation, and inadequate access to healthcare services compared \\nto the rest of older Americans. One of the primary barriers to \\nproviding services to LGBT seniors is a basic lack of information.\\n  The Older Americans Act, or OAA, already requires the Administration \\non Aging to collect data on the individuals receiving OAA services and \\nthe efficacy of OAA programs; but if we collected data on sexual \\norientation and gender identity, we could better understand this \\npopulation and provide services that best fit their needs.\\n  Unfortunately, the data we do have shows that the poverty rate is \\nhigher for LGBT seniors, which is likely because many have faced \\ndiscrimination while working, they have historically been unable to \\nlegally marry, and they have experienced gender and racial \\ninequalities. We also know that LGBT elders are less likely than their \\npeers to have community support and caretakers to help them.\\n  I know from speaking with LGBT seniors that many fear discrimination \\nwhen receiving home healthcare services. They are twice as likely to be \\nsingle and four times more likely to not have children. These are \\ncomplex and important issues that require a personalized solution.\\n  The bill I am introducing today with Colorado Senator Michael Bennet \\nand Florida Representatives Ted Deutch and Charlie Crist would help \\nbridge the gap between LGBT seniors and the services they need.\\n  The bill is named for Ruthie Berman and Connie Kurtz, who sued the \\nNew York City Board of Education years ago for domestic partner \\nbenefits, and won their landmark case in 1994. In the decades since, \\nRuthie and Connie have continued their advocacy and fight as champions \\nof LGBT rights.\\n  Our bill would amend the Older Americans Act to improve services for \\nLGBT seniors and require data collection on sexual orientation so \\nbetter decisions can be made.\\n  Additionally, the bill would permanently establish a National \\nResource Center on LGBT Aging and provide grants for organizations \\nworking to improve LGBT services, including access to healthcare and \\nlong-term care. The resource centers and the grants will help States \\nand localities reach out to LGBT older adults and provide culturally \\ncompetent support.\\n  By requiring specific consideration for LGBT seniors in the Older \\nAmericans Act, we can provide needed support to a vulnerable yet \\noverlooked population.\\n\\n\\n  I thank my colleagues for their work on this important issue, and I \\nhope many others will join us in supporting this bill to help our LGBT \\nsenior communities.\\n\", u'turn': 1, u'speaker': u'Ms. BONAMICI', u'itemno': 1}, {u'kind': u'linebreak', u'speaker_bioguide': None, u'text': u'                          ____________________\\n\\n\\n', u'turn': -1, u'speaker': u'None', u'itemno': 2}], u'header': {u'extension': False, u'vol': u'163', u'wkday': u'Wednesday', u'chamber': u'House', u'num': u'177', u'year': u'2017', u'month': u'November', u'pages': u'H8300-H8301', u'day': u'1'}, u'doc_title': u'RUTHIE AND CONNIE LGBT ELDER AMERICANS', u'id': u'CREC-2017-11-01-pt1-PgH8300-2', u'title': u'RUTHIE AND CONNIE LGBT ELDER AMERICANS'}{u'content': [{u'text': u'  The SPEAKER pro tempore laid before the House the following \\ncommunication from the Clerk of the House of Representatives:\\n                                              Office of the Clerk,\\n\\n\\n                                     House of Representatives,\\n\\n                                 Washington, DC, November 1, 2017.\\n     Hon.

Mr. Speaker, I rise to today in opposition to the so-\\ncalled Stop Settlement Slush Funds Act of 2017 (H.R. 732).\\n  The Department of Justice has long had the authority to enter into \\nand enforce settlement agreements on behalf of the United States \\ngovernment. This includes payments to third parties that help right the \\nwrongs caused by an entity that has broken the law.\\n  For instance, the government can negotiate a settlement that allows \\npayments to groups like nonprofits that help aid in the recovery of the \\nindividuals and communities hurt by unlawful conduct. These third-party \\npayments are particularly important when it is impossible\\n\\n\\nto quantify all of the harm done, as is often true of environmental \\ncases.\\n  When a corporation responsible for dumping waste into a waterway or \\nemitting pollutants into the air agrees to this type of settlements, \\nthe non-profits they pay restore coastlines, rebuild ecosystems, and \\noften coordinate cleanup activities. This legislation threatens that \\ncritical remediation and recovery work.\\n  The Stop Settlement Slush Funds Act of 2017 ends this common-sense \\npractice by prohibiting the U.S. government from entering into or \\nenforcing settlement agreements that require payments to third parties. \\nIt also makes it much more difficult to provide relief for damage that \\nis more generalized and non-quantifiable. When a power plant dirties \\nthe air of a community, the number of visits to the doctor or new cases \\nof asthma cannot be precisely measured. That does not mean that they \\nshould not be held responsible for the harm they caused.\\n  House Republicans have used the first 10 months of this Congress to \\ndo little more than push policies that reduce corporate accountability \\nand line the pockets of corporate bad actors. I oppose the Stop \\nSettlement Slush Funds Act of 2017.\\n', u'turn': 0, u'speaker': u'Ms. McCOLLUM', u'itemno': 1}, {u'kind': u'linebreak', u'speaker_bioguide': None, u'text': u'                          ____________________\\n\\n\\n', u'turn': -1, u'speaker': u'None', u'itemno': 2}], u'header': {u'extension': True, u'vol': u'163', u'wkday': u'Wednesday', u'chamber': u'House', u'num': u'177', u'year': u'2017', u'month': u'November', u'pages': u'E1486-E1487', u'day': u'1'}, u'related_bills': [{u'type': u'HR', u'congress': u'115', u'context': u'TITLE', u'number': u'732'}, {u'type': u'HR', u'congress': u'115', u'context': u'OTHER', u'number': u'732'}], u'doc_title': u'H.R. 732, STOP SETTLEMENT SLUSH FUNDS ACT OF 2017', u'id': u'CREC-2017-11-01-pt1-PgE1486-3'}{u'title': None, u'content': [{u'kind': u'recorder', u'speaker_bioguide': None, u'text': u'           By Mr. BRADY of Texas:', u'turn': -1, u'speaker': u'The RECORDER', u'itemno': 0}, {u'kind': u'title', u'speaker_bioguide': None, u'text': u'       H.R. 4200.\\n       Congress has the power to enact this legislation pursuant \\n     to the following:\\n       United States Constitution Article I Section 8\\n\\n', u'turn': -1, u'speaker': u'None', u'itemno': 1}], u'header': {u'extension': False, u'vol': u'163', u'wkday': u'Wednesday', u'chamber': u'House', u'num': u'177', u'year': u'2017', u'month': u'November', u'pages': u'H8385', u'day': u'1'}, u'related_bills': [{u'type': u'HR', u'congress': u'115', u'context': u'TITLE', u'number': u'4200'}], u'doc_title': u'Constitutional Authority Statement for H.R. 4200', u'id': u'CREC-2017-11-01-pt1-PgH8385-2'}{u'content': [{u'kind': u'speech', u'speaker_bioguide': None, u'text': u'  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. Speaker, today is the early action deadline for \\nmany colleges in the United States. Thousands of students who are \\nsubmitting their applications are anxiously hoping for entry into a \\ncollege, community college, or postsecondary school.\\n  As students try to determine what schools are right for them, it is \\nclear they are missing some key information--information we all wish we \\nhad for our children: How likely are they to graduate? How long will it \\ntake to earn a degree or their certificate? How likely are they to find \\na job? How much money will they earn if they do find a job?\\n\\n  As a parent, I know this information will be helpful. That is why I \\nintroduced the College Transparency Act. My legislation would utilize \\nand make meaning out of the data we currently gather at the Federal \\nlevel to enable students and parents to make informed decisions.\\n  I have over 35 years in workforce development and postsecondary \\neducation. I understand the difficulties that people have in making \\ninformed decisions about what is best for their future career. I also \\nunderstand the reporting expectations for career colleges and \\nuniversities. I understand which institutions have the information \\navailable and how they provide it. I also understand the burdens that \\noccur in providing that information.\\n  Despite the incredible investment involved and the risk in pursuing a \\npostsecondary education, we and students are left with too little \\ninformation to answer the most basic questions: What can students \\nexpect to pay out of pocket? Can you imagine that really they cannot \\ndetermine how much it will cost them to complete a postsecondary \\nprogram? How do students fare in the labor market after leaving \\ncollege? How likely are they to fare in order to enter into the labor \\nmarket? How do students fare on other metrics of success we all \\nconsider important, like earnings, and loan repayment?\\n  A prospective student doesn't have the information about which \\nprograms at which institutions provide an adequate return on their \\ninvestment, and on their parents' investment.\\n  As a consumer and a father, it is difficult for me to wrap my head \\naround the idea that Americans have so little information about \\npotentially what may be the largest investment they make in their \\nlives, and certainly, the second largest. I am the father of six \\nchildren. The reality is that we are investing and putting six children \\nthrough a college or a postsecondary program. Think about how much \\nmoney goes into that. Yet we operate in a vacuum on information.\\n  When you shop online, you are able to compare products, you are able \\nto compare costs, you are able to compare features, the value to the \\nconsumer. At this point in time, try to do that about programs at a \\ncollege, university, or career school. Try to compare one university's \\nnursing program to another; or the architecture program, or history \\nprogram, or the nursing program in a college. Try to find that \\ninformation. You won't find it online. Try to call the university. Good \\nluck on that.\\n  It is not that they don't try to provide it. In fact, they provide \\nreams of data. The reality is that the current system simply doesn't \\ngather that data in a manner that is useful to consumers, the people \\nthat ultimately pay the bill.\\n  The College Transparency Act would enable students to answer crucial \\nquestions, such as how likely they are to enter the workforce \\nsuccessfully, or what their chances are of transferring from a \\ncommunity college to a 4-year college and being able to graduate.\\n  Students past and present are owners of the $1.4 trillion outstanding \\nFederal debt, and the clock is ticking. It is time for students, \\nfamilies, and guidance counselors involved in the college \\ndecisionmaking process to be able to assist students and have access to \\ninformation that will make this huge investment make sense. Otherwise, \\nwe leave young people to make decisions based on: Well, those colors on \\nthe band uniform are really cool; or they have a good football team; or \\nit seems like they have a really nice social life.\\n  But, ultimately, what we are making is an investment into the future \\nof our children and the future of this country. They have massive money \\ninvested, and let's be honest, we all do as taxpayers as well. We have \\na huge investment in the preparation of young people for the workforce.\\n  It is time to streamline and update our higher education information \\nsystem so that families and students can make better decisions on their \\npath to long-term success. It is time to utilize and make meaning out \\nof the data we currently collect to assist them in making the choice.\\n\\n\\n  The question I am asked is: Why did I submit the College Transparency \\nAct? I spent 35 years operating a private career school group and \\nworking in workforce development. I worked at Chrysler Corporation, \\nmoved to another company, and also retired out of that field.\\n  The point is, I have worked in the field for 35 years. I understand \\nthe data that is reported. I understand the challenges that people have \\nin trying to sort out what is the best career path for them, how likely \\nare they to succeed in that career path, and what is it going to cost \\nto go to school?\\n\\n\\n  This information all exists--and we will talk about that tonight--but \\nit isn't made available in some coherent manner to students, and we \\nneed to fix that.\\n  We also can't tell students how long, on average, it takes them to \\ncomplete their program. It used to be the day where they used to call \\nthem 4-year colleges. The reality, as you well know, Mr. Speaker, is 4-\\nyear colleges are now a dream, 5 years is the norm, and 6 years is not \\nuncommon, yet we don't talk about the cost it takes to do that. Again, \\nwe don't talk about the likelihood of completing even if you attend 6 \\nyears. The reality is we have to fix that.\\n  In my 35 years of dealing with the system, what became clear to me is \\nit is outdated, it is burdensome, it is unhelpful, and it conflicts. It \\nled me to start working on the College Transparency Act as soon as I \\ncame to Congress. It was the first bill that I dropped and submitted in \\nCongress. It is the one I spent the most time on. Why? Because we have \\na huge investment in postsecondary education, and, even more \\nimportantly, we have a huge investment preparing a labor force.\\n  I have not gone to an employer since I was sworn into office that has \\nnot said to me: We can't find people with the skills to go to work.\\n  Yet we have people who have graduated from college who can't find \\njobs that relate to their degree. We have people who will go to college \\nfor an extended period of time or to a postsecondary program who don't \\ncomplete, but they meander their way through. They get lost. They don't \\nhave the information to make an informed decision, and then somehow, \\nsometimes, frankly, we blame the consumer.\\n  It is our fault. It is our fault here. It is our fault at the Federal \\nGovernment. We are making a huge investment, and we expect everybody \\nelse to cure the problem. Better information on outcomes in student \\nsuccess will certainly assist in closing the skills gap that we talk \\nabout nearly every day here in Congress and certainly every day in the \\nEducation and the Workforce Committee when we meet.\\n  Senators Hatch, Warren, Cassidy, and Whitehouse share my concern. On \\nthe Senate side, they have introduced a similar bill--almost \\nidentical--to address this critical issue. I believe on this issue we \\ncan get bipartisan support to move forward with an approach to inform \\nthe public and the consumers about the decision they will make with \\ntheir money and, to be honest with you, our investment in their future.\\n  The current system is massively broken. This chart will show the \\ncurrent reporting system for higher education in the United States \\ntoday. If you can possibly read it from there--and we will get it \\nsubmitted for the Record--these are all the groups that gather data, \\nall the places it goes, and all the information that is exchanged about \\nstudents going to postsecondary education in the United States.\\n  I ask you, Mr. Speaker, can you make any sense of that? I have worked \\n35 years in that field. I will tell you that a student enrollment for \\none system doesn't match the definition of enrollment in another \\nsystem, it doesn't match the definition in the State system, yet we all \\nreport that information. Graduate information is all different \\ndepending on the system. None of the definitions match.\\n  Now, if we can't get definitions to match internally in a system \\nbetween State accrediting agencies and the Federal Government, how is \\nit we expect students and how are parents to understand whether they \\nare likely to complete the program? And, by the way, none of this \\ninformation adequately reports student outcomes in terms of employment \\nand doesn't provide them any information on what they are likely to \\nearn. And guess what? Earnings matter in terms of their ability to pay \\ntheir student loans back. News flash to everybody: it helps if they \\nknow what they are going to make.\\n  A 2015 study completed by Boston Consulting Group indicated $11.1 \\nbillion is spent by institutions to comply with regulations specific to \\ncolleges and universities. We don't need more regulations. Good God, \\nhelp us. We have plenty--we have plenty of reporting.\\n  One of the most significant findings of the study was that small and \\nmedium colleges are disproportionately impacted by those Federal \\nregulations with compliance eating up a much larger share of \\nexpenditures than the wealthier institutions.\\n  While we say we need more options for continuing and postsecondary \\neducation, for career and technical education at the postsecondary \\nlevel, we are killing those institutions with rules and regulations of \\nreporting that give us that, that isn't useful to the public that has \\nto make a decision. Imagine that.\\n  We have an opportunity to fix that with the Higher Education Act. We \\nhave an opportunity to fix that with the College Transparency Act. We \\nhave an opportunity now.\\n  There are three main goals of the bill. This chart will show you what \\nthe bill will collect. First and most importantly, the goal is to \\nprovide accurate and complete information that is searchable for \\nstudents and can be customized. Think about it. How many people have \\nshopped for an automobile? They have on the website a comparison of \\nwhatever vehicle to other similar vehicles sold by other manufacturers. \\nYou can compare them dealer to dealer. You can get an idea what \\nfeatures are there. Shop for whatever you want, and then tell me if you \\ncan find that about any educational program offered by postsecondary \\ninstitutions.\\n  This addresses that issue while reducing reporting burdens on \\ninstitutions. I believe, and I think most of our party believes, that \\nmarket competition works best when consumers can actually find out \\ninformation and make rational decisions. They can compare complete \\ninformation. They can compare the offerings, the costs, and the \\noutcomes.\\n\\n  With that competition, we can, in fact, address one of the other \\nconcerns we have, which is: What is the cost of higher education? We \\ncan compare it not just on what you pay for tuition, room and board, \\nbut the return on investment. What do they get for their time and money \\nin a postsecondary education program?\\n  More importantly, choices will be made by consumers and not the \\nFederal Government. We have seen how that works in so many ways, and \\nthe Federal Government should not be making choices about the future of \\nAmericans.\\n  If we arm consumers with that information to make informed decisions, \\nthen we can remove the Federal Government from the business of \\ndetermining quality in education and let consumers and accrediting \\nagencies address that.\\n  The bill also replaces a number of reporting requirements that the \\nFederal Government has, most notably what is called the IPED survey. I \\ndid them for years. Routinely, we get questions that don't match their \\ndefinitions because their definitions made no sense for many \\ninstitutions.\\n  Thirdly, the bill aims to provide transparency to its students by \\nrequiring they be posted in a searchable database, and the costs would \\nbe identified there.\\n  Let me go through real quickly in that chart the information that \\nwill be available that is not currently available on a searchable \\nbasis. You can get enrollment patterns, you can get progress to \\ncompletion, and you can get completion rates. Do you graduate from a \\nprogram? Imagine that. You can find that out, and it is the same \\ndefinition whether it is the University of Michigan or Michigan State \\nwhere I attended. Wouldn't that be a great idea?\\n  You can find out about their postcollege earnings. It is really \\nhelpful. Most people go to college or a postsecondary school to find a \\njob, earn some money, and support their family. Can they do that? What \\nis likely to be the outcome?\\n  The cost of the program? I mentioned that a couple of times. It is \\nnot just tuition and room and board. The reality is that, depending on \\nthe program, your costs are significantly different. My 18- almost 19-\\nyear-old stepdaughter attends an art school. Well, beyond tuition and \\nroom and board, there are huge costs for art supplies. Now, we knew \\nthat. I have experience in education. There are a lot of people who \\nstart these programs who don't understand there are other costs and \\nwhat those may be. This process requires reporting of that from the \\ncolleges.\\n  Also, information about financial aid that is available for those \\ninstitutions\\n\\n\\nso they can compare program to program, institution to institution, and \\nmake a decision that is best for them and their family. That is what we \\nare trying to achieve here. It is achievable.\\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Garrett) who \\nwill speak for a few moments on the bill and its advantages.\", u'turn': 3, u'speaker': u'Mr. MITCHELL', u'itemno': 4}, {u'kind': u'speech', u'speaker_bioguide': u'G000580', u'text': u\"  Mr. GARRETT. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my colleague, Congressman \\nMitchell, for his leadership in this amazingly important area, and also \\nto point out the bipartisan nature of this bill not only, Mr. Speaker, \\nto you, but to those people who might be watching at home at a time \\nwhen it seems that we can't agree on anything, here we have an \\nagreement in a College Transparency Act in how to ensure a better \\ninvestment for the futures of our children.\\n  Now, there are those who have opposed this bill, and I can't really \\nwrap my brain around it, Mr. Speaker. Someone suggested that this might \\ngrow government. But that is absolutely not true. As a matter of fact, \\nthe data that would be made available in this act is already collected. \\nBut the problem is that that data is collected, and then it is siloed \\nand accessible only to institutions or government entities and not to \\nthe end user. That strikes me as illogical, at best, and stupid, at \\nworst.\\n  Someone says it burdens colleges with data collection requirements, \\nyet, again, the data is already being collected. What about personal \\nprivacy? Does it disclose individuals' private information? Well, if it \\ndid, I wouldn't be standing here today extolling the virtues of this \\nbill which I cosponsored and Mr. Mitchell sponsors that support it \\nagain across the aisle to include the likes of the distinguished \\ngentleman, Mr. Polis, from Colorado.\\n  Instead of disclosing personal data of individuals, it discloses \\nmetadata of groups so what we would learn, for example, is that \\nindividuals who majored in X at college Y had an employment rate of Z, \\nand that their earning potential was A as opposed to another university \\nwhere it might be B.\\n  What more pertinent information, Mr. Speaker, could there be to young \\npeople as they seek to choose an area of study and a place to engage in \\nthat area of study than their likelihood of success based on those who \\nhave done the same thing at the same college or university before them?\\n  So we have addressed some of the things that this bill doesn't do, \\nbut let's speak briefly about what it does do. Without any ability to \\narticulately argue, this bill increases transparency. When you step \\naside from the realm of national security, I can think of no reason \\nthat the Federal or State or local government should be in the business \\nof collecting data that they don't share with the citizens who put them \\nin office or the people who fund their endeavors. Indeed, this isn't \\nnational security, unless you contemplate the fact that right now our \\nchildren attend universities deprived of information that might help \\nthem make better choices.\\n  So this increases transparency. It creates informed consumers. It \\nallows individuals to decide for themselves which college or university \\nmight offer a program that they are interested in, is the best \\ninvestment of their time, and perhaps their or their parents' or the \\ngovernment's money. It informs payers to that very end, whether that \\npayer is the student, a family member, or the State of which they are a \\nresident. It gives us a return on the investment.\\n\\n  The fact that this data has been collected low these many years, and \\nit took the leadership of Mr. Mitchell and good folks like Jared Polis \\nworking across the aisle to get us to this point, is lamentable, but we \\nhave the opportunity in the College Transparency Act to correct these \\nwrongs, not to reburden our universities with more data collection \\nrequirements, but to take the data that is already being collected and \\ngive it to the end users, the students.\\n  So it is with that that I again offer a hearty congratulations to \\nCongressman Mitchell, a begrudging ``I wish I had thought of that,'' \\nand I implore my colleagues on both sides of the aisle that while we \\nalready collect this data, we do not disseminate it where it would be \\nmost useful, and that is to the end users. I hope that all can find a \\nway to join us from both parties in supporting this commonsense \\nmeasure, the College Transparency Act.\\n  Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from the president of \\nthe University of Virginia in my district.\\n\\n                                           University of Virginia,\\n\\n\\n                                      Office of the President,\\n\\n                                Charlottesville, VA, June 1, 2017.\\n     Hon.

We are now at over 90 groups that have indicated \\ntheir support for this legislation and the need for this legislation.\\n  I know it is difficult to read from there, but in a moment I will \\ntalk more about some of these institutions.\\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Stivers), who is \\nmy colleague and good friend. Yes, he is from Ohio and roots for Ohio \\nState. I went to Michigan State, but I will certainly yield to Mr. \\nStivers to talk further about the College Transparency Act.', u'turn': 6, u'speaker': u'Mr. MITCHELL', u'itemno': 7}, {u'kind': u'speech', u'speaker_bioguide': u'S001187', u'text': u\"  Mr. STIVERS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak in support of H.R. \\n2434, the College Transparency Act. I want to thank my good friend from \\nMichigan, Congressman Mitchell, for his leadership and bipartisan work \\non this very important bill.\\n  This time of year, parents and students are beginning to make \\nimportant decisions about higher education for the next school year.\\n\\n\\n  Unfortunately, there is little information available about what can \\nbe expected from the large investment in a college or a university. \\nThis legislation will enable students and families to make informed \\nchoices about their education after high school.\\n  The College Transparency Act will provide actionable, customizable \\ninformation for students and families as they consider college and \\nuniversities by accurately reporting on student outcomes, such as \\nenrollment, completion, and postcollege success across colleges and \\nmajors.\\n  Most importantly, this information will tell students how other \\nprospective students have succeeded at an institution and help point \\nthem toward schools best suited for their unique needs and desired \\noutcomes.\\n  The current college reporting system is overly burdensome on \\ninstitutions, yet it provides little practical information for students \\nand families due to significant gaps in college data reporting.\\n  Additionally, the data collected only reports graduation rates for \\nstudents who begin as full-time students and finish at the same \\ninstitution, leaving out successes of part-time students and\\n\\n\\nany student who transfers and completes a degree at an institution \\nother than where they started. With more than half of bachelor's degree \\nrecipients attending more than one school and nearly two-thirds of \\ncommunity college students starting part-time, we have to ensure that \\nthese students count.\\n  One example of this impact from my alma mater, The Ohio State \\nUniversity, is a veteran named Tami. Tami returned to school to \\ncomplete her social work degree after her military service. She \\ncompleted an associate of arts degree at Columbus State, a community \\ncollege, and transferred and eventually graduated with a social work \\ndegree from The Ohio State University. She had a 3.9 grade point \\naverage in the classroom and excelled in her two-semester field \\nplacement at the university's Office of Military and Veterans Services.\\n  Under this system, Tami's success story would not count toward Ohio \\nState success. Under the new system, it will. Today, the system would \\nnot count Tami because she started at one school and transferred to \\nanother school. Under the legislation that Mr. Mitchell is working on \\nand that I am talking about today, Tami would count again.\\n  We need to make people count again. Tami served our country. Tami got \\nout of the military, came back, went to school part-time, then \\ntransferred schools, went to school full-time, and completed her \\npractical experience. Under the current reporting system, Tami doesn't \\ncount.\\n  Let's fix that. That is what this bill would do. Under the updated \\nsystem, institutions would securely report privacy-protected student \\nlevel data to the National Center for Education Statistics, or NCES. \\nNCES would be responsible for presenting summary information on a user-\\nfriendly website for students and families, while securely storing \\nstudent information.\\n  This legislation will help countless students and families make \\nbetter decisions about where to go for higher education, where they \\nshould attend.\\n  I want to thank Congressman Mitchell and Congressman Polis for \\nintroducing this important, bipartisan legislation that will help so \\nmany students and families, students like Tami.\\n  I hope we can roll up our sleeves, work together, and get this bill \\npassed. I urge my colleagues to support this bill.\", u'turn': 7, u'speaker': u'Mr. STIVERS', u'itemno': 8}, {u'kind': u'speech', u'speaker_bioguide': u'M001201', u'text': u\"  Mr. MITCHELL. I appreciate the gentleman's notation of the groups \\nthat support this bill. I was surprised, frankly, with the number of \\ngroups that stepped forward--as I said, over 90--to support the College \\nTransparency Act. Some of the groups I would like to stress today \\ninclude veterans groups.\\n  The Student Veterans of America and Veterans Education Success, among \\nothers, have endorsed the bill because it helps veterans determine \\nwhich institutions and programs best serve their unique needs and \\nimprove their ability to make progress in the workforce to be \\nsuccessful, something that, frankly, we owe them as part of their \\nservice to our country.\\n  As Chris Cate, vice president of research at Student Veterans of \\nAmerica, said: ``Based on recent research, the value of the Post-9/11 \\nGI Bill is clear, as student veterans across the country succeed at \\nrates higher than traditional students. Yet, determining these outcomes \\nis currently a significant effort and not easily accomplished without \\nabundant resources. Basing policy on research and data is imperative, \\nand it shouldn't take as much effort as it does today, as we have the \\nanswer to this challenge staring us in the face.'' It is the College \\nTransparency Act.\\n  We currently collect the data that people are begging to get to make \\ninformed decisions for themselves and, frankly, in this case, to assist \\nveterans in making wise decisions on their GI bill.\\n  Let me talk a little more about some of the groups that support the \\nbill, and then I will yield to another colleague of mine.\\n  Colleges, universities, and postsecondary institutions support this \\nbill, which sometimes surprises me, given what we are trying to do, \\nwhich is remake a reporting system and make transparent their \\nperformance. Think about it. They support the bill without exception. \\nThese institutions want more comprehensive information on student \\nprogress, completion, and outcomes so they can better understand and \\nevaluate how well they are serving their students and identify areas \\nfor improvement.\\n  Institutions also know best student-level data collection will \\ndecrease the reporting burden and the financial and human resources \\nnecessary to report and complete the requirements of the Federal \\nGovernment, State government, and accrediting agencies.\\n  Associations representing institutions serving the majority of \\ncollege students support lifting the ban on connecting student-level \\ndata to help build evidence and improve the quality of the program.\\n  As my colleague Mr. Stivers indicated, as well as others, this \\ninformation is disseminated and developed only at the metadata level. \\nIt is not like we are going to send your Social Security number out and \\npost it on a Facebook page with your employment status; although, in \\nyour case, Mr. Speaker, everyone knows well your employment status.\\n\\n  According to the Michigan Association of State Universities, which \\nserves as the coordinating board for Michigan's 15 public universities \\nin my home State: ``The College Transparency Act of 2017 represents a \\nmuch-needed modernization of the Federal Government's college reporting \\nsystem for postsecondary data. The current ban on student-level data in \\nthe Higher Education Act represents a gross injustice to students and \\nfamilies who require and deserve more accurate data on postsecondary \\ninstitutional outcomes in order to be adequately equipped to make one \\nof the most important decision in one's life--whether and where to \\nattend college. By providing more accurate information about \\ninstitutional graduation rates, salary levels, and other employment \\noutcomes, and additional information on how students fare at individual \\ninstitutions and in academic programs, the College Transparency Act \\nwill enable the creation of an essential resource for student and \\nconsumer information.''\\n  Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from the Michigan \\nAssociation of State Universities.\\n\\n                                           Michigan Association of\\n\\n\\n                                           State Universities,\\n\\n                                       Lansing, MI, July 10, 2017.\\n     Re Endorsement of College Transparency Act, H.R. 2434/S. \\n         1121.\\n\\n     Hon. Paul Mitchell,\\n     House of Representatives,\\n     Washington, DC.\\n       Dear Congressman Mitchell: On behalf of the presidents and \\n     chancellors of the 15 public universities of Michigan and the \\n     nearly 300,000 students they collectively enroll, I write to \\n     express strong support for the College Transparency Act of \\n     2017, H.R. 2434, which you have sponsored, and its companion \\n     bill in the Senate, S. 1121.\\n       The College Transparency Act of 2017 represents a much \\n     needed modernization of the federal government's college \\n     reporting system for postsecondary data. The current ban on \\n     student-level data in the Higher Education Act represents a \\n     gross injustice to students and families who require and \\n     deserve more accurate data on postsecondary institutional \\n     outcomes in order to be adequately equipped to make one of \\n     the most important decision in one's life--whether and where \\n     to attend college. By providing more accurate information \\n     about institutional graduation rates, salary levels and other \\n     employment outcomes, and additional information on how \\n     students fare at individual institutions and in academic \\n     programs, the College Transparency Act will enable the \\n     creation of an essential resource for student and consumer \\n     information.\\n       Introduced in both Congressional chambers, this bipartisan \\n     legislation will also serve as an indispensable tool in \\n     helping institutions assess and enhance their academic \\n     programs. Michigan public universities rely heavily on data \\n     to inform institutional policy and to better serve our \\n     students.\\n       We commend your leadership and those co-sponsoring the \\n     College Transparency Act and offer our support in advocating \\n     passage of the legislation.

I thank my friend from Michigan (Mr. Mitchell) for \\nhosting this Special Order on the College Transparency Act.\\n  Mr. Speaker, I have spoken on the floor a number of times about the \\nHouse's work to improve education in the country. I have been proud to \\nwork with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle in the Education and \\nthe Workforce Committee to improve career and technical education, and \\nI have also spoken about my own experience with higher education as a \\nnontraditional student taking classes at night while I ran a \\nconstruction company during the day.\\n  Tonight, I am happy to be here to talk about ensuring that students, \\nparents, guidance counselors, and legislators like us have access to \\ninformation that can help students make informed decisions about what \\ncollege to attend so that policymakers have access to research and data \\nthat will better inform our work on higher education policy.\\n  Today, colleges and universities report data to the U.S. Department \\nof Education that has been collected by a voluntary survey available \\nonly to a limited group of graduates. The survey is not offered to any \\nstudent who is attending college part-time, who is not seeking a \\ndegree, who has transferred from another college, or who doesn't have \\nFederal loans.\\n  In today's economy, we are trying to make higher education more \\navailable and accessible to nontraditional students, yet we omit a \\nlarge group of nontraditional students from this data. That is just one \\nof the reasons why we need to pass the College Transparency Act.\\n  This bipartisan legislation seeks to modernize higher education \\nreporting so that students and families can make responsible choices \\nabout what college or university to attend. It will help empower \\nstudents and families to determine how much they need to take out in \\nstudent loans and which programs at different schools provide the best \\npaths toward their dream job or a career.\\n  Too many students today are graduating with massive amounts of debt. \\nToo many students graduate with majors offering too few opportunities. \\nAt the very least, students need to have this data available to them to \\nmake informed decisions.\\n  This bill, as has been pointed out by Mr. Mitchell, is endorsed by \\nmore than 80 education and business organizations, including Advance \\nCTE and the Association for Career and Technical Education, \\norganizations that represent great schools like Thaddeus Stevens \\nCollege of Technology in my district.\\n  This bill has bipartisan support in our committee, in the Senate, and \\nthe House, and it is essential for transforming our higher education \\nsystem to meet the needs of a 21st century economy. So, again, I am \\nhappy to rise to speak in support of this act.\\n  I would like to thank my friend from Michigan for hosting this \\nSpecial Order this evening, and I urge my colleagues to consider \\nsupporting this important piece of legislation.\", u'turn': 10, u'speaker': u'Mr. SMUCKER', u'itemno': 11}, {u'kind': u'speech', u'speaker_bioguide': u'M001201', u'text': u\"  Mr. MITCHELL. I thank my colleague, Mr. Smucker, for taking time out \\nof his busy schedule to come here tonight to talk about the act and its \\nimportance nationally and in his district.\\n  He made reference to something I wish to stress, Mr. Speaker, which \\nis that, annually, at the Federal level, we spend $160 billion a year \\non student aid. We currently spend it into a vacuum, into a giant black \\nhole, in which we hope we get outcomes and which students hope they get \\noutcomes. Certainly, parents hope they get outcomes so they don't \\ncontinue to live at home. We all hope that we can get success for our \\nyoung people, and we don't have the information to determine that.\\n  Let me also stress that, beyond educational groups, veterans, the \\nU.S. Chamber of Commerce and Business Roundtable have both endorsed \\nthis bill as being critical to the success of our Nation going forward.\\n  I want to stress for you and everyone in this Chamber, when you get \\nthe level of support from such a broad range of people, we have to \\nstart asking ourselves: Why have we not already moved on this? Why has \\nit not already taken place? We need to move on this issue sooner rather \\nthan later. We can't afford not to.\\n  Let me talk about one other group that supports this bill \\npassionately. Students want to know which schools are best fit for \\ntheir needs. Deciding where to spend their time, their precious \\ndollars, and incur debt is critically important to them.\\n  Surprisingly enough, these folks want to do more than go to college, \\nmeet new friends, and have a little party every now and then. The vast \\nmajority--85 percent--of college freshmen rate getting a better job as \\nvery important in their decision to go to college; yet the day-to-day \\nneed, as we have talked about repeatedly tonight, to discern which \\nprogram's institutions will best address that objective is lacking.\\n  The ability to provide that information is at our hands. We have the \\ntechnology. We have the data. We just don't provide it in a usable \\nformat.\\n  Groups that support this bill include the Big Ten Student \\nAssociation, Campaign for College Opportunity, Young Invincibles, \\nInstitute for College Access and Success, the United Negro College \\nFund, Achieving the Dream, Student Affairs Administrators in Higher \\nEducation, Institute for Higher Education Policy, and the National \\nAssociation for College Admission Counseling. They support the College \\nTransparency Act.\\n  I would ask: How many more groups do we need to gather before we \\ndecide to act here in Congress?\\n\\n\\n  In the time I have left, I want to address some myths. And if my \\ncolleague, Mr. Smucker, who is still here, wants to weigh in on this, I \\ninvite him to join at any point in time he wants to weigh in, because \\nwe heard a number of myths put forward about the terrible things that \\nthe College Transparency Act may arise.\\n  One that amazes me is that while the bill requires institutions \\ncollect and report tons of new information on students--well, can we \\nbring that chart back up of what we already collect? Let's look at that \\ngem of what we collect currently. We are doing this now. Institutions \\nare doing this now.\\n  So tell me, how are we going to collect tons more? In fact, every \\nstudent who attends a postsecondary education institution in the United \\nStates has information reported on them now, whether they take student \\nfinancial aid or not, because a 1098-T is filed by that institution \\nwith the IRS so, in fact, if they claim credit for going to school, \\ntuition tax credit, they can claim that.\\n  There is no information that is not currently with one agency or \\nanother. The astonishing thing is the discussion that somehow there is \\nsome secret about whether someone is attending a postsecondary \\ninstitution. It is astonishing.\\n  College universities, also, because of this reporting, hold the \\nstudent-level data. They report much of it to the Department of \\nEducation, to NCES, and to the State Department of Education to \\naccredit the agencies in a variety of formats. The number of formats, \\nthe array of those, will totally amaze you. If you would like, I can \\nget those reports for you. You can spend the afternoon looking through \\nthe joys of reporting on educational activities in a postsecondary \\ninstitution, and none of it makes any sense to anybody that isn't \\nactually in the system, and I will admit, that data doesn't make any \\nsense to me either.\\n  Colleges and universities also don't know if their graduates actually \\nget a job, unless half the students come back happily and say they went \\nto work and how much they are making. They don't get that information. \\nThey couldn't assist the student with that information if they tried in \\nany accurate basis other than anecdotally. So they don't try. Why would \\nyou? You wouldn't do that. You wouldn't make that mistake.\\n  That information exists. Why? Because the IRS has a 1098-T on \\neveryone who went to college or a postsecondary institution. That data \\ncan be matched by the Treasury Department to whether that student is \\nemployed, what they are making, and they can report that, as was noted \\nearlier, through metadata to the Department of Education for \\ndevelopment of reports without reporting one individual student's \\ninformation.\\n\\n\\n  So I am lost in understanding how it is we lose our minds around here \\nabout student information being disseminated. It exists. It can be \\nprotected.\\n  Let me talk real briefly about another myth that exists, that somehow \\ntracking the student data will lead to a Federal rating system, the \\nFederal rating system of educational programs of institutions.\\n  Well, first, the Department of Education has tried a number of rating \\nsystems over there, all with mixed success, at best, and I am trying to \\nbe polite. It is late in the evening. Let's not be too blunt. But they \\nfailed miserably in doing so. They tried to rate institutions based on \\ncohort default rates, and those are being repealed by many as being \\ninaccurate.\\n  They tried to rate institutions on something called gainful \\nemployment, but they only do gainful employment for career schools, \\nbecause, hey, you know, no one goes to a university for gainful \\nemployment. I assure you, my guess is the Speaker did as well, you went \\nto the university hoping for gainful employment. I doubt there is \\nanyone in the room who didn't go to a college or university in hopes of \\ngainful employment.\\n  The reality is the Department of Education, as they have implemented \\nthis, has tried to create these Federal rating systems and failed \\nmiserably. So I tell you what, we did something unique. The College \\nTransparency Act explicitly prohibits the creation of a single database \\nby the Department of Education and expressly prohibits using that \\ndatabase for a Federal rating system.\\n  I give up. I don't want the Department of Education telling us what a \\ngood education system is because look how well they have done so far. \\nWe will let consumers decide. We will give them information so they can \\ndecide. They can make a wise decision rather than thinking that Big \\nBrother can make that decision for them.\\n  If the government were doing so well with it, why is it that every \\nMember in this room has heard from their employers the terrible \\nshortage we have of people in current technical education, of workers? \\nIf they were doing such a great job of ratings and informing people \\nwhat their opportunities were, why are we currently struggling with the \\nworkforce we have?\\n  It is a disaster. Let's stop thinking we can fix it, and let's let \\nconsumers have the information they need to fix it.\\n  The bill enables the NCES to aggregate student information from \\nrelevant agencies with the responsibility that they had to protect that \\ndata, which they have done for years.\\n  So now they are doing--not create some massive Federal database in \\nwhich everybody's name, Social Security number, is accessible so we can \\ndetermine whether or not you are a successful student. It doesn't do \\nthat, not even close to that, never has. It provides information on an \\naccurate basis by a program institution of what your likelihood of \\nsuccess is.\\n  Last but not least, I talked a little bit about it, is keeping \\npersonal information private, the fears about privacy, and that somehow \\nwe can't achieve that under the College Transparency Act.\\n  The College Transparency Act requires that data collection should be \\nled by the National Center for Education Statistics. I apologize. I \\nhave been using the abbreviation NCES because it has been burned into \\nmy memory over the years. It is a statistical agency with strong \\nprotocols for securing data and protecting student privacy. It has an \\nexcellent track record for doing so.\\n\\n  They have consulted with the private sector, pretty good folks, about \\nhow to continue to work on student privacy in that data. NCES is \\nalready required by law to develop and enforce standards to protect \\nindividual level data. As added protection, the act requires, the \\nCollege Transparency Act requires, an institute utilize the latest \\nFederal data security standards developed by the National Institute of \\nStandards and Technology. We require that they implement those on an \\nongoing basis and they maintain those.\\n  I have to tell you, Mr. Speaker, that is not commonplace in the \\nFederal Government at this point. We are going a step beyond what \\nhappens every day in many agencies.\\n  Further, your personal information, Mr. Smucker's or anybody else's, \\nwill never be available to the Department of Education or to the \\npublic. Your employment status will never be available. What will be \\navailable is whether all of us who took a program in Michigan State \\nUniversity--come on up, you would love the school, some time--whether \\nor not you graduated, you got a job, and whether you are gainfully \\nemployed and making money. Now, wouldn't that be a great idea for the \\nmoney you put into a college education? All the aggregate information \\nis available on the programs and institutions we are talking about \\nhere.\\n  The data developed by the Treasury Department on income and \\nemployment, once it is transmitted to NCES, is literally blown up. The \\nfile no longer exists. You can't hack what isn't there.\\n  So I would ask, at this point in time, rather than continue to extol \\nthe virtues of the College Transparency Act, I would ask all the \\nMembers to look at the act. We have a number of cosponsors at this \\npoint in time that I am very proud of. It is a bipartisan bill. I would \\nask them to look at the act, look at what it is achieving, and if they \\nhave questions, let's hear those questions, and let's make an effort to \\nmove this forward.\\n  We are already well into the decisionmaking process for young people \\nto go to a postsecondary education program next year.

Mr. Speaker, last week, I congratulated \\nSt. Marys Area High School student Michelle Bauer on winning first \\nplace in the 34th annual Pennsylvania Municipal League high school \\nessay contest.\\n  Participants were asked to reflect on the theme ``Civics and You'' by \\nwriting about opportunities in their community that allow for civic \\nengagement and encourage citizens to volunteer to help with local \\nchallenges.\\n  Today, I would like to share a portion of Michelle's essay:\\n  ``When I hear the word `civic,' I think of governmental duties. I \\nunderstand my duty as an American citizen to vote, obey laws, pay \\ntaxes, and serve on juries. These activities all involve one person: \\nyourself. In reality, our civic engagement as Americans expands beyond \\na single individual and encompasses entire communities. The definition \\nof a civic engagement is an activity that includes both paid and unpaid \\nforms of political activism, environmentalism, and service. As I look \\nat my community, it is apparent that we have a lot of civic \\nengagements.\\n  ``As with most towns, mine has a city council that holds meetings and \\nelections for positions on the council. These elections are open to \\nevery member of the city and are an excellent way for citizens to have \\na say in the politics of the town. Just as the elections are open to \\nall citizens so are the weekly meetings. A unique feature about my \\ntown's council meetings is that they are televised on a local channel. \\nFor individuals who are unable to physically be present at the meeting \\nor have commitments that require attention, this televised version \\nprovides a perfect solution to keep abreast of the issues affecting our \\ncitizens.\\n  ``Along with a local city council, it is also a civic duty of \\nindividuals in my community to vote and participate in elections and \\nmeetings at the school district level. Anyone is able to run for a \\nposition on the school board as well as attend the meetings. For me, \\nour school board is a great way of civic involvement because the board \\nis interested in new opportunities that can be incorporated into the \\neducation of our youth. Just recently, I attended a board meeting where \\nthe topic of robots was discussed. As a member of a small competition \\ngroup, we were able to present our success and the benefit of \\ncurriculum that includes new technology. One month later, it was \\nannounced that a robotics class will be offered in the upcoming school \\nyear. This will allow even more students to enhance their education and \\nperhaps encourage new career choices.\\n  ``In my community, the civic engagements do not stop on the political \\nlevel. One of the most prominent forms of civic engagement I see in my \\ncommunity that is not related to politics is the placing of wreaths on \\nthe gravestones of fallen soldiers for Memorial Day. Citizens from all \\nover town come together the weekend before Memorial Day and walk \\nthrough the entire cemetery adorning and honoring the heroes of our \\ncountry. This event is not for publicity or money but instead is for \\nrespecting our veterans. Additionally, it is for the betterment of our \\ncommunity by presenting a beautiful scene to those passing by.''\\n  Michelle goes on to write:\\n  ``Onlookers can also be mesmerized by the beauty of the mountainous \\nrural area. Unfortunately, garbage and litter on the side of roads and \\nhighways is so commonplace that most individuals do not even do a \\ndouble-take when they see it. The highway through my town is an area \\nwhere individuals think it is acceptable to throw garbage out of their \\nvehicles or litter the sides of the road with cigarette butts and \\nwrappers. For the past 7 years, I have been a part of the National \\nHonor Society highway cleanup. Every spring and fall, the society walks \\nthe sides of the roads picking up trash and making our town look \\nbeautiful.''\\n  Mr. Speaker, this is just a portion of Michelle's essay, and I \\ninclude in the Record the full essay.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  34th Annual Pennsylvania Municipal League High School Essay Contest \\n                                 Winner\\n\\n\\n1st Place High School Essay Winner: Michelle Bauer--St. Marys Area High \\n                                 School\\n\\n       When I hear the word civic, I think of governmental duties. \\n     I understand my duty as an American citizen to vote, obey \\n     laws, pay taxes, and serve on juries.

The definition of a civic \\n     engagement is an activity that includes both paid and unpaid \\n     forms of political activism, environmentalism, and service. \\n     As I look at my community, it is apparent that we have a lot \\n     of civic engagements.\\n       As with most towns, mine has a city council that holds \\n     meetings and elections for positions on the council. These \\n     elections are open to every member of the city and are an \\n     excellent way for citizens to have a say in the politics of \\n     the town. Just as the elections are open to all citizens so \\n     are the weekly meetings. A unique feature about my town's \\n     council meetings is that they are televised on a local \\n     channel. For individuals who are unable to physically be \\n     present at the meeting or have commitments that require \\n     attention, this televised version provides a perfect solution \\n     to keep abreast of the issues affecting our citizens.\\n       Along with a local city council, it is also a civic duty of \\n     individuals in my community to vote and participate in \\n     elections and meetings at the school district level. Anyone \\n     is able to run for a position on the school board as well as \\n     attend the meetings. For me, our school board is a great way \\n     for civic involvement because the board is interested in new \\n     opportunities that can be incorporated into the education of \\n     our youth. Just recently, I attended a board meeting where \\n     the topic of robots was discussed. As a member of a small \\n     competition group, we were able to present our success and \\n     the benefit of curriculum that includes new technology. One \\n     month later, it was announced that a robotics class will be \\n     offered in the upcoming school year. This will allow even \\n     more students to enhance their education and perhaps \\n     encourage new career choices.\\n       In my community, the civic engagements do not stop on the \\n     political level. One of the most prominent forms of civic \\n     engagement I see in my community that is not related to \\n     politics is the placing of wreaths on the gravestones of \\n     fallen soldiers for Memorial Day. Citizens from all over town \\n     come together the weekend before Memorial Day and walk \\n     through the entire cemetery adorning and honoring the heroes \\n     of our country. This event is not for publicity or money but \\n     instead is for respecting our veterans. Additionally, it is \\n     for the betterment of our community by presenting a beautiful \\n     scene to those passing by.\\n       Onlookers can also be mesmerized by the beauty of the \\n     mountainous rural area. Unfortunately, garbage and litter on \\n     the side of roads and highways is so commonplace that most \\n     individuals do not even do a double-take when they see it. \\n     The highway through my town is an area where individuals \\n     think it is acceptable to throw garbage out of their vehicles \\n     or litter the sides of the road with cigarette butts and \\n     wrappers. For the past seven years, I have been a part of the \\n     National Honor Society highway cleanup. Every spring and \\n     fall, the society walks the sides of the roads picking up \\n     trash and making our town look beautiful.\\n       Volunteering to pick up the litter is not the only way to \\n     carry out civic responsibility. Everybody has either \\n     witnessed or directly experienced an accident or fire that \\n     required the assistance of a fire department. The fire \\n     department is a critical part of a city keeping fires at bay \\n     and lending a hand wherever needed. In my community, these \\n     people work tirelessly day in and day out for the good of the \\n     community. Much of their assistance is not what would be \\n     depicted as heroic but rather, responding to flooding issues, \\n     weather related emergencies, traffic control, helicopter \\n     landing zones, and searching for missing hunters in addition \\n     to the rescue and fire calls. They are all volunteers that \\n     give up their precious time as a civic duty to their \\n     community without expecting recognition. We, the rest of the \\n     community, have a duty to help support these people. One of \\n     the best ways to do this is to attend their pancake \\n     breakfasts that are used as a fundraiser. I am not a huge fan \\n     of pancakes and sausage so instead of helping the \\n     firefighters out by purchasing a meal, I volunteer to serve \\n     the meals to customers. It is the civic duty of individuals \\n     in my city to attend this pancake breakfast and show support \\n     to the members of this department who tirelessly serve and \\n     assist us.\\n       Reporting for standby at a yearly event in July is another \\n     aspect of service that our firefighters join their community \\n     for. There are loud BOOMS echoing across the city and \\n     suddenly bright orbs of colorful lights bursting in the sky. \\n     This grand spectacle entrances onlookers for half an hour \\n     with its bright lights and fun designs. A Fourth of July \\n     fireworks display like this costs money. Every year, our city \\n     struggles to come up with the funds needed to purchase \\n     fireworks. Businesses around the town make it their civic \\n     duty to help by setting out donation cans in their \\n     businesses. The local Dairy Queen even has a day where 30% of \\n     the profits from every blizzard purchased go to the city \\n     fireworks fund. As citizens in the community, it is our duty \\n     to go to Dairy Queen on this day and purchase a blizzard as \\n     well as make donations in the cans set up at local \\n     businesses. Eating ice cream is certainly an enjoyable way to \\n     carry out a civic duty. The July show has been an important \\n     part of our community for many years thanks to the numerous \\n     supporters.\\n       We have many such events traced back in our records. Local \\n     history is like the heart of the human body. It shapes us, \\n     powers our being, and makes us unique. Without history, \\n     individuals would not even be alive. A great example would be \\n     the Forty-Second Pennsylvania Volunteer Regiment (Bucktails) \\n     who were part of the Civil War. These rugged woodsmen were \\n     skilled marksmen and ideally suited to the challenges of \\n     battle. Stories say that this group was so influential in \\n     fighting the war at Gettysburg that the entire outcome could \\n     have been different without them. The grit and determination \\n     of our local ancestors remains in current day lineage within \\n     our community. By knowing local history, members of the \\n     community have a sense of pride and can even feel at ease \\n     understanding that future generations will uphold the same \\n     virtues. My town has a Historical Society that is free to \\n     enter and accepts donations of local artifacts and history. \\n     As a member of the community, it is my civic engagement to \\n     donate any pieces of history I have so that others may \\n     benefit from it as well. It is also the duty of our community \\n     to visit the Historical Society and learn about our heritage \\n     and how we can use the skills of our people to better our \\n     society just like the Bucktails did in the Civil War.\\n       Civic engagements are abundant in our community. From the \\n     local fireman's pancake breakfast to the city council \\n     meetings, civic activities are occurring all around us. It is \\n     the obligation of the citizens to engage in these activities \\n     to assist with local challenges and create a better community \\n     for all of its members.\\n\", u'turn': 1, u'speaker': u'Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania', u'itemno': 1}, {u'kind': u'speech', u'speaker_bioguide': u'T000467', u'text': u\"  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania.

Mr. Speaker, this is the final amendment to the bill, \\nwhich will not kill it or send it back to committee. If adopted, the \\nbill will immediately proceed to final passage, as amended.\\n  Mr. Speaker, schools and counties across rural America are facing a \\nfunding and economic crisis. It has now been over 2 years since \\nCongress has failed to reauthorize the Secure Rural Schools program. \\nThis is beyond unacceptable.\\n  Schools and counties across rural America are facing a funding and \\neconomic crisis, and the reauthorization of the Secure Rural Schools \\nand Community Self-Determination Act will go a long way to helping \\nensure children get the education they need to achieve success in \\ntoday's economy.\\n  Across my district, I have heard families, teachers, and school \\nadministrators in forest counties tell me about the dire straits \\nschools will be in if SRS is not reauthorized.\\n  In Greenlee County, in eastern Arizona, the school superintendent \\nshared with me that if the county doesn't see SRS dollars, they will \\nhave to close the school that provides special education services. This \\nis after the school has already gone through major changes to save \\nmoney.\\n  Across rural Arizona, schools face issues with access to technology \\nand the educational opportunities that came with them. Reauthorizing \\nSecure Rural Schools will allow more schools to develop innovative \\neducational opportunities.\\n  In Yavapai County, where they are using distance learning, schools \\ncan share teachers. Making sure that students don't miss opportunities \\nbecause they live in rural America is the right thing to do, and \\nreauthorizing SRS will better enable coordination and support for \\nstudents.\\n  Mr. Speaker, the people of rural Arizona and America are tough and \\ninnovative, but the simple fact is that they need resources to keep \\nschools open and educate children. It is past time that we reauthorize \\nSRS, and I call on my colleagues to do so today.\\n  Across rural America and rural Arizona, the need for infrastructure \\nis only growing. In Gila County, a bridge is needed to make it safer \\nfor residents to cross a creek. SRS funding would make it possible for \\nthe county to make a greater contribution to get the project completed.\\n  If we are serious about passing a bipartisan infrastructure plan, it \\nis critical that we make sure that local communities can begin \\nplanning. Reauthorizing SRS would allow that to happen.\\n  Nationally, there are 720 counties and 4,400 school districts that \\ndepend on Secure Rural Schools for education, as well as other critical \\nservices and programs, like law enforcement and infrastructure.\\n  Rural America is ready for a renaissance, but for it to happen, we \\nneed to make sure that folks have equal access to opportunities in \\nschool and in the workforce. That means that we need to guarantee that \\nschools have the resources that they need to educate our children and \\nachieve their potential. That means we need to make sure that \\ncommunities have infrastructure that supports local economies and keeps \\npeople safe. That means we need to make sure that rural Americans have \\na fair shot.\\n\\n\\n  Mr. Speaker, I call on my colleagues to support my commonsense \\namendment on behalf of kids across rural America.\\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\", u'turn': 24, u'speaker': u\"Mr. O'HALLERAN\", u'itemno': 46}, {u'kind': u'speech', u'speaker_bioguide': u'B001250', u'text': u'  Mr. BISHOP of Utah.

I understand how significant and important it is.\\n  The issue, though, for Secure Rural Schools is not the \\nreauthorization, it is finding a funding stream to keep it going. \\nUnfortunately, this amendment doesn't solve the problem. It is not \\nreauthorization, it is the funding, and this provides no funding \\nwhatsoever. It doesn't do what we need to do. It simply is another \\ndelay tactic.\\n  And let's face it, we are dealing with more significant issues in \\nthis Nation, like who is going to win game seven tonight. That is \\nimportant stuff.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and \\ncongratulate Deidre DeJear on being named the Iowa Small Business \\nAdministration Minority Business Champion of the Year.\\n  Each year, during National Small Business Week, the Iowa Small \\nBusiness Administration announces winners of the Iowa Small Business \\nWeek Awards. Deidre is the president of the business marketing company \\nCaleo Enterprises. She's also a passionate advocate for low- to \\nmoderate-income individuals and families, helping to strengthen their \\nfinancial opportunities and knowledge. She led the United Way of \\nCentral Iowa's Financial Capability project, where since 2012 over \\n20,000 people have gained access to financial systems and improved \\ntheir financial management skills.

This bill would rescind \\ncriminal jurisdiction from the State of Iowa over crimes committed by \\nor against members of the Sac and Fox Tribe on their lands. In doing \\nso, the Tribe or the Federal Government would exercise exclusive \\njurisdiction under the Major Crimes Act. This is the most common legal \\nsituation for most tribes in America today.\\n  In 1948, Congress granted jurisdiction over all crimes committed by \\nor against Indians on the Sac and Fox Reservation to the State of Iowa. \\nIn 1949, there was no mechanism in the Federal Government concerning \\ncriminal jurisdiction on the Tribe's land, and up until that point, the \\nTribe had largely policed themselves.\\n  Today, the Federal Government has criminal statutory authority on \\nIndian lands, the Tribe is again ready to police itself, and the State \\nof Iowa has\\n\\n\\nagreed that its Federal grant of criminal jurisdiction can be repealed.\\n  Accordingly, under H.R. 1074, the Federal Government will have \\ncriminal jurisdiction over crimes, especially major crimes, by or \\nagainst Indians on the Tribe's lands. The Tribe would have jurisdiction \\nover Indian offenders for crimes over which it exercises jurisdiction, \\nand the State of Iowa would retain exclusive jurisdiction over crimes \\nwhere both offender and victim are non-Indians.\\n  I thank the sponsor of H.R. 1074, the gentleman from Iowa (Mr. Blum), \\nfor his work on this bill, and I urge adoption of the measure.\\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\", u'turn': 4, u'speaker': u'Mr. COOK', u'itemno': 12}, {u'kind': u'speech', u'speaker_bioguide': u'T000474', u'text': u'  Mrs. TORRES. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\\n  There are laws on the books that stand in the way of true tribal \\nself-determination and self-governance. One of those laws is Public Law \\n80-846, known commonly as the 1948 Act. The 1948 Act targeted only one \\ntribe, the Sac and Fox Tribe of the Mississippi in Iowa, also known as \\nthe Meskwaki Nation, and gave the State of Iowa criminal jurisdiction \\nover their tribal lands.\\n  In 1948, the Nation did not have a formal mechanism for law \\nenforcement and was not in a financial position to create one. This was \\nused as the rationale for the stripping of these jurisdictional rights. \\nBut this has not been the case for many years. The Tribe has a full-\\ntime police department as well as a fully functioning court system.\\n  The continued existence of the 1948 Act has resulted in an unfair \\nsystem of crimes committed on Meskwaki land, whereby a Native-American \\ndefendant must face the possibility of two prosecutions, State and \\nTribal, but a non-Native defendant faces only State prosecution.\\n  That is why I join my colleagues in supporting H.R. 1074. By passing \\nthis bill and repealing the 1948 Act, we will remove the inequity it \\nhas created, and bring the Meskwaki Nation in line with how criminal \\njurisdiction issues are addressed on other Native lands.\\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the adoption of H.R. \\n1074, and I reserve the balance of my time.', u'turn': 5, u'speaker': u'Mrs. TORRES', u'itemno': 13}, {u'kind': u'speech', u'speaker_bioguide': u'C001094', u'text': u'  Mr. COOK.

Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from California for \\nyielding and for his time managing today's floor debate.\\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 1074, a bill I first \\nintroduced in the 114th Congress, which would repeal a 1948 law that \\ngranted the State of Iowa criminal jurisdiction over offenses committed \\nby or against members of the Sac and Fox Tribe of the Mississippi in \\nIowa.\\n  Prior to this 1948 law, the Tribe had largely policed itself, and \\nthere was little, if any, Federal law enforcement on the Tribe's land.\\n  Historically, determining who may exercise jurisdiction over crime in \\ntribal communities is complex. Generally, crimes committed by or \\nagainst Indians in Indian Country are under the jurisdiction of the \\nUnited States, pursuant to various Federal statutes. The 1948 Act was \\npassed at a time when the Federal Government was attempting to shift \\nits responsibility and obligations from tribes to the respective \\nStates.\\n  In 1953, Congress passed a law, commonly called Public Law 280, \\ntransferring criminal jurisdiction over all crimes, regardless of the \\nIndian status of the offender or victim, in Indian Country of six \\nStates from the Federal Government to those States. Even though Iowa \\nwas not one of those States, for years it has been treated as if it \\nwere a Public Law 280 State.\\n\\n  With respect to the law enforcement on the settlement today, a lot \\nhas changed since 1948. Today, the Tribe has a fully-functional \\ncriminal justice system, which includes a full-time police department \\nwhose officers are certified by the State of Iowa. The Tribe maintains \\nand employs law-trained judges and a prosecutor who, together with a \\nprobation department, handle all criminal cases which arise on tribal \\nlands.\\n  H.R. 1074, and its Senate companion bill, have bipartisan support \\nfrom the entire Iowa delegation, as well as the support of the Iowa \\nState Legislature, which passed legislation signed by then-Governor \\nTerry Branstad in April 2016, that began this process of conferring \\njurisdiction to the Tribe and the Department of Justice.\\n  As my friend from California previously mentioned, the entirety of \\nthe Meskwaki Settlement is located in Tama County, Iowa, in my \\ndistrict. Since I have come to Washington, I have gotten to know the \\nSac and Fox Tribal Council and their representatives, and I was happy \\nto first introduce this bill in 2016 after its approval by then-\\nGovernor Branstad.\\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge the adoption of this bill, and I hope it \\ncontinues to move through the legislative process so that the Tribe may \\nonce again have jurisdiction over many of the crimes committed against \\ntheir members on their land, and restore another portion of the Tribe's \\nsovereignty, which has been removed since 1948.\", u'turn': 7, u'speaker': u'Mr. BLUM', u'itemno': 15}, {u'kind': u'speech', u'speaker_bioguide': u'T000474', u'text': u'  Mrs. TORRES.

Mr. Speaker, I rise to talk about a job-killer tax bill \\nthat is coming to Congress this week, and if you don't watch out, it \\ncould be coming to your hometown soon.\\n  Up until yesterday, Mr. Speaker, I thought the new GOP tax plan was \\njust run-of-the-mill, upside-down class warfare waged by the wealthiest \\npeople in the country against everybody else. I knew 80 percent of the \\nwindfall of the tax cut would go to people making $912,000 a year or \\nmore--the richest 1 percent of the country. I knew it would repeal the \\nalternative minimum tax, the only reason that Donald Trump paid any \\ntaxes at all in the 1 year we know he paid taxes over the last few \\ndecades in 2005. I knew it would repeal the State and local income tax \\ndeduction, which would be terrible news for tens of millions of middle \\nclass people in States across the country, including mine in Maryland.\\n  I knew it would repeal the estate tax which only affects the \\nwealthiest one-half of 1 percent of the country. All of these \\nprovisions would help to create a\\n\\n\\nhereditary oligarchical elite like the hereditary oligarchical elite in \\nRussia today.\\n\\n  This huge penthouse suite party will be paid for by the rest of us \\nand blow a record-smashing $2 trillion deficit hole into our economy \\nand programs like Medicare and Medicaid. I knew all of this. It is \\npredictable enough.\\n  But then I noticed a provision yesterday that is absolutely \\ngobstopping, shocking, startling, eye-popping, unbelievable in the GOP \\ntax blueprint. It is called the territorial system, and what it means \\nis simple. We will tax American businesses only when their operations \\nare here in America. Here is what that means: if I am a businessman and \\nI am going to set up a manufacturing plant on main street in my \\nhometown, I have to pay the full freight of taxes. I pay everything.\\n  If I set my business, my new manufacturing plant, up in Mexico, or \\nBangladesh, or Ireland, I pay zero taxes. Let me repeat that: if I \\ndecide to set up my business in America, I pay 100 percent of the taxes \\nI am going to owe. If I decide to relocate my business and all of the \\njobs abroad, I will pay zero taxes. That works even if I have already \\ngot the business in place here and I decide to ship everything \\noverseas. Suddenly, I get a 100 percent tax break for all the profits \\nthat I earn overseas.\\n  Mr. Speaker, perhaps I misunderstand it. I am not a professor of tax \\nlaw. I am a professor of constitutional law. So maybe I am not \\ninterpreting it right. I would love nothing more than for one of my \\ncolleagues from the other side of the aisle to get up and tell me it is \\nnot true, and correct me, and explain what I have got wrong.\\n  But if I have got it right, this shocking provision tucked into the \\nbill that we are about to see is a job killer, a national emergency, \\nand a dagger pointed at the heart of the American economy and our jobs. \\nIt is only a few, small, big businesses, a few big businesses that will \\nbenefit.\\n  Small businesses are not going to be benefited at all. The small \\nbusinesses do not set up tax-dodging corporate subsidiaries in the \\nCayman Islands, or the Bahamas, or in Ireland. They don't ship \\noverseas. So this is for a tiny percentage of the largest corporations \\nin America, leaving the small businesses behind and taking millions of \\nAmerican jobs with them.\\n  Why would the majority do this to us when Donald Trump campaigned on \\na platform of putting America first and promising to bring American \\njobs back home--not export millions more with a devastating tax plan?\\n  Now I see why they are hurdling this through Congress. In 1986, with \\nthe tax reform plan, there were 63 days of hearings, and more than 450 \\nwitnesses in Ways and Means and the Senate Finance Committee. It took 2 \\nyears and 10 months. This plan they want to slam through Congress in \\nless than 2 weeks, with barely any witnesses, maybe no hearings, maybe \\none or two hearings; and you know why? Because they are tucking the \\nmost massive job-killing provision anyone has ever seen into this bill.\\n  If anything, we should be imposing higher taxes on those businesses \\nthat ship our jobs overseas--not lower taxes--or they should pay the \\nsame. But this plan would wipe out any taxes at all, and it is \\ndumbfounding that they would think this is something that Congress \\nwould put up with--just like they tried to slam through Congress the \\nACA repeal and we stopped it when people got the word.\\n  We have got to make sure, Mr. Speaker, that every American \\nunderstands what is really in this tax bill coming our way.\\n\", u'turn': 1, u'speaker': u'Mr. RASKIN', u'itemno': 1}, {u'kind': u'linebreak', u'speaker_bioguide': None, u'text': u'                          ____________________\\n\\n\\n', u'turn': -1, u'speaker': u'None', u'itemno': 2}], u'header': {u'extension': False, u'vol': u'163', u'wkday': u'Wednesday', u'chamber': u'House', u'num': u'177', u'year': u'2017', u'month': u'November', u'pages': u'H8304-H8305', u'day': u'1'}, u'doc_title': u'AMERICANS BEWARE OF TAX BILL', u'id': u'CREC-2017-11-01-pt1-PgH8304-2', u'title': u'AMERICANS BEWARE OF TAX BILL'}{u'content': [{u'kind': u'speech', u'speaker_bioguide': u'M000355', u'text': u\"  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, today I wish to congratulate Brig. Gen. \\nSteven P. Bullard of the Kentucky Air National Guard as he begins his \\nretirement after more than three decades of achievement, service, and \\nsacrifice. This Nation and the Commonwealth of Kentucky thank him for \\nhis diligence in defending our safety and security.\\n  Brigadier General Bullard has served as the chief of staff, \\nHeadquarters, for the Kentucky Air National Guard and the deputy chief \\nof the Joint Staff, Joint Force Headquarters-Kentucky National Guard \\nsince 2012. In these roles, he has been responsible for the guidance \\nand direction of more than 8,500 Army and Air Guardsman in my home \\nState. Brigadier General Bullard has skillfully carried out his \\nresponsibilities in these positions, as well as the duties of his \\ncivilian role as director of the division of administrative services \\nwithin the Kentucky Department of Military Affairs.\\n  On numerous projects, he was the critical link between my office and \\nthe Kentucky Guard. I know that many on my staff who have had the \\nprivilege of interacting with him have appreciated Brigadier General \\nBullard's dependability and talent, which I am told also extends to the \\ngolf course.\\n  Entering officer training school at Lackland Air Force Base in 1985, \\nBrigadier General Bullard took the first steps of his decorated \\nmilitary career. He later achieved the rating of master navigator, \\nhaving completed more than 5,500 flight hours on various aircraft. Over \\nthe years, Brigadier General Bullard flew missions in 75 countries, \\nincluding a deployment to Afghanistan during Operation Enduring \\nFreedom. One might think that, with such aviation skill, he would have \\nmore luck traveling as a passenger on commercial air, but his \\ncolleagues report that throughout his career, a number of commercial \\nflights he has traveled on have experienced weather or maintenance \\ndelays resulting in numerous nights in the airport for the trained \\nairman.\\n  Brigadier General Bullard has earned and been awarded numerous \\nmilitary awards and decorations for his selfless service to the \\nCommonwealth and his Nation. These honors include the Bronze Star \\nMedal, the Meritorious Service Medal with two bronze oakleaf clusters, \\nthe Air Medal with one bronze oakleaf cluster, and the Kentucky \\nDistinguished Service Medal. These awards are recognition of Brigadier \\nGeneral Bullard's distinguished actions on behalf of our Nation and \\nKentucky.\\n  The men and women of Kentucky's National Guard serve a unique mission \\nin our Armed Forces. Their efforts to help fight our Nation's wars, \\ndefend our homeland, provide relief from natural disasters, and \\nmaintain critical State, Federal, and international partnerships in \\nsupport of our Nation's safety and security have demonstrated the vital \\nnature of the National Guard's service. I am proud to represent them in \\nthe U.S. Senate, and I am grateful for their sacrifice on behalf of our \\nCommonwealth and our Nation.\\n  As we celebrate Brigadier General Bullard's retirement, we are also \\nsaddened to lose such a capable and dedicated public servant. In \\naddition to his responsibilities at headquarters, Brigadier General \\nBullard has also worked as the chairman of the Louisville Armed Forces \\nCommittee, two terms as the president of the National Guard Association \\nof Kentucky, and as the volunteer executive director of the Kentucky \\nCommittee for Employer Support of the Guard and Reserve. On behalf of \\nthe people of Kentucky, I would like to thank him for his 32 years of \\nachievement and service. He has earned a relaxing retirement, spending \\ntime with his family and friends. Finally, I would ask my colleagues in \\nthe Senate to join me in paying tribute to Brigadier General Bullard, a \\nbrave American, a selfless public servant, and a proud Kentuckian.\\n\", u'turn': 0, u'speaker': u'Mr. McCONNELL', u'itemno': 0}, {u'kind': u'linebreak', u'speaker_bioguide': None, u'text': u'                          ____________________\\n\\n\\n', u'turn': -1, u'speaker': u'None', u'itemno': 1}], u'header': {u'extension': False, u'vol': u'163', u'wkday': u'Wednesday', u'chamber': u'Senate', u'num': u'177', u'year': u'2017', u'month': u'November', u'pages': u'S6964', u'day': u'1'}, u'doc_title': u'TRIBUTE TO BRIGADIER GENERAL STEVEN P.

Mr. President, Dr. Glenn Poshard has served the United \\nStates in many ways. He served in the military and taught in high \\nschool. He represented rural southern Illinois in the Illinois State \\nSenate from 1984 to\\n\\n\\n1988 and in Congress from 1989 to 1998. I served with him for 8 years \\nin the House of Representatives.\\n  Glenn was a strong proponent of campaign finance reform so much so \\nthat he limited individual donations and refused contributions from \\npolitical action committees when he ran for Governor in 1998.\\n  Following his tenure in Congress, Glenn and his wife, Jo, founded the \\nPoshard Foundation for Abused Children. The foundation has helped the \\nabused, abandoned, and neglected children of southern Illinois for 18 \\nyears.\\n  Glenn's service to the community also continued through his role as \\npresident of Southern Illinois University where he was the second \\nlongest serving president in the history of the Southern Illinois \\nUniversity system.\\n  Earlier this month, Glenn reminded us what service to our country and \\nwhat the American flag means for us in an op-ed in the Southern \\nIllinoisan, which I have included here.\\n  Dr. Poshard wrote:\\n\\n       In 1962, I joined the U.S. Army on my 17th birthday. I had \\n     just graduated from high school and was following in the \\n     tradition of my family's military service. They had served in \\n     the Civil War and fought their way across Europe and the \\n     Pacific in two World Wars. Some were POWs and one, my first \\n     cousin and closest friend, Dennis, awarded the Bronze Star \\n     for bravery in Vietnam, was the first young man from our \\n     county to be killed in that war.\\n       During my three years of enlistment, I served a tour of \\n     duty with the First Cav Division in Korea. When my active \\n     duty was finished in December 1965, I immediately entered SIU \\n     Carbondale on the GI Bill. Protests against the Vietnam War \\n     were already gripping the campus. They were abhorrent to me, \\n     particularly when the American flag was used to symbolize \\n     anger toward the government. But I was busy, carrying a full \\n     load of classes, working three part-time jobs, and trying to \\n     support a new family. By the time Old Main burned and the \\n     campus closed in the spring of 1970, I was beyond anger for \\n     the thousands of protesters desecrating our flag and \\n     destroying my beloved university.\\n       I made no attempt to understand the difference between the \\n     symbolism of the flag and the substance of the Bill of Rights \\n     as it pertained to freedom to speak against perceived wrongs \\n     of our government.\\n       Years later, as a member of Congress, I was forced to \\n     grapple with this volatile issue again. In my first term, a \\n     bill was submitted to amend the Constitution prohibiting the \\n     desecration of the American flag as a means of protest \\n     against our government. Now, I had to understand this issue \\n     in its deepest, broadest context. My family and I went to \\n     Philadelphia where I sat in Independence Hall, contemplating \\n     those early debates of our forefathers on issues of equality, \\n     justice and freedom. Moved to tears, I was about to cast a \\n     vote of which the historical significance reached back to \\n     arguments which formed the founding documents of our country, \\n     the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution.\\n       We drove to Gettysburg and I stood where our greatest \\n     President, Abraham Lincoln, delivered his address, taking us \\n     back to our Declaration of Independence, which stated, ``All \\n     men are created equal and endowed by their Creator with \\n     certain unalienable rights, and that among these are life, \\n     liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.'' When our forefathers \\n     thought they had been denied these rights long enough by the \\n     King of England, they fought a Revolutionary War to gain \\n     them. And they fought a Civil War to extend those rights to \\n     slaves. Over the next 100 years, they fought all over the \\n     world to secure these rights for other people.\\n       President Kennedy spoke of this in his inaugural address. \\n     He said, ``These same revolutionary beliefs for which our \\n     forefathers fought are still at issue around the globe today. \\n     The belief that the rights of man come not from the \\n     generosity of the State, but from the hand of God. We dare \\n     not forget that we are the heirs of that first Revolution.'' \\n     The Declaration goes on to say that when any form of \\n     government becomes destructive of these rights then it is the \\n     right of the people to protest and alter that form of \\n     government so that those rights are secured to the people. \\n     And in the 1960s and '70s, people protested against what they \\n     believed was an unjust war which imperiled their lives, their \\n     freedoms, and their pursuit of happiness. They believed that \\n     nearly 60,000 deaths were enough in a war our government \\n     either could not or would not win.\\n       When hundreds of thousands of mostly white young men in the \\n     '60s and thousands of mostly black young men today protest \\n     against their government, it is because they feel their God-\\n     given rights are threatened. But why involve the flag? In a \\n     Supreme Court decision, Board of Education v. Barnett in \\n     1943, Justice Jackson wrote words especially relevant to this \\n     issue. He said, ``Freedom to differ is not limited to things \\n     that do not matter much. That would be a mere shadow of \\n     freedom. The test of freedom's substance is the right to \\n     differ as to things that touch the heart of the existing \\n     order''--i.e. our flag.\\n       For many, it is not enough to write a letter to their \\n     congressman, attend a meeting or participate in a march. They \\n     must take the most important thing symbolizing our freedom--\\n     the flag--and cast it at the feet of their government to show \\n     how emphatically they disagree with government allowing the \\n     infringement of their rights. Millions of people of color in \\n     our country today feel threatened. They just want to enjoy \\n     the same security and freedom we all enjoy and the flag has \\n     become central to their protest precisely because it matters, \\n     as it did in the '60s to an earlier generation.\\n       When I protested as a young man in my church that it was \\n     not necessary for God to send His only Son to be sacrificed \\n     for my freedom, that He could have provided another way, the \\n     pastor said, ``Oh yes it was, because He could not win your \\n     freedom from sin by sacrificing that which didn't matter \\n     much, He had to sacrifice the most important thing He loved, \\n     His Son.''\\n       The Supreme Court has said that the use of the flag in \\n     dissent against the government does not diminish it or the \\n     contribution of the men and women who fought for our freedom, \\n     but instead stands as a powerful symbol to illustrate the \\n     substance of our Constitution's Bill of Rights.\\n       I listened carefully to the debate in 1990 on the flag \\n     desecration amendment which for the first time in 200 years \\n     would have amended our Bill of Rights. These words from \\n     President Reagan's solicitor general, Charles Fried, express \\n     my beliefs entirely. ``The flag, as all in this debate agree, \\n     symbolizes our nation, its history, its values. We love the \\n     flag because it symbolizes the United States; but we must \\n     love the Constitution even more, because the Constitution is \\n     not a symbol. It is the thing itself.''\\n\\n  Reading Glenn's op-ed, I was reminded of the late John Glenn, \\ncolleague, friend, and legend. He testified to the Senate Judiciary \\nCommittee in 2004 about the flag of the United States. This is a man \\nwho carried the flag into space as an astronaut. He served in the \\nMarine Corps. When presented with a flag-burning amendment, he said, \\n``It would be a hollow victory indeed if we preserved the symbol of our \\nfreedoms by chipping away at those fundamental freedoms themselves.''\\n  Free speech is the bedrock of our democracy. As millions of Americans \\nare participating in the freedoms guaranteed by our Constitution today, \\nwe should remember Glenn Porshard's point that they do so not to \\ndestroy our Republic, but to celebrate the strength of our \\nConstitution.\\n  Thank you.\\n  (At the request of Mr. Schumer, the following statement was ordered \\nto be printed in the Record.)\\n\", u'turn': 0, u'speaker': u'Mr. DURBIN', u'itemno': 0}, {u'kind': u'linebreak', u'speaker_bioguide': None, u'text': u'                          ____________________\\n\\n\\n', u'turn': -1, u'speaker': u'None', u'itemno': 1}], u'header': {u'extension': False, u'vol': u'163', u'wkday': u'Wednesday', u'chamber': u'Senate', u'num': u'177', u'year': u'2017', u'month': u'November', u'pages': u'S6964-S6965', u'day': u'1'}, u'doc_title': u'TRIBUTE TO DR.

Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\\n  Mr. Speaker, H.R. 1488 would redesignate Indiana Dunes National \\nLakeshore as Indiana Dunes National Park.\\n  Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore was established by Congress in 1966. \\nThe designation of the national lakeshore as a unit of the National \\nPark Service was the culmination of decades of work by \\nconservationists, area residents, and elected officials.\\n  The original law included 8,330 acres of land and water. The National \\nPark Service conservation advocates continued to seek expansion of the \\nboundaries, and five subsequent laws increased the size of the national \\nlakeshore to more than 15,000 acres.\\n  In October 1916, shortly after the National Park Service was \\nestablished, NPS Director Stephen Mather held hearings in Chicago to \\ngauge public sentiment on a Sand Dunes National Park. In a Department \\nof the Interior report published after the hearings, Director Mather \\nstated: ``No national park or other Federal reservation offers this \\nphenomenon for the pleasure and edification of the people, and no \\nnational park is as accessible. Furthermore, the dunes offer to the \\nvisitor extraordinary scenery, a large variety of plant life, \\nmagnificent bathing beaches, and splendid opportunities to camp and \\nlive in the wild close to nature.''\\n  Despite Director Mather's support, the national park proposal was \\nabandoned at the onset of World War I, and\\n\\n\\nseveral years later, in 1925, Indiana Dunes State Park was established. \\nRedesignation of the national lakeside as a national park would make \\nIndiana Dunes the 60th national park in the United States.\\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\", u'turn': 4, u'speaker': u'Mr. COOK', u'itemno': 12}, {u'kind': u'speech', u'speaker_bioguide': u'T000474', u'text': u\"  Mrs. TORRES. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak on H.R. 1488, the Indiana Dunes \\nNational Park Act. This act seeks to rename the Indiana Dunes National \\nLakeshore to the Indiana Dunes National Park, one of the over 400 units \\nof the National Park System.\\n  Upon successful redesignation, the Indiana Dunes National Park would \\nbecome the 60th national park, areas which are known for their variety \\nof resources, for encompassing large land and water areas, and for \\nproviding protection of resources within their boundaries.\\n  Designated in 1966, Indiana Dunes protects over 15,000 acres, 50 \\nmiles of trails, and provides both summer and winter recreational \\nactivities for over 2 million visitors who trek to the lakeshore each \\nyear.\\n  When the lakeshore was admitted into the National Park System in \\n1966, it was through the hard work of President Kennedy in 1963-64 to \\ncreate a compromise for the national lakeshore and a port to promote \\nthe industrial needs of the area.\\n  Sponsors of this bill, including our esteemed colleague \\nRepresentative Visclosky, believe that renaming the lakeshore as the \\nIndiana Dunes National Park will capture the spirit and intent of the \\nfirst National Park Service Director Stephen Mather.\\n  Director Mather visited the area in 1916 and recommended the area be \\nincluded as a national park within the newly designated National Park \\nSystem. Sadly, the United States' entry into World War I precluded that \\naddition. Now, 101 years later, this bill seeks to redesignate 15,000 \\nacres of the Indiana Dunes National Park.\\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\", u'turn': 5, u'speaker': u'Mrs. TORRES', u'itemno': 13}, {u'kind': u'speech', u'speaker_bioguide': u'C001094', u'text': u'  Mr. COOK.

Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentlewoman for \\nyielding.\\n  I want to begin by thanking Chairman Bishop and Ranking Member \\nGrijalva for all of their work on this legislation, as well as Chairman \\nMcClintock and Ranking Member Hanabusa and Mrs. Torres for their \\ndiligence.\\n  Mr. Speaker, the legislation we are considering today represents a \\nvery small change--one word--but it would have an enormous benefit of \\nrightly placing the Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore where it belongs \\nas the Nation's 60th national park and the first national park in the \\nState of Indiana.\\n  As mentioned, located along the southern shore of Lake Michigan, the \\nIndiana Dunes are a natural wonder and home of a vast array of rare \\nplants. According to the National Park Service, Indiana Dunes National \\nLakeshore is the seventh most biologically diverse National Park \\nService unit.\\n  I believe the chairman and Mrs. Torres ably described the history of \\nthe dunes and its evolution. I thank them for that, and I would thank \\nall of the citizens over that half century and more that petitioned for \\nthe creation of this great park.\\n  The lakeshore currently does encompass about 15,000 acres of wetlands \\nand marshes, beaches, oak savannahs, and sand dunes. It is clear that \\nthe title of the Indiana Dunes National Park is fitting for such a \\nunique natural resource.\\n  The American taxpayers, over a number of generations, have invested \\nin the preservation of the park. It is incumbent that we do everything \\npossible to encourage citizens and travelers from around the world to \\nvisit it, to learn about it, to recreate, and to simply enjoy the \\nenvironment of northwest Indiana's lakeshore. H.R. 1488 helps to \\nachieve this goal.\\n  Mr. Speaker, I am proud that the act is supported in a bipartisan \\nfashion by the entire Indiana delegation. I would also like to thank \\nSenators Donnelly and Young, who have introduced a companion measure in \\nthe Senate.\\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support passage.\", u'turn': 8, u'speaker': u'Mr. VISCLOSKY', u'itemno': 16}, {u'kind': u'speech', u'speaker_bioguide': u'T000474', u'text': u'  Mrs. TORRES.

LTC Christ exemplifies what it means to commit his life to \\nhis country and community; he is a deserving recipient of a \\nCongressional Veteran Commendation.\\n  LTC Christ has shown sincere dedication throughout his 23 years in \\nthe Army. His commitment to serving his country can be seen through his \\nextensive list of medals, including the Southwest Asia Service Medal \\nand the Vietnam Service Medal. In addition to his superb work defending \\nour nation, LTC Christ held important leadership positions in the \\nMilitary Officers Association of America and the Association of the \\nUnited States Army.\\n  After retiring from the U.S. Army in 1992, LTC Christ continued to \\ndedicate his time to worthy causes. He has served as a city council \\nmember in the city of Harker Heights, on the Board of Directors for \\nHill Country Transit, and the Chamber of Commerce. LTC Christ lives a \\nlife dedicated to other veterans in his area by working closely with \\nthe Area Veterans Advisory Committee and by founding the Harker Heights \\nVeterans' Council. LTC Christ is thoroughly involved in many sports \\norganizations in his area, namely the Tri-County Soccer Club and the \\nT.J. Zimmerman Soccer Tournament which he holds leadership positions \\nin, as well as many other soccer associations. LTC Christ has logged \\nhundreds of volunteer hours in many organizations, including as Admiral \\nof the Texas Navy for Governor Rick Perry. Community activists like him \\nmake Central Texas a great place to live and work.\\n  I commend LTC Christ for his service to his community and country.

CHRIST, U.S. ARMY (RETIRED)'}{u'content': [{u'kind': u'speech', u'speaker_bioguide': u'G000386', u'text': u\"  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, last month the Environmental Protection \\nAgency--EPA--Administrator, Scott Pruitt, issued a directive to all \\nAgency employees that prohibits the so-called sue-and-settle process. \\nThis is good news for good government.\\n  Most of us here are familiar with the term ``sue and settle.''\\n  These are tactics whereby the EPA has, in the past, resolved certain \\nlawsuits against it through agreements negotiated behind closed doors \\nwith politically favored interest groups. As we saw under the Obama \\nadministration, some of these agreements committed the EPA to take far-\\nreaching regulatory action, all without an adequate opportunity for \\nthose people most impacted to have a seat at the table, as would \\nnormally be done through the regulatory process.\\n  Today, I come to the floor to applaud Administrator Pruitt's \\nleadership in working to end these tactics, which make a mockery of \\nlaws that Congress has put in place to ensure a transparent and \\naccountable regulatory process. The commonsense reforms outlined in \\nAdministrator Pruitt's directive will, no doubt, help restore \\ntransparency and accountability, and these reforms should stand as a \\nprime example for all Federal agencies to follow.\\n  Accordingly, I call upon President Trump to use his full authority \\nthrough Executive order to ensure that similar reforms are adopted \\nacross the entire bureaucracy. Regulatory decisions that affect key \\nparts of our economy should be made in an open, transparent, and, \\nconsequently, accountable manner. But as we have seen with sue and \\nsettle, Washington bureaucrats and their interest group pals would \\nprefer to do things their own way.\\n  It works like this. First, an interest group sues a Federal agency, \\nclaiming the agency has failed to take regulatory action required by \\nlaw. Through the lawsuit, the interest group seeks to compel the agency \\nto take action by a new, often rushed, deadline. These plaintiff \\ninterest groups often share a common regulatory agenda with the agency \\nthey sue, such as when an environmental group sues the EPA or the Fish \\nand Wildlife Service.\\n  Instead of challenging the lawsuit, the agency and the interest group \\nenter into negotiations behind closed doors to produce either a \\n``settlement agreement'' or a ``consent decree'' committing the agency \\nto take regulatory action. There is no transparency, no accountability, \\nwhich you would get through normal regulation writing.\\n  Noticeably absent from these negotiations are the very parties who \\nwill be most impacted, such as farmers, manufacturers, and even the 50 \\nStates themselves, which will be charged with enforcing some of these \\nregulations. In 2010, for example, an environmental interest group sued \\nthe Obama administration EPA to force the agency to revise certain \\nwastewater regulations.\\n  Wouldn't it be nice to have the people who are affected by those \\nregulations involved in the process in an open way--the way the \\nAdministrative Procedure Act is designed?\\n  Oddly enough, the same day the lawsuit was filed, the plaintiff \\ninterest group submitted a consent decree already signed by the EPA, \\nwhich committed the agency to take prompt regulatory action. Such a \\nscenario should raise serious questions about how truly adversarial \\nthese lawsuits and negotiations are.\\n  To add insult to injury, regulations that have resulted from sue-and-\\nsettle tactics impose tremendous costs on the American economy. \\nAccording to the American Action Forum, from 2005 to 2016, 23 sue-and-\\nsettle regulations resulted in a cost burden of $67.9 billion, with \\n$26.5 billion in actual costs. Sixteen of the rules imposed paperwork \\nburdens on American job creators of more than 8 million hours. Think \\nabout that. Nearly $70 billion in regulatory costs were imposed on \\nAmerican business owners, manufacturers, farmers, and probably \\ntaxpayers, all without due regard for transparency and the normal \\nrulemaking process required by the Administrative Procedure Act.\\n  Decades ago, Congress enacted the Administrative Procedure Act for \\nthe sole purpose of ensuring transparency, accountability, and, more \\nimportantly, public participation in Federal rulemaking. The EPA has \\nbeen described as the citizens' ``regulatory bill of rights.'' A pillar \\nof the Administrative Procedure Act is the notice-and-comment process, \\nwhich requires agencies to notify the public of proposed regulations \\nand respond to comments submitted--in other words, transparency.\\n  Rulemaking driven by sue-and-settle tactics frequently results in \\nreprioritized agency agendas and rushed deadlines for regulatory \\naction. This renders the EPA's notice-and-comment process a mere \\nformality. It deprives regulated entities, it deprives the States, and \\nmost importantly, it deprives the American public of sufficient time to \\nhave any meaningful input on final rules. The resulting regulatory \\naction is driven not by the public interest but by the special interest \\npriorities.\\n  Sue-and-settle tactics also help agencies avoid accountability for \\ntheir actions. Instead of having to answer to the public for \\ncontroversial regulatory decisions, agency officials will simply point \\nto a court order and say that their hands are tied, when really they \\nwelcomed that process.\\n  The American people deserve better, but don't just take my word for \\nit. The Environmental Council of the States, a national nonprofit, \\nnonpartisan association of State and territorial environmental agency \\nleaders, adopted a resolution in 2013 entitled ``The Need for Reform \\nand State Participation in EPA's Consent Decrees which Settle Citizen \\nSuits.'' The rationale behind it\\n\\n\\nprovides that ``state environmental agencies are not always notified of \\ncitizen suits that allege U.S. EPA's failure to perform its \\nnondiscretionary duties, are often not parties to these citizen suits, \\nand are usually not provided with an opportunity to participate in the \\nnegotiation of agreements to settle citizen suits.''\\n  The Environmental Council of the States further resolved that \\n``greater transparency of citizen suit settlement agreements is needed \\nfor the public to understand the impact of these agreements on the \\nadministration of environmental programs.''\\n  Obviously, I agree. We need more transparency, more accountability, \\nand more voices at the table. In other words, the public's business \\nought to be public, not some new regulation agreed to behind closed \\ndoors. I am happy to say that this administration is working to \\naccomplish that, thanks to Administrator Pruitt. In his own words: \\n``The days of this regulation through litigation . . . are \\nterminated.''\\n  His directive puts a swift end to sue-and-settle tactics by this one \\nagency, the EPA. It does so by adopting commonsense reforms to promote \\ntransparency and public participation in the regulatory process. It \\nrequires the publication online of notices of lawsuits filed against \\nthe EPA. It requires the EPA to reach out and notify any States or \\nregulated entities that will be affected by the lawsuit. It requires \\nthe EPA to seek the agreement of any affected State or regulatory \\nentities before the agency can enter into a consent decree or \\nsettlement agreement. Further, it prohibits the EPA from entering into \\nany consent decree or settlement that converts a discretionary duty of \\nthe agency into a mandatory duty to issue, revise, or amend a \\nregulation. Most importantly, it requires the EPA to post online for \\npublic comment any proposed consent decrees or settlement agreements \\nbefore they are entered into by the court.\\n  These and other reforms in Administrator Pruitt's directive mark a \\nvery strong step toward ensuring that States, American job creators, \\nand the public at large have a seat at the table when regulatory \\ndecisions are made, which is exactly why Congress passed the \\nAdministrative Procedure Act.\\n  Before I close, I will add one more thing. Earlier this year, I \\nintroduced the Sunshine for Regulatory Decrees and Settlements Act. \\nThis bill would make permanent the very types of reforms outlined in \\nAdministrator Pruitt's directive. If it becomes law, it can't be \\nchanged at some later date. In other words, it would ensure that future \\nadministrations can't simply roll back the great work Administrator \\nPruitt is doing through this directive.\\n  I am pleased to hear that the House of Representatives just passed \\nthe companion bill introduced by Congressman Doug Collins. We will \\ncontinue our work to build bipartisan support here in the Senate for \\nthis commonsense decree.\\n  But, today, I urge President Trump to move forward with the example \\nset by Administrator Pruitt because Administrator Pruitt is draining \\nthe swamp through this process. The President loves to sign Executive \\norders. He would probably do more good in draining the swamp by \\nproducing an Executive order like this than almost any other Executive \\norder he could do.\\n  There is simply no reason these reforms should be limited to just the \\nEPA. Transparency and public participation are core elements of a more \\naccountable government. Simply stated, they are part of the process of \\nrepresentative government, where people make the laws and where \\nadministrators carry out the laws, not where something is done behind \\nclosed doors because some special interest wants something or because \\nthe agency is begging to do something--which maybe someone doesn't want \\nthem to do--to get it done and to do it behind closed doors, just to \\nwork it out the way they want it and not necessarily the way it would \\nbe done if people were participating.\\n  I applaud Administrator Pruitt's directive. I urge the President to \\npromptly see to it that similar reforms are implemented across the \\nadministration.\\n  So for a third time today, President Trump, issue an Executive order \\nto all departments to do what Administrator Pruitt has done at the EPA.\\n\", u'turn': 0, u'speaker': u'Mr. GRASSLEY', u'itemno': 0}, {u'kind': u'linebreak', u'speaker_bioguide': None, u'text': u'                          ____________________\\n\\n\\n', u'turn': -1, u'speaker': u'None', u'itemno': 1}], u'header': {u'extension': False, u'vol': u'163', u'wkday': u'Wednesday', u'chamber': u'Senate', u'num': u'177', u'year': u'2017', u'month': u'November', u'pages': u'S6963-S6964', u'day': u'1'}, u'doc_title': u'REGULATORY REFORM', u'id': u'CREC-2017-11-01-pt1-PgS6963-2', u'title': u'REGULATORY REFORM'}{u'content': [{u'kind': u'speech', u'speaker_bioguide': None, u'text': u'  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Rogers of Kentucky).

Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize Fairfax Water on the \\noccasion of its 60th anniversary. There are few human needs more \\nprecious and more critical than access to fresh and safe drinking \\nwater. Indeed, we have seen what can happen when those needs are \\nneglected, as the tragedy in Flint, Michigan reminds us. Prior to the \\ncreation of the Fairfax County Water Authority (now known as Fairfax \\nWater), water was supplied to Fairfax County through many small, mostly \\nprivate water systems, and a limited number of public systems. There \\nwas no standardization between systems and each system maintained its \\nown rate schedule and level of service. In order to improve service \\nreliability, establish equitable rates, and provide effective fire \\nprotection throughout Fairfax County, the Board of Supervisors created \\nFairfax Water in September 1957 for the purpose of ``acquiring, \\nconstructing, operating and maintaining an integrated water system for \\nsupplying and distributing water.''\\n   The acquisition of water systems began in 1959 with the purchase of \\nthe Annandale Water Company. Over the next eight years, Fairfax Water \\nacquired an additional 17 systems and began to build a comprehensive \\nwater-supply system. By the end of 1967, Fairfax Water had 832 miles of \\nmains, 3,354 fire hydrants, and 54,000 metered accounts serving more \\nthan 425,000 people. By 1982, that number had grown to more than 1,800 \\nmiles of mains, more than 10,300 fire hydrants and nearly 126,000 \\nmetered accounts serving more than 650,000 people. By 1994, it would \\nreach more than 2,700 miles of water mains, more than 17,300 fire \\nhydrants and more than 197,300 meters.\\n   Those numbers show a county undergoing tremendous growth in both \\npopulation and urbanization. The challenges associated with that are \\nnumerous and the temptation of providing service while overlooking the \\nquality of that service is real. However, Fairfax Water has never \\nallowed itself to fall into that trap. Instead, it has approached every \\nnew challenge with its mission in mind: providing safe, clean drinking \\nwater to Fairfax County residents and ensuring that the County's water \\nsupply is maintained. There have certainly been no shortage of \\nchallenges--from supply issues stemming from the use of a single source \\n(the Occoquan River) to natural disasters to the threat of terrorism, \\nFairfax Water has risen to meet those challenges. Its work stands as \\ntestament to the strength and character of the ethos of public service \\nin our community.\\n   Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating \\nPhillip Allin, Charles Murray, the members of the Board of Directors \\nand the entire staff of Fairfax Water. I thank them for their service \\nto our community and for maintaining the proud legacy of this \\norganization while adapting it to meet the challenges of the future.\\n\", u'turn': 0, u'speaker': u'Mr. CONNOLLY', u'itemno': 2}, {u'kind': u'linebreak', u'speaker_bioguide': None, u'text': u'                          ____________________\\n\\n\\n', u'turn': -1, u'speaker': u'None', u'itemno': 3}], u'header': {u'extension': True, u'vol': u'163', u'wkday': u'Wednesday', u'chamber': u'House', u'num': u'177', u'year': u'2017', u'month': u'November', u'pages': u'E1483', u'day': u'1'}, u'doc_title': u'RECOGNIZING THE 60TH ANNIVERSARY OF FAIRFAX WATER', u'id': u'CREC-2017-11-01-pt1-PgE1483', u'title': u'RECOGNIZING THE 60TH ANNIVERSARY OF FAIRFAX WATER'}{u'content': [{u'kind': u'linebreak', u'speaker_bioguide': None, u'text': u'                                 ______\\n', u'turn': -1, u'speaker': u'None', u'itemno': 0}, {u'kind': u'title', u'speaker_bioguide': None, u'text': u'                          HON.

Here is how one practitioner put it in a \\nletter to the Judiciary Committee: ``I am not a Republican,'' he wrote. \\n``Justice Larsen approaches cases with an open mind and an independence \\nfrom party affiliation. . . . I believe that . . . Justice Larsen has \\nhad a very positive influence on the Michigan Supreme Court. In my \\nview, she would be a deserving addition to the Sixth Circuit Court of \\nAppeals.''\\n  Another lawyer wrote the committee, advising that he ``has practiced \\nlaw in Michigan for 39 years'' and is ``a past president of the \\nMichigan Association for Justice (formerly the Michigan Trial Lawyers \\nAssociation).'' He goes on to say that Justice Larsen ``has \\ndemonstrated on the bench that she is precisely who she is in person, a \\ngenuine, thoughtful individual who respects precedent, the common law \\nand the role that lawyers and judges play in society. . . . I have no \\nhesitation in telling you that Justice Larsen will make an excellent \\njudge on the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals.''\\n  In conclusion, President Trump continues to nominate smart, well-\\nqualified, and impartial individuals to our Nation's Federal courts. \\nJustice Larsen, like each of the other nominees before her, was \\nnominated on the basis of her belief in the rule of law and her \\ncommitment to apply the law fairly to everyone who enters her \\ncourtroom.\\n  Once again, I would also like to thank Chairman Chuck Grassley for \\nhis leadership on the Judiciary Committee, tirelessly working to bring \\nthe President's nominees to the floor.\\n  I look forward to voting to confirm Joan Larsen today, and I urge all \\nof my colleagues to join me.\\n\", u'turn': 0, u'speaker': u'Mr. McCONNELL', u'itemno': 0}, {u'kind': u'linebreak', u'speaker_bioguide': None, u'text': u'                          ____________________\\n\\n\\n', u'turn': -1, u'speaker': u'None', u'itemno': 1}], u'header': {u'extension': False, u'vol': u'163', u'wkday': u'Wednesday', u'chamber': u'Senate', u'num': u'177', u'year': u'2017', u'month': u'November', u'pages': u'S6937-S6938', u'day': u'1'}, u'doc_title': u'NOMINATION OF JOAN LARSEN', u'id': u'CREC-2017-11-01-pt1-PgS6937-7', u'title': u'NOMINATION OF JOAN LARSEN'}{u'content': [{u'kind': u'speech', u'speaker_bioguide': None, u'text': u'  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Mr. Speaker, last week, the Labor-HHS \\nAppropriations Subcommittee had a most remarkable hearing on Down \\nsyndrome, which moved us to a new understanding of this disability.\\n  DS is a genetic disorder that affects over 300,000 men, women, and \\nchildren in America. It is the most common chromosomal disorder and the \\nmost frequent genetic cause of learning disabilities in children.\\n  Each year, approximately 6,000 babies in the United States are born \\nwith Down syndrome, a condition resulting from an extra 21st \\nchromosome. Sixty years ago, people with DS had a life expectancy of \\nless than 20 years, and most lived their lives in institutions. Today, \\ndue to early medical care and being raised in loving homes, these \\nchildren can expect to live well into their sixties.\\n  Last week's hearing was one of the most emotionally charged and \\ninspirational hearings I can recall as a member of this subcommittee. \\nThe room was filled with children and adults with DS and their \\nfamilies, including my young constituent, Jose Cisneros. Amidst the \\ntears, laughter, and applause, we heard inspiring stories about the \\namazing accomplishments of DS teens and young adults in sports, \\nscouting, community activism, and film acting.\\n  We learned that they are graduating from high schools, attending \\ncolleges, and working at jobs in their communities.\\n  And, most importantly, we saw how these young Americans are teaching \\nour country about the value of diversity and inclusion, while at the \\nsame time increasing the happiness quotients of those lucky enough to \\nbe in their very wide circle of friends.\\n  We also learned some very surprising and amazing facts about Down \\nsyndrome. Researchers told us that individuals with DS are medically \\nvery special. On the one hand, they are highly predisposed to \\nautoimmune disorders such as thyroid disease and rheumatoid arthritis; \\nchildren with DS are 50 times more likely to develop\\n\\n\\nchildhood leukemia, and virtually all adults with DS will develop the \\nbrain pathology of Alzheimer's by the age of 40.\\n  But they also said that due to a small difference in their genetic \\nmakeup, persons with Down syndrome are naturally protected from heart \\ndisease, high blood pressure, and most solid-tissue cancers. \\nResearchers said studying these unique genetics could help discover \\nways to prevent or cure diseases such as cancer, autoimmune disorders, \\nand Alzheimer's disease.\\n  With such promising potential, one would think the Federal Government \\nwould invest heavily in Down syndrome research. Unfortunately, what we \\nlearned was that over the last two decades, DS has been one of the \\nleast funded genetic conditions at the NIH.\\n  This hearing left no doubt about the need for a significant and \\nsustained investment in Down syndrome research. A trans-NIH DS \\ninitiative could help not only find answers and cures for DS, but \\ndiscover its mysteries, which could answer questions about other \\nserious and life-threatening diseases.\\n  While the benefits of DS research are unquestionable, it will take \\ntime to realize its full potential. In the meantime, we must ensure \\nthose living with DS can access and afford high-quality, coordinated \\nhealthcare and the long-term services and support they need to live \\nproductive lives in their communities.\\n  Medicaid long-term supports and Medicaid community-based services \\ngives them that opportunity by enabling them to maintain gainful \\nemployment and stay in their homes and in their communities. Sadly, \\nacross our country, thousands of people with Down syndrome are on very \\nlong waiting lists for those services.\\n  As lawmakers, we have an obligation to find a bipartisan way to \\nprotect and expand Medicaid services so all individuals with DS and \\nother debilitating diseases have access to the lifelong interventions \\nand support they need.\\n  The time has come for this country to embrace the gift and potential \\nthat Down syndrome brings to our society. The 300,000-plus Americans \\nliving with DS today want and deserve the same opportunities available \\nto all of us: to live a full life and to reach their true potential.\\n\", u'turn': 1, u'speaker': u'Ms. ROYBAL-ALLARD', u'itemno': 1}, {u'kind': u'linebreak', u'speaker_bioguide': None, u'text': u'                          ____________________\\n\\n\\n', u'turn': -1, u'speaker': u'None', u'itemno': 2}], u'header': {u'extension': False, u'vol': u'163', u'wkday': u'Wednesday', u'chamber': u'House', u'num': u'177', u'year': u'2017', u'month': u'November', u'pages': u'H8298-H8299', u'day': u'1'}, u'doc_title': u'DOWN SYNDROME', u'id': u'CREC-2017-11-01-pt1-PgH8298', u'title': u'DOWN SYNDROME'}{u'related_usc': [{u'number': u'1189', u'title': u'8'}, {u'title': u'22', u'number': u'211a', u'detail': u'et seq.'}], u'title': u'FTO PASSPORT REVOCATION ACT OF 2017', u'content': [{u'kind': u'speech', u'speaker_bioguide': u'P000592', u'text': u'  Mr. POE of Texas.

Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \\nconsume.\\n  Mr. Speaker, the terrorist attack last night in New York City comes \\nas a devastating reminder that the enemies of liberty will not cease.\\n  Eight people were killed and 11 more were injured in what law \\nenforcement officials are now calling New York's deadliest terror \\nattack since 9/11.\\n  The perpetrator of this attack was radicalized domestically by ISIS, \\nhighlighting the grave threat posed by this terrorist propaganda.\\n  Mr. Speaker, the terrorist last night was an immigrant from \\nUzbekistan, but we know that even within our midst, there are Americans \\nwho sympathize with those who seek to destroy our freedom.\\n\\n\\n  As many as 250 American citizens have sought to travel to Syria, and \\nmore than 100 have joined ISIS' ranks. Many of these individuals have \\nreceived terrorist training while overseas. Some are under the command \\nand control of terrorist leaders who have instructed them to attack the \\nUnited States whenever. Others are inspired by the perverted ideology \\nof hate that the terrorists post on social media sites. Many of these \\nare American social media sites.\\n  These American citizens are a direct threat to our homeland. \\nUnfortunately, our current safeguards are insufficient to protect us \\nagainst such vulnerability.\\n  In 2014, a 22-year-old Florida native became the first American to \\ncarry out a suicide bombing in Syria. He had battled hard and been \\ntrained by al-Qaida's Syrian affiliate for some time. This same \\nAmerican was waved through U.S. border inspections when he traveled \\nhome to Florida a year earlier.\\n  After spending some time in Florida, the man made his way back to \\nSyria to kill in the name of al-Qaida. When he ultimately blew himself \\nup in May of 2014, al-Qaida released a video of his last will and \\ntestament. He said: ``You think you are safe where you are in America. \\nYou are not safe.''\\n  Mr. Speaker, today we are at a dangerous crossroad. As ISIS loses \\nmore territory in its so-called caliphate and it collapses, the threat \\nto our homeland will really grow. Americans who have been fighting with \\nISIS will be looking for ways to come home to stage deadly attacks.\\n  In recent weeks, a man from Alexandria, Virginia, was convicted on \\nterrorism charges for joining ISIS. He was sentenced to 20 years in the \\npenitentiary. This terrorist traitor to our Nation named four other \\nWesterners who had joined ISIS and who left Syria with intentions to do \\nharm in their home countries.\\n  Law enforcement officials and terrorism experts have been warning of \\nthis foreign fighter threat for years. This is a serious threat, and we \\nmust address it before it becomes worse.\\n  Having betrayed our Nation, we must revoke the privileges that come \\nwith an American passport. That is why my colleague, the gentleman from \\nMassachusetts (Mr. Keating), and I introduced H.R. 425, the Foreign \\nTerrorist Organization Passport Revocation Act. It authorizes the \\nSecretary of State to revoke passports of those who have joined foreign \\nterrorist organizations.\\n  I might add, Mr. Speaker, this is a legal term, what a foreign \\nterrorist organization is. It is only those organizations.\\n  These individuals are U.S. citizens, but they betray our country. \\nThey should clearly not be allowed the privilege of international \\ntravel with an American passport, and they should definitely not be \\nable to come back into the United States when they travel overseas, \\nsuch as in Syria. This bipartisan bill will also stop these Benedict \\nArnolds from using their passports to travel to other war zones or \\ncross borders to attack any of our allies.\\n  Mr. Speaker, there is absolutely nothing in current regulations \\nspecifically to support foreign terrorist organizations. The Secretary \\nof State does not have the authority to revoke passports on a broad \\nnational security basis.\\n  It is time our laws change and catch up with the modern world and the \\nnew and real threats to our Nation. Let me be clear, Mr. Speaker. This \\nbill would not strip American of their citizenship. It would deny those \\nAmericans who have sided with foreign terrorist organizations the \\nprivilege of travel internationally.\\n  The bill also would not impinge on any American's due process rights \\nif they want to appeal the revocation of their passport. Anyone whose \\npassport is revoked or denied is eligible for a due process hearing \\nwithin 60 days. The bill would actually increase oversight on this \\nprocess by requiring the State Department to report directly to \\nCongress whenever the Secretary moves to revoke or deny an American's \\npassport on these grounds.\\n  Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my colleague from Massachusetts (Mr. \\nKeating) for working with me on this bill. We both sit on the Committee \\non Foreign Affairs' Subcommittee on Terrorism, Nonproliferation, and \\nTrade as the chair and ranking member. We have both been working on \\nthis issue of foreign fighter threats for some time, and we believe \\nthis is a good first step to protect our homeland.\\n  I also want to thank Chairman Royce for his help in getting this \\nimportant bill passed in the committee, and also Ranking Member Engel \\nfrom New York, where this unfortunate tragic event occurred last night.\\n  Mr. Speaker, the point is this: the traitors among us who have chosen \\nto\\n\\n\\nmake their allegiance to a murderous ideology instead of the country \\nthat gave them life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness must face \\nthe consequences. If you take up arms with our enemies, you deserve to \\nbe treated like one.\\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\", u'turn': 4, u'speaker': u'Mr. POE of Texas', u'itemno': 12}, {u'kind': u'speech', u'speaker_bioguide': u'E000179', u'text': u\"  Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume, \\nand I rise in strong support of this measure.\\n  Mr. Speaker, as a New Yorker, my heart aches today. The appalling \\nloss of life on the streets of Manhattan yesterday is a reminder that \\nterrorism remains a threat that demands our focus.\\n  Confronting violent extremism requires sound, reasoned policies; \\npolicies proportional to the threat, policies based on good \\nintelligence, careful analysis, and a clear understanding of what we \\nare up against, not policies based on hysterical reactions or biases \\nagainst certain faiths or nationalities.\\n  I support this bill because it will ensure that the State Department \\nhas the tools to prevent American terrorists from traveling abroad or \\nreturning to our country.\\n  Under this legislation, the Secretary of State could refuse to issue \\na passport or revoke a passport for any American who has provided \\nassistance to foreign terrorist organizations. Importantly, it also \\naffords anyone affected the right to an appeals process, helping to \\nensure due process rights.\\n  This bill is just common sense. It is also a vital aspect of the \\nfight against terrorism. We don't want known threats crossing our \\nborders or slipping from country to country anywhere in the world.\\n  The bill we are considering today would not have, obviously, \\nprevented yesterday's attack, but this is important. This is just a \\npiece of a larger strategy.\\n  The President yesterday called our judicial system, which would \\nprosecute the perpetrator of yesterday's attack, a joke and a laughing \\nstock. I beg to disagree. That is our judicial system, which \\nsuccessfully prosecuted shoe bomber Richard Reid; Ramzi Yousef, the \\n1993 World Trade Center bomber; Faisal Shahzad, the Times Square \\nbomber; and Sulaiman Abu Ghaith, Osama Bin Laden's son-in-law, in March \\nof 2014.\\n  Mr. Speaker, the judicial branch has done quite a good job in \\nprosecuting terrorists. Let's show them a little confidence and give \\ncredit where credit is due.\\n  This is deadly serious. The man suspected in yesterday's attack was \\nreportedly radicalized after he arrived in the United States. We have \\nseen this before in San Bernardino and Orlando. ISIS inspires its \\nadherents from thousands of miles away. That is a problem. And just as \\nthis bill gets at a narrow, specific potential vulnerability, policies \\nto deal with homegrown extremists and terrorists should take a hard \\nlook at causes and take appropriate action to prevent this sort of \\nradicalization on American shores.\\n  We won't solve this problem by slamming shut America's front door and \\nclamping down on immigration. In fact, doing so just contributes to the \\nterrorist's ideological ammunition and recruitment efforts. There are \\nproven ways to combat terrorism, but demonizing a religion or chipping \\naway at constitutional rights won't work. Those approaches play right \\ninto the tactics terrorists use to radicalize vulnerable Americans, \\nmaking us less safe and less free.\\n  I want to thank Representatives Poe and Keating, who lead our \\nCommittee on Foreign Affairs' Subcommittee on Terrorism, \\nNonproliferation, and Trade. Mr. Speaker, this bipartisan bill gets to \\nthe real concern in the fight against terrorism. I am pleased to \\nsupport it.\\n  With all due respect to Mr. Poe, that is just the way it is.\\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Massachusetts \\n(Mr. Keating), the ranking member of the Terrorism, Nonproliferation, \\nand Trade Subcommittee.\", u'turn': 5, u'speaker': u'Mr. ENGEL', u'itemno': 13}, {u'kind': u'speech', u'speaker_bioguide': u'K000375', u'text': u\"  Mr. KEATING.

My prayers are with all the individuals and families \\nthat were affected. My utmost respect goes to the New York City \\ncommunity that, once again, stands strong, stands together, \\nunintimidated.\\n  Mr. Speaker, I introduced this important piece of legislation, H.R. \\n425, together with Chairman Poe of the Foreign Affairs' Subcommittee on \\nTerrorism, Nonproliferation, and Trade.\\n  As we have discussed, this legislation works to strengthen the tools \\nwe have at our disposal for combating terrorism. Put simply, the \\nSecretary of State can refuse to issue or revoke the passport to any \\nindividual the Secretary determines is affiliated with or has aided, \\nassisted, or abetted a designated foreign terrorist organization.\\n  The terrorist treats that we face today are complex. Our Federal, \\nState, and local agencies are fighting terrorism at a time when ISIS \\nand other terrorist organizations are able to use new technologies and \\nmeans of communication to connect with individuals around the globe to \\nfund, to direct, and inspire acts of terror.\\n  Modes of international travel are more accessible and affordable than \\never, and cross-border flows of people and goods have increased as we \\nhave become more connected in the global world. While these are very \\npositive developments for exchange, competitiveness, and quality of \\nlife, we also have to be sure we are managing the risks that go along \\nwith this increased connectivity.\\n  We have to make it harder for anyone supporting terrorism to benefit \\nfrom the increased ease of global movement. That is why our legislation \\nis important. We must ensure that the Secretary of State has the clear \\nauthority to refuse a passport to anyone affiliated with or supporting \\na designated foreign terrorist organization.\\n  This legislation provides that specific statutory authority, as well \\nas improved congressional oversight, are in place. It is also important \\nthat there are safeguards in place in order for any law to be \\nsuccessful. That is why I am pleased that H.R. 425 also includes a \\nright of review for anyone whose passport has been refused or revoked.\\n  It is absolutely possible to fight terrorism while still upholding \\nprotections for individuals' rights and the rule of law, and it is \\ncritical that we do both. In fighting to protect our communities and \\nour democracy, we cannot compromise these very things we are fighting \\nto protect.\\n  Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank Chairman Poe for joining me in \\nintroducing H.R. 425, the Foreign Terrorist Organization Passport \\nRevocation Act. I would like to also thank Chairman Royce and Ranking \\nMember Engel for their support with this bill as well within the \\nForeign Affairs Committee.\\n  Mr. Speaker, in closing, I urge that all of our colleagues join \\ntogether in support of this important legislation.\", u'turn': 6, u'speaker': u'Mr. KEATING', u'itemno': 14}, {u'kind': u'speech', u'speaker_bioguide': u'E000179', u'text': u'  Mr. ENGEL.

And the New York tragedy is an \\nexample of how they respond and chase and go after terrorists rather \\nthan run from terror.\\n  One other thing I want to mention is the Foreign Affairs Committee, \\nwe work primarily bipartisan, Mr. Speaker. That shocks a lot of folks \\nhere in Washington, D.C., and it sure shocks a lot of folks back home. \\nBut most of the\\n\\n\\nthings that come before the House floor have been bipartisan pieces of \\nlegislation.\\n  We spend a lot of time on legislation and almost always come to the \\nHouse floor with unanimous votes, or mostly unanimous votes, on the \\ncommittee level. We work very well on these issues because these are \\nnot partisan issues; these are American issues that we are talking \\nabout.\\n  Mr. Speaker, there are about 61 designated foreign terrorist \\norganizations that our State Department has said are foreign terrorist \\norganizations and, to prevent individuals in America who side with \\nthese organizations, who support these organizations, who are part of \\nthese organizations from traveling around the world and coming back \\nhome, based upon their activities, this legislation by Mr. Keating is \\nintroduced. Keep them from traveling, because we know who those people \\nare, and keep them, especially, from coming back to the United States.\\n  So what would happen if a passport is revoked and some American is in \\nSyria and is radicalized and he tries to get on a plane? Well, he is \\nnot allowed to get on the plane. He is stopped, and then he is turned \\nover, eventually, to Department of Homeland Security and our Justice \\nDepartment and handled that way.\\n  Now, there are only a few places under our law where a person's \\npassport can be revoked. Not paying your child support, drug \\ntrafficking, sex tourism--those are three of the examples. So we are \\nnot talking about a lot of examples, but we are talking about this \\nexample.\\n  I am a former judge, and I know Mr. Keating is a former prosecutor. \\nDue process for Americans is always important. The Supreme Court has \\nalready ruled on whether or not passports can be revoked under certain \\ncircumstances, and they have affirmed the authority of the State \\nDepartment to revoke passports in specific cases based upon national \\nsecurity reasons.\\n  This bill allows for due process of those people who have their \\npassports revoked. This is a good step in protecting the United States. \\nThis is bipartisan legislation. I think it is very important that we \\ntake this step.\\n  Once again, my prayers, our prayers, are for those folks in New York. \\nBut, Mr. Speaker, we are not going to allow terrorists to have their \\nday.

I cannot help but see this measure as a common sense \\ntactic to prevent terrorists from entering or re-entering our country. \\nHowever, more needs to be done to build on this useful foundation for \\nsecurity from terrorists originating in this country or foreign-based \\nterrorists.\\n  Just yesterday, the streets of New York were the scene of carnage \\ncaused by a man from Uzbekistan who won a diversity visa lottery to \\nenter this country in 2010. He has lived here for seven years before \\ngoing on the murderous rampage that killed 8 people and injured 12 \\nothers. Clearly, we need to look closer at the background of those \\nadmitted through this lottery as they could eventually obtain a U.S. \\npassport. That was the conclusion by the Government Accountability \\nOffice ten years ago--three years before New York terror suspect \\narrived in this country.\\n  The GAO report in 2007 called the diversity visa program ``an open \\ndoor'' for terrorists. According to the report 9,800 people from \\ncountries designated by the State Department as State Sponsors of \\nTerrorism had used the program to enter the country. These people could \\neventually qualify for a U.S. passport.\\n  We also must be more vigilant about people coming from countries not \\ndesignated as State Sponsors of Terrorism. The 9/11 Commission reported \\nback in 2004 that as many as six of the hijackers of the three planes--\\nwho were from Saudi Arabia, Egypt, United Arab Emirates and Lebanon--\\nhad used fraudulent or manipulated passports to enter the United \\nStates. In 2013, a Saudi citizen entering the United States through the \\nDetroit airport was detained because he couldn't satisfactorily explain \\nwhy he was carrying a pressure cooker like the one used in the Boston \\nmarathon bombing. However, upon inspection, his passport suspiciously \\nhad a missing page. Would that have been caught without the presence of \\nthe pressure cooker? We are told that even the slightest tweak to a \\npassport will be caught, but one failure could result in a terrorist \\nentering our country, and they could eventually become terrorist \\nsleepers who acquire a U.S. passport.\\n  Finally, in order for the FTO designation to be effectively used to \\nstop terrorists from getting passports or having their passport \\nrevoked, our government must make that designation in the first place. \\nI tried for two years to get the previous administration to designate \\nBoko Haram as a terrorist organization. They finally did so in 2013, \\nbut how many potential terrorists may have gotten through before then \\nand acquire sufficient status to receive a U.S. passport? We also need \\nto use the FTO designation to identify those giving support to \\nterrorist organizations, especially in cases of such support coming \\nfrom those living in the United States who could be or potentially \\ncould be U.S. passport holders.\\n  As I said earlier, I consider H.R. 425 a common sense measure on \\nwhich to build, but we must take steps to make this bill as meaningful \\nas it must be for our security. I ask my colleagues to approve this \\nlegislation.\", u'turn': 9, u'speaker': u'Mr. SMITH of New Jersey', u'itemno': 17}, {u'kind': u'speech', u'speaker_bioguide': None, u'text': u'  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Higgins of Louisiana).

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to call attention to the \\nGovernment of Ethiopia's continued pattern of repression and violence \\nagainst its own people, and I urge the House of Representatives to vote \\non H. Res. 128, the Supporting Respect for Human Rights and Encouraging \\nInclusive Governance in Ethiopia resolution.\\n  This resolution calls on the Government of Ethiopia to take clear, \\ndecisive steps towards becoming more inclusive, more democratic, and \\nmore respectful of the basic human rights of its own people.\\n  This resolution has overwhelming bipartisan support, with more than \\n70 cosponsors, and it passed out of the House Foreign Affairs Committee \\nunanimously on July 27.\\n  The ongoing human rights crisis in Ethiopia is extremely troubling to \\nme, to the resolution's other cosponsors, the many Americans of \\nEthiopian heritage, and too numerous to list human rights groups. I \\nfirmly believe that the passage of this resolution will encourage the \\nEthiopian Government to end its practice of violence and repression and \\nprovide a strong basis for an inclusive government.\\n  Specifically, this resolution condemns the excessive use of force by \\nEthiopian security forces and the killing of peaceful protestors; the \\narrests and detention of journalists, students, activists, and \\npolitical leaders; and the Ethiopian Government's abuse of the anti-\\nterrorism proclamation to stifle political and civil dissent.\\n  The resolution does not simply highlight the Ethiopian Government's \\nincreasingly authoritarian acts, but it also encourages the United \\nStates to support efforts to improve democracy and governance in \\nEthiopia.\\n  I believe that the United States can take actions that will \\npositively influence the Ethiopian Government and use our existing \\ninstitutions to further democracy and effective governance in Ethiopia.\\n  Critically, the resolution calls on the Ethiopian Government to admit \\nU.N. human rights observers so they can conduct an independent and \\nthorough examination of the current state of human rights in Ethiopia.\\n  On March 9 of this year, the House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on \\nAfrica, Global Health, Global Human Rights, and International \\nOrganizations held a hearing to discuss specific steps the United \\nStates can take to bring about positive changes for the Ethiopian \\nGovernment and their people.\\n  Among those who testified was Deacon Yoseph Tafari of the St. Mary's \\nEthiopian Orthodox Church located in Aurora, Colorado. Deacon Yoseph \\nwas raised in Ethiopia and has experienced the daily struggles too many \\nEthiopians have faced living in abject poverty under an oppressive \\ngovernment.\\n  Deacon Yoseph fled from Ethiopia in 1976 and came to the United \\nStates as a refugee. He and many of the members of the Ethiopian \\ncommunity in my congressional district of Colorado, including the Oromo \\nand Amharas, have worked diligently to organize and assist those still \\nsuffering from repression in their home country.\\n  Oromo community president of Colorado, Jamal Said, has also shared \\nhis concerns with me, and both of these gentlemen have no motives other \\nthan a concern about the safety and state of democracy in Ethiopia. I \\nappreciate their leadership in the community as they continue to fight \\nfor democracy in their homeland.\\n  Unfortunately, stories like this are not uncommon in my district, and \\nI am disappointed that the House has not yet scheduled a floor vote on \\nH. Res. 128. I note that on two prior occasions a vote was tentatively \\nscheduled. In both of these instances, it is my understanding that the \\nvote was postponed due to pressure from the Ethiopian Government, which \\ncontinues to make promises to curb human rights abuses against their \\nown people, but fail to deliver.\\n  Additionally, it has been brought to my attention that the Ethiopian \\nGovernment has threatened to cut off security cooperation with United \\nStates should we proceed with H. Res. 128.\\n  I am particularly dismayed that rather than solving their problems \\nand moving towards becoming a more democratic country, the Ethiopian \\nGovernment has chosen instead to hire a D.C. lobbying firm at a cost of \\n$150,000 a month to ``work with the Ethiopian Government to develop and \\nexecute a public affairs plan to enhance the dialogue and relationships \\nwith policymakers, media, opinion leaders, and business leaders,'' in \\naddition to ``meetings with Members of Congress, their staffs, and \\nexecutive branch officials.''\\n  The issue the Ethiopian Government needs to address is the repression \\nof democracy and its citizens in Ethiopia. The solution to whatever \\nnegative perception it has in the Halls of the U.S. Congress is not a \\npublic affairs one, but, rather, what concrete steps are being taken \\nagainst democracy in Ethiopia.\\n  That is why I remain committed to working with House leadership to \\nhave a vote scheduled on H. Res. 128.\\n  Mr. Speaker, I encourage leadership to schedule a vote, and I call on \\nmy colleagues to vote in favor of and pass H. Res. 128. I will continue \\nworking with local Ethiopian community leaders in Colorado and across \\nthe country to raise awareness of the human rights abuses occurring in \\nEthiopia and to bring relief from oppression to the Ethiopian people.\\n\", u'turn': 1, u'speaker': u'Mr. COFFMAN', u'itemno': 1}, {u'kind': u'linebreak', u'speaker_bioguide': None, u'text': u'                          ____________________\\n\\n\\n', u'turn': -1, u'speaker': u'None', u'itemno': 2}], u'header': {u'extension': False, u'vol': u'163', u'wkday': u'Wednesday', u'chamber': u'House', u'num': u'177', u'year': u'2017', u'month': u'November', u'pages': u'H8302', u'day': u'1'}, u'related_bills': [{u'type': u'HRES', u'congress': u'115', u'context': u'FIRSTPARAGRAPH', u'number': u'128'}, {u'type': u'HRES', u'congress': u'115', u'context': u'OTHER', u'number': u'128'}], u'doc_title': u'THE GOVERNMENT OF ETHIOPIA HAS A HUMAN RIGHTS CRISIS', u'id': u'CREC-2017-11-01-pt1-PgH8302'}{u'content': [{u'kind': u'linebreak', u'speaker_bioguide': None, u'text': u'                                 ______\\n', u'turn': -1, u'speaker': u'None', u'itemno': 0}, {u'kind': u'title', u'speaker_bioguide': None, u'text': u'                            HON.

It is a terrible process. This is terrible legislation. \\nIt will produce terrible results for the overwhelming majority of \\nAmericans, especially the millions who rely on Medicaid and Medicare.\\n  Now, here is the deal, Mr. Speaker, that you are trying to push: if \\nAmericans are willing to give billionaires\\n\\n\\nwindfall tax cuts today and also trade their health security and safety \\nnet, then you, Mr. Speaker, will give average Americans the empty \\npromise of wage growth tomorrow and you will be able to file your taxes \\non a postcard.\\n  I say ``empty promises'' because studies and our experience have \\nshown that this unicorn of wage growth from tax cuts will never, in \\nfact, happen.

Without access \\nto basic medical services, communities in America's breadbasket and \\nenergy basin would not survive.\\n  Hospitals serving rural communities face unique challenges: an aging \\npopulation, low patient volume, higher percentages of Medicare \\nbeneficiaries, to name a few. Each translates into a higher per-patient \\ncost which has left 41 percent of rural hospitals operating at a loss.\\n  On top of this problematic patient volume and patient mix, ObamaCare \\nhas heaped a backbreaking $54 billion in additional regulatory burden \\nin unfunded mandates. Since 2010, the year ObamaCare was enacted, 80 \\nrural hospitals have shut down, 11 of which were in my home State of \\nTexas. If this rate continues, in less than 10 years, an unimaginable \\n25 percent of our Nation's rural hospitals will close. That would \\ncripple rural communities across this country and deliver a devastating \\nblow to our agriculture and energy economy, affecting all Americans, \\nincluding our neighbors in urban and suburban America.\\n  For some Texans, the nearest hospital is already 100 miles away. In \\nan emergency, this distance can mean the difference between life and \\ndeath. Point of fact: 60 percent of all trauma deaths occur in rural \\nAmerica, despite the fact that rural America only makes up 20 percent \\nof the country's population.\\n  Here is a startling fact and outright scary scenario: one-third of \\nrural hospitals have been deemed vulnerable to closure. If all 673 of \\nthose hospitals were to close down, it could result in over 130,000 \\njobs lost and almost $300 billion in GDP lost. When unemployment goes \\ndown and wages go down in those small towns, folks move away in search \\nof better opportunities.\\n  In order to sustain the critical lifeline hospitals provide for our \\nrural communities, I have introduced H.R. 4178, the Healthcare \\nEnhancement for America's Rural Towns Act, or the HEART Act. Why? \\nBecause small towns are the heartbeat of America; the heart of our \\nfood, fuel, and fiber production; the heart of traditional American \\nvalues. This legislation extends two programs vital to the \\nsustainability of rural hospitals and the community they deserve: the \\nLow-Volume Adjustment program and the Medicare-Dependent Hospital \\nprogram. These programs account for less than one-tenth of 1 percent of \\nall Medicare expenditures, but they go a long way to ensuring that \\nrural community hospitals with a higher percentage of Medicare patients \\nhave adequate funding to serve the unique populations.\\n  By extending the Medicare Low-Volume Adjustment program for 2 years, \\nand for the first time permanently extending the Medicare-Dependent \\nHospital program, we can provide the assurance and continuity that our \\nrural hospitals desperately need in order to serve our communities in \\nthe future. Just as importantly, we do this in a way that is budget \\nneutral and without spending any additional taxpayer moneys.\\n  Let's pass this legislation. Let's protect the heart of rural America \\nand give our community hospitals the certainty that they need to keep \\nour people and our communities healthy.\\n\", u'turn': 1, u'speaker': u'Mr. ARRINGTON', u'itemno': 3}, {u'kind': u'linebreak', u'speaker_bioguide': None, u'text': u'                          ____________________\\n\\n\\n', u'turn': -1, u'speaker': u'None', u'itemno': 4}], u'header': {u'extension': False, u'vol': u'163', u'wkday': u'Wednesday', u'chamber': u'House', u'num': u'177', u'year': u'2017', u'month': u'November', u'pages': u'H8304', u'day': u'1'}, u'related_bills': [{u'type': u'HR', u'congress': u'115', u'context': u'FIRSTPARAGRAPH', u'number': u'4178'}, {u'type': u'HR', u'congress': u'115', u'context': u'OTHER', u'number': u'4178'}], u'doc_title': u'PROTECT RURAL AMERICA HOSPITALS', u'id': u'CREC-2017-11-01-pt1-PgH8304'}{u'content': [{u'kind': u'linebreak', u'speaker_bioguide': None, u'text': u'                                 ______\\n\\n                         HON.

Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\\n  Mr. Speaker, small businesses, entrepreneurs, and emerging companies \\nare what drive the American economy. We meet them in our districts and \\nsee firsthand the benefits that their dreams, their innovations, and \\ntheir hard work provide to our constituents and to our communities.\\n  These innovators, entrepreneurs, and risk takers are critical to our \\ncountry's economic growth and prosperity. In fact, small businesses are \\nresponsible for more than 60 percent of the Nation's net new jobs over \\nthe past two decades. Sixty percent of all of the new jobs over the \\npast two decades come from these small emerging companies.\\n  Their ability to raise capital in the private markets is critical to \\nthe economic well-being of the United States.\\n  So if our Nation is going to have an economy that provides \\nopportunities for every American, then we must promote and encourage \\nthe success and growth of our small businesses and our startups. It is \\nthis notion that brings us to this legislation that we are discussing \\ntoday.\\n  Under current law, accredited investors are allowed to purchase \\nsecurities that haven't been registered with the Securities and \\nExchange Commission. These types of offerings carry more risks than \\npublic offerings. The thought is that individuals with enough financial \\nsophistication or net worth can bear the potential losses that may be \\nassociated with these types of securities.\\n  How the law works today is that this definition of an accredited \\ninvestor is solely based on wealth.\\n  The ability to participate in a private offering should not be \\nlimited to individuals that pass some type of Federal Government assets \\ntest. Instead, the ability to participate should be expanded to include \\nall individuals who demonstrate that they have sufficient understanding \\nof the offering. That may be a doctor who has gone through the training \\nand has an idea that a new piece of equipment might work for them; or a \\nscientist who has done research in the lab who says: You know what, \\nthis makes sense to me, and they understand the risk that they are \\nentering into.\\n  Well, H.R. 1585, the Fair Investment Opportunities for Professional \\nExperts Act, introduced by Representative Schweikert and Representative \\nHill, will expand the definition of an accredited investor in a way \\nthat will appropriately increase the pool of potential investors, \\nthereby providing additional investment opportunities for more \\nAmericans and enabling the businesses they invest in to create more \\njobs.\\n  The expansion of the accredited investor definition will enhance the \\nability of many companies, particularly small and emerging companies \\nand businesses, to raise capital and grow by increasing the pool of \\npotential investors. These are investors, again, that are very \\nknowledgeable about that particular area.\\n  This will both provide greater investment opportunities for more \\nAmericans and will enable these businesses to begin investing to create \\nmore jobs.\\n  H.R. 1585 is a bipartisan bill that will help create jobs and a \\nhealthier economy. The bill provides Americans with more investment \\nopportunities and enhances small companies' ability to raise capital.\\n  This legislation overwhelmingly passed the Financial Services \\nCommittee by a bipartisan vote of 58-2, and I urge all of my colleagues \\nto vote ``yes'' on this particular bill today.\\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\", u'turn': 4, u'speaker': u'Mr. HUIZENGA', u'itemno': 10}, {u'kind': u'speech', u'speaker_bioguide': u'F000454', u'text': u\"  Mr. FOSTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1585. This bill will \\nexpand the definition of accredited investor, a status reserved for \\ninvestors who possess the sophistication and financial means necessary \\nto invest in private securities offerings.\\n  Currently, accredited investors are limited to persons who have an \\nannual income more than $200,000, or $300,000 together with a spouse, \\nor a net worth in excess of $1 million, excluding a primary residence.\\n  Aside from the primary residence exclusion added by the Dodd-Frank \\nAct, the accredited investor definition has not been updated since \\n1982.\\n  In light of the growth of private markets and increasing complexity, \\nthe SEC's Investor Advisory Committee recommended that the SEC conduct \\nadditional study of adjusting the current thresholds for inflation and \\nestablishing alternatives based on existing credentials, investment \\nexperience, and limits of investments.\\n  An updated definition is long overdue. Current law speaks almost \\nexclusively to the ability to bear a loss rather than the \\nsophistication of the investor.\\n  The bill we consider today is the product of bipartisan compromise. \\nLast Congress, it was significantly narrowed to include only persons \\nwho qualify based on current income and net worth tests: registered \\nbrokers, and investment advisers, and those who have the appropriate \\neducational background and job experience as determined by the SEC and \\nverified by FINRA.\\n  These categories are in line with the recommendations of the Investor \\nAdvisory Committee and effective proxies for sophistication, access to \\ninformation, and ability to withstand losses.\\n  There is an inherent tension between democratizing markets and \\nprotecting investors on the basis of their ability to bear financial \\nlosses.\\n\\n  This bill includes Ranking Member Waters' bipartisan amendment to \\nrequire the SEC to adjust net worth and income thresholds for inflation \\nevery 5 years. This will establish the economic value of the thresholds \\nin current law, as the dollar amounts are increased, with growth in the \\noverall economy and changes in the value of the dollar.\\n  Doing so will preserve access to private markets for those currently \\ninvesting in them. Private offerings can offer some of the best returns \\nin the market, but they obviously carry different risks, like \\nilliquidity, than securities in the public markets.\\n  While there can be investment opportunities that significantly \\nincrease a person's net worth, they cannot be immediately sold if an \\ninvestor's financial circumstances change.\\n  So this bill strikes a good compromise between giving access to \\ninvestments without exposing the retirement accounts of working \\nfamilies to excessive risks.\\n\\n\\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge broad support for the bill today, and I reserve \\nthe balance of my time.\", u'turn': 5, u'speaker': u'Mr. FOSTER', u'itemno': 11}, {u'kind': u'speech', u'speaker_bioguide': u'H001058', u'text': u'  Mr. HUIZENGA.

He and I were having a conversation about a company that he \\nwas really interested in that had been started by a handful of his old \\nfriends.\\n  Well, it turns out his old friends had gone through all this process, \\nand he had just sort of been watching what they were doing.\\n  Now, Lakshmi is an absolute expert on the technology that these \\ngentlemen are putting together, but because of a series of timing and \\nother things, he was walled off from investing in a company that was \\nusing a technology he was an absolute expert in, because he didn't meet \\nthe accredited investor standards. He didn't have the million dollars \\nin the bank.\\n  His argument to me was, should his knowledge on a company and its \\nproduct, their risk profile, its opportunity to succeed and its \\npotential failure in the marketplace be based on his bank account, or \\nshould it be based on his knowledge?\\n  Now, the legislation has gone through a couple generations of \\ncompromise. I personally preferred the original bill, a bit more \\nexpansive, but this is a good thing, because for our brothers and \\nsisters on both sides of the aisle here, I think we are embracing this \\nconcept that we all care about the curve where we are seeing the \\nwealthy getting wealthier in the United States and much of our \\nhardworking middle holding sort of flat.\\n  This is one of the reasons: we have created these definitions where \\naccredited investors, I think only, like, 600-some-thousand people, \\nhave gone through the process to hold that designation in our society, \\nmeaning it is a tiny sliver of our society that is allowed to invest in \\nthese types of businesses.\\n  We have a bureaucracy that for how many years now the regulator has \\nsaid: Your ability to invest in these types of organizations is based \\non your bank account.\\n  Today, we take the sort of first step on a bipartisan basis to say: \\nYes, bank account is one, but how about your risk tolerance, your \\nknowledge, your expertise, and your understanding that many of these \\nfail, and many of these businesses become amazing successes, but are \\nyou able to process both the technology, the risk, and the information?\\n  For many of us, we are hoping that the opportunity to be part of the \\ninvestor class starts to become much more egalitarian across our \\nsociety instead of just being the hallmark of the ultrawealthy in our \\ncountry.\\n  Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Huizenga for giving me a moment and for \\nmoving this bill forward.\", u'turn': 7, u'speaker': u'Mr. SCHWEIKERT', u'itemno': 13}, {u'kind': u'speech', u'speaker_bioguide': u'F000454', u'text': u\"  Mr. FOSTER.

Mr. Speaker, today I rise in support of the \\nFair Investment Opportunities for Professional Experts Act. This is a \\nbipartisan bill. It expands economic opportunities for many, many \\nAmericans because, to date, only an individual's wealth has been taken \\ninto consideration when defining whether he meets the qualifications or \\nshe meets the qualifications of an accredited investor under our \\nsecurities laws. The simple fix proposed by this bill will empower \\nthose with financial expertise and those with experience to join the \\nranks of those who can invest in private, high-growth companies.\\n  It was explained very eloquently here by the bill's author, and I \\nthink that this commonplace change is going to broaden the pool of \\nstartup capital. That is going to help companies looking to grow, \\ncompanies looking to add jobs.\\n  At the same time, it provides an investment opportunity, one with \\ngreater upside and more risk, to those previously locked out of the \\nprivate placement market. This includes many educated young Americans \\nwho have not yet had time to grow their pocketbooks but do have the \\nexpertise in these areas.\\n  Mr. Speaker, in closing, I have seen firsthand that the \\nentrepreneurial spirit is certainly alive and well in California and \\nall across this country, and this bill before us today ensures that \\nmore Americans can participate in both the risk and reward of the \\nstartup economy.\\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support passage of H.R. \\n1585.\", u'turn': 10, u'speaker': u'Mr. ROYCE of California', u'itemno': 16}, {u'kind': u'speech', u'speaker_bioguide': u'H001058', u'text': u'  Mr. HUIZENGA.

Mr. Speaker, H.R. 1585 does one of the things that most \\nof us came to Congress to do: solve problems and change laws.\\n  The current law excludes most of America from participating in one of \\nthe most dynamic parts of our economy, which is private placement \\ninvestment into small startup companies or, sometimes, very big \\ncompanies but they are not yet publicly traded. There are opportunities \\nall over to do this, but there are only a small number of Americans who \\ncan make the investment.\\n  For many smaller companies, they are faced with a dilemma. One option \\nis no option. They may not have the network of prospective high net \\nworth, accredited investors who can take a look at the kind of capital \\nthat would help that company become a thriving larger company, that \\nwould help grow the companies that drive the growth in our economy.\\n  As investors, there are people who work in the investment industry \\nwho are doing the underwriting--charter financial analysts, for \\nexample. Whether they are working for a private equity group, they are \\ndoing the work but don't yet have the high net worth. They have true \\ndomain expertise.\\n  Imagine the skilled labor who is actually doing the technology \\nimplementation, who knows exactly everything that it would take in a \\nprogram to make a program be the winner in the marketplace but is also \\nwell informed on the rest of the risks, has been well educated on the \\nmarket, and he is prevented from participating.\\n  This act is a step in the right direction. I hope we can accomplish \\nmore together. I am confident we will see great success if we can pass \\nthis and build on it by taking a bigger bite at the apple soon.\\n  Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my colleagues Mr. Schweikert for \\noffering the bill, Mr. Hill for getting it through, Mr. Hensarling, and \\nMr. Huizenga, but I also want to thank my colleagues because it is \\nreally nice to see something go through unanimously in our committee.\", u'turn': 12, u'speaker': u'Mr. DAVIDSON', u'itemno': 18}, {u'kind': u'speech', u'speaker_bioguide': u'F000454', u'text': u'  Mr. FOSTER.

Mr. Speaker, very quickly, just to recap, 60 percent of \\nall job growth over the past two decades has come from small and \\nemerging companies. This bill today recognizes that and encourages more \\nof that to happen. It allows knowledgeable but maybe not wealthy folks \\nto invest in areas of their expertise. In an era of crowdfunding and \\nfund-me pages and those types of capital raises and investing, this \\nbill makes sense. As the gentleman from Ohio, my friend Mr. Davidson, \\npointed out, it came through the committee unanimously.\\n  Mr. Speaker, I think we all like to point out that Congress can work \\ntogether across party lines and have some common goals that can be \\nachieved and recognized, and this is one of those bills.

Mr. Speaker, today is the last day of baseball, but, more \\nimportantly, it is the first day of open enrollment for the Patient \\nProtection and Affordable Care Act.\\n  This year, enrollment only runs from November 1, today, through \\nDecember 15. This is half the length of last year when open enrollment \\nextended until January 30. It is 6 weeks shorter, so to sign up, get \\nstarted today. You only have 45 days to do it. This is something the \\nTrump administration is doing to\\n\\n\\nmake it more difficult and less likely people will sign up.\\n  Don't let them do this. Sign up for your healthcare. During this \\nshortened enrollment period, there will also be 12-hour periods of \\nscheduled maintenance when the website will be inaccessible. These \\nperiods will occur every Sunday morning, except one, during the open \\nenrollment period. December 15 is the last chance for individuals to \\nsign up for health insurance for 2018, unless you have a major event \\nlike getting married, having a child, or moving.\\n  In previous years, individuals were notified of autoenrollment with \\ntime to change their choice. This year, that happens on December 16, a \\nday after open enrollment ends, so there is no reason to do it. It just \\ntells you what you have got, and you don't have the opportunity to \\nchange. So individuals should not rely on autoenrollment. They should \\nuse healthcare.gov to find the best plan for them and their families.\\n  In many cases, there are affordable plans. In 2018, in Tennessee, 88 \\npercent can find a bronze plan for under $75.\\n\\n\\n  In Memphis, many consumers earning $30,000 to $48,000 a year can find \\nsilver plans for under $100. This is particularly true for those in \\ntheir late forties to age 64.\\n  You may qualify for premiums and cost-sharing reductions like in past \\nyears. In 2016, 88 percent of Tennesseans on the exchanges received \\npremium assistance, and 58 percent received cost-sharing reduction \\nsubsidies.\\n  This is still true even as the President attempts to sabotage the \\nPatient Protection and Affordable Care Act.\\n  Marketing funding and funds for navigators to help people through the \\nprocess have both been slashed. In spite of that fact, we are going to \\ntry to find some navigators still around and have a townhall in Memphis \\npossibly Saturday, November 11. We are still in the process of \\nscheduling that, but we want all of our people to get that chance. So \\nwe encourage all Americans to get that chance.\\n  Cost-sharing reduction subsidies will be available for individuals \\nwho qualify for silver plans despite Trump's decision to stop the \\ngovernment from reimbursing insurers.\\n  The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act is the law of the \\nland. All current efforts to repeal and replace have failed because \\nthey have not come up with a better plan. Healthcare is difficult, and \\nwe came up with a plan that needs some tweaking but not repealing.\\n  Memphis has recently seen a decrease in the disparity of breast \\ncancer mortality rates between Black and White women, a clear \\nindication that access to affordable care saves lives.\\n  Memphis has done excellent work at expanding access to screenings and \\ncoverage. In addition to local efforts, the Affordable Care Act has \\nhelped to reduce or even eliminate copayments that women have to pay \\nfor preventive screenings, including mammograms.\\n  Access to affordable healthcare has saved lives in Memphis and \\nthroughout this country. The open enrollment for the Affordable Care \\nAct starts today and runs through December 15. Avail yourselves of \\nthose opportunities.\\n\", u'turn': 1, u'speaker': u'Mr. COHEN', u'itemno': 1}, {u'kind': u'linebreak', u'speaker_bioguide': None, u'text': u'                          ____________________\\n\\n\\n', u'turn': -1, u'speaker': u'None', u'itemno': 2}], u'header': {u'extension': False, u'vol': u'163', u'wkday': u'Wednesday', u'chamber': u'House', u'num': u'177', u'year': u'2017', u'month': u'November', u'pages': u'H8305-H8306', u'day': u'1'}, u'doc_title': u'SIGN UP FOR HEALTHCARE NOW', u'id': u'CREC-2017-11-01-pt1-PgH8305-2', u'title': u'SIGN UP FOR HEALTHCARE NOW'}{u'content': [{u'kind': u'linebreak', u'speaker_bioguide': None, u'text': u'                                 ______\\n', u'turn': -1, u'speaker': u'None', u'itemno': 0}, {u'kind': u'title', u'speaker_bioguide': None, u'text': u'                         HON.

Mr. Speaker, I, along with my colleague Representative \\nRobert Wittman, rise today to recognize the twenty-five years that \\nMaster Sergeant Paul Contreras has served in the United States Marine \\nCorps. MSgt Contreras is a true patriot who has significantly \\ncontributed to the defense of our Nation. He enlisted in the Marine \\nCorps in April, 1992 and was assigned to Recruit Training Center, San \\nDiego, CA. He subsequently attended Marine Combat Training before being \\ntransferred to Marine Corps Logistics Base, Albany, GA where he trained \\nas a Packaging Specialist. Lance Corporal Contreras' first assignment \\nwas to Supply Company, 1st Supply Battalion, 1st Service Support Group, \\nCamp Pendleton, CA. Within his first month of this assignment, LCpl \\nContreras volunteered to deploy in support of OPERATION RESTORE HOPE in \\nMogadishu, Somalia. Upon completion of this deployment, he was selected \\nto attend Marine Security Guard training, transferring to Marine \\nSecurity Guard Battalion, Quantico, VA. Upon graduation from this \\nrigorous course, LCpl Contreras' first assignment was to U.S. Embassy \\nAbidjan, Ivory Coast. In July 1995 Cpl Contreras was transferred to \\nU.S. Embassy Santiago, Chile for his second post.\\n  Upon departure from Chile, Sergeant Contreras served with 1st Supply \\nBattalion until early 1998 when he began the process of applying for \\nthe Marine Corps' Counterintelligence/Human Intelligence (CI/HUMINT) \\noccupational specialty. Staff Sergeant Contreras was competitively \\nselected to train as a CI/HUMINT Marine, attending school from January \\nto June, 1999. SSgt Contreras' first assignment was with 1st CI/HUMINT \\nCompany where he served until being selected to deploy with the 13th \\nMarine Expeditionary Unit. During this deployment, SSgt Contreras \\nparticipated in recovery efforts following the bombing of the USS Cole \\nin Aden, Yemen. In 2000, SSgt Contreras returned to 1st CI/HUMINT \\nCompany where he served until June, 2001 before being reassigned to 2nd \\nCI/HUMINT Company, Camp Lejeune, NC. During this assignment, SSgt \\nContreras supported various exercises including BATTLE GRIFFIN in 2002, \\nand deployed in support of combat operations to Kabul, Afghanistan in \\n2002 and Babil, Iraq in 2004.\\n  In 2006, Gunnery Sergeant Contreras completed his active service to \\npursue a civilian career but remained committed to the Marine Corps, \\njoining the Select Marine Corps Reserve later that year. His first \\nreserve assignment was with the Marine Forces Pacific G2X office. From \\n2006 to 2008 Master Sergeant Contreras supported exercises and \\noperational requirements for Marine Forces Pacific. During this same \\ntime, MSgt Contreras was a part owner of a small defense contracting \\ncompany dedicated to the further development and training of Department \\nof Defense CI/HUMINT professionals prior to their deployments into Iraq \\nand Afghanistan. In the fall of 2008, Master Sergeant Contreras \\nreturned to the CI/HUMINT school to provide support to the training \\nstaff. His next assignment in March 2009 was with Marine Forces Command \\nG2X office. Due to his excellent reputation, MSgt Contreras was \\nrequested by name to mobilize with Marine Forces Europe from November \\n2011 until August 2013 where he served as Counterintelligence \\nOperations Chief. He returned to the United States for assignment to \\nIntelligence Support Battalion, Marine Forces Reserve in Quantico, VA. \\nIn his civilian career, MSgt Contreras also joined the Defense \\nIntelligence Agency's Counterespionage Division. He remained on Marine \\nReserve duty with Bravo Company until November 2014, upon which time he \\ntransferred to Individual Ready Reserve Status intending to retire. \\nRecognizing the immeasurable contribution that MSgt Contreras had made \\nto the CI/HUMINT profession, the senior leadership of Intelligence \\nSupport Battalion compelled MSgt Contreras to consider withdrawing his \\nretirement request in order to serve one final tour with the Battalion \\nand in February 2016 MSgt Contreras returned to Bravo Company. He \\nsubsequently participated in a US Army exercise at Guantanamo Bay, \\nCuba, and served as both Company CI/HUMINT Chief and Senior Enlisted \\nAdvisor until his retirement in November of 2017. During this same \\ntime, MSgt Contreras was hired by the Marine Corps Intelligence \\nActivity in the Office of the Counterintelligence Coordinating \\nAuthority where he is able to continue to support his beloved Corps by \\ninfluencing the development and direction of counterintelligence \\nactivities for the Marine Corps into the future.\\n  Mr. Speaker, few can match the dedication and Esprit de Corps that \\nPaul Contreras has displayed over his twenty-five years of service to \\nCorps and country. We wish Paul continued success in his future \\nendeavors. Many thanks to Master Sergeant Contreras. Our Nation has \\nbenefited from his outstanding leadership\\n\", u'turn': 0, u'speaker': u'Mrs. COMSTOCK', u'itemno': 2}, {u'kind': u'linebreak', u'speaker_bioguide': None, u'text': u'                          ____________________\\n\\n\\n', u'turn': -1, u'speaker': u'None', u'itemno': 3}], u'header': {u'extension': True, u'vol': u'163', u'wkday': u'Wednesday', u'chamber': u'House', u'num': u'177', u'year': u'2017', u'month': u'November', u'pages': u'E1476', u'day': u'1'}, u'doc_title': u'IN RECOGNITION OF MASTER SERGEANT PAUL CONTRERAS', u'id': u'CREC-2017-11-01-pt1-PgE1476-3', u'title': u'IN RECOGNITION OF MASTER SERGEANT PAUL CONTRERAS'}{u'content': [{u'text': u'             UNDERSTANDING THE RYAN-McCONNELL TAX GIVEAWAYS\\n', u'kind': u'Unknown', u'speaker': u'Unknown', u'itemno': 0, u'turn': -1}], u'header': {u'extension': False, u'vol': u'163', u'wkday': u'Wednesday', u'chamber': u'House', u'num': u'177', u'year': u'2017', u'month': u'November', u'pages': u'H8302-H8303', u'day': u'1'}, u'doc_title': u'UNDERSTANDING THE RYAN-McCONNELL TAX GIVEAWAYS', u'id': u'CREC-2017-11-01-pt1-PgH8302-2', u'title': None}{u'content': [{u'kind': u'linebreak', u'speaker_bioguide': None, u'text': u'                                 ______\\n', u'turn': -1, u'speaker': u'None', u'itemno': 0}, {u'kind': u'title', u'speaker_bioguide': None, u'text': u'                        HON.

Of the roughly 2,500 students enrolled in Gar-Field Senior \\nHigh School last year, approximately half spoke a language other than \\nEnglish at home. One to never shy away from a challenge, Dr. Sadki \\nrolled up his sleeves, transformed the teaching model, and embedded \\nEnglish instruction into the core curriculum to meet the needs of the \\ndiverse student body.\\n   For his foresight, engagement of the community, and commitment to \\nensuring that all students receive a world-class education, it is my \\nhonor to include in the Record, Dr. Cherif Sadki.\\n   Dr. Sadki is the standard-bearer at the regional and national level \\nfor educating English learners. He attributes much of his success in\\n\\n\\nreshaping the mission of Gar-Field Senior High School to the efforts of \\na supportive community, a focused group of educators, and a dedicated \\nadministrative staff. Instead of seeing students who embraced a failing \\nattitude, he saw children who had not been given an opportunity to \\nsucceed. Dr. Sadki saw teachers who needed encouragement, training and \\nsupport and a community that could be convinced that success was \\npossible.\\n   I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing Dr. Cherif Sadki, \\nprincipal of Gar-Field Senior High School on his selection as the 2017 \\nOutstanding High School Principal for Virginia. His leadership and \\ndedication to the students, teachers, and faculty as he works to ensure \\na bright future for all who pass through the doors of Gar-Field Senior \\nHigh School is truly commendable and worthy of our highest praise.\\n\", u'turn': 0, u'speaker': u'Mr. CONNOLLY', u'itemno': 2}, {u'kind': u'linebreak', u'speaker_bioguide': None, u'text': u'                          ____________________\\n\\n\\n', u'turn': -1, u'speaker': u'None', u'itemno': 3}], u'header': {u'extension': True, u'vol': u'163', u'wkday': u'Wednesday', u'chamber': u'House', u'num': u'177', u'year': u'2017', u'month': u'November', u'pages': u'E1484-E1485', u'day': u'1'}, u'doc_title': u'RECOGNIZING DR.

Because he was so close to unlocking a billion-dollar \\ndrug pipeline, he was kidnapped and murdered by drug traffickers. His \\ntragic death opened the eyes of many Americans to the dangerous illicit \\ndrug trade.\\n  Red Ribbon Week celebrates Agent Camarena's life and his vision for a \\ndrug-free America.\\n  Last week, the Atlantic Coast Young Marines honored his life through \\nevents that helped reduce the demand for drugs throughout northeast \\nFlorida.\\n  These young men and women who participate in this education and \\nservice program are known to be excellent leaders inside and outside of \\nthe classroom. The Atlantic Coast Young Marines are a shining example \\nof our First Coast youth.\\n  They also serve our veterans in numerous ways, by cleaning yards, \\nmaking hospital visits, and simply writing cards. Their dedication to \\ncommunity service and our veterans is a shining example of noble \\nselflessness.\\n  Mr. Speaker, I applaud the Atlantic Coast Young Marines for their \\nservice to Florida's First Coast community.\\n\", u'turn': 1, u'speaker': u'Mr. RUTHERFORD', u'itemno': 1}, {u'kind': u'linebreak', u'speaker_bioguide': None, u'text': u'                          ____________________\\n\\n\\n', u'turn': -1, u'speaker': u'None', u'itemno': 2}], u'header': {u'extension': False, u'vol': u'163', u'wkday': u'Wednesday', u'chamber': u'House', u'num': u'177', u'year': u'2017', u'month': u'November', u'pages': u'H8301', u'day': u'1'}, u'doc_title': u'ATLANTIC COAST YOUNG MARINES', u'id': u'CREC-2017-11-01-pt1-PgH8301', u'title': u'ATLANTIC COAST YOUNG MARINES'}{u'content': [{u'text': u'  (Mr. EVANS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \\nminute and to revise and extend his remarks.)', u'kind': u'Unknown', u'speaker': u'Unknown', u'itemno': 0, u'turn': -1}], u'header': {u'extension': False, u'vol': u'163', u'wkday': u'Wednesday', u'chamber': u'House', u'num': u'177', u'year': u'2017', u'month': u'November', u'pages': u'H8309', u'day': u'1'}, u'doc_title': u\"WE NEED A BIPARTISAN SOLUTION TO REAUTHORIZE CHILDREN'S HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM\", u'id': u'CREC-2017-11-01-pt1-PgH8309-2', u'title': u\"WE NEED A BIPARTISAN SOLUTION TO REAUTHORIZE CHILDREN'S HEALTH  INSURANCE PROGRAM\"}{u'content': [{u'text': u'                    RECOGNITION OF MR.

Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\\n  Mr. Speaker, over the last two decades, our Nation has experienced a \\n37 percent decline in the number of U.S. listed companies--public \\ncompanies. Equally troubling, we have seen the number of publicly \\ntraded companies fall to around 5,700. These statistics are concerning \\nbecause they are similar to the data we saw in the 1980s when our \\neconomy was less than half its current size.\\n  Mr. Speaker, since 2000, the average number of initial public \\nofferings, or IPOs, has fallen to approximately 135 per year, which \\npales in comparison to the more than 450 IPOs filed per year in\\n\\n\\nthe early 1990s. Notably, there has not been a corresponding downward \\ntrend in the creation of new companies over that same period. This \\ndemonstrates that the regulatory costs associated with going public is \\ndeterring new and emerging companies from making the decision to go \\npublic.\\n  Now, you may ask: Why is this important?\\n  Well, first of all, it is preventing our capital markets from \\nreaching their full potential, which sounds very academic and pie in \\nthe sky.\\n  What does that mean, though?\\n  What it really means is that it is not allowing Mr. and Mrs. 401(k) \\nfrom participating in the economic successes that we have seen lately.\\n  Federal securities regulations are typically written for large public \\ncompanies, and this one-size-fits-all framework imposes a \\ndisproportionate burden on small and emerging companies looking to go \\npublic.\\n  The 2012 Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act, or JOBS Act, which was \\na bipartisan bill signed into law by President Obama, created a new \\ntype of issue called an emerging growth company, which allowed these \\nso-called EGCs with less than $1 billion in revenue to be allowed to \\ncommunicate with potential investors before an initial public offering \\nand file confidential draft registration statements with the Securities \\nand Exchange Commission.\\n  On June 29, 2017, the SEC extended to all companies the option of \\nsubmitting in advance draft registration statements for IPOs and \\nfollow-on offerings within 1 year of an IPO.\\n  H.R. 3903, the Encouraging Public Offerings Act, would ensure that \\nall issues making an IPO would be allowed to communicate with potential \\ninvestors before an offering and file confidential draft registration \\nstatements with the Securities and Exchange Commission. In other words, \\nwe are going to codify what the Securities and Exchange Commission has \\nsaid we should be doing.\\n  H.R. 3903 simply codifies that practice into law and it will allow \\nthese companies to finalize their registration documents without undue \\nexpectations from outside influences, and it allows companies to time \\ntheir offering with the market before making their Form S-1s public and \\nbeginning an investor road show.\\n  I commend the bipartisan work of Representatives Budd and Meeks on \\nthis important bill to ensure that H.R. 3903 applies to all companies, \\nwithout losing valuable investor protections--a key element in this.\\n  This bill will also help encourage companies to go public, and I \\nencourage all of my colleagues to vote in favor of H.R. 3903.\\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.', u'turn': 4, u'speaker': u'Mr. HUIZENGA', u'itemno': 11}, {u'kind': u'speech', u'speaker_bioguide': u'F000454', u'text': u'  Mr. FOSTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 3903. This bill will \\nexpand the ability of companies to test the waters prior to going \\npublic and to submit confidential filings for feedback from the SEC \\nstaff prior to filing of an IPO.\\n  The JOBS Act of 2012 created these mechanisms for emerging growth \\ncompanies. Emerging growth companies are those with less than $1 \\nbillion in revenue, $700 million in public float, and $1 billion in \\nnonconvertible debt. The JOBS Act enabled these companies to speak to \\ninstitutional investors prior to an IPO without it being considered an \\nunregistered offering for sale of securities.\\n  The definition of a securities offering is appropriately broad to \\nprotect investors and ensure transparency in our markets by requiring \\nregistration and significant disclosures. However, companies \\nconsidering a public offering should be able to talk to the most \\nsophisticated investors in the markets, large institutional investors, \\nto gauge the interest in the offering. Having that ability will help \\nencourage public offerings because it enables companies to realize \\nefficiencies in assessing demand.\\n  Research-intensive firms are more likely to test the waters because \\nit lowers the cost of proprietary disclosure. These are the firms that \\ndrive economic growth by bringing new ideas to market.\\n  Research is obviously a passion of mine, having founded a company \\nthat was based on my intellectual property and subsequently designing \\nparticle accelerators as a physicist at Fermi National Lab. It is the \\nnew ideas that grow our GDP and improve the standard of living for all \\nAmericans.\\n  Moreover, new businesses with new ideas do more to grow the economy \\nthan incumbents with new ideas or just acquisitions. The public market \\npresents an opportunity for small businesses to become big businesses \\nwithout being bought out.\\n  Additionally, this bill would allow companies of all sizes to file \\nconfidentially forms with the SEC. This allows the firm to receive \\nfeedback without making inappropriate or unrequired information public. \\nDisclosing the correct information helps the markets understand risks \\nand price an offering appropriately.\\n  The bill also includes a provision giving the SEC discretion to \\nensure that these mechanisms are used in a way that benefits markets \\nand investors. The U.S. capital markets are the deepest and most liquid \\nin the world, and this bill will help more companies tap into that \\ncapital and grow our economy.\\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge broad support for this bill today, and I reserve \\nthe balance of my time.', u'turn': 5, u'speaker': u'Mr. FOSTER', u'itemno': 12}, {u'kind': u'speech', u'speaker_bioguide': u'H001058', u'text': u'  Mr. HUIZENGA. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 5 minutes to the \\ngentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Budd), the sponsor of this very \\nimportant legislation.', u'turn': 6, u'speaker': u'Mr. HUIZENGA', u'itemno': 13}, {u'kind': u'speech', u'speaker_bioguide': u'B001305', u'text': u\"  Mr. BUDD. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.\\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the Encouraging Public \\nOfferings Act, a bill that the gentleman from New York (Mr. Meeks) and \\nI have worked on together, and I thank him for that.\\n  I also thank the Financial Services Committee, in particular, the \\nstaff and the subcommittee chairman, Mr. Huizenga.\\n  I also thank the chairman, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Hensarling). \\nHis leadership of this committee and his devotion and fidelity to the \\nconservative principles are legendary. His retirement will be a great \\nloss to this institution. The Hensarling legacy of conservative \\nleadership will not be forgotten, and I am certain that his next \\nchapter will be as great as this one. He will be missed by all, \\nespecially by those of us--myself among them--who share his vision and \\nhis limited government principles.\\n  Mr. Speaker, no other country has a better history of connecting \\nmoney with vision than the United States of America. We rightfully \\ncelebrate our legendary entrepreneurs: Steve Jobs, Bill Gates, Andrew \\nCarnegie, Tom Davis, John Rockefeller, and a whole host of others who \\nbuilt the companies that drive our economy. None of those men could \\nhave done what they did without capital. None of them could have done \\nwhat they did without intermediaries to connect that capital to their \\nvision.\\n  So, Mr. Speaker, the depressing truth is that our capital markets are \\nthe biggest, strongest, and most transparent connectors between money \\nand vision, and they are not where they once were. We have the same \\nnumber of public offerings on our stock exchanges that we did in the \\n1980s, when the economy was much smaller. We have lost 50 percent of \\nour public companies since the 1990s, and more and more companies \\nchoose to go private, or they never even sell their shares to the \\npublic.\\n  The hope is that, with this bill, we will increase the desire of \\ncompanies to go public, getting our financial markets back to being the \\nnumber one method for capital formation. To that end, our bill does \\nthree things:\\n  First, it allows the companies to file their paperwork for going \\npublic with the SEC confidentially. That way, if there is an error or a \\ndiscrepancy in the documents, the company can work it out with the \\nagency without getting embarrassed in public or exposing information to \\ncompetitors.\\n  Second, it allows all companies to confidentially file their \\npaperwork for a second stock sale after an initial public offering. \\nAgain, the point being to allow for a dialogue between the company and \\nthe regulator.\\n  Third, it also allows all companies considering an IPO to talk to \\nsophisticated investors and qualified institutions and see if these \\ninvestors might want to buy their stock before offering it to the \\npublic, which is called ``testing the waters.'' It is hard to know if\\n\\n\\nyou should sell a product if you can't check and see if there is anyone \\nout there who even wants to buy it.\\n  Mr. Speaker, these changes to the securities laws have received broad \\nsupport. I want to quote the SEC chairman on this when he spoke at a \\nhearing in our committee. He said: ``The initial data is positive. Not \\njust people using it, but people saying, Thank you, we intend to use \\nit. Both from an IPO perspective, but also from the perspective on \\nfollow-on offerings that occur in the first year . . . if there is any \\nadverse views, I'd like to hear them. We haven't heard any.''\\n  The Center for American Progress, which has not traditionally been \\nfriendly to relaxing financial regulations, has said that these \\nreforms, which were made available to smaller companies in the JOBS \\nAct, were some of the most successful provisions in that law. This bill \\napplies them to all companies, not just those with a certain amount of \\nrevenue.\\n  Finally, the Treasury Department gave favorable mention to these \\nreforms in its report on the capital markets earlier this year. This \\nbill passed out of the House Financial Services Committee with \\nunanimous support.\\n  Mr. Speaker, the numbers on public companies are clear. We have a \\nproblem. The experts are clear that the changes in the Budd-Meeks bill \\nwould be a positive step towards fixing the problem. Similar bipartisan \\nreforms have seen great success in the past.\\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge support.\", u'turn': 7, u'speaker': u'Mr. BUDD', u'itemno': 14}, {u'kind': u'speech', u'speaker_bioguide': u'F000454', u'text': u'  Mr. FOSTER. Mr. Speaker, I would like to, first off, reiterate my \\nsupport of this bill. It is the sort of commonsense, bipartisan fix \\nthat will make an incremental improvement to our public markets.\\n  However, I would also like to emphasize what I believe is the real \\nthreat to the health of our public markets, which is the concentration \\nof wealth at the very top. It is no secret that the competition to our \\npublic markets are private equity and venture capital, and these are \\ninvestment instruments largely, almost entirely, under the control of \\nthe very wealthy.\\n  We are, this week, going to begin debate on a tax bill that will \\ndecide, to a large extent, whether we accelerate or decelerate the \\nconcentration of wealth at the very top. I just want to emphasize that \\nconnection to make everyone understand that the continued health of our \\npublic markets, which historically have been such an important \\ncontributor to middle class investment in growing businesses. So I want \\npeople to consider that as we debate this bill, which I fully support, \\nand, as well, the variety of important issues that we debate that \\nreally affect the distribution of wealth in this country.\\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.', u'turn': 8, u'speaker': u'Mr. FOSTER', u'itemno': 15}, {u'kind': u'speech', u'speaker_bioguide': u'H001058', u'text': u'  Mr. HUIZENGA.

Mr. Speaker, access to capital is crucial to promoting \\na thriving U.S. economy. It allows companies to invest in growth and to \\ndevelop new and innovative products and services. Historically, \\ncompanies seeking a considerable amount of capital have preferred to \\nuse an initial public offering and have shares traded on a national \\nsecurities exchange.\\n  However, the United States has experienced a 37 percent decline in \\nthe number of U.S. listed public companies, which is considerably lower \\nthan in the 1980s and 1990s.\\n  Public company compliance costs have grown sufficiently large that \\nmany smaller firms stay private rather than spend their profit \\novercoming these regulatory burdens. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Dodd-\\nFrank Act, and other legislative and regulatory actions have \\ncontributed to these costs.\\n\\n\\n  Title I of the JOBS Act created a new category of issuers known as \\nemerging growth companies, or EGCs. These issuers must have less than \\n$1 billion in annual revenue or $700,000 million in public float when \\nthey register with the SEC.\\n  While the JOBS Act made it easier for companies to go public, it was \\nnot enough to overcome capital formation obstacles entrepreneurs and \\nsmall businesses are facing.\\n  H.R. 3903, the Encouraging Public Offerings Act of 2017, would allow \\nany company, regardless of size or EGC status, to take advantage of the \\npopular provisions of title I of the 2012 JOBS Act.\\n  Title I of the JOBS Act has proven to be a real policy success, and \\nCongress and the SEC should continue to advance policy that will reduce \\nor eliminate barriers to economic growth.\\n  Mr. Speaker, I applaud Mr. Budd and Mr. Meeks for their work on this \\nimportant piece of legislation. I appreciate our chairman, Mr. \\nHuizenga, for moving it expeditiously through our committee; and our \\nchairman, Mr. Hensarling, for presiding over it.\\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes.''\", u'turn': 10, u'speaker': u'Mr. DAVIDSON', u'itemno': 17}, {u'kind': u'speech', u'speaker_bioguide': u'H001058', u'text': u'  Mr. HUIZENGA. Mr. Speaker, I yielded myself the balance of my time.\\n  Mr. Speaker, in closing, we know that trillions of dollars are \\ninvested in our economy through IRAs, 401(k)s, and other investment \\ntools. However, these companies need to be publicly traded for Joe and \\nJane IRA or Mr. and Mrs. 401(k) to even be able to have the opportunity \\nto invest in them. That is what this bill is trying to do.\\n  This bill is trying to make sure that those emerging companies, those \\nsmall startup kind of companies, who may be very innovative or, \\nfrankly, might be even more mundane, but they are small and they are \\nlooking to grow, that they have an opportunity to do so.\\n  Who benefits? Everyone. Everyone is going to be able to take a much \\nmore broad view of how they are going to invest their hard-earned \\ndollars that they have worked so long and hard for.\\n  Mr. Speaker, this is also, I believe, an important aspect, because we \\nknow that economic growth comes from small- and medium-sized \\nbusinesses. That is where we are going to see really the engine of our \\neconomy rev up.\\n  It is maybe not as much of a headline grabber as some of those big \\ncompanies adding 100 or 200 or even thousands of jobs, but all of those \\nsmaller companies adding people into the workforce add up to far larger \\nnumbers than those numbers are.\\n  Mr. Speaker, I ask all of my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R. \\n3903, and I yield back the balance of my time.', u'turn': 11, u'speaker': u'Mr. HUIZENGA', u'itemno': 18}, {u'kind': u'speech', u'speaker_bioguide': None, u'text': u'  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Ten years later, the library stands as a pillar \\nof the Oakton community and I am confident that it will continue to \\nserve that role for many more decades to come.\\n   I wish to give special recognition to the members of the Friends of \\nOakton Library, who worked with myself and others side by side on every \\nstep of this project. Together, we guided what was once just a concept \\ninto a brick-and-mortar reality.\\n   We are incredibly fortunate in Fairfax County to have such dedicated \\ncitizens, who go out of their way for the betterment of the lives of \\nothers. I have often said that local government is where the rubber \\nmeets the road. The level of accountability is absolute. You either \\nsolved the problem or you didn't . . . and everyone knows where you \\nlive and has your phone number! My colleagues on the Board of \\nSupervisors and I accomplished a lot together during my time in Fairfax \\nCounty government, but the completion of the Oakton Library remains one \\nof my proudest moments in local government. A testament to what can \\nhappen when like-minded individuals are willing to back up their words \\nand desires with concrete, often unglamorous actions. The Oakton \\ncommunity and indeed all of Fairfax County is better off today because \\npeople were willing to put in the work.\\n   Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating the \\nFriends of Oakton Library and the entire Oakton community on this \\nimportant anniversary. I commend them for their contributions to \\nFairfax County and wish them great success in all their future \\nendeavors. I am confident that we will be observing many more \\nanniversaries of this library still to come.\\n\", u'turn': 0, u'speaker': u'Mr. CONNOLLY', u'itemno': 2}, {u'kind': u'linebreak', u'speaker_bioguide': None, u'text': u'                          ____________________\\n\\n\\n', u'turn': -1, u'speaker': u'None', u'itemno': 3}], u'header': {u'extension': True, u'vol': u'163', u'wkday': u'Wednesday', u'chamber': u'House', u'num': u'177', u'year': u'2017', u'month': u'November', u'pages': u'E1483', u'day': u'1'}, u'doc_title': u'RECOGNIZING THE 10TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE OAKTON LIBRARY', u'id': u'CREC-2017-11-01-pt1-PgE1483-4', u'title': u'RECOGNIZING THE 10TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE OAKTON LIBRARY'}{u'content': [{u'text': u'           2017 WOMAN OF THE YEAR AWARD WINNER--BECKY MARIGO\\n', u'kind': u'Unknown', u'speaker': u'Unknown', u'itemno': 0, u'turn': -1}], u'header': {u'extension': True, u'vol': u'163', u'wkday': u'Wednesday', u'chamber': u'House', u'num': u'177', u'year': u'2017', u'month': u'November', u'pages': u'E1477-E1478', u'day': u'1'}, u'doc_title': u'2017 WOMAN OF THE YEAR AWARD WINNER--BECKY MARIGO', u'id': u'CREC-2017-11-01-pt1-PgE1477-6', u'title': None}{u'content': [{u'text': u'  Pursuant to clause 7 of rule XII of the Rules of the House of \\nRepresentatives, the following statements are submitted regarding the \\nspecific powers granted to Congress in the Constitution to enact the \\naccompanying bill or joint resolution.\\n\\n\\n', u'kind': u'Unknown', u'speaker': u'Unknown', u'itemno': 0, u'turn': -1}], u'header': {u'extension': False, u'vol': u'163', u'wkday': u'Wednesday', u'chamber': u'House', u'num': u'177', u'year': u'2017', u'month': u'November', u'pages': u'H8385', u'day': u'1'}, u'doc_title': u'Constitutional Authority Statement', u'id': u'CREC-2017-11-01-pt1-PgH8385', u'title': u'CONSTITUTIONAL AUTHORITY STATEMENT'}{u'content': [{u'kind': u'speech', u'speaker_bioguide': u'M000355', u'text': u\"  Mr. McCONNELL.

We are working hard on joint \\nlegislative initiatives on tax reform.\\n  We have also undertaken what has been described as ``the most \\nambitious regulatory rollback since Reagan.'' The administration has \\nthe ability to take serious action on its own, and it has. The Congress \\nhas taken important action many times as well. We have used the tools \\ncontained in the Congressional Review Act, which allows us to overturn \\ncertain regulations with a majority vote in Congress and the \\nPresident's signature. The President signed all of the many CRA \\nresolutions we passed already, which overturned regulations that \\nthreatened everything from job creation to economic growth.\\n  The President will sign another CRA resolution today, one that will \\noverturn a regulation that threatened to drive up costs for millions of \\nAmericans who carry a credit card. It is a regulation dreamed up by a \\ngovernment agency, the CFPB, that claims to protect consumers but seems \\nto have found a way to actually harm them. The Treasury Department \\nreleased a study showing how this regulation has little to do with \\nconsumer protection and everything to do with lining the pockets of \\ntrial lawyers. This unaccountable agency ignored that study and issued \\nits regulation anyway.\\n  We passed this Congressional Review Act resolution to protect \\nconsumers from wrongdoing while avoiding frivolous lawsuits that will \\nonly drive up costs for the millions of Americans who have a credit \\ncard.

Mr. Speaker, I think it is appropriate this morning \\nto rise to share my passion and my love for this country, but also my \\nfrustration. I will use this graphic to set the tone for my remarks \\nthis morning.\\n  Although the Republican tax proposal will be introduced tomorrow, I \\nbelieve, if you look at this graphic and the headlines, it says that 80 \\npercent of the tax relief will not go to you and you and you and to the \\nAmerican people, or maybe even staff and Members who are here who are \\nAmericans, salaried individuals; it will go, 80 percent, to the 1 \\npercent of Americans.\\n  Now, I am not going to talk about the tax legislation this morning. I \\nwant this to be a symbol of the wrongness of the direction of this \\ncountry and the leader who leads this Nation. We are going down a wrong \\npath.\\n  Many of us thought we had come together in unity, we had overcome the \\ndivisiveness because we were different,\\n\\n\\nwe had recognized the beauty of all of us, rural citizens in West \\nVirginia, Ohioans in the mountains of the Appalachian area, \\nMidwesterners, Southerners, Northerners, Westerners, Far West, \\nimmigrant and nonimmigrant. But, unfortunately, in 2016, although some \\nlost and some won, as we moved toward a new administration with the \\nhopes and dreams of those who had voted, we looked for the unifying of \\nwhat I know that all Presidents have done.\\n  It has been a privilege of mine to work with President William \\nJefferson Clinton, who didn't have an easy time but sought to unify the \\ncountry. I worked with President George W. Bush, who did not have an \\neasy time or an unconflicted election but sought to unify the country, \\nin fact, was an enthusiastic signer of the reauthorization of the \\nVoting Rights Act; and President Barack Obama, who rode in on a sense \\nof hope and unity. That is the task of a President.\\n  In the midst of this, again, having been appointed to the Homeland \\nSecurity Committee in the ashes of 9/11, having gone to Ground Zero \\nwhile our brave first responders were recovering, were still looking \\nfor remains--it will penetrate my soul forever--unity was what we \\nsought in spite of our difference of opinions.\\n  So I rise to thank the first responders and the quick response of the \\nNYPD and Fire Department on yesterday's terrorist act. Yes, it was a \\nterrorist act. We live in a different world. But rather than rise to \\nthe occasion, this morning the words come from the White House:\\n\\n       The terrorist came into our country through what is called \\n     the ``Diversity Visa Lottery Program,'' a Chuck Schumer \\n     beauty. I want merit-based immigration.\\n\\n  You tell me how many immigrants, how many Italians, how many Irish, \\nand how many of those who escaped the Holocaust, who came before that \\nfrom the Jewish community, how many of them would have met any test of \\nmerit. Did the slaves who were brought here as slaves meet a test of \\nmerit? All of these individuals helped build this Nation.\\n  And on the morning when people are mourning of their lost loved ones, \\nrather than bringing the country together, there is a politicizing, \\ncalling out names of Members. We are working on merit based.\\n  Does he even understand what merit based is? Absolutely not.\\n  Taking away from the conspiracy charge against Manafort, taking away \\nfrom the conspicuous collusion with Russians that George Papadopoulos \\nhas indicated, oh, he is worrying about him lying. But I am worrying \\nabout him telling the truth, and he is. They wanted dirty stuff on the \\nopponent; they wanted to work with Russia; they wanted to work with \\nPutin; and they wanted to conspire against the United States of \\nAmerica--as well as the misunderstanding or the devastating comments of \\nhis chief of staff about the civil war and NFL players being called \\ninmates in a prison.\\n  Mr. Speaker, I am fed up with dividing this Nation. We are going in \\nthe wrong direction, and I am not going to accept it. I am taking a \\nknee with all of those who believe in justice and what is right. I did \\nit before. I do it now.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition \\nof the American Museum of Tort Law, located in Winsted, CT, which \\ncelebrated its second anniversary on September 25, 2017. In honor of \\nits history and continued importance as a national educational \\ninstitution, I would like to commemorate the museum and celebrate this \\nmilestone.\\n   Since its founding by Ralph Nader, the American Museum of Tort Law \\nhas attracted national acclaim from media outlets including Politico, \\nthe New Yorker, the Boston Globe and the Washington Post. Its vital \\nimportance to our citizenry has been recognized by former Supreme Court \\nJustice Sandra Day O'Connor. Thousands of people have attended the \\nmuseum and have come away educated, entertained, and impressed by its \\npresentation.\\n   The mission of this unique institution is to educate, inform, and \\ninspire Americans about their legal system, with a focus on the right \\nof trial by jury and the benefits of tort law. Through school group \\nvisits, self-guided tours, quality curated programing, and its website, \\nthe museum has shown true dedication towards the fostering of greater \\ncivic knowledge and awareness.\\n   Moving forward, the museum has an ambitious plan to expand, \\nincluding not just on-site operations, but broadening its reach by \\ntraveling across the country and becoming a resource for practitioners, \\njudges, and legal scholars.\\n   I have thoroughly enjoyed the opportunity to personally visit the \\nAmerican Museum of Tort Law. As a former history teacher, I can attest \\nto the tremendous value this museum provides through the details and \\nhistorical context that brings to life the law and justice.
