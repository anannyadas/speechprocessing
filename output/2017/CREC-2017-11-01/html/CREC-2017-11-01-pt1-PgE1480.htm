                      Wednesday, November 1, 2017

  Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize the Asian-American 
Chamber of Commerce and the recipients of the 2017 Excellence Awards.
   The Asian-American Chamber of Commerce (AACC) is dedicated to 
improving economic development opportunities for Asian Pacific 
American-owned businesses in the Washington, DC, region. Northern 
Virginia has a robust international business community and is home to 
the largest concentration of minority-owned technology firms in the 
nation.
   The AACC and its members contribute greatly to our regional culture 
as well as to our economic strength and stability. In fact, Asian-
American businesses generate more than 52 percent of total revenues 
generated by all minority owned businesses in this region. In Fairfax 
County, approximately 25,000 businesses are Asian-owned and generate 
approximately $9 billion in annual revenue, creating 54,000 jobs.
   Each year, the AACC recognizes individuals, businesses and non-
profit organizations that have made extraordinary contributions to the 
Metropolitan Washington community and economy. I am pleased to include 
in the Record the names of the following recipients of the 2017 
Excellence Awards:
   Member of the Year: Stephanie Shei.
   Business of the Year: University of North America, State Farm.
   Young Professional of the Year: Jhenileen Libongco.
   Citizen/Company of the Year: Jon Peterson, The Peterson Company.
   Non-Profit of the Year: AAPIVote.
   Asian-American Business Leader: Dr. James S.C. Chao, The Foremost 
Group.
   New Business of the Year: Logos Briosystems.
   Chamber Partner: Central Intelligence Agency, Corner Media, MGM.
   Mentorship Award: Dr. Gary Jones, Youth for Tomorrow.
   Community Leader: Christina Chang, Chiling Tong.
   Entrepreneurship of the Year: Terry Hsaio, Hook Mobile, Inc.
   Chairman and President's Award: Haiwen Mackleer, Capital Bank.
   Mr. Speaker, I ask that my colleagues join me in congratulating the 
recipients of the 2017 Excellence Awards and in commending the AACC for 
its work to support all Asian-American owned businesses throughout our 
region.
