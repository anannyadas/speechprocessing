   RECOGNIZING DR. CHERIF SADKI AS THE 2017 OUTSTANDING HIGH SCHOOL 
                         PRINCIPAL OF VIRGINIA

                                 ______
                                 

                        HON. GERALD E. CONNOLLY

                              of virginia

                    in the house of representatives

                      Wednesday, November 1, 2017

  Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Dr. Cherif 
Sadki, principal of Gar-Field Senior High School, as the 2017 
Outstanding High School Principal of Virginia.
   Each year, the Virginia Association of Secondary School Principals, 
which is the seventh largest school administrators' organization in the 
National Association of Secondary School Principals, selects a 
principal to represent the state as the nominee for the National 
Principal of the Year Program.
   As the 2017 nominee, Dr. Sadki is commended for his ``creativity and 
imagination in bringing about positive change, improving the 
educational program and student achievement; ensuring a school climate 
that reflects high staff and student morale; and for involving the 
community in the life of the school.''
   At the helm of Gar-Field Senior High School for the past five years, 
Dr. Sadki has implemented countless policy changes and program 
adjustments to address the needs of the increasingly diverse student 
population. Of the roughly 2,500 students enrolled in Gar-Field Senior 
High School last year, approximately half spoke a language other than 
English at home. One to never shy away from a challenge, Dr. Sadki 
rolled up his sleeves, transformed the teaching model, and embedded 
English instruction into the core curriculum to meet the needs of the 
diverse student body.
   For his foresight, engagement of the community, and commitment to 
ensuring that all students receive a world-class education, it is my 
honor to include in the Record, Dr. Cherif Sadki.
   Dr. Sadki is the standard-bearer at the regional and national level 
for educating English learners. He attributes much of his success in

reshaping the mission of Gar-Field Senior High School to the efforts of 
a supportive community, a focused group of educators, and a dedicated 
administrative staff. Instead of seeing students who embraced a failing 
attitude, he saw children who had not been given an opportunity to 
succeed. Dr. Sadki saw teachers who needed encouragement, training and 
support and a community that could be convinced that success was 
possible.
   I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing Dr. Cherif Sadki, 
principal of Gar-Field Senior High School on his selection as the 2017 
Outstanding High School Principal for Virginia. His leadership and 
dedication to the students, teachers, and faculty as he works to ensure 
a bright future for all who pass through the doors of Gar-Field Senior 
High School is truly commendable and worthy of our highest praise.
