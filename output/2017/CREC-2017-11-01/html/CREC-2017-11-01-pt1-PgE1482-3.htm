   HONORING LIEUTENANT COLONEL GERY BRENT TRUITT, U.S. ARMY (RETIRED)

                                 ______

                    in the house of representatives

                      Wednesday, November 1, 2017

  Mr. CARTER of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Lieutenant 
Colonel Gery Brent Truitt, U.S. Army Retired, of Harker Heights, Texas, 
for his dedication to our country while serving 25 years in the Army. 
LTC Truitt exemplifies what it means to commit his life to his country 
and has more than earned our admiration and respect. He is a deserving 
recipient of a Congressional Veteran Commendation.
  Upon his commissioning as a Second Lieutenant from Sam Houston State 
University in 1979, LTC Truitt began his military career as an Infantry 
Officer with the Texas National Guard and then entered the United 
States Army. As Lieutenant, he conducted more combat patrols inside the 
Korean demilitarized zone than any other officer in the 2nd Infantry 
Division, and as Major, he served in a variety of 5th Special Forces 
Group assignments. Just prior to being promoted to Lieutenant Colonel, 
he was diagnosed with terminal colon cancer, which he successfully 
overcame in the next year. LTC Truitt used that time to revive the 
Columbus State University ROTC Program as a professor in Military 
Science.
  This brave soldier is also a committed citizen. Following his 
military career, he continued to support the military in the Central 
Texas Special Forces Association. As President, he is responsible for 
an annual raffle that raises thousands of dollars annually to support 
homeless veterans' programs and local non-profit organizations to meet 
immediate community needs. His work to make his community a great place 
to live and work have made lasting and positive impacts on the region.
  I commend LTC Truitt's selfless service to his community and nation. 
His dedication to our country and community reflects the best values of 
central Texas. I join his family and friends in saluting his great work 
and dedication to our country.
