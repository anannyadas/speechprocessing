                       RECOGNIZING MARY BETH COYA

                                 ______
                                 

                        HON. GERALD E. CONNOLLY

                              of virginia

                    in the house of representatives

                      Wednesday, November 1, 2017

  Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize someone who has had a 
profound impact on the Northern Virginia community, Ms. Mary Beth Coya. 
I have been proud to partner with Mary Beth on many issues of 
importance to the residents of Northern Virginia and the quality of 
life we enjoy, and I consider her a good friend. This year marks 30 
years since Mary Beth Coya began her career with the Northern Virginia 
Association of Realtors (NVAR), beginning in 1987 as a Legislative 
Assistant. During her career, she has steadily advanced and currently 
serves as the Senior Vice President of Government and Public Affairs 
for NVAR.
   Prior to joining NVAR, Mary Beth began her career as a staff member 
with the Virginia House of Delegates Appropriations Committee in 
Richmond. From there she took her passion for advocacy to the private 
sector, where she lobbied at both the state and federal levels for a 
variety of associations and companies. Throughout her career, Mary Beth 
has used her knowledge and experience to advocate for policies that 
would improve the lives of the members of her community. This has 
perhaps most been felt in the area of transportation, where she serves 
as a member of the Board of Directors for the Northern Virginia 
Transportation Alliance (NVTA), a business-citizen coalition focused on 
advancing highway and transit projects of major importance to the 
region.

   I have worked with Mary Beth and the NVTA on efforts to construct 
the Silver Line Metrorail extension and the establishment of the 
Virginia Railway Express commuter rail system. In fact, NVTA was the 
first private sector organization to call for a dedicated funding 
source for Metro, which is a goal that I share.
   Mary Beth's career with NVAR and her role as a Board Member for the 
Northern Virginia Transportation Alliance are inextricably intertwined. 
At NVAR, she has been an experienced and expert advocate for the 
advancement of major legislation in the Commonwealth of Virginia. She 
was instrumental in obtaining dedicated regional and statewide 
transportation funding and has a passion for protecting the real estate 
industry. Due to her strong relationships with elected leaders at all 
levels of government and her extensive historical knowledge of the 
region, she has been an effective voice in ensuring that Northern 
Virginia remains one of the best places in the country in which to 
live, work, play, and raise a family.
   Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating Mary 
Beth Coya on the occasion of her 30th Anniversary with the Northern 
Virginia Association of Realtors and in commending her for her 
dedication to the betterment of our region. I am pleased to have had 
the opportunity to partner with her and NVAR on numerous issues and I 
look forward to continuing to work with her going forward.
