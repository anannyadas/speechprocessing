         RECOGNIZING RED CREEK HIGH SCHOOL'S BLUE RIBBON AWARD

                                 ______
                                 

                            HON. JOHN KATKO

                              of new york

                    in the house of representatives

                      Wednesday, November 1, 2017

  Mr. KATKO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the outstanding 
students, faculty, and staff at Red Creek High School. The mission 
statement of the Red Creek Central School District is to educate 
students with equity, and help them master fundamental skills. I would 
like to commend the hard work of the Red Creek Central School District 
for making Red Creek High School a safe and welcoming place to learn.
   The National Blue Ribbon Schools Program recognizes public and 
private schools based on overall academic excellence or ability in 
closing achievement gaps among students. Every year the United States 
Department of Education seeks out, and honors, schools that tirelessly 
work to help students grow academically. Red Creek High School is one 
of just 19 New York State schools to receive the prestigious 
``Exemplary High Performing Schools'' award from the United States 
Department of Education this year.
   Since the Blue Ribbon Award was first created in 1982, only four 
other schools in Wayne-Finger Lakes region have garnered Blue Ribbon 
status. Red Creek High School was awarded its Blue Ribbon Award this 
year for the strong academic performance of its student body. The 
teachers and administrators at Red Creek High School work hard each day 
to make learning exciting, and encourage their students that they can 
achieve their goals both inside and outside of the classroom. I'm proud 
to recognize this stellar high school in my district, and applaud the 
students, parents, administrators and teachers for their efforts.
