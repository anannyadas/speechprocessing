                      Wednesday, November 1, 2017

  Mr. CARTER of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Lieutenant 
Colonel Patrick J. Christ, U.S. Army, Retired, from Harker Heights, 
Texas, for his dedication to our country while serving over two decades 
in the Army. LTC Christ exemplifies what it means to commit his life to 
his country and community; he is a deserving recipient of a 
Congressional Veteran Commendation.
  LTC Christ has shown sincere dedication throughout his 23 years in 
the Army. His commitment to serving his country can be seen through his 
extensive list of medals, including the Southwest Asia Service Medal 
and the Vietnam Service Medal. In addition to his superb work defending 
our nation, LTC Christ held important leadership positions in the 
Military Officers Association of America and the Association of the 
United States Army.
  After retiring from the U.S. Army in 1992, LTC Christ continued to 
dedicate his time to worthy causes. He has served as a city council 
member in the city of Harker Heights, on the Board of Directors for 
Hill Country Transit, and the Chamber of Commerce. LTC Christ lives a 
life dedicated to other veterans in his area by working closely with 
the Area Veterans Advisory Committee and by founding the Harker Heights 
Veterans' Council. LTC Christ is thoroughly involved in many sports 
organizations in his area, namely the Tri-County Soccer Club and the 
T.J. Zimmerman Soccer Tournament which he holds leadership positions 
in, as well as many other soccer associations. LTC Christ has logged 
hundreds of volunteer hours in many organizations, including as Admiral 
of the Texas Navy for Governor Rick Perry. Community activists like him 
make Central Texas a great place to live and work.
  I commend LTC Christ for his service to his community and country. I 
join his family and friends in saluting his dedication to our country, 
and being an embodiment of Central Texas values.
