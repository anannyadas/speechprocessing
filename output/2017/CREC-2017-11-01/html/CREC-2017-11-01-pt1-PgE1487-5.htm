                      Wednesday, November 1, 2017

  Mr. YOUNG of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and 
congratulate the Waukee High School Boy's Swimming Team for winning 
their second consecutive team state championship on February 11, 2017.
  In winning their consecutive title, the Waukee High School Boys 
Swimming Team doubled their team points from their first championship 
last year. During the meet, they were able to grab state championships 
in three individual events, and all three of their relay events 
finished runner up. I would like to congratulate each member of the 
Team:
