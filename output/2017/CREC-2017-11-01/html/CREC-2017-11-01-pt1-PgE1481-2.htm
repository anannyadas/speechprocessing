                       RECOGNIZING EILEEN CURTIS

                                 ______
                                 

                        HON. GERALD E. CONNOLLY

                              of virginia

                    in the house of representatives

                      Wednesday, November 1, 2017

  Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize an individual 
who has had a tremendous impact on Northern Virginia. Eileen Curtis, 
President and CEO of the Dulles Regional Chamber of Commerce, is 
retiring after leading the Chamber since 1994.
   During her tenure, the Dulles Chamber has established itself as one 
of the leading business advocacy groups in the region, adding to the 
quality of life for our residents in the Dulles Corridor and beyond. I 
have been proud to work with the Chamber on a host of issues, perhaps 
most significant being Rail to Dulles. The Chamber was instrumental in 
the foundation of the Dulles Corridor Rail Association, which helped 
lobby for federal funding which was eventually secured to help 
construct the Silver Line. The 23-mile long Silver Line has spurred 
major economic development along the Dulles Corridor and has been 
singled out by Fairfax County executives as one of the main reasons 
behind Fairfax County's continued economic success.
   In addition to Rail to Dulles, Eileen has worked with the Chamber to 
enhance the region in other ways including advocating for STEM 
education in our schools, forging partnerships with the business and 
education communities, creating greater opportunities for our immigrant 
community, and establishing new local festivals and events to bring the 
community together. These efforts are among the many reasons why 
Northern Virginia is routinely recognized as one of the best places in 
the United States in which to live, work, raise a family, and start a 
business.
   Eileen's efforts have been drawn recognition from across the region. 
The Chamber's efforts in education have been honored by Fairfax County 
Public Schools on multiple occasions and the Washington Business 
Journal routinely lists the Dulles Chamber as being one of the largest 
in membership. Eileen herself has been recognized as Woman of the Year 
by the Herndon Business & Professional Women and as Executive of the 
Year by the Virginia Association of Chambers of Commerce Executives. 
These accolades speak to the strength of Eileen as a leader and the 
dedication that she has shown to our community. There can be no doubt 
of the positive impact that she has had on our community and our region 
is better for her efforts.
   Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating Eileen 
Curtis on her retirement and in thanking her for her outstanding 
service to Fairfax County and Northern Virginia. While she may be 
retiring, I am confident that she will remain engaged on the issues 
that are close to her heart. I wish her great success in all her future 
endeavors.
