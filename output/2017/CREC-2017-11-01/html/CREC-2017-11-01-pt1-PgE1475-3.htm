                WISCONSIN MILITARY ACADEMY HALL OF FAME

                                 ______
                                 

                          HON. MIKE GALLAGHER

                              of wisconsin

                    in the house of representatives

                      Wednesday, November 1, 2017

  Mr. GALLAGHER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor and recognize LTC 
Joseph McGrath for his induction into the Wisconsin Military Academy 
Hall of Fame. LTC McGrath's long and distinguished career is 
highlighted by the numerous accolades and successes he achieved during 
his service in the United States Army and Wisconsin Army National 
Guard.
   LTC McGrath has been an integral factor in protecting America's 
security interests here at home, while also spreading peace around the 
world. Following the tragic events of September 11, 2001, LTC McGrath 
deployed to Nicaragua to help ensure the security of the Nicaraguan 
President and establish the future success of the joint Wisconsin-
Nicaragua partnership.
   In 2004, LTC McGrath was deployed to Afghanistan to direct 
operations in support of the Kandak ETT comprised of American and 
Coalition partners. LTC McGrath was also instrumental in providing 
direct liaison with the UN Ballot Counting teams, while also 
coordinating physical security for the provincial ballot collection 
compound during the Afghan Presidential election.
   Upon his return to the United States, LTC McGrath's leadership led 
to the creation of the Warrant Officer Candidate School at the 426th 
Regiment, a fiscally responsible move that brought greater strength and 
security to Wisconsin.
   LTC McGrath received the Bronze Star, among many other awards, for 
his honorable service and dedication to our country. LTC McGrath's 
commitment and courage have left a profound impact on the men and women 
he led and served with across the world, as well as continued security 
of our great nation.
   Mr. Speaker, I urge all members of this body to join me in 
commending LTC Joseph McGrath for his dedicated military service and 
congratulate his induction into the Wisconsin Military Academy Hall of 
Fame.
