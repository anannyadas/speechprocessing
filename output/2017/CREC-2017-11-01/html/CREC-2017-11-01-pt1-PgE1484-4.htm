                      Wednesday, November 1, 2017

  Mr. CARTER of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Captain Skip 
Blancett, USN, Retired of Salado, Texas. With a career spanning over 
two decades, CAPT Blancett is a true patriot, a faith-filled citizen, 
and unquestionably a deserving recipient of a Congressional Veteran 
Commendation.
  CAPT Blancett joined the Navy at age 29 and was stationed in Guam, 
where he helped fulfill the spiritual needs of others. CAPT Blancett 
went on to serve his country in eight other stations around the world, 
with duties ranging from Public Affairs Officer, to teaching a course 
in the Naval War College, to furthering the spiritual state of his 
fellow sailors through various tactics with the Chaplain Corps.
  CAPT Blancett's love of country is matched only by his commitment to 
his community. Upon retirement, the call to serve continued to burn 
inside. CAPT Blancett has gracefully served as Mayor of Salado since 
2014 where he has been a champion of the Village's growing economy and 
its hard-working citizens. He is beloved by the Village of Salado for 
his leadership, commitment to faith, and passion for his community.
  CAPT Blancett serves the people of Salado with the same dedication, 
honor, and humility with which he served his country. He is an 
exemplary man who shows the utmost commitment to his family, community, 
and above all, his faith. May we all follow the example of great men 
such as CAPT Blancett, and live a life of hard work, loyalty and 
service to others.
