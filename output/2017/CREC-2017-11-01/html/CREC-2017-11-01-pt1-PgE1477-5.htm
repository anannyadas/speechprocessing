                      Wednesday, November 1, 2017

  Mr. CARTER of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Staff 
Sergeant Rufus Honeycutt, USMC, for his dedication and commitment to 
our country. SSG Honeycutt's extraordinary devotion to community and 
service reflects the best values of Central Texas. He is a fitting and 
worthy recipient of a Congressional Veteran Commendation.
  SSG Honeycutt enlisted in the United States Marine Corps in 1960, and 
spent six years proudly defending his country. His military career 
included wartime deployment with the first combat unit to see action in 
Vietnam and earned him numerous awards and medals including the Armed 
Forces Expeditionary Medal for Vietnam Service.
  Following his military career, Rufus has served those around him with 
boundless altruism and exemplary leadership. A profoundly respected 
pillar of the Round Rock community, SSG Honeycutt has dedicated his 
time to numerous community organizations, including six years of 
service on the Round Rock City Council. He continues to support fellow 
veterans by providing transportation to the VA, working as the Blood 
Drive Coordinator at Ft. Hood, and much more. He has volunteered 
countless hours in his community, and has consistently placed his 
neighbors' needs before his own. For these reasons and many more, his 
community carne together in 2002 to honor Rufus Honeycutt as Round Rock 
Citizen of the Year.
  SSG Honeycutt is a hero who has devoted his life to defending our 
freedoms abroad and serving his community at home. Dedicated public 
servants like him make Central Texas a great place to live. I join his 
family and friends in saluting his honored work and commitment to our 
country.
