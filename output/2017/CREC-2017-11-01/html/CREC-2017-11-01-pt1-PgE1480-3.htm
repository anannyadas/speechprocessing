                                 ______
                                 

                        HON. GERALD E. CONNOLLY

                    in the house of representatives

                      Wednesday, November 1, 2017

  Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize the Annandale 
Christian Community for Action (ACCA) on the occasion of its 50th 
anniversary. In 1967, Fred and Emily Ruffing realized that there was a 
great need for childcare services for low-income and working poor 
families who did not qualify for subsidized daycare. They decided that 
they needed to take action to address this problem so they organized a 
meeting with representatives from eight local churches to set up a day 
care center and ACCA was born.
   Since 1967, ACCA has continued to grow not only in size but in the 
number of services provided. What began as a group of eight churches 50 
years ago has grown to 26 member congregations. ACCA has also partnered 
with the Fairfax County Department of Neighborhood and Community 
Services (NCS) and its services and programs as well as the model of 
faith community and government partnership begun by ACCA has been 
replicated all throughout Fairfax County.
   ACCA gives back to the community in a variety of ways. The Child 
Development Center (CDC) provides both developmental childcare and 
early childhood education to over 200 toddlers, preschoolers and 
infants. The ACCA Pantry collects from churches, schools, community 
groups and local businesses and delivers food and other necessities on 
an emergency basis to area households. ACCA's Emergency Assistance 
program handles financial emergencies such as payment for rent, 
utilities, prescription drugs, and minor car repairs for low-income 
families who have few resources to fall back on in a time of crisis.
   The 26 partner ministries provide a safety net while the families 
recover stability. Furniture ministry volunteers collect and distribute 
gently used furniture to needy recipients, while volunteers from the 
Transportation ministry provide rides to medical appointments. Meals on 
Wheels volunteers deliver meals every weekday to elderly residents who 
cannot fend for themselves. ACCA volunteers also spend a Saturday in 
April repairing houses--more than 110 homes have been repaired or 
rehabilitated since 1990. With the exception of the CDC, all of these 
services are provided by volunteers.
   Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in thanking the staff 
and volunteers of ACCA and in congratulating them on this incredible 
milestone. Civic engagement is the foundation of a healthy community, 
and Fairfax County residents enjoy an exceptional quality of life due 
in part to the efforts of these individuals. Their contributions have 
been a great benefit to our community and truly merit our highest 
praise.
