                    in the house of representatives

                      Wednesday, November 1, 2017

  Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Barbara 
Beckworth, a community activist in Dixon, California, and small 
business owner with a heart of service and a strong desire to help 
others. She has been involved in nearly every organization and club in 
the Dixon area and has served in many leadership roles.
  Barbara's commitment and love for her community as a leader is 
reflected by her involvement in several committees and organizations. 
She was past Chair and Member of the Governmental Affairs Committee 
where she continues to moderate the candidate's forums, she sits on 
several scholarship committees for the students at Dixon High School, 
and she's also served as past president for the Dixon Chamber of 
Commerce and Dixon Downtown Business Association. Her desire to make 
Dixon a better place didn't stop there. She also is past president of 
Lambtown USA and is involved every year in the annual Dixon May Fair 
Parade.
  Barbara is a true civic leader. There are many words to describe 
Barbara: graceful, elegant, beautiful, but most of all she is simply 
the nicest person one would ever meet. She was honored with the Dixon 
Citizen of the Year in 1989 and is considered an icon in Dixon who is 
loved by all who know her. Barbara is also known for her beloved dress 
shop that was in Downtown Dixon for many years.
