  Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Mrs. Barbara 
Graham of Vacaville, California, who exemplifies the qualities of 
selfless service and boundless giving of herself to the betterment of 
others. A woman of great faith, Barbara has been a pillar of the 
Vacaville community for many years. In the late 80's, she with husband 
and co-pastor, Willie Graham, founded the Christian Body Life Church in 
Vacaville where she serves and has served as Sunday School Teacher, 
Preacher, Choir member, Head of the Women's Department, and servant to 
any needy family of the congregation.
   In 1999, Mrs. Graham answered the call to assist the Vacaville 
Police Department in establishing resource for victims of domestic 
violence. This program provides food, clothing, counseling, and many 
other free referral services in collaboration with city and county 
services. Since 2013, Barbara has also served as the Chapel Coordinator 
for David Grant Medical Center at Travis Air Force Base where she 
oversees hospitality and all aspects of daily operation and church 
services.
   Barbara is a Board Member of Safe Quest Solano, a domestic violence 
shelter for women and their children, and was also integral to 
establishing the Supervised Visiting Care Program in collaboration with 
the Solano County Courts to provide safe spaces for troubled families 
to have visitations and promote positive joint custody child exchanges.
