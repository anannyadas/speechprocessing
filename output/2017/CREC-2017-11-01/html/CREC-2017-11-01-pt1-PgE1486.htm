                             of california

                    in the house of representatives

                      Wednesday, November 1, 2017

  Ms. ROYBAL-ALLARD. Mr. Speaker, I rise to congratulate the City of 
Bell on its 90th anniversary. I am deeply honored to represent this 
city as part of California's 40th Congressional District, and I ask my 
colleagues to join me in paying tribute to Bell and its residents on 
the city's anniversary.
  The foundation of the City of Bell can be traced back to the arrival 
of the first group of settlers in the mid-1870s. Among the settlers 
were the city founder James George Bell and his wife and children. They 
moved to a property on Gage Avenue that is now known as the Bell House. 
The house is now a historic landmark filled with antique furnishings, 
vintage clothing, and photographs, and is open for the public to visit.
  In 1898, the town's name was officially changed from Rancho San 
Antonio to Bell, in honor of its pioneer founders. The City of Bell was 
incorporated in 1927 and is a small, vibrant community composed of 
young families, small businesses, and an industrial district.
  Between 1920 and 1935, Bell experienced a growth spurt where schools, 
businesses, and community organizations were established, such as the 
Bell Chamber of Commerce and Bell High School.
  Since its incorporation, the city has expanded its facilities, 
obtained land for public parks and recreational areas, and acquired 
basic amenities such as a city hall, parks, a fire department building, 
and a police department.
  The city has recently enhanced transparency and accountability within 
the city government. In 2013, the city's website earned an A- from a 
non-profit organization that examines state and local government 
transparency. Through the city website, the public can now watch live 
streaming council meetings, look up city contracts, view warrant 
payments and public officials' salaries and compensations, and review 
budget information.
  Over the years, Bell has become a vibrant city with an innovative 
approach to enhancing its services and infrastructure in order to 
support its growing community. Bell encourages programs that provide 
recreational activities and community services, preserve and improve 
the environment, and protect the safety of Bell residents.
  In 2016, the Bell City Council adopted a five-year strategic plan, 
which outlines the top five targets for the city: economic development, 
community outreach, public image, developing and improving strong city 
management, and fiscal sustainability.
  Currently, the City of Bell is mostly composed of a large Latino 
population and a growing Lebanese American community. Bell's commitment 
to community engagement can be seen through the various programs it 
offers to youth, adults, and seniors.
  Over 700 children are participating in the city's soccer program and 
parents turn out in large numbers to support their kids. Some parents 
even become team coaches. The city has also developed new adult sports 
programs, and has been renovating parks by establishing maintenance 
procedures for the synthetic fields.
  Ernest Debs Park, which is home to the youth soccer program, includes 
a synthetic soccer field with covered bleachers and a covered fitness 
zone that are available to residents every day of the week. The largest 
park in the city is Veterans Memorial Park, which commemorates the 
contributions of war veterans to our country and our freedom. Veterans 
Memorial Park includes a veterans monument, a rose garden, a baseball 
field with stadium seating, two large park pavilions, and batting 
cages.
  Family events such as the city's annual street festival, the Summer 
Concert Series, and the Bell 5K Run/Walk have also been developed to 
promote community, health, and fitness in the city. The city's 
smartphone application has made it possible for its residents to report 
street improvements, pickup of bulky items, and graffiti removals 
through the touch of a button.
  The new City of Bell Technology Center has provided a safe learning 
environment where both adults and youth can access computers. This 
Technology Center provides free afterschool computer skills training 
classes, which include introductions to computer equipment and 
operation, word processing techniques, e-mail correspondence, and 
fundamental skills required for safe web access.
  As the City of Bell celebrates its 90th anniversary this month, the 
community will also be celebrating some of the following achievements: 
a ``Certificate of Achievement for Excellence in Financial Reporting'' 
by the Government Finance Officers Association of the United States and 
Canada; the establishment of a Planning Commission; the initiation of a 
``Business of the Month'' effort to highlight local businesses; a 
partnership with the Bell Chamber of Commerce to establish the Bell 
Family Food Truck Night; and adoption of the city's Strategic Plan and 
the new city logo.
  That new logo is shaped by a bell design, and includes the city's 
motto: ``Home . . . in the center of it all'' to inspire civic pride 
and civic engagement in the community.
  The City of Bell has made huge strides in the past couple of years 
and does not show any sign of slowing down. I ask my colleagues to join 
me in sending our best wishes and congratulations to Bell on its 90th 
anniversary. This small, diverse, vibrant community makes residents 
proud and visitors feel at home. I expect more great things to come in 
Bell's future.
