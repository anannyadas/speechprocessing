                        TRIBUTE TO JOHN ANDERSON

                                 ______
                                 

                            HON. DAVID YOUNG

                                of iowa

                    in the house of representatives

                      Wednesday, November 1, 2017

  Mr. YOUNG of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and 
congratulate John Anderson of Minburn, Iowa, who, along with his 
cousin, Andy Anderson of Cedar Falls, Iowa, became the first Iowans to 
climb to the summit of Mount Everest on the North Face.
  John and Andy have been climbing and hiking for over 10 years. When 
they decided to tackle the largest mountain in the world over a year 
ago, they began their training between heavy work schedules, preparing 
their bodies and minds for the physical and mental challenges such a 
climb presents. On the afternoon of May 21, all of their preparation 
paid off when they announced on their Facebook page that they had 
reached an elevation of 29,052 feet, the summit of Mt. Everest. 
Alongside the goal of just conquering the tallest mountain in the 
world, the cousins also used the opportunity to help raise awareness 
for veterans with PTSD. They plan to use the network they built in 
promoting this climb to help veterans and their families learn to use 
outdoor activities to help manage stress.
  Mr. Speaker, I am immensely proud of John and his cousin Andy for 
conquering the largest mountain in the world. I am honored to represent 
them in the United States Congress and it is with great pride that I 
recognize them today. I ask that my colleagues in the United States 
House of Representatives join me in congratulating John and Andy for 
this outstanding accomplishment and in wishing them both nothing but 
continued success.
