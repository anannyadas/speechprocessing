being named one of the 2016 Businesses of the Year at the Des Moines 
East and South Chamber of Commerce Annual Dinner and Awards Ceremony 
earlier this year.
  The Business of the Year award celebrates a local business that is 
dedicated to serving their community. RDG Planning and Design has 
helped to design numerous buildings, landscapes and interiors across 
the Midwest, but the company's dedication extends beyond their office 
walls. Their employees help embody one of the company's core principles 
of giving back to the community. From schools to churches, neighborhood 
associations to charities and non-profits, you'll find RDG employees 
devoting their time to making their communities a better place to live.
  Mr. Speaker, I am honored to represent Iowa businesses like RDG 
Planning and Design in the United States Congress and it is with great 
pride that I recognize them today. I ask that my colleagues in the 
United States House of Representatives join me in congratulating them 
for this outstanding recognition and in wishing them all nothing but 
continued success.
