TRIBUTE TO NEWARK BETH ISRAEL MEDICAL CENTER FOR PERFORMING ITS 1,000TH 
                            HEART TRANSPLANT

                                 ______
                                 

                       HON. DONALD M. PAYNE, JR.

                             of new jersey

                    in the house of representatives

                      Wednesday, November 1, 2017

  Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me as I rise to 
pay tribute to the Heart Failure Treatment and Transplant program at 
Newark Beth Israel Medical Center for performing its 1,000th heart 
transplant.
   Founded in 1901, Newark Beth Israel Medical Center is a regional 
care, teaching hospital that provides comprehensive health care 
services to local communities. Beth Israel is an important referral and 
treatment center for patients throughout northern New Jersey, and it is 
one of only two hospitals certified to perform heart transplants in the 
state. Staffed with more than 800 physicians, 3,200 employees, and 150 
volunteers, the hospital serves over 3 million patients each year.
   Newark Beth Israel Medical Center has long been a leader in cardiac 
care. It performed the first heart transplant in New Jersey in 1986. It 
was the first New Jersey hospital to use extracorporeal membrane 
oxygenation for babies awaiting transplants, and it pioneered the use 
of Left Ventricular Assist Devices for heart-transplant patients.
   In August, Beth Israel's Heart Failure Treatment and Transplant 
Program performed its 1,000th heart transplant. Only eleven other 
centers in the United States have reached this milestone. Newark Beth 
Israel Medical Center deserves to be recognized for its achievement. I 
am proud and honored to have this medical center investing in the 
health care of my constituents and the citizens of the State of New 
Jersey.
