                          HONORING DEE BRADEN

                                 ______
                                 

                           HON. JOHN SHIMKUS

                              of illinois

                    in the house of representatives

                      Wednesday, November 1, 2017

  Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Dee Braden for 
her service to the senior citizens of Coles County, Illinois.
  On December 31, 2017, Dee will be retiring from the Coles County 
Council on Aging (CCCA) after 41 years of service. Dee began her career 
at the CCCA as a Volunteer Recruiter and was soon promoted to the 
organization's Executive Director. Under Dee's leadership the (CCA was 
awarded three Illinois Governor Awards for Unique Distinction, one of 
which came after ten years of research, development, and fundraising 
that led to the construction of the 25,000 square foot LifeSpan Center 
in Charleston, Illinois.
  I have worked with Dee and the LifeSpan Center staff on several 
occasions to provide information to my constituents. Dee has always 
been most helpful and professional. It is clear she loves those she 
serves at LifeSpan and loves her community.
  While serving as the CCCA's Executive Director, Dee simultaneously 
served her community and its seniors in many other capacities by 
serving on multiple advisory boards and committees. Dee has been a true 
champion in her efforts to enhance the quality of life for older adults 
in her community.
  Mr. Speaker, I wish Dee nothing but the best in her retirement and 
thank her for her many years of dedicated service.
