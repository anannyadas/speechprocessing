              TRIBUTE TO CAPTAIN DENNIS DeWINE, U.S. ARMY

                                 ______
                                 

                          HON. JOHN R. CARTER

                                of texas

                    in the house of representatives

                      Wednesday, November 1, 2017

  Mr. CARTER of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the 
service and achievements of an esteemed and valued citizen, Captain 
Dennis DeWine, U.S. Army. He has dedicated himself to his community and 
nation and is an embodiment of the Army values of honor, loyalty, and 
selfless service. CPT DeWine is a fitting and worthy recipient of a 
Congressional Veteran Commendation.
  CPT DeWine joined the Army in 1967, graduated Helicopter Flight 
School in 1968, and spent the next seven years as a helicopter pilot; 
twenty months of which were two tours of duty in Vietnam. As a 
testament to his valorous service in Vietnam, the President of the 
United States presented CPT DeWine with the Distinguished Flying Cross 
award for his actions above and beyond the call of duty. After being 
Honorably Discharged CPT DeWine was inducted into the Ohio Military 
Hall of Fame for Valor.
  CPT DeWine's leadership skills have been invaluable throughout his 
post-military career. After rejoining civilian life, he became the 
founder, broker, and president of ERA Colonial Real Estate and Colonial 
Residential Properties, Inc. Despite his busy schedule, CPT DeWine 
remains dedicated to serving his community. He can often be found in 
jeans and boots working alongside his friends and neighbors. CPT 
DeWine's passion to serve is evident through his participation and 
leadership in numerous organizations, such as Central Texas Voices for 
Life, where he serves as Chairman. CPT DeWine has also proven his 
commitment to serving others through his company's efforts to 
successfully raise $100,000 for Muscular Dystrophy.
  Despite his business and charitable commitments, CPT DeWine has found 
time to raise a closeknit family, volunteer in community organizations, 
and remain active in his church. With admiration and deep respect, I 
pay tribute to Dennis DeWine for his sacrifices and the lasting impact 
he has had on his community and country
