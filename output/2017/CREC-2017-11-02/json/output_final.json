Madam Speaker, on Tuesday, we had the holiday of \\nHalloween, and a character came to my house with paint all over their \\nface, and I thought they were the musical group KISS. Well, they \\nweren't.\\n  They were the Trump administration, disguised as the Trump \\nadministration is, and with the simple logo of KISS: Keep it simple, \\nstupid. That is what the Trump administration's attempts are to the \\nAmerican people.\\n  The previous speaker made some comments about regulations and said \\nthat the Obama administration wanted to stop Second Amendment advocates \\nfrom getting guns, arbitrarily, for Social Security recipients. Well, \\nthat sounds good. It is simple. Keep it simple.\\n  Well, they weren't Social Security recipients. They were Social \\nSecurity recipients who had been declared incompetent to manage their \\nown affairs. That is who they said shouldn't get guns, not Social \\nSecurity recipients.\\n  The previous speaker said something about abortion provider Planned \\nParenthood getting their funds cut off. Planned Parenthood does most of \\ntheir work outside of the arena of abortion. Mostly, they do women's \\nbasic health services, and by cutting that off, they are hurting women, \\nparticularly in my community and other communities where poor people \\noften get their healthcare, their women's care, from Planned \\nParenthood, and they are depriving them of that healthcare.\\n  Just yesterday, in the subcommittee of which I am the ranking member, \\nwe had a hearing on changing Roe v. Wade. They called it the Heartbeat \\nbill. In reality, it is destruction of women's right to choose, a \\nfundamental right established in Roe v. Wade, and an unconstitutional \\nbill that could limit the right of a woman to have an abortion as early \\nas 6 weeks, while right now it is 20 to 24 weeks, the period of \\nviability.\\n  They brought a sonogram in and showed a sonogram on the monitor. What \\nthey didn't do when they talked about their ``culture of death'' was \\nbring in any lifesaving equipment that\\n\\n\\nwill not be available when they cut $1 billion from Medicaid and $500 \\nmillion from Medicare in their tax proposal, when they put 23 million \\npeople off of healthcare, the Affordable Care Act, which is what they \\ntried to do but couldn't accomplish.\\n  It is difficult to sit here and watch what is happening to our \\ncountry. Having the Trump administration tell the middle class they are \\ngoing to get a tax cut on the one hand, but on the other hand, they are \\ncreating over a trillion dollars in debt, where is that debt going to \\ncome from? It is going to come from programs that the middle class will \\nhave to give up, so they will be net losers.\\n  One of the main thrusts of their tax proposal is to eliminate the \\nState tax, originally to do it immediately. Now they are talking about \\nmaybe phasing it out over 5 or 6 years. That will cost the Federal \\nbudget $290 billion. That will come from Pell grants that give people \\nthe opportunity to go to college and not have a terrible debt over \\ntheir heads when they leave; from SNAP payments that give nutritional \\nbenefits to people that otherwise would go without, the families that \\nwould go without food and proper nutritional benefits; and even LIHEAP, \\nwhich gives help with heating bills to people who can't afford it in \\ndifficult winter conditions.\\n  What they are proposing is not a middle class tax cut. It is a cut \\nfor the wealthiest in our country, and that is who will get the \\nbenefits. That is who they are about.\\n  Their whole program is KISS: Keep it simple, stupid. That is the only \\nway they can try to sell their wealthy tax break, their aims to prevent \\nwomen from getting proper healthcare, and their attacks on women in \\ngeneral.\\n\\n  It is unfortunate what we see, what we saw earlier this week in the \\nindictments handed out to Mr. Manafort, Mr. Gates, and the guilty plea \\nof Mr. Papadopoulos. Individuals involved with the campaign and the \\nadministration have not been the best, as they were supposed to be. In \\nfact, they are suspected of criminal behavior, and one has admitted to \\nit.\\n  Our democracy is at risk, and I fear what could happen to it. That is \\nwhy I introduced an amendment to the Constitution to limit the \\nPresident's pardon power so he couldn't pardon himself, members of his \\nfamily, members of his administration, or paid members of his campaign \\nstaff.\\n  He has already pardoned Joe Arpaio, and he has threatened to use that \\npower in furtherance as he discussed the possibility of pardoning \\nhimself. If he does so, any of these pardons, it will be a test of our \\ndemocracy, and it will be a test of my colleagues on the other side.\\n  We must protect democracy and protect America from unlawful activity.\\n  God bless America.\\n\", u'turn': 1, u'speaker': u'Mr. COHEN', u'itemno': 1}, {u'kind': u'linebreak', u'speaker_bioguide': None, u'text': u'                          ____________________\\n\\n\\n', u'turn': -1, u'speaker': u'None', u'itemno': 2}], u'header': {u'extension': False, u'vol': u'163', u'wkday': u'Thursday', u'chamber': u'House', u'num': u'178', u'year': u'2017', u'month': u'November', u'pages': u'H8391-H8392', u'day': u'2'}, u'doc_title': u'KEEP IT SIMPLE, STUPID', u'id': u'CREC-2017-11-02-pt1-PgH8391-2', u'title': u'KEEP IT SIMPLE, STUPID'}{u'content': [{u'kind': u'linebreak', u'speaker_bioguide': None, u'text': u'                                 ______\\n', u'turn': -1, u'speaker': u'None', u'itemno': 0}, {u'kind': u'title', u'speaker_bioguide': None, u'text': u'                           HON.

Mr. President, on another matter, the Obama years were \\nnot easy for America's middle class. For many, steady work became \\nharder to find, paychecks stagnated, and opportunities faded. America's \\nmiddle class deserves better after a decade of drift, and we are \\nworking hard to deliver for them.\\n  Tax reform is the single most important thing we can do today to get \\nthe economy reaching for its true potential again. That is why the \\nSenate recently passed the legislative tools to advance it. That is why \\nthe House recently did the same. And because we did, later today, after \\nmonths of hard work, the House's tax-writing committee will unveil its \\nversion of tax reform legislation.\\n  I commend Chairman Brady and the members of the Ways and Means \\nCommittee for their hard work in unveiling this critical legislation \\ntoday. This announcement is more positive momentum from our colleagues \\nover in the House, and I look forward to continued work with them as we \\nmove forward. Here in the Senate, the Finance Committee will continue \\nits work on tax reform legislation as well.\\n  Both Chambers are working on this at full steam because we are \\ncommitted to achieving our mutual tax reform goals for the middle \\nclass, working families, and small businesses. Our main goal is this: \\nWe want to take more money out of Washington's pockets and put more in \\nyours. This goal is shared by the American people, it is shared by the \\nPresident and his team, and it is shared by Republicans in the House \\nand in the Senate.\\n  The goals of tax reform used to be shared by our Democratic \\ncolleagues as well. Over many years, multiple Senate Democrats, \\nincluding the Democratic leader himself, have called on Congress to \\npass reform. But then something changed. It was the President who \\nchanged, it seems.\\n  Now we are reading reports that our friends across the aisle plan to \\noppose any tax reform bill at all, regardless of what is in it. It \\nseems that Democratic leadership is praying that this chance to put \\nmore money in the pockets of the middle class will not succeed. But \\nwhy? To protect incentives and encourage companies to ship jobs \\noverseas? I thought they were against those. To prevent working \\nfamilies from keeping more of what they earn? I assumed we were all for \\nthat. According to recent news reporting, Democrats apparently want to \\ntank tax cuts for the middle class because it might give them a \\npolitical leg up. In other words, it seems that this is some kind of \\ngame to them.\\n  I certainly hope what we read is not true. I certainly hope Democrats \\nwill take note of the fact that their latest false talking point about \\ntax reform just got debunked today as well. This effort is way too \\nimportant for any of that. I hope our friends will decide to work with \\nour colleagues in a serious way instead. That is what their \\nconstituents sent them here to do, and that is what their constituents \\ndeserve after the last decade of economic disappointment. There is no \\nreason for our Democratic friends not to work across the aisle in a \\nserious way to help shape this critically important effort.\\n  I thank Chairman Hatch and Chairman Brady for their commitment to tax \\nreform and regular order. Through the committee process, Members on \\nboth sides of the aisle will have the opportunity to offer input as the \\ntax reform effort advances. Today's announcement is an important step \\nforward for that process, as well as for our once-in-a-generation \\nopportunity to fundamentally rethink our Tax Code and deliver real \\nrelief.

Mr. President, I rise on the floor with a simple message. \\nWe should completely dispel with the fiction that the American Bar \\nAssociation is a fair and impartial arbiter of facts. This is a sad \\nreality, but it is the reality.\\n  Let's back up. We in this body have taken an oath to uphold and \\ndefend the Constitution of the United States. Considering judicial \\nnominees who have lifetime appointments is the most important thing \\nthis Senate will do over the weeks ahead. It demands the full attention \\nof every single Member--Republican, Democrat, and Independent. This \\nought to be an opportunity for this body to pause and stand back from \\nthe frenzy of day-to-day media cycles and cable news shouting and \\nrecommit ourselves to basic American civics and some very basic \\nAmerican ideas: the idea that our three branches of government have \\nthree separate roles; the idea that we in the article I branch, the \\nlawmakers, make the laws because we stand before the people and can be \\nhired and fired--if the people are going to be in charge of our system, \\nthey need to be able to fire the people who make the laws--the idea \\nthat judges are explicitly not to make law; the idea that judges do not \\nhave R and D, Republican and Democrat, behind their names but rather \\nthat judges should be dispassionately ruling on the law and the facts; \\nand the idea that all of us, temporary public servants, although the \\njudiciary have lifetime appointments, can be upholding and defending a \\nlimited system of government, again, through our three differentiated \\nroles.\\n  Unfortunately, over the last few days in this body, it has become \\nclear that some of us are attempting to outsource our constitutional \\nduties to an outside organization. That organization, the American Bar \\nAssociation, purports to\\n\\n\\nbe a neutral arbiter but is frankly twisting its ratings process to \\ndrive a political agenda in an important nomination pending before this \\nbody. I am referring specifically to the smear campaign of the ABA \\nagainst Steve Grasz, a qualified public servant, who has been nominated \\nby the President to the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals.\\n  Steve Grasz has decades of honorable service in Nebraska, including \\nmore than a decade as the chief deputy attorney general of my State.\\n  Mr. Grasz is, in fact, eminently qualified for the circuit court \\nbench as has been testified to by Republicans and Democrats across our \\nState.\\n  Let's set the scene first for the ABA's silly decision earlier this \\nweek to announce that they regard Steve Grasz as ``not qualified.'' I \\nwill highlight three specific items.\\n  First, we should discuss the two people who interviewed Mr. Grasz and \\nrecognize that unfortunately they are blatant partisans with a sad \\ntrack record of hackery.\\n  Second, the ABA is trying to paint Mr. Grasz as an extremist simply \\nbecause he did his job as the chief deputy attorney general of Nebraska \\nand defended Nebraska laws and Nebraskans who wanted to outlaw the most \\nbarbaric of abortion practices--partial birth abortion.\\n  Third, we should talk about the obvious bigotry of cultural liberals \\nevident in their interview process of Mr. Grasz when they asked him \\nrepeated questions about nonlegal matters that had nothing to do with \\nthe claims of competence of the ABA.\\n  First, let's talk about the two reviewers. The lead reviewer for the \\nbar association on the Grasz nomination was Arkansas law professor \\nCynthia Nance. As it turns out, this is an encore performance for Ms. \\nNance. In 2006, she opposed then-nominee and now-Supreme Court Justice \\nSamuel Alito because of his ``pro-life agenda,'' and she argued that \\nmade him unqualified to sit on the U.S. Supreme Court. I wonder if \\nthere is anyone in this body who rejected her view then and voted to \\nconfirm now-Justice Alito who would now echo her claims that Justice \\nAlito is not qualified to sit in the seat he now holds. Hopefully we as \\na body are better than that.\\n  The ABA's second reviewer, Lawrence Pulgram, is an attorney from San \\nFrancisco. A cursory glance at Mr. Pulgram's political involvement \\nshows a long track record of support for leftwing candidates and \\naggressively progressive political organizations. These are the \\nreviewers who are setting themselves up as dispassionate umpires \\ncalling balls and strikes. It is hogwash. These are not umpires. These \\nare folks in the starting lineup of the ABA, an organization that \\nexplicitly endorsed pro-abortion policies beginning two decades ago.\\n  To be clear, there is nothing wrong with Nance and Pulgram's zealous \\nadvocacy. They enjoy First Amendment rights just like all 320 million \\nAmericans do. There is nothing wrong with advocacy. What is wrong here \\nis advocacy disguised as objective analysis, and that is what is \\nactually happening in the case of the Grasz nomination.\\n  This brings us to our second point about the ABA's treatment of Mr. \\nGrasz. When you read their letter, it makes many anonymous claims that \\nsome people supposedly support the author's great worry about Grasz's \\nalleged deeply held social views, but the closest thing the ABA ever \\ncomes to stating a fact--let alone producing a smoking gun--is the fact \\nthat as the chief deputy attorney general of the State of Nebraska, Mr. \\nGrasz did the job of the chief deputy attorney general of the State of \\nNebraska. That is not news.\\n  It is no secret that the vast majority of Nebraskans are pro-life, \\nand thus it is no surprise that our State's laws reflect this. In the \\n1990s, Nebraska outlawed the most horrifying of all abortion \\nprocedures--the partial birth abortion. Unless anyone seeks comfort \\nbehind empty euphemisms like ``choice,'' let's be very clear what the \\npeople of Nebraska were outlawing. The people of my State banned a \\ngruesome and grotesque practice where a doctor partially delivers an \\nunborn baby and, while that baby girl's head is the only thing still in \\nthe mother's womb, the doctor would then collapse the baby's skull. If \\nthere is anyone in this body who believes that is a good and a moral \\nact, that it is a good and a moral thing to deliver that baby girl, and \\nthen moments before her complete and full entry into the world, to \\nvacuum out her brains, please come to the floor because few people \\nbelieve that is a good or a moral or a just act--or at least few would \\nadmit it openly.\\n  In fact, that is why, just a few years later, Federal law followed \\nNebraska's law and outlawed partial birth abortion, but in the 1990s, \\nwhen Nebraska first outlawed that partial birth abortion procedure, \\nmany pro-abortion advocates brought suit and Steve, as chief deputy \\nattorney general of Nebraska, defended the law of our State, which \\nagain is now the Federal law. He defended that law because it was his \\njob. He defended the law because that is what the people of Nebraska \\nwanted when they said this unspeakably barbaric procedure had no place \\nin our State and now, thankfully, has no place in our Nation. Anyone \\nwho would paint Steve as an extremist needs to take a long, hard, and \\nhonest look at what he did as chief deputy attorney general of Nebraska \\ndefending the laws of the State of Nebraska.\\n  Third, I know the ABA has an august-sounding name, but here is the \\nreality of the kinds of stuff they did in their interview with Mr. \\nGrasz. They asked him: What kind of schools do your kids go to? I don't \\nreally understand the connection to their legal interview. When they \\nfound out his kids attended a religious institution, they asked him why \\nhis kids would go to a religious institution. Well, it turns out, in my \\nState, lots and lots of Lutherans and Catholics and lots of non-\\nLutherans and Catholics send their kids to Lutheran and Catholic \\nschools. I don't know what that has to do with someone's competence, \\nman or woman, to sit as an objective judge on a court of appeals, and \\nyet the interviewers decided they should go there.\\n  Then they began to refer to Mr. Grasz repeatedly in the interview as \\n``you people.'' They would frame questions to him and ask about ``you \\npeople.'' At one point, he finally paused and asked: Can you tell me \\nwho ``you people'' are? Because at this point, he didn't know if it was \\npro-life people, people who send their kids to religious schools, maybe \\njust Nebraskans. They informed him they were using the term ``you \\npeople'' to mean conservatives or Republicans.\\n\\n  Third, in the course of their time with Mr. Grasz, their interview \\nwent from actual legal questions to just asking him more and more \\ndetail about his pro-life views, again that has nothing to do with the \\ndistinction between sitting on the bench as someone who applies facts \\nand law and someone who, in a private capacity or in his public \\ncapacity, as the chief deputy attorney general of Nebraska had been \\ndefending the laws of the State of Nebraska.\\n  Ed Whelan is the president of the Ethics and Public Policy Center and \\nis a legal and jurisprudential expert. He has been covering the ABA \\ncase and their judgment on Mr. Grasz this week closely, and so I would \\nlike to read a few of his comments into the Record.\\n\\n       The ABA contends that Grasz is not sufficiently able ``to \\n     differentiate between the roles'' of advocate and \\n     adjudicator.\\n       As its first example, the ABA contends that there is an \\n     inconsistency between Grasz's stated respect for stare \\n     decisis (that is, for binding precedent) and the views he \\n     expressed in a 1999 law-review article (and that it says he \\n     continues to adhere to). Selectively quoting that article, \\n     the ABA faults him for his supposed ``suggestion that a lower \\n     court judge was entitled, in deciding the issue [whether a \\n     `partially born' fetus has a right to life under the 14th \\n     Amendment], to question the jurisprudence of a superior \\n     court.''\\n       But in the law-review article that the ABA criticizes--\\n\\n  In that same article--\\n\\n     Grasz states [on pages] 27-28:\\n       ``Lower federal courts are obliged to follow clear legal \\n     precedent regardless of whether it may seem unwise or even \\n     morally repugnant to do so. However, a court need not extend \\n     questionable jurisprudence into new areas or apply it in \\n     areas outside of where there is clear precedent.''\\n       Read together, these sentences set forth an uncontroversial \\n     position. In order to create controversy, the ABA entirely \\n     omits the first sentence, and it then pretends that the \\n     second sentence, rather than setting forth a general \\n     proposition, is ``referring to the Supreme Court's rulings in \\n     Roe and Casey.'' Yes, Grasz applies that general proposition \\n     to the question whether Roe v. Wade and Planned Parenthood v. \\n     Casey speak to the legal status of ``partially-born human \\n     beings,'' but, much as the ABA would have\\n\\n\\n     the reader think otherwise, he isn't concocting a special \\n     rule for abortion precedents.\\n\\n  Skipping ahead:\\n\\n       The ABA states that ``members of the bar shared instances \\n     in which Mr. Grasz's conduct was gratuitously rude.'' \\n     Amazingly, it doesn't bother to give a simple example of rude \\n     conduct by Grasz, so its claim is [entirely] impossible to \\n     address.\\n       Aside--\\n\\n  This is again quoting Whelan--\\n\\n       Aside: According to Larry Tribe, as Josh Blackman reminds \\n     us, Sonia Sotomayor had a ``reputation for being something of \\n     a bully'' when she was nominated to the Supreme Court. (It \\n     was I [Whelan], by the way, who uncovered and published \\n     Tribe's letter to President Obama.)\\n       The ABA alleges that ``there was a certain amount of \\n     caginess, and, at times, a lack of disclosure [on Grasz's \\n     part] with respect to some of the issues which the evaluators \\n     unearthed.'' But once again it provides no specifics or \\n     illustrations, so it's impossible to assess whether Grasz can \\n     be fairly faulted here.\\n       Something very fishy is going on.\\n\\n  And here pulling up from Whelan, I would comment that my senior \\nSenator Deb Fischer and I from Nebraska, both of whom were advising \\nPresident Trump on the selection of Steve Grasz for this Eighth Circuit \\nvacancy, received literally boxes of letters from Nebraska lawyers--\\nboth Republican and Democratic--for months in the moment after the \\nEighth Circuit vacancy appeared, and at no point did we hear either \\nverbally from people we know in the State or in our interview process \\nor in those boxes of letters--at no point did we hear of any rudeness \\non the part of Mr. Grasz. Yet the ABA is judging him ``not qualified'' \\nfor the bench based on anonymous sources that say he is rude, without a \\nsingle example. There is not one example.\\n  It is an embarrassing letter from the ABA. Folks in this body who \\nwould be tempted to take the ABA's judgment seriously should read the \\nletter. It is filled with anonymous claims that once he was rude to \\nsomeone, and they have no examples.\\n  Back to Ed Whelan:\\n\\n       [Reviewer] Nance's strong ideological bias is not difficult \\n     to uncover. Among other things, she signed a letter opposing \\n     the confirmation of Justice Alito. Given the ABA's persistent \\n     complaints about Grasz's supposed inability to separate his \\n     judging from his ``pro-life agenda,'' it's notable that \\n     letter against Alito complains about the impact that he would \\n     have on . . . women's reproductive [rights]. Nance also \\n     signed a letter arguing that the ``government's interests in \\n     protecting women's health and reproductive freedom, and \\n     combating gender discrimination,'' meant that even \\n     religiously affiliated organizations--like the Little Sisters \\n     of the Poor--should be required to provide contraceptive \\n     coverage (including drugs and devices that can also operate \\n     in an abortifacient manner) notwithstanding their own \\n     religiously informed views on what constitutes illicit moral \\n     complicity in evil.\\n       Nance's very active Twitter feed (more than 24,000 tweets) \\n     also offers some revealing insights. Among other things, \\n     Nance retweeted the question whether Justice Scalia would \\n     have been in the majority in Dred Scott, and she evidently \\n     found amusing or insightful the observation that \\n     ``Constitutional strict constructionists . . . want women to \\n     have all the rights they had in 1787.'' Yes, this is just the \\n     sort of fine and balanced legal mind, with a great grasp of \\n     conservative judicial principles, that the ABA puts in charge \\n     of evaluating judicial nominees.\\n\\n  Finally:\\n\\n       The ABA's supposed check against a hostile lead \\n     investigator is to have a second investigator conduct a \\n     supplemental evaluation of the nominee in those instances in \\n     which the lead investigator recommends a ``Not Qualified'' \\n     rating.\\n       So if you're the head of the committee, whom would you \\n     select to ensure that ideological bias isn't warping the \\n     process? Probably not a very liberal [activist] lawyer from \\n     San Francisco. But that's exactly what the ABA did [in this \\n     case].\\n       Lawrence Pulgram, the second investigator, is a member of \\n     the left-wing Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights of the San \\n     Francisco Bay Area.\\n\\n  We have a crisis of institutional trust in this country that should \\nconcern all of us. Our job here, in seeking to preserve and protect and \\nuphold the Constitution, and a Constitution that is focused on limited \\ngovernment, is because our Founders believed that the vast majority of \\nthe most interesting questions in life happen in the private sector, \\nnot just for-profit entities but primarily civil society, families, \\nneighborhoods, and not-for-profit organizations, and religious \\ninstitutions, and the Rotary Club, and philanthropies, and voluntary \\nenterprises. The most interesting things in life are not in government. \\nGovernment provides a framework for order of liberty, but once you have \\nthat framework, once you are free from violence, you are free to live \\nyour life in all of these fully human-fit community ways in your local \\ncommunity.\\n  Our job in this body is to not only pass good legislation and repeal \\nbad legislation and to advise and consent on the President's nominees \\nto faithfully execute the laws that have been passed by the article I \\nbranch, but our job is also to speak to a constitutional system, where \\na separation of powers exists so power is not consolidated in \\nWashington and so there is room for the full flowering of social \\ncommunity across our great land.\\n  So the decline of trust in our institutions is something that should \\ntrouble all of us. Our job here isn't merely about government, it is \\nalso teaching our kids about the Constitution and basic civics. I ache \\nwhen private sector institutions and civil society institutions see the \\ntrust in those institutions decline. But one of the things that is \\nclearly happening in our time is that the ABA is becoming much less a \\nserious organization and much more an activist organization advancing a \\nspecific political agenda.\\n  The ABA is due to appear before the Judiciary Committee in 2 weeks to \\nexplain this interview process and why they gave this judgment on Mr. \\nGrasz with so few facts and so little evidence and so much pro-abortion \\nzealotry driving the opinion of the lead reviewer in this case.\\n  I hope that when the ABA comes before the Judiciary Committee, it \\nrecants this very silly opinion of ``not qualified'' on a man who is \\neminently qualified and is going to serve very well the people of not \\njust the Eighth Circuit but this country on the Eighth Circuit Court of \\nAppeals.\\n  I would hope that the ABA would recant this silly judgment, but if \\nthey do not, I think we should recognize that the fiction of the ABA as \\na serious organization that ought to be taken seriously as a neutral, \\nimpartial arbiter of qualifications for the Federal bench should be \\ndispensed with; and that we in this body, who have actually taken an \\noath to three separate-but-equal branches, with differentiated roles of \\nlegislating, executing, and ultimately judging, would continue to \\naffirm that distinction; and that we should want judges who do not try \\nto be superlegislators but, rather, seek to attend themselves to the \\nfacts and the law, as is indeed the calling of article III branch \\njudges.\\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\", u'turn': 0, u'speaker': u'Mr. SASSE', u'itemno': 0}, {u'kind': u'speech', u'speaker_bioguide': None, u'text': u'  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cassidy).

The administration of Wells \\nMiddle School has worked diligently to meet the stringent standards \\nnecessary to receive this distinction. It has minimized incidences of \\ncheating and bullying while maximizing student and parent engagement.\\n  At Wells Middle School, character education is made a priority by the \\nadministration and teachers. The character education program focuses on \\nbringing relevant, engaging and versatile resources directly to the \\nstudents. The school makes an extensive effort to prioritize the \\nsuccess of its students.\\n  One example is the Response to Intervention program. This program \\nprovides a network of instructional sessions for teachers and students, \\nwhich work to address academic and behavioral concerns. This \\nprogramming stresses inclusivity and adaptability as it seeks to meet \\nthe needs of all Wells Middle School students.\\n  In addition to the National School of Character designation, Wells \\nMiddle School was named a 2017 California Gold Ribbon School by the \\nCalifornia Department ofEducation and a 2017 California School of \\nCharacter.\\n  I am honored to have such an incredible school within my district, \\nand as a Wells Middle School student, benefited myself from its focus \\non character. The continual effort of Wells Middle School to promote \\nthe success of its students both academically and behaviorally, serves \\nas a statewide example of an ideal institution for holistic student \\ngrowth. Our community is better and stronger as a result of its \\ntireless dedication.\\n  I want to congratulate Wells Middle School on receiving the 2017 \\nNational School of Character Award, and I wish the school and its \\nstudents continued success in the years to come.\\n', u'turn': 0, u'speaker': u'Mr. SWALWELL of California', u'itemno': 2}, {u'kind': u'linebreak', u'speaker_bioguide': None, u'text': u'                          ____________________\\n\\n\\n', u'turn': -1, u'speaker': u'None', u'itemno': 3}], u'header': {u'extension': True, u'vol': u'163', u'wkday': u'Thursday', u'chamber': u'House', u'num': u'178', u'year': u'2017', u'month': u'November', u'pages': u'E1494', u'day': u'2'}, u'doc_title': u'RECOGNIZING WELLS MIDDLE SCHOOL AS A 2017 NATIONAL SCHOOL OF CHARACTER', u'id': u'CREC-2017-11-02-pt1-PgE1494-3', u'title': u'RECOGNIZING WELLS MIDDLE SCHOOL AS A 2017 NATIONAL SCHOOL OF CHARACTER'}{u'title': None, u'content': [{u'kind': u'recorder', u'speaker_bioguide': None, u'text': u'            By Mrs. McMORRIS RODGERS:', u'turn': -1, u'speaker': u'The RECORDER', u'itemno': 0}, {u'kind': u'title', u'speaker_bioguide': None, u'text': u'        H.R. 4229.\\n        Congress has the power to enact this legislation pursuant \\n     to the following:\\n       Consistent with the understanding and interpretation of the \\n     Commerce Clause, Congress has the authority to enact this \\n     legislation in accordance with Clause 3 of Section 8, Article \\n     1 of the U.S. Constitution.\\n\\n', u'turn': -1, u'speaker': u'None', u'itemno': 1}], u'header': {u'extension': False, u'vol': u'163', u'wkday': u'Thursday', u'chamber': u'House', u'num': u'178', u'year': u'2017', u'month': u'November', u'pages': u'H8444', u'day': u'2'}, u'related_bills': [{u'type': u'HR', u'congress': u'115', u'context': u'TITLE', u'number': u'4229'}], u'doc_title': u'Constitutional Authority Statement for H.R. 4229', u'id': u'CREC-2017-11-02-pt1-PgH8444-13'}{u'content': [{u'text': u'  (Mr. FITZPATRICK asked and was given permission to address the House \\nfor 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)', u'kind': u'Unknown', u'speaker': u'Unknown', u'itemno': 0, u'turn': -1}, {u'kind': u'speech', u'speaker_bioguide': u'F000466', u'text': u\"  Mr. FITZPATRICK.

Madam Speaker, I would like to start by saying I am \\nheartbroken and shocked by the terror attack in New York this week. \\nThis atrocious act of hatred and violence has no place in this country, \\nand we must make it clear that we will not stand for it.\\n  I offer my sincere condolences to every single person who has been \\nimpacted by this senseless tragedy. My family and I will be in prayer \\nfor everyone who has been hurt by this act, whether physically or \\nemotionally.\\n  I also want to thank law enforcement officers who responded so \\nquickly, who saved lives and apprehended the suspect. As scary as this \\nincident was, we can all be reassured by the courage and \\nprofessionalism of our law enforcement, the military, and the \\nintelligence community that work together to keep our country safe.\\n  Madam Speaker, it has been a busy 10 months here in the House of \\nRepresentatives. We have passed more than 360 bills this year alone in \\na unified effort to deliver on our promises to the American people. Of \\ncourse, many of those bills are aimed at rolling back the Big \\nGovernment policies of the Obama era. So I would like to say we are \\ndoing a lot to make sure that the Federal Government does less.\\n  As a limited government conservative, I am especially glad that we \\nhave taken action to return some of Washington's bureaucratic power to \\nthe American people. The last 7 years saw the emergence of a regulatory \\nstate that never stopped in its mission to grab power and impose its \\nwill at the expense of everyday Americans. This town is overrun with \\nFederal agencies and departments where bureaucrats sit around every day \\nconcocting rules and regulations that might sound like a good idea but, \\nin reality, end up weighing down businesses, destroying jobs, and \\nlimiting freedom.\\n  In his 8 years, President Obama added 18,000 pages to the Federal \\nRegister, amounting to 6 pages added every day that he held office. \\nThis habit costs American households roughly $15,000 per year, each.\\n  While President Obama is no longer in office, his regulatory state is \\nalive and well, but not for long. Madam Speaker, the people of Alabama \\nelected me to help put an end to that, and I am proud to report that is \\nexactly what we are doing. The House is changing the game because the \\nAmerican people deserve better than to pay for unnecessary Big \\nGovernment mandates. We have utilized the Congressional Review Act to \\nstrike 15 Federal regulations that were imposed by executive action.\\n\\n  What kind of regulations?\\n  One extended intrusive, overreaching, and punitive environmental \\npenalties on energy companies, costing tens of thousands of jobs, but \\nnot anymore.\\n  One attempted to force State and local schools to use Washington's \\npreferred teacher preparation programs, undermining local control--not \\nanymore.\\n  One restricted States' ability to enforce existing laws stopping \\notherwise able-bodied drug abusers from receiving unemployment \\nbenefits--not anymore.\\n  One attempted to take away the Second Amendment rights of millions of \\nAmericans without due process by arbitrarily restricting Social \\nSecurity disability beneficiaries from purchasing firearms--not \\nanymore.\\n  Finally, one attempted to force States to steer millions in Title X \\nfunding to abortion provider Planned Parenthood, even over the State's \\nobjections--not anymore, thank God.\\n  These rules no longer exist because this Congress, working together \\nwith the Trump administration, struck them one by one. In all, 15 bills \\nrolling back these Big Government policies have been passed and signed \\ninto law.\\n  Madam Speaker, I am proud of the work the House of Representatives \\nhas done, and I hope it can give us momentum for tackling more pressing \\nissues like tax reform and infrastructure.\\n\", u'turn': 1, u'speaker': u'Mrs. ROBY', u'itemno': 1}, {u'kind': u'linebreak', u'speaker_bioguide': None, u'text': u'                          ____________________\\n\\n\\n', u'turn': -1, u'speaker': u'None', u'itemno': 2}], u'header': {u'extension': False, u'vol': u'163', u'wkday': u'Thursday', u'chamber': u'House', u'num': u'178', u'year': u'2017', u'month': u'November', u'pages': u'H8391', u'day': u'2'}, u'doc_title': u'CONGRESSIONAL REVIEW ACT PROGRESS', u'id': u'CREC-2017-11-02-pt1-PgH8391', u'title': u'CONGRESSIONAL REVIEW ACT PROGRESS'}{u'content': [{u'kind': u'metacharacters', u'speaker_bioguide': None, u'text': u'                              {time}  1455', u'turn': -1, u'speaker': u'None', u'itemno': 0}, {u'kind': u'title', u'speaker_bioguide': None, u'text': u\"                              AFTER RECESS\\n\\n  The recess having expired, the House was called to order by the \\nSpeaker pro tempore (Mr. Palmer) at 2 o'clock and 55 minutes p.m.\\n\", u'turn': -1, u'speaker': u'None', u'itemno': 1}, {u'kind': u'linebreak', u'speaker_bioguide': None, u'text': u'                          ____________________\\n\\n\\n', u'turn': -1, u'speaker': u'None', u'itemno': 2}], u'header': {u'extension': False, u'vol': u'163', u'wkday': u'Thursday', u'chamber': u'House', u'num': u'178', u'year': u'2017', u'month': u'November', u'pages': u'H8410', u'day': u'2'}, u'doc_title': u'AFTER RECESS', u'id': u'CREC-2017-11-02-pt1-PgH8410-2', u'title': None}{u'content': [{u'text': u'  The SPEAKER pro tempore laid before the House the following \\ncommunication from the Speaker:\\n\\n                                               Washington, DC,\\n\\n                                                 November 2, 2017.\\n       I hereby appoint the Honorable Mimi Walters to act as \\n     Speaker pro tempore on this day.\\n                                                     Paul D.

Madam Speaker, I recently visited the \\nInnovation Commons at Penn State Behrend in Erie County, which is an \\nidea lab that offers support for entrepreneurs and startup companies.\\n  It opened in January of 2016 to innovators, including those at the \\nstudent level, who sought a place to organize, collaborate, compose, \\nand construct their ideas.\\n  The Innovation Commons is a part of the Innovation Beehive, which is \\nhoused at, and managed by, Penn State Behrend. It is in partnership \\nwith three additional Erie County universities: Mercyhurst, Gannon, and \\nEdinboro. It was the first of its kind in 2016, and its success \\nestablished a business network across Erie County--or, in other words, \\nthe beehive.\\n  The beehive sites will operate as both individual service providers \\nand as part of a larger, connected network, with multiple points of \\nentry for entrepreneurs. All services will be available to the public \\nand to businesses seeking to develop new products or enter new markets.\\n  Each lab will specialize in different aspects of product or business \\ndevelopment:\\n  Edinboro University will provide advertising, marketing, and public \\nrelations strategies for business startups. Both current students and \\nthose entrepreneurs in the community can all seek assistance with all \\nof these universities. The lab, which will be equipped with high-end \\nprinters, art supplies, drafting tables, and other multimedia support, \\nwill be located in the Baron-Forness Library;\\n  Gannon University will focus on business development, including \\nbusiness analysis. The Gannon beehive, which will be located in the \\nCenter for Business Ingenuity, will offer access to the Small Business \\nDevelopment Center and the Erie Technology Incubator;\\n  Mercyhurst University will provide business intelligence services and \\nsolutions to help developers commercialize their ideas. Blended \\nfaculty-student teams will use high-end computers, plotters, and other \\ntools to develop custom intelligence products from within the Ridge \\nCollege of Intelligence Studies.\\n  Madam Speaker, this northwest Pennsylvania Innovation Beehive network \\nis working to serve the region. It will enable innovators to access \\nuniversities' resources and applied research\\n\\n\\ncapabilities for new business development or expansion at little to no \\ncost.\\n\\n  I recently participated in a roundtable discussion with the \\nuniversity presidents, and I am very excited to see this collaborative \\neffort take root in Erie County. This network was made possible thanks \\nto the Ignite Erie Industry and Business Acceleration Collaborative, \\nthe Erie County Gaming Authority, and the Appalachian Regional \\nCommission.\\n  This truly is a collaborative effort, and it is my hope that the \\nbeehive will soon be abuzz with good ideas throughout Erie County. This \\nis an excellent partnership that will give innovators and students \\nhands-on, real-world experience to test their ideas and make their \\ndreams become reality.\\n  Madam Speaker, I am glad to see Erie County leveraging the strengths \\nof these four universities for the betterment of its community.

Mr. Speaker, today I rise in memory of Army \\nStaff Sergeant (SSG) Joe Nathan Wilson who paid the ultimate sacrifice \\nwhile defending our great nation on November 2, 2003, during Operation \\nIraqi Freedom. SSG Wilson was mortally wounded in an attack on a CH-47 \\nChinook helicopter near Fallujah, Iraq. Fifteen other servicemen were \\nkilled in the crash. He died from his injuries in a Kuwait hospital. \\nSSG Wilson was assigned to Alpha Battery, 2nd Battalion, 5th Field \\nArtillery Regiment, 3rd Corps Artillery, Fort Sill, Oklahoma.\\n  According to the Associated Press, an Ohio serviceman said he \\nsurvived because of the heroic act of SSG Wilson. Sergeant (SSG) Joe \\nMlinar said SSG Wilson cradled his head with his body to shield him \\nwhen the helicopter crashed.\\n  SSG Wilson was remembered on a memorial website by a fellow soldier. \\nStaff Sergeant (SSG) Benjamin Dunlap of Stroud, Oklahoma, said SSG \\nWilson was a leader, ``I served with SSG Wilson during our tour in \\nIraq. He was the epiphany of the NCO corps. He was always leading by \\nexample. He could never be seen without a smile on his face. I \\nconsidered him to be my friend. He was a friend to all who knew him.''\\n  SSG Wilson graduated from Crystal Springs High School in Crystal \\nSprings, Mississippi in 1992. Robert Green, the Crystal Springs High \\nSchool athletic director, said SSG Wilson was a standout student, ``He \\nwas a nice young man, especially on the football field.'' Shortly after \\ngraduation, SSG Wilson enlisted in the U.S. Army. Maxine Adams, SSG \\nWilson's mother, said he always wanted to be in the military, ``He was \\na great son. It was important to Nate to be an accomplished person.'' \\nPatricia Fortenberry, SSG Wilson's sister, is proud of her brother's \\nservice, ``He was a great brother. He was my best friend.''\\n  Shortly after SSG Wilson's death, the city of Crystal Springs \\ndesignated November 2nd as an official day to recognize his service to \\nour nation. His family hosts a picnic and speakers are included at the \\nevent. It is held at the Joe Nathan Wilson Sportsplex and Memorial Fire \\nStation in Crystal Springs which is named in his honor. Sally Garland, \\nmayor of Crystal Springs, said the city will begin a new tradition in \\nhonor of SSG Wilson. Beginning this year, flags will be lowered to \\nhalf-staff on the anniversary of his death.\\n  SSG Wilson was buried at Brushy Creek Cemetery in Hopewell, \\nMississippi. SSG Wilson is survived by his mother, Maxine Adams; his \\nwife, Erica; his daughter, Yasmin; his three nephews, Jaydan Adams, \\nJordan Adams, and Specialist (SPC) Jerrick Wilson; his two nieces, \\nKawanza Fortenberry and Latria Wilson.\\n  SSG Wilson's bravery under fire demonstrated his devotion to his \\ncomrades and to our nation.

Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Colorado \\nfor organizing this Special Order and recognizing me to address it.\\n  I would like to say at the start of this that the folks that had the \\nSpecial Order ahead of us had not read the bill that they were \\nexpounding upon, and it would be impossible for them to have done so. \\nSo I want to remind the body of that, Mr. Speaker, and then address the \\nNo Sanctuary Cities Act.\\n  It is this: that we saw what happened in San Francisco when the \\nmurderer of Kate Steinle had been deported five times. He was a seven-\\ntime felon, five-time deportee. He still came back, and he came to San \\nFrancisco because he knew that it is a sanctuary city, and if he got \\ncrossways with the law for whatever it might be, sleeping on the street \\nor shoplifting or any of the additional felonies that were brought \\nagainst him, they were not going to notify immigration officials. They \\nwere going to turn him back loose on the streets of San Francisco. If \\nhe was taken care of as an indigent, they would turn him loose on the \\nstreets of San Francisco.\\n  So Kate Steinle now lies in her grave, her family grieves for her \\nloss, and America felt that pain.\\n  San Francisco is a sanctuary city, and now the entire State of \\nCalifornia has declared themselves a sanctuary State.\\n  I think, Mr. Speaker, about the hole in the wall. Butch Cassidy and \\nthe Sundance Kid, they had a spot in the canyon there where you had to \\nride through a notch to get in there, and they posted a guard there. \\nAll the bad guys that wanted to get along with the other bad guys in \\nthe West went in that place, and if law enforcement came, then they \\nwould line up against them and block them from coming in to enforce the \\nlaw.\\n  That is essentially what we have got going on in city after city all \\nover America: sanctuary cities operating under the erroneous idea that \\nbecause their cities are so full of illegals, that if they would ever \\nallow Federal immigration enforcement officials to work and cooperate \\nwith local law enforcement, those folks might not be in America.\\n\\n  Well, I met with some people today at the Remembrance Project. These \\nare the families who had their family members killed by illegal aliens \\nwho are in America. Many of these illegal aliens who killed Americans \\nand killed other illegal aliens and killed people who are here and \\nlawfully present in America, many of them had criminal records. Many of \\nthem had been interdicted by law enforcement, but the local \\njurisdictions decided it wasn't politically correct to cooperate with \\nFederal law.\\n  Well, the Constitution of the United States is the supreme law of the \\nland, and it is an enumerated power that Congress establish an \\nimmigration policy. We do that, and we direct that those laws be \\nenforced. The executive branch's job is to do that.\\n  All throughout law enforcement, it has been seamless throughout all \\nof my growing up years. I grew up in a law enforcement family. There \\nwas no separation. There was no segregation between city police and \\ncounty law enforcement officers, the sheriff's department, and highway \\npatrol and DCI and FBI. When there was a crime that was committed, \\neverybody worked together seamlessly.\\n  How is it that these cities and now the State of California have \\ncarved themselves out an exception to what has been a timeless, time-\\nhonored, established cooperation between all levels of law enforcement?\\n  So the No Sanctuary for Criminals Act, which was my bill, is now \\nsitting on Mitch McConnell's desk with the scores of other bills that \\nthe gentleman from Colorado has addressed, and it is one that says \\nthere will be no sanctuary cities any longer and that we will be \\ncutting off funds going to these cities until they get the message.\\n\\n\\n  I think it is about time that the Justice Department moved on all of \\nthe jurisdiction that they actually have, but we need to help them here \\nin Congress. And it is about time that this bill, along with Sarah's \\nLaw and Kate's Law, be moved off of Mitch McConnell's desk to the floor \\nof the United States Senate.\\n  That is just a small piece of the broad picture we are addressing \\nhere tonight, Mr. Speaker. We need some action over in the Senate. If \\nthey would get rid of that filibuster rule, we would see more action \\nthan we are seeing today.\\n  Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding to me, and I \\nencourage him to continue this effort. I am going to stand with him on \\nthis. I thank him for all he is doing.\", u'turn': 4, u'speaker': u'Mr. KING of Iowa', u'itemno': 5}, {u'kind': u'speech', u'speaker_bioguide': u'B001297', u'text': u'  Mr. BUCK.

This \\nlegislation has been sitting in the Senate for 31 days.\\n  H.R. 7, which prohibits taxpayer funding for abortion, passed the \\nHouse by 238 votes.

Mr. Speaker, I sincerely appreciate the \\ngentleman's great leadership in this, and I am grateful to be able to \\nspeak on this issue of life.\\n  There have been, as mentioned a few moments ago, some 300, plus or \\nminus, bills sent to the Senate that we have labored here in the House \\nand worked through, negotiated, duked it out, so to speak, gotten ideas \\non the table, worked it out, sent it over to the Senate, only to see \\nthem sit there and do nothing.\\n  Right in the midst of all of that, at the heart of it all, are a \\ncouple of very important bills dealing with the issue of life, which is \\nimportant to all of us. I firmly believe, and I know my colleagues do \\nas well, that all human life at every stage of development is worthy of \\nprotection. I am deeply honored and proud of the fact that this House \\nhas passed a couple of extremely important bills in that regard.\\n  As the gentleman from Colorado just mentioned, H.R. 7, No Taxpayer \\nFunding for Abortion, by our friend from New Jersey, Chris Smith, and \\nH.R. 36, the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act, by Trent Franks \\nof Arizona,\\n\\n\\nare fantastic bills. One basically says that the American taxpayer \\nshould not be footing the bill to end the life of unborn children. It \\nhas been sitting for over 200 days in the Senate without even a debate.\\n  The other says that, after 20 weeks, when an unborn child is capable \\nof feeling pain, we are not going abort that child in the midst of a \\nperiod of time where pain is absolutely scientifically proven to be \\nfelt. Again, that bill is sitting across the way in the Senate Chamber, \\nand they have not done anything about it whatsoever.\\n  These are important bills. These bills affect lives. Every day that \\nthe Senate does nothing, lives are being lost.\\n  The question is: Where is the Senate?\\n  We all sit here and we wait and we wait and we wait. The time has \\ncome that the Senate has to take ownership of what the American people \\nelected not only us, but the American people elected them to do, and \\nthat is the job, the task, the platform that we all ran on, and at the \\nheart of that is the fight, the battle for life.\\n  I am also proud of the fact that the House, in our appropriations \\npackage, defunded Planned Parenthood. This is a promise that we made \\nthe American people after the gruesome discovery of how Planned \\nParenthood was selling baby body parts. Again, we just recognize that \\nlife is a gift from God and it is precious and it is to be protected. \\nIt is an inalienable right that we as Members of Congress have the \\nresponsibility to defend those inalienable rights. Obviously, without \\nthe right to life, there, likewise, is no right to liberty, and \\ncertainly no right to the pursuit of happiness.\\n  Again, the question is: Where is the Senate on these issues?\\n  It is time that we join together. Again, I thank my friend for having \\nthis Special Order and calling on the Senate to deal with this 60-vote \\nthreshold that has become an enormous barrier, causing all of us to be \\ndysfunctional in that which the American people sent us here to do.\\n  Our conservative principles, as well as our whole Nation, rests upon \\nus advancing these things that the American people sent us here to do, \\nand at the heart of that is to defend life. I just join in calling on \\nthe Senate to deal with this 60-vote rule and move forward on the \\nagenda that we are here to do.\\n  Again, I just thank the gentleman for his kindness in allowing me to \\nspeak on this issue, which is important not only to me, but to all of \\nus; and for his leadership on joining us in having a united voice, \\ncalling our colleagues down the hallway here to do the job that they \\nwere called on to do.\", u'turn': 6, u'speaker': u'Mr. JODY B.

Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend and colleague from \\nColorado for yielding to me on such an important issue not only to my \\ndistrict, not only to my city, not only to my State, but to our Nation.\\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise this evening to discuss a vital program within \\nthe Department of Homeland Security, the Securing the Cities program.\\n  The Domestic Nuclear Detection Office's Securing the Cities program \\nenhances the ability of States and localities to detect and prevent \\nterrorist attacks and other high-consequence events using nuclear and \\nradiological materials in high-risk urban areas through the provisions \\nof training, equipment, and other resources.\\n  Securing the Cities began as a pilot program in 2006 in the New York \\nCity region, including surrounding jurisdictions of New Jersey and \\nConnecticut. Since that time, it has expanded to Los Angeles; Chicago; \\nWashington, D.C.; and Houston. Once the program is fully implemented, \\nit is estimated that it will protect nearly 100 million people \\nnationwide, Americans.\\n  Hailing from New York City and representing Staten Island and \\nBrooklyn, I have seen firsthand the positive impact of the Securing the \\nCities program. Since 2007, our region has purchased more than 13,000 \\nradiation detectors and trained nearly 20,000 personnel.\\n  I had the opportunity to observe an exercise in Brooklyn last year \\nand witnessed New York City Police Department personnel using Securing \\nthe Cities-procured equipment to locate and identify hidden \\nradiological sources in a baseball stadium. During the exercise, I \\nspoke with the participating officers and received a demonstration of \\nthe different types of equipment they deployed.\\n  This program is making a difference in New York City, and I support \\nits continued expansion. That is why I introduced H.R. 655, the \\nSecuring the Cities Act of 2017. This bill authorizes the Securing the \\nCities program, underscoring our commitment to protecting our major \\ncities from catastrophic terrorist attacks.\\n  As we, unfortunately, saw earlier this week, our major cities, \\nincluding my hometown of New York City, in particular, remain targets \\nfor terrorist groups. We have to do everything we can to ensure the \\nDepartment of Homeland Security and our State and local partners have \\nthe tools they need to address the threats that we face. The Securing \\nthe Cities program is one of those tools.\\n  I am pleased that the House quickly passed my legislation earlier \\nthis year on January 31. It is now time for the Senate to act. Mr. \\nSpeaker, I urge the Senate to move swiftly to approve H.R. 655 to \\nauthorize the Securing the Cities program and ensure its continued \\nexpansion.\\n  In April 2010, President Obama stated: ``The single biggest threat to \\nU.S. security, both short term, medium term, and long term, would be \\nthe possibility of a terrorist organization obtaining a nuclear \\nweapon.''\\n  Since that time, the FBI has disrupted attempts by smugglers in \\nEastern Europe to sell nuclear materials to extremist groups and \\ncriminal organizations. The threat has not abated.\\n  I am thankful for the work of the Domestic Nuclear Detection Office \\nto provide support and guidance to New York City and other urban areas \\nto meet the threats we face.\\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge the Senate to quickly take action to pass the \\nSecuring the Cities Act of 2017.

This bill has been stuck in the Senate for 127 days.\\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield to my friend and colleague, Representative Andy \\nBiggs, to talk about H.R. 3004, Kate's Law, and the importance of \\nsecuring our Nation from violent illegal felons.\", u'turn': 9, u'speaker': u'Mr. BUCK', u'itemno': 10}, {u'kind': u'speech', u'speaker_bioguide': u'B001302', u'text': u\"  Mr. BIGGS. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from Colorado, Mr. Buck, \\nfor yielding to me. I am grateful for his leadership as a conservative. \\nIt has been my honor to serve with him this past year. I appreciate him \\nsharing some time with me tonight as I share several important stories.\\n\\n  Mr. Speaker, these are stories of real people, not just some people \\nwho are distant to us. These are people that we know, people just like \\nthis.\\n  Mr. Speaker, one early January morning in 2015, a young man named \\nGrant Ronnebeck began the graveyard shift at a QuikTrip convenience \\nstore in my district. After his parents divorce, Grant took the \\ninitiative to find a job working at this convenience store\\n\\n\\nin Mesa, Arizona, to help his family pay the bills. He was only 21 \\nyears old. He had his entire life ahead of him.\\n  Just before 4 a.m., an angry customer walked in, demanded a pack of \\ncigarettes, and dumped a handful of change on the store counter. Grant \\nstarted to count the money, but he saw the customer pull a gun out and \\npoint it directly at his head.\\n  Grant tried to immediately hand over the cigarettes in a desperate \\nattempt to save his life, but it was too late. The customer shot Grant \\nin the face in cold blood, took the cigarettes, and casually walked out \\nof the store.\\n  Grant's father describes him as being his buddy from the minute he \\nwas born and a person that brightened everybody. He did not leave the \\nstore alive that night.\\n  The customer's name was Apolinar Altamirano. He was an illegal alien \\nwith a long criminal record, including violent crimes. He was held in \\nFederal custody, but then released while he awaited deportation \\nproceedings. Our government let Grant down when they allowed Grant's \\nkiller to walk out of custody and onto our streets.\\n  Altamirano should have remained in custody until he was deported, but \\nhe was set free, and Grant was killed due to the government's failure \\nto hold this violent criminal in custody until deported.\\n  Sadly, Grant's story is not unique. Many Americans are aware of \\nanother tragic incident, the case of Kate Steinle. Kate was 32 years \\nold. She was walking along a San Francisco pier when an illegal alien \\nshot and killed her. This illegal alien had just been released from \\nprison again. He should have been held until deportation, but he, in \\nfact, had been deported many times previously.\\n\\n\\n  Even then, he was set free, only to kill Kate Steinle.\\n  In 2014, Mesa, Arizona, Police Officer Brandon Mendoza was killed in \\na wrong-way crash by an illegal alien who was driving under the \\ninfluence of drugs and alcohol.\\n  And in January 2016, Sarah Root was murdered by an illegal alien who \\nwas drunk and drag racing in Omaha, Nebraska.\\n  In each of these cases, Grant and Brandon, I am privileged to know \\ntheir parents, Steve Ronnebeck and Mary Ann Mendoza. These are fierce \\nadvocates who tirelessly work to make sure these types of tragedies \\nnever happen to another family. I am grateful for their efforts, and I \\nbelieve that we are making significant headway to stop these types of \\ncatch and release programs that allow criminals to remain on our \\nstreets.\\n  In June of this year, the House of Representatives passed H.R. 3003, \\nthe No Sanctuary for Criminals Act, and H.R. 3004, Kate's Law, \\ntandemly. These bills would end the policies that contributed to the \\ntragic deaths of Grant, Kate, Brandon, and Sarah.\\n  I was pleased to coauthor the first bill, which included my \\nlegislation, Grant's Law. Grant's Law is named in memory of Grant \\nRonnebeck.\\n  All Americans can agree that someone who is criminally violent should \\nnot be released back on to the streets. Yet, for years, the Obama \\nadministration's policies failed to protect Americans by allowing \\ncriminally violent illegal aliens to roam our streets and \\nneighborhoods.\\n  These types of tragedies are preventable when the Federal Government \\nenacts and enforces the No Sanctuary for Criminals Act and Kate's Law. \\nCongress has begun to take meaningful action to bring these tragedies \\nto an end, starting with the two bills we passed in June.\\n  Chairman Bob Goodlatte showed leadership and commitment to ensure \\nthese important bills received swift consideration. These two bills, if \\nenacted and enforced, would protect innocent Americans to prevent \\nfuture tragedies like those of Grant, Kate, Brandon, and Sarah.\\n  When the bills passed out of the House, I hoped these bills would \\nreceive a swift vote in the Senate. That has not happened. I am still \\nhoping for this vote to take place. I call upon the leadership of the \\nSenate to put these bills up for a floor vote.\\n  We owe it to our constituents to put arcane tradition aside and to \\npass policies that will protect them. Yet, even in a Republican-\\ncontrolled Senate, we cannot receive an up-or-down vote on these \\nimportant immigration enforcement bills.\\n  Why is this?\\n  Mr. Speaker, I firmly believe the answer lies in the fatally flawed \\n60-vote rule. It is more commonly known as the filibuster, but the \\nSenate's tradition is preventing consideration of nearly all \\nlegislation passed from the House.\\n  For example, look at our current situation. Since January, the House \\nhas passed over 300 bills, including the two immigration and \\nenforcement bills I have just discussed. These bills will most likely \\nlanguish until the end of the term, in large part, due to the \\nfilibuster rule.\\n  So what can be done about this irresponsible inaction? Well, the \\nSenate can change the rule. Indeed, the Senate must change the rule.\\n  Many people do not realize that the 60-vote requirement is not even \\nin the United States Constitution. It dates back to 1917, when the \\nSenate agreed that debate could be cut off with a two-thirds majority \\nvote. Decades later, when deciding a two-thirds vote was found to be \\ntoo difficult to achieve, the Senate reduced the number of required \\nvotes to three-fifths, or 60 of the current 100 Senators.\\n  The filibuster is a tradition, barely a century old, less than half \\nthe age of the U.S. Constitution.\\n  There is a place for rules and traditions, but not when they obstruct \\nthe will of American people. Is it honorable for the United States \\nSenate to have a gentleman's agreement to keep bills from being voted \\non, or to dilute our representation in the United States Senate?\\n  Americans would rather that Congress pass just and reasonable laws \\nthan to preserve extraconstitutional, institutional traditions. \\nAmericans want our borders secure and our immigration laws to be \\nenforced.\\n  Congress is running out of time to keep its promises to the American \\npeople. We promised to ensure that what happened to Kate, Grant, \\nBrandon, and Sarah would not happen again. The House has done its duty. \\nIt is time for the Senate to do its duty.\\n  There are no excuses to allow these bills to die in the Senate. I \\nencourage my friends in the Senate to eliminate the 60-vote rule and to \\nconsider the two immigration enforcement bills that the House passed in \\nJune. We must not allow inaction to be the enemy of our sworn \\nresponsibilities as representatives of the American people.\\n  Again, I thank my friend from Colorado. I appreciate the opportunity \\nto say what has been on my mind for some time.\", u'turn': 10, u'speaker': u'Mr. BIGGS', u'itemno': 11}, {u'kind': u'speech', u'speaker_bioguide': u'B001297', u'text': u'  Mr. BUCK. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from Arizona for his \\ninsight, and I appreciate his comments here tonight.\\n  Mr. Speaker, in 2010, President Obama and Congress passed the Dodd-\\nFrank legislation that attempted to reform Wall Street and end the too-\\nbig-to-fail problem. But instead of fixing the financial industry, \\nDodd-Frank was mainly served to excessively regulate local community \\nbanks, making it harder for individuals on Main Street to gain access \\nto credit.\\n  The Financial CHOICE Act, sponsored by Chairman Jeb Hensarling from \\nthe Financial Services Committee, replaced Dodd-Frank with a system \\nthat holds Wall Street accountable, while also making credit more \\naccessible for Main Street America. The bill passed the House with 233 \\nvotes. It has been stuck in the Senate for 148 days.\\n  I yield to the gentleman from West Virginia (Mr. Mooney), my friend \\nand colleague, who sits on the Financial Services Committee, to talk \\nabout H.R. 10, the Financial CHOICE Act.\\n', u'turn': 11, u'speaker': u'Mr. BUCK', u'itemno': 12}, {u'kind': u'speech', u'speaker_bioguide': u'M001195', u'text': u\"  Mr. MOONEY of West Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from \\nColorado, Mr. Buck, for leading this Special Order effort and for \\nrecognizing me to talk about this issue and the general problem in the \\nSenate today of having legislation considered, debated, and passed in a \\nway that we can go to conference committee.\\n  As the gentleman mentioned, the Senate has already failed to act, and \\nis currently failing to act, as we stand here, on over 270 House-passed \\nbills. One of those bills is a really important one, very important to \\nthe committee on which I serve.\\n  I am proud to be on the Financial Services Committee. The tradition \\nof\\n\\n\\nthat position was held by my predecessor, Shelley Moore Capito, who \\nserved on that committee for 14 years. Ably led by Chairman Jeb \\nHensarling from Texas, we work in a bipartisan fashion, as much as we \\npossibly can, to bring relief to the American people, give consumers \\nchoices in banking products, and the ability to get a small loan or get \\na mortgage for their house. We are doing very important work there.\\n  So, as was mentioned, on June 8 of 2017, this year, here, the U.S. \\nHouse of Representatives, where I now stand, passed H.R. 10, the \\nFinancial CHOICE Act, by a vote of 233-186. I was very proud to vote \\nfor that legislation, as I know were a lot of my colleagues.\\n  The Financial CHOICE Act, if you are not familiar with the bill, \\nafter the financial crisis in 2007, Democrats held all the Chambers in \\nthe House, the Senate, and the Presidency, and they passed sweeping \\nlegislation that fundamentally changed the way our economy works for \\nthe worse; much more interference in your lives in banking, and the \\nability to make loans and consider requests for bank loans were done.\\n  Basically, Dodd-Frank is to the financial services industry what \\nObamaCare is to the healthcare industry. It is a government-knows-\\nbetter, one-size-fits-all, federally mandated set of laws that have \\nhurt the very people they claim they want to help. It hurts the same \\npeople they want to help. So we are repealing most of that, and we are \\ngoing to empower consumers, give you the choices back.\\n  So we have passed this bill. Let me just give you one example of \\nsomething in the bill, to be specific. There was something that was \\ndesignated in the Dodd-Frank bill called too big to fail. You may \\nremember that term, ``too big to fail.''\\n  That is a situation where Washington bureaucrats had decided that \\ncertain banks--the theory is that they are so essential to the global \\neconomy that failure would be catastrophic. So it takes the ability to \\nfail out of the banks' system, which then makes them act more risky. \\nBig does not necessarily refer to the size of the company, just what \\nthe government decides is essential, too big to fail.\\n  So the first bank that was too big to fail was Bear Stearns. In March \\nof 2008, the Federal Reserve lent $30 billion to JPMorgan Chase to buy \\nthe failing investment bank. Bear was a small bank, but very well-\\nknown, and there was a worry that it would destroy confidence in other \\nbanks. So your tax dollars were used to, essentially, bail out banks.\\n  So this bill repeals the authority of the Financial Stability \\nOversight Council to designate firms as systematically important \\ninstitutions. It prohibits the use of Exchange Stabilization Funds to \\nbail out banks. Most Americans I talk to don't think their taxpayer \\ndollars should be used to bail out banks, so this bill would stop that.\\n  So we passed that bill. We sent it to the Senate. We didn't think the \\nSenate would pass the exact same bill, word for word, that the House \\npassed. We thought they would consider our bill, take the parts they \\nlike, maybe change some parts, maybe add some parts, or move some \\nparts, pass a bill in the Senate, and then we would go to a conference \\ncommittee to reconcile the differences.\\n  One of the biggest travesties I have seen around here of the \\npolitical process, Mr. Speaker, is the failure to have conference \\ncommittees in the Congress any longer. The House passes all these \\nbills, over 300 over there; 270 are waiting for the Senate to do \\nanything on. Anything. And we wait for the Senate to act so we can have \\na conference committee and reconcile the differences.\\n  It is important to understand that no one in the House is demanding \\nthey get their way on every bill, every provision, all the time. We \\nsimply want to have a product sent to the Senate, have the Senate do \\ntheir job, do their due diligence, pass legislation in whatever form \\nthey can get out of the Senate, and have a chance to go to conference \\ncommittee, reconcile the differences.\\n  There is some give-and-take there. They won't get everything they \\nwant. We may not get everything we want. You can reconcile those \\ndifferences, and it has to go back and pass again.\\n  Over the past 3 years, my third year in Congress now, I have taken to \\nreminding folks things they learned in fifth grade, in fifth grade \\ngrade school, about how I am just a bill sitting on Capitol Hill, and \\nhow it is supposed to go to one Chamber; then it is supposed to go to \\nthe other, and they appoint a conference committee to reconcile the \\ndifferences.\\n  Instead, as the previous speaker, Congressman Biggs from Arizona, \\nmentioned, the filibuster is abused. You have 48 Democrats in the \\nSenate who filibuster everything. Everything. And for some reason, my \\ncolleagues on the majority side of the aisle, the Republicans, don't \\nput the bills on the floor to make the American people see them \\nfilibuster, and obstruct, and shut down, avoid conference committees, \\navoid passing anything in the Senate that would require action, and, \\ntherefore, just stop anything from happening. It is a travesty of the \\npolitical process.\\n  Neither Republican nor Democrats should stand for such an abusive \\nsystem in the Senate. So I think we should put the bills over there and \\nmake them act. We have actually started passing pieces of the CHOICE \\nAct, one small bill at a time, in order to get other stuff over to the \\nSenate, in the hope that they will just do something, act on something.\\n\\n  But we shouldn't have to do that, frankly, Mr. Speaker, because the \\nSenate can simply pass any bill they want, or any Senate bills they \\nwant, and then we can consider it in the House as well. We have led by \\npassing the CHOICE Act bill, which is the right thing to do.\\n  You know, as disappointing as it was to see the U.S. Senate fail to \\npass anything on healthcare, maybe the one silver lining was the \\nAmerican people could finally see what happens if three Republicans \\njoin with 48 Democrats to vote against the bill. We did not have the \\nvotes to pass anything on healthcare, and the whole healthcare reform \\nplan died at that moment.\\n  We are sitting here today with a failing healthcare system that is \\ngoing to continue to fail. ObamaCare is going to continue to fail. It \\nis not getting any better. It is getting worse.\\n  Look, our bill wasn't perfect, Mr. Speaker, but at least we did \\nsomething in the House to address the problem. I am not saying this \\nbill is perfect, the CHOICE Act for financial services, but we are \\ndoing something to address the problem that consumers are demanding, \\nwhere they can have more choice and more access to funds to buy a home \\nor start a small business. We are doing something about it, and the \\nSenate is doing nothing. They don't pass anything.\\n  In fact, we have passed all 12 appropriations bills in this Chamber. \\nAll 12 are sitting over there in the Senate, waiting for someone to \\nact.\\n  I think the first thing they should do is bring up the military \\nfunding bill. We are in November already. In December, next month, \\nfunding runs out. We have passed our appropriations bills. The Senate \\nis doing nothing on appropriations bills.\\n  They should bring that military bill to the floor of the Senate, \\nright now, and have a vote. It passed this Chamber with a strong, \\nbipartisan majority. Funding the military is not a partisan issue. \\nThere are votes, I believe, in the Senate and the House to fund the \\nmilitary.\\n  But if the 48 Democrat Senators want to filibuster, abuse their \\npower, abuse this filibuster tradition, which was mentioned is not in \\nthe Constitution, it is simply a courtesy extended to the minority \\nparty; if they want to continue to abuse that power, the American \\npeople should see them, ruthlessly, politically, try to shut down the \\nmilitary, and then try to blame the President or blame the House when \\nthey won't pass anything.\\n  They should pass a military appropriations bill that helps fund our \\ntroops. We will reconcile the differences and send it to the \\nPresident's desk. That, ladies and gentlemen, is how the process is \\nsupposed to work. That is what kept our democratic republican form of \\ngovernment, constitutional form of government, with democratic \\nelections, the rule of law, a republican constitution; that is what has \\nkept our country, to this point, functional and working well, having \\nthat bipartisan, bicameral process.\\n  What is currently happening is really a travesty to this process, \\nwhere it is being abused by the Senate. They have all these bills over \\nthere. It is high time for them to take action, pass\\n\\n\\nsomething, pass the best product they can on this issue, and let's go \\nto conference committee and reconcile the differences.\\n\\n\\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge the Senate to act as quickly as possible on the \\nCHOICE Act, on whatever provisions they want to. We are trying to \\nrepeal the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Another part of that, \\nthe fiduciary rule, has really hurt consumers. These are other parts of \\nthe CHOICE Act that need action. The American people need and expect \\nrelief.\", u'turn': 12, u'speaker': u'Mr. MOONEY of West Virginia', u'itemno': 13}, {u'kind': u'speech', u'speaker_bioguide': u'B001297', u'text': u'  Mr. BUCK.

So we \\nappreciate his work very much.\\n  Mr. Speaker, with rising premiums and sky-high deductibles, Americans \\nare hurting under ObamaCare. Republicans talk a lot about increasing \\ncompetition in the healthcare market, and this next bill actually makes \\nthat talk a reality.\\n  H.R. 372, the Competitive Health Insurance Reform Act restores \\nFederal antitrust laws to the health insurance industry, ensuring that \\nthe market for health insurance remains competitive and affordable for \\nAmericans.\\n  On March 22, the House passed this legislation in an overwhelmingly \\nbipartisan fashion, and 416 Members voted for it. It is 226 days later, \\nand the Senate can still not move that legislation through its Chamber.\\n  I yield to my friend and colleague, the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. \\nGosar), to say a few words about this bill that he sponsored.', u'turn': 13, u'speaker': u'Mr. BUCK', u'itemno': 14}, {u'kind': u'speech', u'speaker_bioguide': u'G000565', u'text': u\"  Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from Colorado (Mr. Buck) \\nfor taking the opportunity to highlight some of the good work the House \\nhas accomplished this year. I urge my colleagues in the Senate to build \\non these accomplishments so that Congress as a whole can keep their \\npromises to the American people.\\n  As Congress continues to face the preeminent task of repairing our \\nNation's healthcare system, first and foremost, we must establish the \\nproper foundation for a competitive and consumer-driven health \\ninsurance marketplace. The Competitive Health Insurance Reform Act of \\n2017 will restore the application of Federal antitrust and competition \\nlaws to the health insurance industry.\\n  Ending the special interest exemption is the first step to broader \\nhealthcare reform. Popular cost-reducing reform priorities, such as \\nselling insurance across State lines and developing diverse consumer-\\ndriven plans, are predicated on the robust competitive markets this \\nbill will ensure.\\n  The McCarran-Ferguson Act of 1945 exempted the insurance industry \\nfrom the Sherman Act and the Clayton Act, acts that have the purpose of \\nensuring fair competition. This broad exemption was intended to assist \\nthe newly developing business of insurance so that those companies \\ncould set sustainable premiums by permitting data sharing between \\ninsurance companies.\\n  However, after 70 years, it is apparent that the broad-stroked \\nexemption created by Congress in the 1940s was not wise. Over the \\ndecades, and expeditiously since the passage of ObamaCare in 2009, the \\nhealth insurance market has devolved into one of the least transparent \\nand most anticompetitive industries in the United States.\\n  It is clear that the continued exemption of the health insurance \\nindustry from the full application of the Federal antitrust laws has \\nhad an unfair impact on consumers. It shows up as artificially higher \\npremiums, unfair insurance restrictions, harmful policy exclusions, and \\nsimply no diversity of choice.\\n  These antiquated exemptions are no longer necessary. There is no \\nreason in law, policy, or logic for the health insurance industry to \\nhave special exemptions that are different from all other businesses in \\nthe United States.\\n  Repeal of the specific section of the McCarran-Ferguson Act, which \\napplies only to health insurance, has strong bipartisan support. A form \\nof this legislation passed the Democratic-controlled House during the \\n111th Congress by a vote of 406-19 and passed the Republican-led House \\nin the 112th Congress by a voice vote.\\n  Similar legislation has been introduced by multiple Democratic \\nMembers of the House, and the text of my bill has been included in the \\nRepublican Study Committee's healthcare reform bill for the last four \\nCongresses in a row.\\n  In March of this year, this pro-market reform received its biggest \\nshow of support yet, passing by an overwhelming majority of 416-7. Now, \\nwhen 416 Members of the House agree, it sends a strong call to action \\nin the Senate.\\n  As a dentist, I know how important robust competition is to dynamic \\nand effective health insurance. It should protect the patient as well \\nas the healthcare provider. It should uniformly apply associated checks \\nand balances that incentivize competition and prevent monopolies. \\nToday, in the healthcare market, those equally applied antitrust \\nprotections just simply don't exist.\\n  I don't have a crystal ball that will tell you what the future holds \\nfor healthcare or what it will look like. I don't think anybody knows. \\nBut I can tell you that history is an important guide. The 70-year \\nantitrust exemption for health insurance has strangled competition and \\nresulted in a consolidated, anticompetitive, and nontransparent scheme \\ncontrolled by seven megacorporations. That is not what we want for our \\nfuture.\\n  Instead, let's liberate the market by removing this antitrust \\nexemption. Imagine what could exist when we put the patient first and \\ndemand that health insurance companies compete for their business. This \\nmarket should be patient-centric, patient-focused, and provide a \\nvariety of affordable, quality options that empower patient involvement \\nand accountability.\\n  The passage of the Competitive Health Insurance Reform Act into law \\nis an important first step toward increasing competition in the health \\ninsurance market and will assist in setting the foundation for real \\ncompetitive and patient-centered healthcare reform.\\n  I thank my friends in the House for their strong support, and at the \\nsame time, promises were made in the Senate to get a vote on the Senate \\nfloor. I urge my colleagues in the Senate to build upon the good work \\nof this Chamber and do their part to restore competition in the health \\ninsurance industry.\\n  There is an old saying: Trust is a series of promises kept.\\n  Keep the promise. We are watching.\", u'turn': 14, u'speaker': u'Mr. GOSAR', u'itemno': 15}, {u'kind': u'speech', u'speaker_bioguide': u'B001297', u'text': u\"  Mr. BUCK.

Right now I feel the \\nsame way as a prosecutor impersonating a Congressman, and I appreciate \\nhis friendship and great insight.\\n  Mr. Speaker, I would like to now invite my friend and colleague, \\nRepresentative Ted Poe, to speak about the Email Privacy Act. This \\nlegislation clears up a loophole in the Electronic Communications \\nPrivacy Act, or ECPA, that allows the government, after a certain \\namount of time, to search someone's email if it is held on a third-\\nparty server.\\n  The ECPA was passed in 1986. For the past 30 years, our technology \\nhas drastically advanced, but our electronic communications policy has \\nbeen stuck in the 1980s. The Email Privacy Act allows the law to catch \\nup with the tech. This bill simply requires the government to have a \\nwarrant if they are going to search your email.\\n  This legislation passed on voice vote. After 269 days, the bill still \\nsits in the Senate Judiciary Committee.\\n  I yield to my friend and colleague, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. \\nPoe), to speak about this important legislation.\", u'turn': 15, u'speaker': u'Mr. BUCK', u'itemno': 16}, {u'kind': u'speech', u'speaker_bioguide': u'P000592', u'text': u\"  Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Arizona \\n(Mr. Buck) for yielding and for doing this Special Order.\\n  Most Members of Congress agree, I believe, that the Constitution \\nshould be followed. There are certain rights in the Constitution that \\nare very, very important to all of us. One of those is the right of \\nprivacy, enumerated specifically in the Fourth Amendment.\\n  The Fourth Amendment is unique to America. Other countries don't have \\nthe Fourth Amendment. We have it in the United States to protect the \\nprivacy of Americans.\\n\\n\\n  Let me give you a little history.\\n  As Congressman Buck pointed out, back in 1986, which was an eternity \\nago when you start talking about the digital age, Congress passed \\nlegislation to protect the emails that people had on their server for 6 \\nmonths. The idea was that people wouldn't keep their emails. They would \\ndelete them, and 6 months was a good enough time to protect those \\nemails from the spies in our government--I will use that phrase, that \\nis my phrase--and that is the current law. But here is what has \\nhappened over that 30 years.\\n  Many Americans stored their emails after that 6-month period. They \\nstore them in the cloud, for example. Americans store their schedules \\nin the cloud. They store photographs in the cloud.\\n  When Americans store those items that are over 6 months old in the \\ncloud, they are not protected against the search by our government of \\nthat email, of those photographs, of that schedule. In fact, searches \\ncan take place without the knowledge of the person whose email is being \\nsearched, without the approval of that individual, and the government \\nnever notifies that individual that that email stored in the cloud was \\nsearched because, under current law, the American citizen is only \\nprotected for emails stored on their server up to 6 months.\\n  So after about 4 years of working on this legislation with my friend \\nZoe Lofgren from California, bipartisan, we presented to Congress H.R. \\n387, the Email Privacy Act. As Congressman Buck said, on February 7, to \\nbe exact, of this year, that passed by voice vote on this floor, and we \\nsent it down the hallway to the siesta Senate to take a vote over \\nthere, and they have yet to vote on it.\\n  So what does that legislation do? It protects the right of privacy of \\nAmericans. It requires government to follow the Constitution.\\n  I was a former criminal court judge in Texas for 22 years. Like Mr. \\nBuck, I was also a prosecutor in the DA's office in Houston.\\n  The Fourth Amendment of the Constitution--remembering that this is \\nunique to America--protects Americans, their persons, their houses, \\ntheir papers, and their personal effects from the intrusion of \\ngovernment unless government has probable cause and government gets a \\nsearch warrant. That is the law. That is the Fourth Amendment.\\n  If government has a probable cause, go get a warrant from a judge. I \\nsigned hundreds of warrants from law enforcement as a judge.\\n  A simple example: the government can't search our mail, snail mail as \\nit is now called. When you put a letter in the mailbox and the \\npostmaster picks it up and sends it across the fruited plain and it \\nlands in somebody else's mailbox, government cannot generally go into \\nthat letter and seize it for any purpose unless they have a warrant to \\ndo so.\\n\\n  There are some exceptions, but government can seize your emails after \\n6 months if they are stored in the cloud, as I already mentioned, \\nwithout a warrant. So this legislation basically requires government to \\nfollow the Constitution.\\n  We have heard about the widespread abuse--that is my opinion--of the \\nNSA over the last several years, the government agencies that felt like \\nthey had a blank check to search and seize Americans' information \\nwithout their knowledge, without their approval, and without a warrant. \\nThis legislation goes to prevent that and simply requires that \\ninformation stored in the cloud--emails, photographs, schedules, or \\nwhatever--the government can go get it, but the government has got to \\nget a search warrant to seize that information.\\n  That is what this legislation does. It protects the Fourth Amendment. \\nIt protects Americans. It is simple legislation. It passed the House on \\nvoice vote, yet the Senate refuses to protect Americans from unlawful \\nsearches without the knowledge of Americans. We need to pass the \\nlegislation that Zoe Lofgren and I have sponsored that has passed the \\nHouse to protect that basic right.\\n  Mr. Speaker, I think our Senators would all vote ``yes'' for the \\nlegislation. They believe in the Constitution like the rest of us. They \\nbelieve in the Fourth Amendment like the rest of us.\\n  So let's get a vote. Another piece of legislation the House has \\npassed. We have done our job. We want the Senate to follow up and pass \\nthis good legislation to make it the law of the land so Americans are \\nmore secure in their papers and their effects and their homes.\\n  And that is just the way it is.\\n\\n\", u'turn': 16, u'speaker': u'Mr. POE of Texas', u'itemno': 17}, {u'kind': u'speech', u'speaker_bioguide': u'B001297', u'text': u\"  Mr. BUCK. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his hard work and \\npersistence on this very important issue.\\n  Mr. Speaker, this year, the House completed all 12 appropriations \\nbills. It is the first time in decades that that has happened. I am \\nproud that our Chamber worked hard to return to a regular \\nappropriations process, and I can tell you that there were many late \\nnights spent looking through amendment after amendment both in the \\nRules Committee hearing room and on the House floor. We thoughtfully \\nconsidered these bills and offered them for votes on the House floor.\\n  But the Senate hasn't approved any of these 12 bills. Not one. \\nRepublicans, month by month, crisis to crisis, were appropriating of \\nthe Obama administration era. But now Republicans are in charge, and \\nwithout Senate action, we are staring down the barrel of another \\nomnibus or continuing resolution. This isn't fair to the American \\npublic.\\n  The Founders gave to Congress the power of the purse so that 435 men \\nand women in this Chamber and 100 men and women in the Senate Chamber \\ncan spend weeks at a time thoughtfully discerning how to spend taxpayer \\ndollars. That is our job. The House has finished its work for this \\nyear, and now we beg the Senate to finish theirs.\\n  The House has done good work. We have listened to our constituents, \\nworked with our stakeholders, and met each other in the middle on many \\nbills. Now we are left just talking about these great bills because \\nthey are all stuck in the Senate.\\n  I want to take a minute in closing to remind the Senate why we are \\nhere and why the voters offered the Republican Party control of both \\nChambers and the House.\\n  We are here because Americans want fewer regulations. We are here \\nbecause Americans want lower healthcare premiums and costs. We are here \\nbecause Americans want a stronger stance against the world's bullies. \\nWe are here because Americans want a respect for the rule of law. We \\nare here because Americans want our veterans to have the best care. We \\nare here because Americans want better access to credit. They want to \\nprotect unborn life. We are here because Americans expect us to improve \\ntheir lives, to work on meaningful legislation that limits government, \\nthat stewards taxpayer dollars effectively, and that guards family \\nvalues.\\n  Americans should know that the House of Representatives has heard \\nthem. We have passed bills to address these concerns.

Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to be \\nhere this evening on the floor of the United States House of \\nRepresentatives and talk about a timely issue that is an issue that is \\nmost important to most of the American people, and that is the issue of \\nthe economy, globalization, automation, and all of the issues that are \\ncoming down on many communities across the United States.\\n  I want to take this opportunity to spend the next 30 minutes walking \\nthrough for the American people a little bit about what has happened \\nand talk very clearly about the differences in approach on how we deal \\nwith these issues, how the Republican Party is trying to deal with \\nthese issues, and how those of us on the Democratic side want to deal \\nwith these issues.\\n  I don't want to get into a discussion at all, Mr. Speaker, about who \\nhates whom, and who is bad and who is good,\\n\\n\\nand who is this and who is that. I want to talk about the facts, I want \\nto talk about the historical facts, and I want to talk about what is \\nhappening to average families across these United States.\\n  Clearly, given the volatility of the elections over the past 15 years \\nor so, I would argue that most of those elections have been about the \\neconomy, and that most of those elections have been about wages, \\npensions, security, and stability for families.\\n  My district is from Akron, Ohio, over to Youngstown and points in \\nbetween, right up against the Pennsylvania border. And what we have \\nseen over the last 20 or 30 years--for a while you think that all of \\nthis is just happening to your community, and then you realize as you \\nread and travel, you begin to see that, unfortunately, most communities \\nare facing very similar circumstances as the ones that I represent.\\n  So here on this chart we have an outline of what has happened in \\ncommunities with regard to foreign trade and automation. The red are \\nthe States that have been hardest hit. As it moves from red to brown to \\npurple to blue, and then a lighter blue, red is the most down to the \\nleast affected by globalization and automation.\\n  You will see on this chart the industrial Midwest, you will see up in \\nNew England, you will see down South, you will see as you move more to \\nthe central part of the country and then up into the Northwest, the \\nhardest hit are manufacturing States, and the hardest hit by \\nglobalization and automation are the Deep South.\\n  So the big question facing the United States of America today in 2017 \\nis: How do we fix this problem?\\n  These are States that have had significantly lower growth, and they \\nhave been hit hard with wages that have been stagnant for close to 30 \\nyears. We have seen an erosion of their pensions.\\n  So what are we going to do about this?\\n  The topic today in Washington, D.C., is the issue of tax reform. So \\nwe talk about tax reform in the context of the last time we had tax \\nreform, 31 years ago. Mr. Speaker, since then, we have seen that 96 \\npercent of income growth has gone to the wealthiest 10 percent of \\nfamilies in the United States. So in 30 years, 96 percent of income \\ngrowth in the country--almost all of it--has gone to the top 10 \\npercent. So the average family is getting squeezed.\\n  When you look back at the elections going back to, I think, 2006--I \\nthought 2004--2002 and 2004 were going to be elections about the \\neconomy, too, but after 9/11, that had an impact on what the national \\nconversation was about with regard to our elections. But I would \\nargue--and I have been here since 2003. I would argue that, in 2006, \\nthat election putting Democrats in was about the economy.\\n  I would say that 2008, during the Presidential election and, again, \\nfor Congress, was about the economy. We had a complete collapse. The \\nAmerican people didn't think the Democrats fixed things fast enough, so \\nin 2010 they put the Republicans in Congress. In 2012 things were \\ngetting better, and the election went for President Barack Obama, \\nthinking that he was moving things slightly in the right direction. But \\nthey thought he would probably be better than Mitt Romney, who would \\nhave let the auto industry collapse and who was perceived as being more \\nin line with the financial institutions in the United States. So they \\nvoted for President Obama.\\n  Then in 2014, President Obama wasn't doing things fast enough, still \\nthe squeeze, and then obviously in 2016, America voted for President \\nTrump, thinking that he was promising expansion of healthcare, opening \\nup the coal mines and opening up the steel mills. He was going to get \\nthe economy back, he was going to do it. It was going to be beautiful, \\nand he was going to do it with the waving of a magic wand. It was going \\nto be easy. So all of those elections were about the economy.\\n  So we still have this squeeze happening in the United States. We \\nstill have 63 percent of American families who could not withstand a \\n$500 catastrophe in their family with their car, with their health \\ninsurance, with someone's health in their family, or with an accident. \\n$500 in an emergency would send 63 percent of the families in the \\nUnited States spinning out of control.\\n\\n  We see with pensions, for example, that the average person 65 years-\\nplus only has $60,000 in a 401(k), which means they can drop out $3,000 \\na year--not a month, a year--out of their 401(k) for 20 years. Their \\naverage Social Security is a little over $1,000. Their pension isn't \\nmuch. And all of this averages to about $25,000 a year. So you are \\nsqueezed with your pension. You have had stagnant wages. You don't have \\nmuch of a savings. And most families can't withstand even a $500 \\nemergency.\\n  This constant squeeze over the last 30 years from globalization and \\nautomation has put many of the communities on the last chart behind the \\neight ball, unable to get and keep their nose above water for them and \\ntheir families.\\n  So our job is to figure out what the heck are we going to do about \\nthat. So the Republicans today proposed a new program of tax cuts. Here \\nis what their tax cuts look like. Remember, I said 96 percent of income \\ngrowth over the last 31 years went to the top 10 percent. So the \\nRepublican plan--again, we are not mad at them. This is just what they \\nthink is going to work.\\n  Their idea is: Why don't we give a tax cut to people making more than \\n$1 million a year? They will see a good chunk of the tax cut. The next \\ngroup, people making between $500,000 and $1 million a year, will see \\nthe next part--the biggest chunk of the tax cut.\\n  So the people who are making all of the income gains over the last 30 \\nyears, that huge concentration of wealth in the last 30 years, the \\nRepublicans think if we give them a tax cut, then they are going to \\ntake that tax cut, and it is going to trickle down to those red States \\nthat I had up here earlier in the industrial Midwest, in the South, \\nmoving into the central part of the country, and in the New England \\nStates that aren't really surrounded and based on finance. Let's give \\nthem a tax cut and hope it makes its way and trickles its way down to \\nYoungstown, Ohio. That is their solution. That is what they think is \\ngoing to work.\\n  So let's ask ourselves: Have we tried this before?\\n  We have. When I was early in my career, we tried this approach of \\nsupply-side economics. We are going to cut taxes for the wealthy. They \\nare going to take that money. It is going to make its way back into the \\neconomy, and it is going to get wages up, secure pensions, and all the \\nrest.\\n  So with the Republican plan, they have done things to do that. Not \\njust cut taxes for the wealthy, they get rid of the alternative minimum \\ntax, which means no matter how many loopholes you are able to take \\nadvantage of, there is a minimum you are going to have to pay. And if \\nthey get rid of that minimum tax, and if that minimum tax wasn't in \\nplace a few years back, President Trump would have reduced his tax \\nburden by $30 million--just so we can wrap our heads around this stuff.\\n  Under the plan that they have now, the top 175,000 richest families \\nin the country will see a $700 tax cut. That is their plan. We really \\ncan't afford it because we have got to borrow $1\\\\1/2\\\\ trillion to pay \\nfor all this stuff.\\n  So that is where we are. That is their solution. Huge challenges with \\nthe middle class, huge challenges with pensions, huge challenges with \\nwages and retirement and cost of healthcare and education, and their \\nplan is to cut the taxes for the wealthy and hope it helps everyone \\nelse. That is their plan.\\n  We have tried this before. When President Bush got in, there were two \\nrounds of tax cuts that he passed in the early part of the first decade \\nof this century. He gave most of the taxes, in the same way, to the top \\n1 percent of earners. They got a huge chunk of what we called the Bush \\ntax cuts.\\n\\n\\n  That was their strategy back then.\\n  What happened in that decade following the Bush tax cuts?\\n  Well, we see that, after the Bush tax cuts, we had the slowest \\neconomic growth in the United States post-World War II, the slowest \\ngrowth across the board in the United States. They cut taxes for the \\nwealthiest in the hopes that it would somehow help the economy. They \\nalso deregulated the financial markets because that was going to help, \\ntoo.\\n  So what happened was that we had very low growth: employment only \\nincreased by 0.3 percent, and the real\\n\\n\\nGDP only grew by 2.6 percent; wages were stagnant.\\n  As we all remember, in 2007 and 2008, things started to unravel in \\nthe economy, and we had a huge collapse in the housing market that was \\nderegulated. We didn't have any cops on the beat watching what was \\ngoing on.\\n  Stagnant growth ends in the collapse, and then Democrats came in and, \\nquite frankly, fixed the problem, stemmed the tide, and did what we \\ndid. That is a whole other story.\\n  The whole idea that cutting taxes for the wealthy is really going to \\nbump employment and really bump GDP growth is shown in recent economic \\nhistory to not be true.\\n  Now, what do we have to compare this with?\\n  If we go back another decade to 1993, when President Bill Clinton got \\ninto office, he had a different strategy and the Democrats had a \\ndifferent strategy. We started to run up the deficits coming out of the \\neighties. We had to get our financial house in order.\\n  President Clinton came in and raised some taxes on the wealthiest \\npeople in the country, not because we don't like them, but the country \\nneeded revenue. We reinvested that money, balanced the budget, and what \\nhappened? A totally different strategy than our friends on the other \\nside--right?--totally different. What we saw in the 1990s was \\nemployment at 2.4 percent, and we saw real GDP growth at 3.7 percent.\\n  The red is the Bush tax cut that we have already tried in the \\nhistorical analysis of that, ending in a financial collapse and \\nstagnant wages. What we saw with President Clinton's economic plan is \\nreal growth, and we saw an improvement in employment. Wages went up in \\nevery single bracket, from the poorest to the wealthiest. Everybody \\nmade more money. We had a balanced plan on how to do it.\\n  When we look at what happened with the Bill Clinton plan--oh, by the \\nway, it ended the decade with a $5.6 trillion surplus. That is a $5.6 \\ntrillion surplus that we had here in the United States that, when \\nPresident Bush got in, he gave it all away in tax cuts. I just told you \\nthat story.\\n  What the Democrats are saying is kind of what President Trump was \\nsaying during the campaign. There has been this huge concentration of \\nwealth at the top, and they have seen all the income gain.\\n  We have got debt and deficits to pay for. We have got to rebuild the \\nUnited States. We have got to lay broadband in every corner of the \\ncountry. We need a new energy grid. We need a resilient economy to \\nprepare ourselves for the storms and the hurricanes and the ups and \\ndowns from climate change. We have got to reinvest back into our \\nneighborhoods. We have thousands of blighted homes in communities all \\nacross the United States that need to come down.\\n  What we are saying is: Don't borrow $1.5 trillion from China and then \\ntake the money that you are borrowing from China, pay interest on it, \\nand give it to primarily the top 1 percent of the wealthiest people in \\nthe United States. That doesn't make any sense.\\n  In good times, I don't know if that makes any sense, but certainly \\nnot when we are already running huge deficits, not when we have the \\nbaby boomers moving into our healthcare programs for the elderly, not \\nwhen we have an opioid epidemic where we lost more people in 1 year, \\nlast year, than we lost in the entire Vietnam war. That doesn't make \\nany sense.\\n  We have got to rebuild the country. We are competing with China. We \\nhave to make sure that our military is equipped, our students are \\neducated, and that we are investing in research and development to \\ndevelop wind and solar, the next generation of renewable energy, the \\nnext generation of jobs.\\n  And we are borrowing money from China to the tune of $1.5 trillion to \\ngive to the wealthiest people in the country? Does that make any sense?\\n  Mr. Speaker, it does not.\\n  This is the most irresponsible tax proposal I have seen. I will even \\nsay it is more irresponsible than the Bush tax credits. At least with \\nthe Bush tax credits, we had a $5.6 trillion surplus. Many of us were \\nsaying to put that into Medicare, put it into Social Security. In the \\nAl Gore campaign, it became a joke: Put it in a lock box; don't touch \\nit; save it for a rainy day.\\n  A few months later, 9/11 happened, and we could have used some of \\nthat for the next decade. We could have rebuilt the economy, moved the \\neconomy forward, reinvested it back into the United States. At least we \\nhad it coming.\\n  The economy was growing and President Bush said: Well, we will give \\nit back in tax cuts primarily to the rich.\\n  Now we don't even have it. Now we are going to go out and borrow it \\nand bring it in from China and say: Okay, China, we will owe you \\nanother $1.5 trillion because we don't owe you enough already. We are \\nnot going to give it to the middle class, who has not seen a pay raise \\nfor 30 years. We are going to give it to the top end.\\n  I just think this is very irresponsible for us as we are trying to \\nget the economy to work for everybody and we have all of these \\nchallenges that we are trying get our arms around here in the United \\nStates that will take some public investment.\\n  I am not here to say that the government can solve all of our \\nproblems, because it can't. I am not saying that every solution is \\nabout writing a check from Uncle Sam and putting it into a program, \\nbecause it is not. But what we do have to do is make some investments \\non the public side that are going to allow for growth.\\n\\n  When you talk about things like broadband penetration to make sure \\nthat rural America or small towns or certain parts of our cities have \\naccess to high-speed broadband, high-speed internet access, you will \\nsee that, for every 10 percent penetration, you see, I think it is, 1, \\n1.3, 1.4 percent growth in the GDP. It sounds like a pretty good \\ninvestment.\\n  So let's figure out how we can do a public-private partnership with \\nthe telecommunications companies and the public to make sure that we \\nhave high-speed internet access all over the United States. Let's sit \\ndown with the power companies, the energy companies, and figure out how \\nwe redo our energy grid so that we can have a 21st century, efficient, \\nsecure energy grid.\\n  And, oh, by the way, ask all of these people who are underemployed \\ntoday to help us build out this new America. Whether it is broadband or \\nthe energy grid, it is in the ground. These jobs can't be outsourced. \\nThe same with renewable energy. Many of the jobs related to renewable \\nenergy cannot be outsourced. These are the investments we need to make.\\n  Again, we are competing with China. This, my friends, is a very \\nimportant point. When you look at what China is doing militarily with \\nNorth Korea, not helping as much as we want them to, moving out, \\nactually building islands in the South China Sea, further projecting \\ntheir force, moving into Africa, already in Africa, establishing bases \\nin Africa, building relationships, getting minerals and other resources \\nout of Africa, moving ahead with battery-powered cars in China and \\nhere, moving and spending $360 billion on renewable energy initiatives \\nby 2020, creating 13 million jobs, China is on the move.\\n  What are we doing? What does the Republican Party want to do? What \\ndoes the Trump administration want to do, Mr. Speaker, while China is \\ninvesting billions of dollars in renewable energy, creating 13 million \\nnew jobs? This genius idea is to go and borrow $1.5 trillion from them \\nand take it and give it to the wealthiest people in the United States \\nin the form of a tax cut that they don't need.\\n  We are going to further position ourselves behind them in the race \\nfor the green economy. This could mean jobs in places like Youngstown, \\nOhio, investments in places like Youngstown, Ohio, driving up wages in \\nYoungstown, Ohio, increasing and securing pensions in these industrial \\nStates and in the South. That, to me, makes sense. That, to me, is a \\nsmart plan.\\n  So, Mr. Speaker, I am deeply frustrated with this tax cut. I think it \\nis irresponsible. I don't think it makes economic sense. As we start to \\npeel through it, other than the big picture of $1.5 trillion that we \\nare going to borrow from the Chinese to pay for it, they are going to \\nget rid of people's ability to deduct student loans. Medical \\nemergencies will no longer be deductible.\\n  They are providing instability in the wind sector with the wind tax \\ncredit, which has about $50 billion in investments. About 50,000 jobs \\nare at stake and 500 factories participating in this new economy.\\n\\n\\n  There is a way to do this. There is a way to be smart. We can't let \\nour ideology determine our public policy if it doesn't make any sense. \\nIf we can have a balanced approach, we pay for the spending; and \\nbecause of the situation we are in, we ask the wealthiest in the United \\nStates to help us pay for this because they have seen 96 percent of the \\nincome growth over the last 30 years.\\n  If we do it right and we do it smart, we will position the next \\ngeneration of Americans to be in an economy that they can thrive in, \\nthat provides stability for them, security for them and their families, \\nand it will also help us deal with the great challenge of our time: \\nglobal climate change.\\n  Mr. Speaker, I hope that, as this process moves forward, we recognize \\nthat this tax cut bill is not the solution to the economic problems. It \\nhas gone against what the President of the United States campaigned on, \\nand I believe it is the very betrayal of his campaign, a betrayal of \\nwhat that campaign meant to so many people, and a betrayal of those \\nvery people whom he said he was going to help.\\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\\n\", u'turn': 1, u'speaker': u'Mr. RYAN of Ohio', u'itemno': 1}, {u'kind': u'linebreak', u'speaker_bioguide': None, u'text': u'                          ____________________\\n\\n\\n', u'turn': -1, u'speaker': u'None', u'itemno': 2}], u'header': {u'extension': False, u'vol': u'163', u'wkday': u'Thursday', u'chamber': u'House', u'num': u'178', u'year': u'2017', u'month': u'November', u'pages': u'H8435-H8438', u'day': u'2'}, u'doc_title': u'TAX REFORM', u'id': u'CREC-2017-11-02-pt1-PgH8435', u'title': u'TAX REFORM'}{u'content': [{u'kind': u'linebreak', u'speaker_bioguide': None, u'text': u'                                 ______\\n', u'turn': -1, u'speaker': u'None', u'itemno': 0}, {u'kind': u'title', u'speaker_bioguide': None, u'text': u'                          HON.

His commitment to \\nhis community can be seen through his involvement in and leadership of \\nmany organizations, including the Greater Houston Red Cross, Camp \\nAllen, the Talking Book Program and the Texas Stream Team.

Mr. President, I come to the floor today to join several \\nof my colleagues in raising concerns about nominations to the Federal \\njudiciary and the Senate's role in carrying out its constitutional \\nadvice and consent responsibilities. From my vantage point as a member \\nof the Judiciary Committee, I can see all too clearly that an alarming \\ntrend of more and more extreme judicial candidates appearing before us \\nis growing, that more extreme judicial candidates are being nominated, \\nand that the safeguards here in the Senate that are important to our \\nvetting process are being threatened.\\n  Let me start by giving a simple overview of what has happened, first \\nin terms of the speed at which we are considering critical lifetime \\nappointments to some of the most central courts in our whole Federal \\njudicial system.\\n  Just this week, my Republican colleagues have brought forward four \\ncircuit court nominees--four nominees in one week--beginning to end. \\nThat is more than the number of circuit court nominees than were \\nconfirmed in the entire first year of President Obama's Presidency.\\n  More important to me than the speed is the quality of our process of \\nreviewing these important nominations. The\\n\\n\\nAmerican Bar Association has issued unanimous ``not qualified'' ratings \\nfor two current judicial nominees. That hasn't happened in over a \\ndecade--since 2006. The American Bar Association is not a partisan or a \\npolitical group. Founded in 1878, the ABA is a national professional \\norganization with over 400,000 attorney members. The ABA's \\nuncontroversial objectives are to serve its members, improve the legal \\nprofession, enhance diversity, and advance and secure the rule of law \\nin our Nation. Its contributions to the legal profession are \\nsignificant. It is the ABA that accredits law schools and establishes \\nmodel ethical codes.\\n  Additionally, since 1953, when President Eisenhower invited the ABA \\nto provide specific, timely input on candidates for Federal judgeships, \\nthe ABA has evaluated nominees for professional competence, integrity, \\nand judicial temperament. This is a rigorous process that involves \\ncollecting impartial, peer-review evaluations of candidates.\\n  It is startling that less than a year into this administration, two \\nnominees have already received ``not qualified'' ratings from the ABA, \\nand two more nominees are under consideration of what is called a \\nsecond evaluator. This is concerning. You see, the ABA does not take \\ngiving a ``not qualified'' rating lightly. Any time an evaluator is \\nconsidering recommending ``not qualified,'' a second evaluator is \\nbrought in to conduct an independent review. I believe all nominees to \\nlifetime article III appointments on the Federal bench should have the \\ncompetence, integrity, and temperament to do the important work that \\nFederal judges are called on to perform.\\n  The nominees we are seeing not only raise concerns about professional \\nqualifications and the speed with which they have been processed. Many \\nof the President's recent candidates are notable for their polarizing, \\ndivisive, even offensive rhetoric, rather than the depth of their legal \\nexperience or the quality of their judicial temperament. I will give \\njust a few selections from a broad range.\\n  We have recently considered candidates on the Judiciary Committee who \\nhad blogged at length in support for birtherism, the discredited and \\nuntrue conspiracy theory that suggested that our immediate past \\nPresident wasn't born in the United States. Another suggested that \\n``Mama Pelosi'' should be ``gagged.'' Another called Supreme Court \\nJustice Kennedy a ``judicial prostitute,'' compared abortion to \\nslavery, complained that Americans overreacted to Sandy Hook, repeated \\nanti-gay slurs, and said transgender children are proof that ``Satan's \\nplan is working.'' Many alarming, even extreme comments are in the \\nrecords of folks brought forward for confirmation--a startling number \\nof them.\\n  Frankly, this isn't about party allegiance--being a Republican or a \\nDemocrat, being a conservative or a liberal. This is about having the \\njudgment and the temperament to be a Federal judge.\\n  The mechanisms we have for completely evaluating nominees are today \\nbeing strained. The American Bar Association has been cut out of some \\nof the White House's efforts, its prenomination vetting process. That \\nmeans that when the ABA conducts an evaluation and seeks feedback from \\na candidate's peers, they discover the nomination has already been \\nannounced by the White House. The candidate has already been chosen. \\nUnderstandably, lawyers are reluctant to provide candid feedback when \\nthey know a potential judge has already been nominated. Additionally, \\nit is concerning that we have had hearings in the Judiciary Committee \\nbefore the ABA rating process is completed. When that happens, it \\nprevents the ABA, our professional organization of attorneys, from \\nbeing called to testify to explain a ``not qualified'' rating at a \\nhearing where a nominee is considered. In fact, just earlier today, we \\nhad two judicial nominees listed on our agenda who do not yet have an \\nABA rating.\\n  I am not suggesting that every Senator needs to vote in lockstep with \\nthe ABA rating, but I feel strongly that the ABA's evaluation must be \\navailable to Senators before they are asked to vote on a nominee for a \\nlifetime position as a Federal judge.\\n  Another tool that is under attack that is a century-old tradition of \\nthe Judiciary Committee is the so-called blue slip. This is a practice \\nthat allows the two home-State Senators to give a positive or negative \\nrecommendation on a nominee before they receive a hearing and are \\nconsidered for lifetime tenure. It allows each Senator to approve the \\njudicial nominations for vacancies in their home States or in the \\ncircuit courts where a seat is traditionally associated with that home \\nState. By requiring that blue slips be returned before a nominee is \\nconsidered, each Senator is afforded the courtesy to evaluate whether a \\njudicial nominee will meet the needs of his or her constituents and the \\npriorities and values of their home State. It is an important tool for \\nensuring that the White House of either party consults with Senators \\nabout the judicial candidates the President is considering for \\nnomination. In the end, this tool promotes consensus candidates by \\nensuring all Senators' views are taken into account, without respect to \\npartisan registration.\\n  As a Senator from Delaware--a State with two current judicial \\nvacancies in one of the busiest district courts in America, which only \\nhas four active judgeships--I have been focused on working \\ncollaboratively with the White House in a productive manner that \\nensures that my State gets qualified consensus nominees from the White \\nHouse. I am pleased to report that Senator Carper and I have had a very \\npositive experience so far working with the White House on these \\npotential nominations, and it is my hope that we will soon see nominees \\nI can support without reservation. But the blue slip process ensures \\nthat this consultative, constructive experience is the rule, not the \\nexception. It is unfortunate that this blue slip practice--this \\ncentury-old tradition of the Judiciary Committee--is under sustained \\nattack. I believe we should maintain it for all Senators, in the best \\ninterests of this institution and our Federal judiciary.\\n  Article III judges, as I have said, serve with lifetime tenure. They \\ndecide issues of civil rights, of personal freedom, commercial disputes \\nof enormous value, and even life and death. These judges can and \\nshould, on occasion, also serve as checks on Presidential power \\noverreach. Just in the past few months, article III judges have \\nenjoined executive orders, including the so-called travel ban, the \\ntransgender military ban, and the decision to strip funding from \\nsanctuary cities.\\n  We should be advancing nominees who can earn broad support from \\nMembers of both parties, nominees with the experience to handle some of \\nthe most complex and demanding judicial issues of our time, nominees \\nwho have demonstrated the temperament to administer justice fairly. \\nThese nominations matter. The nominees who will fill the 140 current \\njudicial vacancies on district and circuit courts across our country \\nwill play a critical role in either protecting or undermining the \\nconstitutional rights that are the bedrock of our Republic. Our courts \\nmust continue to be the place where everyone is treated fairly and the \\nlegal rights of our citizens can be vindicated.\\n  I wish to close by calling on my colleagues to reconsider how we are \\nconducting the judicial nominee process. This race to confirm as many \\nnominees as possible is not how we respect the rule of law--one of the \\nmost treasured American values.\\n  I have come to the floor multiple times since the beginning of this \\nCongress to convey and speak about the importance of bipartisanship, \\nand I will continue to do that today.\\n  As we have seen in important public policy matters, from the \\nhealthcare debate to the current debate on tax reform, Republicans and \\nDemocrats need to work together to get things done. Purely partisan \\nprocesses will not succeed in this or future Congresses. We have to \\nwork together to protect our democracy and our rule of law.\\n  I would also like to note that today Sam Clovis withdrew as a nominee \\nfor Chief Scientist at the USDA.\\n  I am not here to comment on any connection to any ongoing \\ninvestigations or other social issues but, rather, would like to \\ncomment on a simple concern I have had since his nomination; namely, \\nthat Mr. Clovis is unqualified to serve as Chief Scientist, lacking any \\nprofessional training in the hard sciences. This is not just my opinion \\nbut a matter of statutory requirement. It is a requirement in statute \\nto have a background in science.\\n\\n\\nScience is critically important to agriculture, and this is another \\nFederal agency that depends on good science.\\n  Given the serious challenges facing America's farmers and our food \\nsystem--from pollinator declines, to deteriorating soil health, to a \\nchanging climate--USDA's science mission is extremely important. As \\nsomeone whose home State university has a vibrant department of \\nagriculture, as someone who knows the very broad range of Federal \\nfunding for USDA that supports agriculture-related scientific \\nresearch--the USDA is critical in helping provide our farmers with the \\ninformation they need to improve plant and animal resilience, to be \\nmore effective stewards of the land, and to adopt new technologies and \\npractices on their farms. This could all be at risk if the agency's \\nhead of science has no relevant scientific training and even rejects \\ncurrent scientific thinking.\\n  I believe that science, not mere opinion or partisan attitude, should \\nunderpin our decisions when it comes to our Nation's agricultural \\npolicy.\\n  It is my hope that the administration will now go back and recommend \\na nominee who is scientifically trained and who cares deeply about the \\nrole of science in our Nation's agriculture.\\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\", u'turn': 0, u'speaker': u'Mr. COONS', u'itemno': 0}, {u'kind': u'speech', u'speaker_bioguide': None, u'text': u'  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. Speaker, it is with a heavy heart and \\nsolemn remembrance that I pay tribute to a respected athlete, an \\nambitious franchiser, and a friend of longstanding, Mr. Brady Keys, Jr. \\nMr. Keys passed away on Tuesday, October 24, 2017. A memorial service \\nwill be held on Saturday, November 4, 2017 at 1:30 p.m. at Rejoice in \\nthe Lord Ministries in Apopka, FL and will be followed by a funeral \\nservice and burial on Thursday, November 9, 2017 at 2:00 p.m. at \\nInglewood Park Cemetery Chapel in Inglewood, CA.\\n  Brady Keys, Jr. was born on May 19, 1937 in Austin, Texas. He \\nattended Kealing High School in Austin, before moving to California, to \\nattend Polytechnic High School.\\n  After graduating high school, he enrolled at East Los Angeles Junior \\nCollege, where he played semi-pro football and gained the attention of \\nFido Murphy, a scout for the Pittsburgh Steelers. Murphy offered Keys a \\nposition on the Steelers taxi squad, which he declined. Murphy then \\noffered Keys an education at Colorado State University with the hope \\nthat he could be legally drafted as a free agent. During his junior \\nyear, he was ultimately drafted by the Pittsburgh Steelers and played \\nwith them for six years. He played as a defensive back for a total of \\neight seasons with the National Football League, also playing for the \\nMinnesota Vikings and St. Louis Cardinals.\\n  Brady Keys, Jr. was not only a natural athlete, but he was also a \\nvery successful entrepreneur, owning numerous enterprises and \\nfranchises. After leaving the NFL, Brady was determined to start his \\nown restaurant franchise but was denied business loans as bankers were \\nreluctant to lend to businesses with African-American management. \\nHowever, he did not let that stop him. In 1967, with the financial help \\nof Art Rooney, then Coach of the Steelers, he opened his first All-Pro \\nChicken restaurant in Detroit, Michigan. As All-Pro Chicken expanded, \\nMr. Keys became the first African-American to establish a national \\nfranchise.\\n  After the opening of his first All-Pro Chicken restaurant, Mr. Keys' \\nbusiness empire expanded beyond his All-Pro restaurants. His businesses \\nincluded several Kentucky Fried Chicken restaurants in Albany, Georgia; \\nthe Urban Talent Development Corporation; The Keys Group; Pennky Mining \\nand Oil Company; Brady Keys, Jr. Athletic Foundation, Inc.; Keys \\nCommunications Group, Inc., (formed upon purchase of WJIZ 96.3 FM and \\nWJYZ 960 AM radio stations in Albany, Georgia); Alpha-Keys Orlando \\nRetail Associates; Keys Technology Group, Inc.; Keys News and Gift \\nShop; Keys-Watt Productions, Inc.; and Keys and Sons Jewelers. Brady \\nwas truly an asset to the Albany, Georgia, Orlando, Georgia, and \\nDetroit, Michigan communities, and his companies contributed over $40 \\nmillion to the economies of those states.\\n  A prominent sports figure and successful business owner, Brady Keys, \\nJr. received several awards and appointments including an appointment \\nto the Advisory Council on Minority Business Enterprise by President \\nNixon; an award for Outstanding African-American Albanian of the Year; \\nand several rankings on Black Entertainment Magazine's list of 100 \\nlargest minority owned businesses between the years of 1972 to 1979.\\n  Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. once said, ``Life's most urgent question \\nis: What are you doing for others?'' Brady Keys, Jr. committed a \\nprodigious amount of time and love to the service of others, and he \\nshared his own enthusiasm and wisdom in order to better those around \\nhim. In life and in death, Brady has left a lasting impact on all those \\nwhose lives he has touched.\\n  Brady Keys, Jr. leaves behind his wife of many years, Anna, and a \\nlarge loving family and a host friends who will miss him dearly.\\n  Mr. Speaker, my wife Vivian and I, along with the more than 730,000 \\nresidents of the Second Congressional District of Georgia, salute Brady \\nKeys, Jr. for his outstanding entrepreneurism, untiring commitment to \\nminority business ownership, and community development in the urban \\ncommunities where he lived. I ask my colleagues to join all of us in \\nextending our deepest condolences to the Keys family during this \\ndifficult time. We pray that they will be consoled and comforted by an \\nabiding faith and the Holy Spirit in the days, weeks, and months ahead.\\n\\n\", u'turn': 0, u'speaker': u'Mr. BISHOP of Georgia', u'itemno': 2}], u'header': {u'extension': True, u'vol': u'163', u'wkday': u'Thursday', u'chamber': u'House', u'num': u'178', u'year': u'2017', u'month': u'November', u'pages': u'E1499', u'day': u'2'}, u'doc_title': u'IN HONOR OF MR.

Mr. Speaker, today I rise in memory of \\nfallen Mississippi soldier Army First Lieutenant (1LT) Robert Charles \\nOneto-Sikorski who gave his life while in service to our great nation \\non October 31, 2005, during Operation Iraqi Freedom. 1LT Oneto-Sikorski \\nwas killed when an improvised explosive device detonated near his \\ndismounted patrol in Iskandariyah, Iraq. 1LT Oneto-Sikorski was \\nassigned to the 1st Battalion, 155th Infantry, Mississippi Army \\nNational Guard, Biloxi, Mississippi.\\n  1LT Oneto-Sikorski was born on September I, 1972, in New Orleans, \\nLouisiana, but called Bay St. Louis his home. According to the \\nAssociated Press, while 1LT Oneto-Sikorski was serving in Iraq, his \\nhome was flooded from the\\n\\n\\nstorm surge caused by Hurricane Katrina. Despite his loss, Elaine \\nOneto, 1LT Oneto-Sikorski's mother, said her son looked to the future \\nand talked about his homecoming which would have been in December 2005. \\n``He was devoted to his children. He is so much more than any of us \\ncould say,'' Mrs. Oneto said. ``He was a wonderful man who loved \\neveryone and his loss is going to devastate this whole community.''\\n  Patrick Rager, 1LT Oneto-Sikorski's son, recently said he will always \\nbe remembered for his service and sacrifice. ``I am proud of his \\nservice, and to this day, I strive to make him proud through hard work \\nand getting good grades in school,'' Patrick said. ``Many people go \\nthrough this life and have little to no impact. Because of his \\nsacrifice, he will not be forgotten.''\\n  1LT Oneto-Sikorski was remembered by a fellow soldier on a memorial \\nwebsite. ``I was serving with Ski in Iraq. He was my XO and my close \\nfriend,'' SFC Gene Dufrene said. ``Ski was by far the best officer that \\nanyone could serve with. He was what we NCOs called a real soldiers' \\nofficer. He would break his neck to take care of us. He took care of \\neach and every soldier under his command. We all miss our brother and \\nwe will always remember Ski for the man he was to each of us \\nsoldiers.''\\n  1LT Oneto-Sikorski was employed at Northrop Grumman's Ingalls \\nShipyard in Pascagoula, Mississippi, where he worked in the engineering \\ndepartment.\\n  1LT Oneto-Sikorski was buried with full honors at the Biloxi National \\nCemetery.\\n  1LT Oneto-Sikorski is survived by his parents, Elaine Marie Oneto and \\nRobert Charles Sikorski, II; his wife, Kristine Seamans Sikorski; his \\nthree children, Robert Charles Sikorski, II, Patrick Rager, and Hannah \\nRager; the mother of his children, Clare Rager; and his two sisters, \\nShawn Durfey, and Kathleen Sherlock.\\n  1LT Oneto-Sikorski demonstrated courage and bravery protecting the \\nfreedoms we all enjoy.

Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\\n  I rise today in support of H.R. 849, the Protecting Seniors' Access \\nto Medicare Act. This discussion is not new. Republicans and Democrats \\ncame together to pass this same bill back in 2015. This year there is, \\nonce again, strong bipartisan support with 45 Democratic Members and \\n225 Republican cosponsors. It passed out of the Ways and Means \\nCommittee last month with bipartisan support, too.\\n  This bill will repeal the Independent Payment Advisory Board, or \\nIPAB, created in ObamaCare, the Affordable Care Act. The IPAB puts 15 \\nunelected bureaucrats in charge of Medicare spending with significant \\nunilateral powers to slash payments to providers, forcing them to stop \\nseeing Medicare patients without any accountability, judicial review, \\nor transparency.\\n  The board's unprecedented authority to alter Medicare policy could \\nultimately reduce seniors' access to healthcare and put the government, \\nrather than the patient, at the center of the healthcare system.\\n  Putting Medicare on a sustainable financial footing is a top priority \\nfor all of us here in Congress, but passing the buck to a handful of \\nunaccountable bureaucrats is not the right approach.\\n  Last year, the Medicare Trustees Report stated that this was to be \\nthe year that the IPAB's authority to make cuts would be triggered. \\nFortunately, this year's Medicare Trustees Report has given us slightly \\nmore time, but next year, they can come back and move that date up once \\nagain. This is a cloud that will hang over providers and beneficiaries, \\nunless we act and pass this bill today.\\n  Now some have stated that this bill does not solve any immediate \\nproblem, and they have questioned the need to act on the bill today. I \\nbelieve that our seniors and our healthcare providers are a priority. \\nWhy should we kick the can down the road when we can stop this today?\\n  There are letters of support from over 700 bipartisan groups \\nrepresenting patients, employers, hospitals, doctors, nurses, and other \\nhealthcare professionals all voicing strong support for IPAB repeal.\\n  They believe that the threat of this board is enough to warrant \\nrepeal and to place the decisionmaking back in the hands of elected \\nMembers of Congress, and I agree.\\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\", u'turn': 5, u'speaker': u'Mr. PAULSEN', u'itemno': 11}, {u'kind': u'speech', u'speaker_bioguide': u'L000263', u'text': u\"  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\\n  Mr. Speaker, this is really the question: Why in the world are we \\ntaking up a bill to terminate a board that does not exist? Why in the \\nworld are we doing so when premiums are rising and action should be \\ntaken to strengthen them? Why in the world are we passing a bill that \\nwould increase the deficit by $17.6 billion? Pay for CHIP, the \\nRepublicans say, but not this bill.\\n  So however you feel about IPAB, this is the wrong time and the wrong \\nbill for addressing it. The ACA enrollment period began yesterday, and \\nbecause of actions of the Trump administration, consumers across the \\ncountry face confusion and instability in the market.\\n  Rather than addressing these urgent issues, we are engaged today in a \\npolitical exercise to repeal IPAB, a board that has no members under a \\nprovision that has never taken effect and is not projected to be \\ntriggered before 2021, according to CMS actuaries.\\n  In September, every Democratic member of the Ways and Means Committee \\nwrote to Chairman Brady urging bipartisan action to stabilize the \\ninsurance market. But after repeated requests, we never received a \\nresponse from the chairman, and, to date, the House has taken no action \\non behalf of consumers.\\n  In the meanwhile, the Trump administration has continued to work to \\nundermine the law and access to healthcare by: one, cutting off funding \\nfor cost-sharing assistance for moderate-income enrollees; two, \\nslashing funds to navigators that help consumers enroll in coverage--\\nthe biggest navigator in Michigan had its funding cut by 90 percent; \\nthree, shortening the enrollment period; four, shutting down \\nhealthcare.gov on weekends; and five, proposing to chip away at \\nconsumer protections through executive fiat.\\n  These actions have significantly contributed to insurers exiting the \\nmarket and raising premiums. It is nothing less than direct and \\ndeliberate sabotage; so, instead, the Republicans today bring up a bill \\nabout a board that does not exist, and the latest is it would not until \\n2021, at the earliest.\\n  There are simple actions that we can take today to repair some of the \\ndamage and, thereby, improve the insurance markets. Senators Lamar \\nAlexander and Patty Murray recently came to a bipartisan agreement that \\nwould provide funding for the cost-sharing reductions and outreach and \\nenrollment activities that strengthen the risk pool in the marketplace.\\n  Unfortunately, as we see today, my Republican colleagues continue to \\nignore these and other important issues, while allowing an \\nadministration, obsessed with repeal of ACA, to do so through executive \\naction what could not be done legislatively.\\n  What is more, they are bringing to the floor today a bill that the \\nCongressional Budget Office estimates will raise the deficit by $17.5 \\nbillion over the next decade. I repeat, raise the deficit by $17.5 \\nbillion over the next decade. And this is just a small preview of the \\ncoming GOP tax bill, which would increase our Nation's debt by $1.5 \\ntrillion according to the Republican's own budget resolution.\\n\\n  And whatever happened to the crocodile tears we used to hear from \\nRepublicans about the deficit? In terms of today's bill lacking any \\noffset, how about at least starting to address the staggering cost of \\nprescription drugs, a step that would save both senior citizens and the \\nMedicare program money.\\n  Mr. Speaker, the American people need Congress to take action to \\nlower their healthcare costs and to stabilize the markets. They do not \\nneed today an irrelevant political bill such as H.R. 849. If you \\nsupport real steps to lower health insurance premiums now, vote ``no'' \\non this bill.\\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\", u'turn': 6, u'speaker': u'Mr. LEVIN', u'itemno': 12}, {u'kind': u'speech', u'speaker_bioguide': u'P000594', u'text': u\"  Mr. PAULSEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume, \\nand let me just start by saying that some of my colleagues on the other \\nside of the aisle have called on us to work with them over and over \\nagain to find common ground, to make fixes in the flaws in ObamaCare.\\n\\n\\n  Today we have an opportunity to do exactly that. We should all be \\njoining together. There is bipartisan support on this bill to eliminate \\nthis unnecessary and potentially very destructive body, one that I \\nwould define as a major flaw in the law. This is the exact process that \\nwe have been asking for--you have been asking for.\\n  The bill has been through regular order. We have had countless \\nhearings on this topic. We have actually voted not once, but twice, in \\npast Congresses to repeal the IPAB to keep it from harming access to \\nseniors' care.\\n  So today we are bringing this bill forward--this legislation \\nforward--as a stand-alone provision, not tied to any other policies, to \\nonce and for all allow Members to say whether they support or oppose \\nthis unaccountable board.\\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. \\nRoe), who has been a tireless champion for seniors in Tennessee and, \\nsince day one, has been working on this legislation to repeal the IPAB.\", u'turn': 7, u'speaker': u'Mr. PAULSEN', u'itemno': 13}, {u'kind': u'speech', u'speaker_bioguide': u'R000582', u'text': u\"  Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of my bill, H.R. \\n849, the\\n\\n\\nProtecting Seniors' Access to Medicare Act of 2017, a bipartisan bill \\nwith 270 cosponsors, that repeals two sections of the Affordable Care \\nAct and terminates the Independent Payment Advisory Board--or the \\nIPAB--once and for all. I thank Chairman Brady and Chairman Walden for \\nbringing this important bill to the floor.\\n  I also want to start by thanking my lead Democrat cosponsor from \\nCalifornia, Dr. Raul Ruiz. Dr. Ruiz and his staff have worked \\ntirelessly with my staff to get more cosponsors this Congress than we \\nhave ever had before, including 45 Democrats. Seeing such strong \\nbipartisan support for my bill only makes sense, however, since doing \\naway with the IPAB has been a bipartisan idea since it was first \\nproposed.\\n  In December of 2009, I joined Congressman Richard Neal and 72 other \\nbipartisan Members in writing then-Speaker Pelosi expressing our \\nopposition to the IPAB's creation. On the day the ACA passed the House, \\nI filed legislation to repeal the IPAB, and have received bipartisan \\nsupport in every Congress since. This is about access for seniors' care \\nand quality of their care. By the way, the IPAB was not in the House \\nversion of the Affordable Care Act. Only the Senate sent that back over \\nhere. So it was not part of the House to begin with.\\n  We got lucky this summer that the Medicare trustees' report did not \\ntrigger the IPAB. Otherwise, there would have been significant \\nstatutory requirements to cut Medicare within a year. These cuts would \\nhave been made to provide reimbursements, which would do nothing but \\ndrive providers out of Medicare and would eliminate options for our \\nseniors to receive healthcare.\\n  Peter Orszag, President Obama's Office of Management and Budget \\nDirector, said this was the greatest ceding of power from the Congress \\nto a bureaucracy since the formation of the Federal Reserve. Remember, \\nit has been stated here, Mr. Speaker, that the board hasn't been \\nformed. That means one person makes these decisions, not the Congress. \\nMedicare recipients can't come to their elected official and effect \\nchanges in this IPAB if it is enacted, and it will be.\\n  One of the major concerns we hear today is that the CBO has estimated \\nthat this bill will cost over $17 billion that is not paid for. First \\nof all, the CBO describes its estimates as ``extremely uncertain'' \\nbecause it is quite possible that under current law, the IPAB will not \\nbe triggered.\\n  Secondly, this is the same dilemma we were in with the sustainable \\ngrowth rate--SGR. Medicare says to doctors: You go out and provide the \\ncare, but if you provide too much, we will cut your payments.\\n  As a physician myself, having seen how much havoc the SGR wreaked \\nevery year, we can't afford to put providers through this again. We \\nspent months and years getting that corrected. Knowing that many \\nMembers were concerned about the offsets in previous years, we have a \\nbill on the floor today that all of our cosponsors can support.\\n  I look forward to seeing all 270 of my cosponsors voting in favor of \\npassage in order to preserve Medicare for our Nation's seniors. We have \\na chance to send a strong statement of support to Americans of Medicare \\nage that do not want to see their healthcare arbitrarily cut by a body \\nof 15 unelected, unaccountable bureaucrats, or the Secretary of HHS, if \\nthe board is not empaneled. If there are hard decisions to be made on \\nMedicare, Congress should not abdicate that duty to a group of people \\nwith no oversight or legal recourse. Those decisions should be made by \\nthe people elected as representatives of the people.\\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support final passage of this \\nbill and maintain Medicare services for our Nation's seniors, because \\nthis is truly a bipartisan issue that will affect all seniors equally.\", u'turn': 8, u'speaker': u'Mr. ROE of Tennessee', u'itemno': 14}, {u'kind': u'speech', u'speaker_bioguide': u'L000263', u'text': u'  Mr. LEVIN.

Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend for yielding me this time.\\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition of the repeal of the \\nIndependent Payment Advisory Board.\\n  This is another classic example of a solution in search of a problem. \\nOf all the things that we should be working on in Congress in a \\nbipartisan fashion to improve and to fix the problems that exist within \\nour healthcare system, we have legislation on the floor before us today \\nthat calls for the repeal of a nonexisting commission, based on \\nnonconsistent spending cuts being proposed for Medicare, based on a \\nnonconsistent cost of rate of increase in spending under the Medicare \\nprogram, all of which is going to add $17.5 billion to the deficit over \\nthe next 10 years because this bill isn't paid for. And the irony is \\nthey are coming forward with this legislation, which will add another \\n$18 billion to the debt, on the same day they release a tax bill that \\ncalls for an additional $1.5 trillion worth of deficit spending because \\nthe tax bill hasn't been offset. At some point and at some time, we \\nhave got to take a bipartisan stand on fiscal responsibility in this \\nplace again because it is not happening today.\\n\\n  Instead, we should be working on short-term, practical solutions to \\nstabilize and bring more certainty to the health insurance marketplace, \\nin light of what the administration is doing to completely undermine \\nthe marketplaces today. We ought to be working on delivery system \\nreform proposals that will emphasize the establishment of accountable \\ncare organizations and medical homes and value-based purchasing and \\nbundling arrangements and different alternative payment models to get \\nus to a system of value, quality, and outcomes, and away from the fee-\\nfor-service payment for the volume of services, regardless of results.\\n  Let's be honest, the real cost driver in our Federal budget--and it \\nis true at the State and local level--has been healthcare costs because \\nwe have an aging population. That is the work that we should be working \\non together, is the delivery system reform and the payment reform, so \\nwe are aligning the incentives in the right direction where we are \\ntelling our healthcare providers: You will be compensated based on good \\nresults, not on how much you do.\\n  There is a lot within the Affordable Care Act giving our providers \\nthe very tools in order to accomplish that, and we ought to be \\nenhancing that here today. Instead, we are wasting time on a commission \\nthat, according to the CMS's own actuary, says, at the very earliest, \\nit might be comprised in 2021. But, even then, it warrants us, with the \\nmission that we have given it, that: Hey, you have got healthcare \\nspending within the healthcare system that, Congress, you need to deal \\nwith. And then come back with recommendations. And then it is up to us \\nto make corrective action at that time.\\n  So all this talk about unelected bureaucrats making these decisions \\nbelies what the legislation actually calls for in the establishment of \\nthe IPAB. This was, however, another important cost containment tool \\nthat was put into the Affordable Care Act to try to restrain the growth \\nof healthcare spending. We need more of those type of ideas, rather \\nthan efforts today to remove those tools and then possibly see just \\nunbridled healthcare spending in the future.\\n  What is really disturbing is I know there is a lot of common ground \\nin this area, yet the American people wouldn't know it, with this \\npolitical ping-pong ball on healthcare reform going back and forth and \\nthe chaos and the confusion that it is causing, and that is \\nunfortunate.\\n  So, instead, today, we ought to first take steps to stabilize the \\ninsurance exchanges, rather than an administration that is doing \\neverything they can to limit the enrollment during the signup period, \\nwhich actually started yesterday and lasts until December 15. They have \\ncut by 90 percent funding for marketing of the exchanges. They have cut \\nby almost 50 percent the funding for our navigators back home who are \\ntrying to help people get affordable healthcare coverage in their \\nlives. They ended the cost-share payments, which only increases the \\ncost for healthcare for everyone else because of the risk that the \\ninsurance plans now face.\\n  The other segment of the population that we should be focused on in \\nhelping is that 5 or 6 percent of the population that are in the \\nindividual market who don't qualify for premium tax credits because \\nthey are getting hammered today. You would think that would be another \\narea of bipartisan commonality that we can come together on\\n\\n\\nto provide relief for those individuals who are in the individual \\nmarket experiencing these higher premiums, part of it being done \\nbecause of the elimination of the cost-sharing reduction payments, but, \\ninstead, nothing is being done on that front.\\n  My friend from Michigan also pointed out that we should be having \\nhearings about the cost of prescription drugs in committee. That is one \\nof the main cost drivers within the healthcare system, yet there is \\ndeafening silence in the Halls of Congress when it comes to taking \\nmeasure on that front, even though President Trump promised during the \\ncourse of his campaign and even earlier this year to try to take some \\naction in a bipartisan way to address drug costs.\", u'turn': 10, u'speaker': u'Mr. KIND', u'itemno': 16}, {u'kind': u'speech', u'speaker_bioguide': None, u'text': u'  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

In the Committee on \\nWays and Means, when we raised this issue, we were told, as always: \\nWell, we don't have to pay for it in the committee, but it can be paid \\nfor on the floor.\\n  This is totally unpaid for, zero, no effort to pay for it, and it \\nwould add $17.5 billion to the national debt. Already, it is at its \\nrecord level with, now, the threat of $1.5 trillion more.\\n  So I really urge, no matter what were the circumstances when you \\nsigned on, in almost every case they have changed, and so there is such \\ngood reason why this is the wrong bill at the wrong time, and I think \\nto vote for this is really the wrong vote.\\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\", u'turn': 24, u'speaker': u'Mr. LEVIN', u'itemno': 30}, {u'kind': u'speech', u'speaker_bioguide': u'P000594', u'text': u\"  Mr. PAULSEN.

The cost of healthcare in this country is far \\ntoo expensive, and it is for a variety of reasons that our country \\nspends twice as much on healthcare as most industrialized countries in \\nthe rest of the world and we don't get better results for that.\\n  The challenge for us, if we want to save healthcare, particularly \\nMedicare, is to start focusing on reforms that bring the cost of \\nhealthcare down and don't compromise quality.\\n  The Affordable Care Act extended access to healthcare for millions of \\nAmericans, but it also included some steps that began bending the cost \\ncurve. The rate of growth in the Medicare spending has started to come \\ndown under the Affordable Care Act. It was patient-centered programs, \\nit was accountable care organizations, it was value-based payment \\nsystems. These things where, for the first time, Congress talked not \\njust about extending access, but trying to reform payment systems so \\nthat we could get the benefit of a more efficient system.\\n  The IPAB is simply one of the potential tools that would be used in \\norder to present to Congress recommendations. Unlike what Mr. Walden \\nsaid, it would be the final say of Congress whether we wanted to \\napprove or not any recommendation by the IPAB.\\n  Here is the difference in how we are approaching healthcare. Many in \\nthis body on the Republican side have focused on the cost of \\nhealthcare, its contribution to the debt. The policy proposal in the \\nform of repealing the Affordable Care Act, its way of reducing the cost \\nof healthcare was to take healthcare away from 24 million Americans. \\nThat is what that bill did.\\n  That is one way to control the cost of healthcare, have people go \\nwithout. It is the wrong way. We all know that. We have got to bite the \\nbullet here and start addressing the fact that we spend too much. Some \\nof it is wasteful procedures, some of it is gaming the system, some of \\nit is these incredible maneuvers by drug companies.\\n  I am just going to give one example because I want to give this \\nexample as an indication of how right before our eyes bad things are \\nhappening that we are allowing to occur.\\n  HUMIRA, a very good drug by AbbVie. Their patent was expiring. That \\npatent is legislatively provided to give them exclusive marketing and \\nselling rights. They have a monopoly price. It is incredibly expensive, \\nlike $70,000 for a supply.\\n  Amgen had a biosimilar that was going to be marketed, and then you \\nwould have the benefit of competition. The price would go down.\\n  AbbVie and Amgen made a deal. We don't know how much AbbVie paid to \\nAmgen, but suddenly Amgen is not going to bring its generic, in effect, \\nto market until 2023, but--and this is part of their agreement--they \\nare going to sell their biosimilar product in Europe now.\", u'turn': 35, u'speaker': u'Mr. WELCH', u'itemno': 41}, {u'kind': u'speech', u'speaker_bioguide': None, u'text': u'  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\\n  Mr. Speaker, I can't help but put what is happening today in terms of \\nthe Republicans putting up this bill on the IPAB and what is happening \\ntomorrow with the Republicans putting up a CHIP and community health \\ncenters bill but point out that collectively what they are trying to do \\nis what they were not able to do in the first 9 months of this session \\nwhen they sought very hard and pushed very hard to repeal the \\nAffordable Care Act.\\n  What is going on here today and tomorrow with the IPAB and community \\nhealth centers and CHIP is essentially an effort to repeal the \\nAffordable Care Act piece by piece, in my opinion.\\n  What do we do?\\n  We see the IPAB, which is part of the Affordable Care Act. We see the \\npay-fors for community health centers and the CHIP tomorrow, taking \\naway money from the Prevention Fund from the Affordable Care Act, \\nlimiting the grace period when people will lose their insurance that \\nthey have under the Affordable Care Act.\\n  This goes along also with what is happening with the President as \\nwell. The President has, in the last month or so, said that he is not \\ngoing to pay the cost-sharing subsidies. He has cut back on the \\noutreach so that people don't know what is in the Affordable Care Act. \\nHe has cut back on the period when people can sign up and get their \\ninsurance in half.\\n  What we are seeing, in my opinion, is the Republicans sabotaging the \\nAffordable Care Act. They couldn't repeal it, so now they are doing \\nwhatever they can to sabotage it. It is really ironic or inconsistent, \\nhowever you want to put it. On the one hand they are insisting that \\nwhen it comes to kids and community health centers, which is a group of \\npeople you would think they would be most concerned about, they insist \\non paying for it by taking money from other healthcare programs. We are \\nasked to take money from the Prevention Fund, which pays for vaccines \\nfor children, which pays for the children's lead poisoning program, \\nwhich is a major part of our opiate prevention program. This is the \\nmoney that comes from the Prevention Fund. Basically, they are taking \\nthat money and using it to pay for the community health centers and the \\nChildren's Health Initiative, which means that that money is lost. That \\nmoney is lost for those other purposes.\\n  With regard to the grace period, they are saying, well, if you fail \\nto pay your insurance, it used to be 90 days before you lost it. Now it \\nwould be 30 days before you lost it, which means that you end up with \\nabout 500,000 or 600,000 people who have insurance now under the \\nAffordable Care Act that would lose it, according to the CBO.\\n  Yet, at the same time, with the IPAB repeal, which we are considering \\nnow, which costs $17.5 billion, and which, as my colleague from Vermont \\nsaid, is a mechanism to try to save costs, they are saying: Well, we \\ndon't have to pay for that. We can just repeal it. We will forego those \\nadditional costs, which become part of the deficit.\\n  Mr. Speaker, for all these reasons, the bottom line is, what the \\nRepublicans are doing is not fair. It is not fair to the kids. It is \\nnot fair to the people who are going to lose their health insurance.\\n  I will say as the last thing that this is going nowhere. One of the \\nreasons why Democrats have been urging the Republicans with regard to \\nthe CHIP and community health centers to work with us on a bipartisan \\nbasis is because we know if this bill passes today on a partisan vote, \\nbecause we can't support it for the reasons I explained, then that \\nmeans that it is going to go to the Senate and it is going to die \\nbecause there is no reason to believe that the Senate is going to take \\nup this partisan bill.\\n  I think it is just a huge mistake on the part of Republicans. \\nBasically, what they are signaling today is that they don't really care \\nabout this. They wanted to stick around until the end of year, which \\nmeans the community health centers and CHIP just basically wither on \\nthe vine for lack of funds. That is not fair. It is not fair to the \\nkids. It is not fair to those who use community health centers.\\n  Mr. Speaker, for all these reasons, I would urge a ``no'' vote on the \\nbill today, the IPAB repeal; and I will also ask for a ``no'' vote \\ntomorrow on the CHIP and the community health centers legislation.\\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\", u'turn': 43, u'speaker': u'Mr. PALLONE', u'itemno': 49}, {u'kind': u'speech', u'speaker_bioguide': u'G000558', u'text': u\"  Mr. GUTHRIE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\\n  Mr. Speaker, one, this IPAB effort is bipartisan. We have even heard \\non the floor both sides of the aisle support passage of the bill. It \\nhas been bipartisan.\\n\\n  First, a couple of things. On the value-based payments--which I think \\nis the direction we need to go to rein in the costs and make sure we \\nhave sustainable programs, but the IPAB's annual short-term focus \\nsavings provision would affect Medicare and the wider health system in \\nunpredictable ways with potentially many negative unintended \\nconsequences by doubling down on the traditional practice of squeezing \\npayment rates in order to slow spending with no meaningful eye to how \\nthese changes impact long-term incentives--the IPAB could work at cross \\npurposes to broaden reform that would base Medicare payments on quality \\nand value.\\n  On the offset, we did offset CHIP and the community health centers. \\nWe know that money is going to be spent. We know that when we authorize \\nit, it is going to be spent. We believe it is going to be spent wisely. \\nThat is why we are moving forward with these bills.\\n  The IPAB has not been constituted, and repealing it should not have \\nto be offset since it has not spent any money nor been charged yet with \\nfinding any savings. The IPAB trigger has never been hit. The CBO \\nestimates that the IPAB would be triggered in 2023, 2025, and 2027. But \\nby their own admission, and I quote from the report, ``Given the \\nuncertainty that surrounds these projections, it is possible such \\nauthority would be invoked in other years,'' or we could also assume \\npossibly never at all.\\n  The CBO estimate also has to assume the level of cuts required by the \\namount Medicare is spending that exceeds the trigger. The CBO also then \\nhas to speculate on how reductions made in any one year would impact \\nthe trigger in future years, further laying assumption upon guesswork. \\nAs the CBO notes in their estimate, the estimate represents a broad \\nrange of possible effects.\\n  The CBO admits they do not know if the IPAB will be triggered or what \\npolicies they might pursue if activated. Some of their assumptions are \\none-sided bets that may or may not achieve savings, and the CBO must \\nfurther speculate on the probabilities associated with such variations.\\n  Mr. Speaker, in closing, I believe the IPAB will not be effective \\nproviding real solutions for Medicare solvency. It contributes \\ndisproportionately little to the projected cost savings needed in \\nMedicare, but it has the potential to hurt seniors' access to care. \\nFundamentally, I believe it is a constitutional affront to the \\nlegislative branch.\\n\\n\\n  The IPAB decisions don't come to Congress to be approved or \\ndisapproved. We can undo the IPAB decisions if we have dollar-for-\\ndollar replacement, but that could even be blocked by a minority vote \\nin the Senate.\\n  So I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 849, to repeal the \\nIndependent Payment Advisory Board, and I hope there will continue to \\nbe bipartisan support for this important legislation.\\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\", u'turn': 44, u'speaker': u'Mr. GUTHRIE', u'itemno': 50}, {u'kind': u'speech', u'speaker_bioguide': u'J000032', u'text': u\"  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.R. 849, the \\nso-called ``Protecting Seniors' Access to Medicare Act of 2017,'' which \\nrepeals the Independent Payment Advisory Board (IPAB), that was \\nestablished under the ACA in response to high rates of growth in \\nMedicare expenditures and charged with developing proposals to ``reduce \\nthe per capita rate of growth in Medicare spending.''\\n  I opposed this bill when it came to the floor as H.R. 1190 in the \\n114th Congress and I oppose it now because by repealing IPAB, the bill \\nwould eliminate an important safeguard that will help reduce the rate \\nof Medicare cost growth responsibly while protecting Medicare \\nbeneficiaries.\\n\\n\\n  Mr. Speaker, H.R. 849 is nothing but another attempt, in a long line \\nof House Republican efforts to undermine both the Medicare guarantee \\nand the Affordable Care Act.\\n  Repealing IPAB would cost over $17.5 billion during the course of a \\nten year period according to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO).\\n  Mr. Speaker, Republicans do not even make an attempt to find an \\noffset for this $17.5 billion increase to the deficit resulting from \\nrepeal of the IPAB, while at the same time they plan to bring to the \\nfloor a partisan bill to reauthorize CHIP, Community Health Centers, \\nand other public health extenders by cutting Medicare and slashing \\nfunding for programs relied upon by Medicaid recipients, low and middle \\nincome families with Affordable Care Act health coverage.\\n  After more than seven years under the Affordable Care Act, more than \\n20 million Americans have gained health coverage; up to 129 million \\npeople who could have otherwise been denied or who faced discrimination \\nnow have access to coverage.\\n  Mr. Speaker, given the real challenges facing our nation, it is \\nirresponsible for the Republican majority to continue bringing to the \\nfloor unpaid for bills that would do serious harm to millions of \\nAmericans if they were to be enacted.\\n  House Republicans have tried more than 65 times to undermine the \\nAffordable Care Act, which has enabled more than 20 million previously \\nuninsured Americans to know the peace of mind that comes from having \\naccess to affordable, accessible, high quality health care.\\n  Their batting average to date is .000; they have struck out every \\ntime because the American people appreciate and strongly support the \\nAffordable Care Act.\\n  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to look at the facts and abandon \\nthis misguided effort to undermine the ACA and impose significant \\nnegative impacts on Americans currently insured.\\n  The Independent Payment Advisory Board is to recommend to Congress \\npolicies that reduce the rate of Medicare growth and help Medicare \\nprovide better care at lower costs.\\n  IPAB membership by law is to be made up of 15 members appointed by \\nthe President and confirmed by the Senate and been comprised of the \\nnon-partisan CBO, economists, and health policy experts as contributing \\nto Medicare's long-term sustainability.\\n  Mr. Speaker, the IPAB is already prohibited from recommending changes \\nto Medicare that ration health care, restrict benefits, modify \\neligibility, increase cost sharing, or raise premiums or revenues.\\n  Under current law, the Congress retains the authority to modify, \\nreject, or enhance IPAB recommendations to strengthen Medicare, and \\nIPAB recommendations would take effect only if the Congress does not \\nact to slow Medicare cost growth.\\n  Finally, Mr. Speaker, let me point out to our friends across the \\naisle that according to the CMS actuary, IPAB will not be triggered \\nuntil 2021, so the timing of today's repeal is premature and \\npolitically motivated.\\n  IPAB was enacted as a backstop to the other cost saving and quality \\nimprovement efforts in ACA, such as accountable care organizations, \\npatient-centered care models like medical homes, programs that pay for \\nquality not quantity, and value based purchasing.\\n  Because of the ACA and these programs, Medicare spending growth has \\nslowed and Medicare's solvency has been extended.\\n  Increasing the deficit by $17.5 billion as a result of repealing the \\nIPAB would is fiscally irresponsible, especially now that Republicans \\nhave introduced a tax package that will saddle our country with $1.5 \\ntrillion of debt in order to give tax cuts to the wealthy and \\ncorporations.\\n  Mr. Speaker, despite the Supreme Court's upholding of the law's \\nconstitutionality, the reelection of President Obama, and Speaker \\nRyan's admission that ``Obamacare is the law of the land,'' Republicans \\nrefuse to stop wasting time and taxpayer money in their effort to take \\naway the patient protections and benefits of the Affordable Care Act.\\n  Mr. Speaker, I call upon House Republican leaders to stop wasting our \\ntime trying to take away healthcare protections that Americans depend \\non and to start addressing pressing national priorities.\\n  And they should start with working with Democrats on a bipartisan and \\nresponsible plan to reauthorize the Children's Health Insurance Program \\n(``SCHIP'') which insures more than 9 million kids and fully funding \\nthe relief efforts needed to help American communities recover from the \\ndevastating effects of Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria.\\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in voting against H.R. 849.\", u'turn': 45, u'speaker': u'Ms. JACKSON LEE', u'itemno': 51}, {u'kind': u'speech', u'speaker_bioguide': None, u'text': u'  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Owned by Air Force veteran Tom Fenerty, Navmar engineers \\ntechnology to make sure that our military has the best tools possible \\nto complete any mission. Tom has also committed to employing veterans \\nin the community.

National Obesity Care Week is recognized during the first week \\nof November, when individuals and organizations from across the country \\nraise awareness about the serious chronic disease of obesity.\\n  Leading medical organizations, including the American Medical \\nAssociation, the Obesity Society, the American Academy of Family \\nPhysicians, the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists, and \\nthe World Obesity Federation, all recognize obesity as a disease and \\nthe belief that it should be treated as such.\\n  National Obesity Care Week aims to advance an evidence-based \\nunderstanding of obesity and widespread access to respectful, \\ncomprehensive, and appropriate care. Obesity is a complex disease, \\nlinked to over 50 disorders, including type 2 diabetes, hypertension, \\nand cardiovascular disease. Over $1.4 trillion is spent in the U.S. on \\ndirect and indirect costs for health-related conditions related to \\nobesity each year.\\n\\n  This must change, Madam Speaker. It is time for action, and I commit \\nto being part of the solution to improve care for obesity.

Mr. Speaker, I would like to recognize the passing of a \\nvery special individual and true patriot: Mr. Edward Earl Gidcumb. Mr. \\nGidcumb was 92 at the time of his passing on October 25, 2017. He was \\nborn in Harrisburg, KY, and raised by his maternal grandparents, \\nBroughton Temple and Nancy Ann Cummins.\\n  Mr. Gidcumb attended Harrisburg Township High School, graduating in \\n1943. And in 1965, he received his business degree from Paducah Junior \\nCollege. During World War II, he served our nation honorably as a \\nmember of the U.S. Navy, holding rank of storekeeper second class. He \\nwas assigned to two different ships, the USS Indianapolis and USS \\nBottineau. He received an honorable discharge from the Navy in February \\n1946.\\n  Mr. Gidcumb served in the Illinois National Guard for two years as a \\nsergeant and squad Leader, was a member of the American Legion, and \\nreceived several honors throughout his life, including being named Duke \\nof Paducah, Honorary Patriot Guard Rider, and Honorary Mustang. In his \\nmilitary endeavors, he was also awarded six battle stars, an honor one \\nshould be immensely proud of. Mr. Gidcumb was truly an outstanding \\nleader and contributor in both his military and civilian life.\\n  After his time in the military, Mr. Gidcumb retired as a purchasing \\nmanager at Westvaco. He also served as president of the National \\nAssociation of Purchasing Managers. A participant and supporter of the \\nKentucky Veteran and Patriot Museum, many people from across the \\ncountry had the opportunity to learn about his service to the U.S. But \\nbeyond his military and career accomplishments, many will remember Mr. \\nGidcumb as an avid golfer and also a professional trumpeter. He \\ndirected his own Big Band dance band, ``The Townsmen,'' for 30 years. \\nThe band played at numerous community events and regularly at First \\nBaptist Church of Wickliffe. He enjoyed sharing his joy of golf with \\nhis friends, especially at Ballard County Country Club.\\n  I am honored to recognize the memory of an individual whose life \\nrepresented such patriotism, civic engagement, joy and compassion. Mr. \\nGidcumb will not soon be forgotten, as his remarkable life of \\naccomplishments, skills and experiences will live on.\\n\", u'turn': 0, u'speaker': u'Mr. COMER', u'itemno': 2}, {u'kind': u'linebreak', u'speaker_bioguide': None, u'text': u'                          ____________________\\n\\n\\n', u'turn': -1, u'speaker': u'None', u'itemno': 3}], u'header': {u'extension': True, u'vol': u'163', u'wkday': u'Thursday', u'chamber': u'House', u'num': u'178', u'year': u'2017', u'month': u'November', u'pages': u'E1489', u'day': u'2'}, u'doc_title': u'REMEMBERING MR.

Pollard, \\npresident of Montgomery College, and Scott Ralls, president of Northern \\nVirginia Community College. I am proud to represent George Mason \\nUniversity and Northern Virginia Community College. This important and \\neloquent piece, titled ``College presidents: Protect our students, pass \\nthe Dream Act,'' was published in the Hill on October 16, 2017:\\n\\n       ``One month ago, the lives of 800,000 young people around \\n     our nation were put in jeopardy, with the decision by the \\n     White House to rescind the Deferred Action for Childhood \\n     Arrivals (DACA) program. This decision fails to understand \\n     the overwhelmingly positive impact that the DACA program has \\n     had for so many students, and the devastating consequences \\n     that rescinding it will have on them, their families, our \\n     schools, our communities and our country.\\n       We cannot set aside the invaluable contributions of these \\n     students and their passion and commitment to the work of our \\n     colleges and our country.\\n       We cannot forget the impact of their contributions to our \\n     economy--estimated at $460 billion over the next decade.\\n       We cannot ignore the joy they bring to our communities and \\n     the degree to which we are strengthened by their presence.\\n       We believe, as presidents of colleges and universities, it \\n     is imperative that we protect these young people through the \\n     passage of the Dream Act. They have grown up here in America. \\n     They've gone to grade school, middle school and high school \\n     with our children. They are student body presidents, medical \\n     students and doctoral candidates. Some serve in high school \\n     ROTC and volunteer in their churches. Others help single \\n     parents raising younger siblings and tutor their peers as \\n     they prepare for college. They are members of our \\n     communities. They have done all the things we expect of our \\n     young people, and for their efforts so many have been able to \\n     earn places on our college campuses. They want--and deserve--\\n     the chance to continue learning and living in America without \\n     the constant fear of deportation.\\n       We have seen the contributions that these extraordinary \\n     young people make to our campuses and our communities. \\n     Colleges and universities are about opportunity and the \\n     pursuit of each and every student's version of the American \\n     dream. No matter who they are--or where they came from--every \\n     student deserves an equal shot at success. We take \\n     responsibility for fostering academic and social environments \\n     that give every student the means and opportunity to pursue a \\n     better future.\\n       Across our nation, our higher education community is coming \\n     together in support of our Dreamers. This week, the American \\n     Council on Education and colleges and universities around the \\n     country are contributing their voices to a national campaign: \\n     ``Higher Education Week'' in support of Protecting Dreamers. \\n     To launch this week, our institutions--which represent public \\n     and private as well as two- and four-year institutions in \\n     Virginia, Maryland and Washington, D.C.--have come together \\n     to reflect on the invaluable presence of these students on \\n     our campuses. Our region has approximately 23,000 DACA \\n     recipients and we know that almost half of all DACA \\n     recipients are in school or pursuing a college degree.\\n       These young people belong here. They have played by our \\n     rules since the day they arrived as minors with their \\n     parents. They have done everything we could expect of them. \\n     They have earned their places on our campuses. They are \\n     poised to contribute to the future of our nation. We have the \\n     capacity, and responsibility, as a nation to provide a \\n     permanent bipartisan legislative solution.\\n       We call upon Congress to pass the bipartisan DREAM Act so \\n     that these talented and hardworking students, brought here as \\n     children by parents who only wished for a better life, are \\n     able to get the shot at success and the American dream that \\n     they so rightfully deserve.''\\n\\n  Mr. Speaker, I agree wholeheartedly with Presidents Cabrera, DeGioia, \\nPollard, and Ralls.

Mr. President, I rise to give my fifth in a series of \\nspeeches addressing what I think will be a monumental achievement of \\nthis Senate and House when we pass our tax reform bill.\\n  I have spoken previously about how I believe tax reform will be good \\nin a lot of different ways. First of all, I talked about how this tax \\nreform bill will spur economic growth in our country. Second, I talked \\nabout how it would grow jobs in small businesses. Third, I talked about \\nthe benefits working-class families will have through policies such as \\nthe child tax credit.\\n  So today I rise to talk about the importance of tax simplification. \\nAccording to a publisher who analyzed the issue, since 1913, the \\nFederal Tax Code is 187 times longer than it was a century ago. On top \\nof the Tax Code itself that spans thousands of pages, there are \\nadditional IRS regulations that are complicated, and you need somebody \\nnot just to figure them out for you and interpret them for you but to \\nfigure out how that translates to your own tax return. Of course, \\ntaxpayers have to comply with all of these.\\n  Beyond the code and the regulations, there are countless IRS \\nprocedures, technical memorandums, and more, and all of this adds to \\nthe length and complexity of our tax system. You can see it when you \\nturn toward the April 15 date, the stress level in this country really \\nrises, and a lot of it has to do with the complications of our tax \\nsystem.\\n  The point is this, when it comes to figuring out your taxes, it is \\njust far too complex. That is why businesses and individuals spend 6 \\nbillion hours a year complying with the Tax Code. That is more than 18 \\nhours for every man, woman, and child in this country. That is \\nequivalent to 3 million people working full time--3 million people \\nworking full time to comply with the Tax Code and fill out your tax \\nforms or, another way of looking at it, that is $195 billion in lost \\nproductivity.\\n  Again, our Tax Code is just too complicated, and that is also what \\ntax reform is about, simplifying and making it easier for Americans to \\ncomply.\\n  According to the Brookings Institution, ``The notion that taxes \\nshould be simpler is one of the very few propositions in tax policy \\nthat generates almost universal agreement.''\\n\\n\\n  Despite years of bipartisan talks, we are now on the verge of major \\ntax reform for the first time in 30 years. Making our Tax Code simpler \\nwill benefit every single working family in this country. By roughly \\ndoubling the standard deduction, filing your taxes will be easier and \\nmore understandable. The higher standard deduction will let more \\nmiddle-class Americans benefit from not just lower taxes but also \\nwithout the hassle of itemizing your tax return. Lower rates and fewer \\ndeductions will help all Americans spend less time and energy and worry \\non tax compliance.\\n  Our goal is for the overwhelming number of Americans to be able to \\nsubmit their tax forms on a single sheet of paper without all those \\nextra forms, and for many families in West Virginia and around the \\ncountry who already use the standard deduction, increasing it will \\nreduce their taxes. Now, 83 percent of West Virginians last year--or \\nmaybe it was the year before, 2015, 2016--83 percent filed a simple \\nform.\\n  Simplicity in our Tax Code and relief for middle-class families, \\nthose are the reasons I offered a straightforward amendment to the \\nSenate's budget resolution. My amendment said Congress should focus on \\neliminating deductions that primarily benefit wealthier individuals in \\nfavor of tax policy that benefits the middle class. Let me say that \\nagain. Congress should focus on eliminating deductions that primarily \\nbenefit wealthier individuals in favor of tax policy that benefits the \\nmiddle class. That means a tax code that is simpler with fewer \\ndeductions and lower rates.\\n  It will not just be individuals and families who benefit from a less \\ncomplicated tax code. Tax simplification will help our small businesses \\nstart, grow, and succeed. Ninety-five percent of the businesses in my \\nState of West Virginia are small businesses, and they employ over half \\nof West Virginia's private sector workforce. So in addition to their \\nhigh marginal tax rate, the complexity and compliance cost of their \\ntaxes impedes their economic growth, impedes their ability to grow \\ntheir job, raise their wages, spur growth. A CNBC survey found that 22 \\npercent of small business owners aren't sure what their effective tax \\nrate really is. If Congress can simplify the code just to cut \\ncompliance costs in half, that would free up significant resources that \\ncould be used to grow the economy. Given that 50 percent of U.S. job \\ngrowth has occurred in just 2 percent of our country's counties, we \\nneed that growth. Think about that. Over the last several years, 50 \\npercent of the U.S. job growth has only occurred in 2 percent of our \\ncountry's counties. We need the rest of the country to be able to enjoy \\nthat growth. To do that, we need to help the small businesses that are \\nthe major economic drivers in our economy.\\n  Simplifying the Tax Code will benefit so many across this country \\nthrough GDP growth and higher wages. I look forward to working with my \\ncolleagues to make tax reform and tax simplification a reality.\\n  Thank you.\\n  I yield the floor.\\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\", u'turn': 2, u'speaker': u'Mrs. CAPITO', u'itemno': 5}, {u'kind': u'speech', u'speaker_bioguide': None, u'text': u'  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, later this morning, after months of \\nhemming, hawing, and delaying, House Republicans will finally release \\nsome legislative details about their tax plan. It may not even include \\nall the details. The on again, off again nature of these deliberations \\nshould concern every Member of both Chambers. That is not how you \\nconstruct sound policy, especially with something as complicated and \\nimpactful as the Tax Code. Each decision has enormous ramifications. \\nLast-minute changes and sloppy drafting could change the fate of entire \\nindustries. Rushing it through in a hasty manner could have disastrous \\nconsequences.\\n  We know why my colleagues are doing this. They don't want the public \\nto know what is in this bill--increases on the middle class, breaks for \\nthe wealthy, big corporations getting a huge tax break, with no \\nguarantee and very little likelihood that they will use the money to \\ncreate jobs. That is why they don't want it to be public. It is not \\npopular. On polls, it says: Do you support tax reform? They say yes. Do \\nyou support cutting the taxes on big corporations? They say, \\noverwhelming, no. Do you support increasing taxes on the middle class? \\nOverwhelming, they say no. Do you support decreasing taxes on the \\nwealthy? They say, overwhelming, no. Those are the three tenets of this \\nbill.\\n  I hope my Republican colleagues here in the Senate are watching what \\nis going on in the House--the problems they are having, the secrecy \\nthey need--and realize how difficult and dangerous it is to rewrite the \\nTax Code by the seat of your pants. Looking at the Tax Code and real \\ntax receipts after all the loopholes, the wealthy in our country pay \\nfar less in Federal taxes than they did historically while the middle \\nclass pays more. Corporate profits are at a record high, while average \\nwages have been stagnant. Those statistics articulate a real problem \\nwith the basic fairness of our Tax Code that tax reform could underline \\nand could fix. This plan doesn't.\\n  Instead, what we are seeing today is a plan that exacerbates the \\nunfairness and inequality in our Tax Code. If the details of the \\nRepublican tax plan are anything like we have seen in the press--to \\nrepeal the estate tax, to create a huge new loophole for wealthy \\nindividuals in the form of a reduction in the pass-through rate, and \\nlowering the big rates on corporations and the wealthy--this sure \\ndoesn't fit the bill of helping the middle class.\\n  Meanwhile, to pay for all the tax giveaways in their bill, the \\nRepublicans are likely to make it worse for the middle class--not just \\nnot help them but hurt them. It will slash State and local \\ndeductibility, which is a bedrock middle-class and upper middle class \\ndeduction, that would hurt so many middle-class taxpayers. Nearly one-\\nthird of all taxpayers claim it from all over the country, the vast \\nmajority of whom make under $200,000 a year.\\n  Today, Republicans will crow about reaching a compromise on State and \\nlocal, whereby they don't eliminate the deduction; they just reduce its \\nvalue by about 70 percent. That means the bulk of the deduction will go \\naway for so many middle class Americans. I would remind my Republican \\ncolleagues over in the House, particularly those from States like New \\nYork, New Jersey, California, Pennsylvania, Illinois, Virginia, and \\nColorado, that this compromise will not solve your problem. You will \\nstill pay the price with the voters.\\n  I have been in politics a long time. I know how this will affect \\npeople--this compromise. They will not look and say: Oh, it could have \\nbeen worse. Maybe we would have lost the entire deduction. They will \\nsay: This year, I have the whole deduction, and next year, I have less \\nthan half of it. They will take it out on our Republican colleagues who \\nvote for it, particularly from those States, and they are throughout \\nthe country--in well-to-do and upper middle class and middle-class \\nsuburban districts.\\n  So anyone who thinks this compromise is going to help them doesn't \\nunderstand how politics works. It is not what it could have been. It is \\nwhat it is and what it will be. Now it is a complete deduction. What it \\nwill be is that you will lose 70 percent of that deduction. No one is \\ngoing to breathe a sigh of relief and say: I could have lost 100 \\npercent.\\n  Taxpayers will see that the Republicans have capped the amount of \\nmortgage interest they can deduct from purchasing a new home now. That \\nis the latest. Again, that hits right at the middle class. The mortgage \\ndeduction doesn't really affect the wealthiest. They have all their \\nmoney in unearned income and capital gains, and all of that is what \\naffects them the most. But the mortgage deduction is one of the hearts \\nof the middle class. To play with it--to reduce it, to cap it, so they \\ncan do tax giveaways for the very rich--is not going to fly, I don't \\nthink--not in America, not in the America most of us know.\\n  Taxpayers in the big cities and small ones, in the exurbs and \\nsuburbs, who\\n\\n\\ncommute to work, will also notice if they never receive the critical \\ntransit benefits they receive now. Thousands of dollars a year that \\nhelp pay when you transit to work will be gone. Why? To help the \\nwealthy.\\n  While some working Americans and middle-class taxpayers watch their \\ntaxes go up, they will read about how Republicans repealed the estate \\ntax, which benefits only 5,500 families whose estates are worth over $5 \\nmillion. They will learn how, instead of keeping the estate tax or \\nclosing the egregious carried-interest loopholes, the Republicans \\nreached into their pockets--the middle-class pockets--to pay for a big \\ncorporate tax break that has no guarantee and very little likelihood of \\nproducing jobs. They will learn that, while the reduction to the \\ncorporate tax rate is permanent, the increase in the child tax credit \\nis temporary.\\n  Big, wealthy corporations count far more than kids in this bill. \\nCorporations get permanent benefits, and families with kids get \\ntemporary and meager ones.\\n  The Tax Code is a reflection of fairness in our society. Do we want \\nto be in a country where everyone pays their fair share, including big \\ncorporations and the very wealthy? I think so. I think most Americans \\nagree with that. Yet right now, our Tax Code is slanted in favor of the \\nrich and the powerful, and the Republican plan makes it only worse.\\n  The Republican tax plan would put two thumbs down on a scale already \\ntipped toward the wealthy and powerful. It wouldn't create jobs. It \\nwouldn't raise wages. The Tax Policy Center, as we know, estimated that \\n80 percent of the benefits of the Republican plan go to the top 1 \\npercent--this new bill doesn't change that a bit--while nearly one-\\nthird of middle-class Americans would see a tax increase; 80 percent of \\nthe benefits to the top of our country, 20 percent of the benefits to \\nthe other 99 percent. That is not a middle-class tax bill, as President \\nTrump said it would be.\\n  Surely, we can do better. If our colleagues--whether it be in the \\nHouse or Senate, our Republican colleagues who are trying to go it \\nalone--can't pass this bill, we would welcome them. We would welcome an \\nopportunity to sit down together and come up with a bill that really \\nhelps the middle class.\\n  I yield the floor.\\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\", u'turn': 6, u'speaker': u'Mr. SCHUMER', u'itemno': 10}, {u'kind': u'speech', u'speaker_bioguide': None, u'text': u'  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, today is an important day on our promise \\nto deliver tax relief for America's working families and our \\nbusinesses, to create more jobs and grow our economy faster. The House \\nWays and Means Committee is about to unveil their first draft of a tax \\ncut bill. That is a good step forward after we both passed our budgets \\na couple of weeks ago.\\n  As we move forward through this process, it is important that we all \\nrecognize that tax cuts are a way to let the American people and our \\nbusinesses keep more of their money, not the government's money but \\ntheir money. We also have to be mindful of the impact it has on our \\nstaggering national debt of over $20 trillion and rising deficits. We \\ncan expect the economy to grow at a much healthier rate than it has in \\nrecent years if we pass a good tax bill. But we also need to look for \\nother ways to offset the costs of those tax cuts to a degree.\\n  There have been a lot of discussions during the year about what I \\nwould consider unwise and painful changes to our tax law. Eliminating \\ndeductions, credits, exclusions, exemptions--they are popular and \\nwidespread. Some people call that the spinach, in addition to the ice \\ncream of tax cuts.\\n  However, I have what I would call maybe a creative idea, a novel \\nidea--one that I think is gaining momentum in the Senate and in the \\nHouse. We can repeal the individual mandate of ObamaCare and save $300 \\nto $400 billion for the Federal Government and therefore deliver more \\ntax relief to our families and our workers and our businesses. That is \\nnot my math. That is the math of the Congressional Budget Office. They \\nhave said repeatedly that eliminating the individual mandate of \\nObamaCare would save $300 to $400 billion. That is a lot of tax cuts.\\n  The individual mandate has also been the most unpopular part of \\nObamaCare. More than two-thirds of Americans want to see it repealed. \\nThe House has voted repeatedly to repeal it. The Senate has voted to \\nrepeal it. Even some Democrats have said that they want to repeal the \\nindividual mandate as well. It is the first time in our country's \\nhistory, after all, that the Federal Government has said: You must buy \\nthe product of a private company for the mere privilege of being an \\nAmerican citizen.\\n  We also know that the individual mandate simply has not worked. It \\nwas designed to hold down premiums on the ObamaCare exchanges. That has \\nnot been the case. Despite the individual mandate being in place now \\nfor 4 years, we continue to see premiums spiral out of control. So I \\nthink it is a pretty reasonable proposal to repeal the most hated part \\nof ObamaCare to help pay for tax cuts the American people want rather \\nthan trying to eliminate popular and widely used deductions, credits, \\nexemptions, and exclusions.\\n  Moreover, it allows us to make more of the tax cut bill permanent \\nbecause the $300 to $400 billion savings over a 10-year period is just \\na 10-year period, but it will continue to save money after those 10 \\nyears. With the crazy way we do our budgeting around here, that allows \\nus to make more of those tax cuts permanent so that our families and \\nour businesses can have greater predictability to save and invest and \\ngrow our economy.\\n  It is also a kind of tax cut for working-class Americans in its own \\nright. According to IRS data, more than five out of six households that \\npaid the mandate fine last year made less than the median income. They \\nwere in the bottom half of income earners.\\n  So what are we doing? We are imposing a fine on the working class and \\nworking poor because they can't afford the insurance that ObamaCare \\nmade unaffordable in the first place. That is crazy.\\n  We can do this in a way that makes it easier to pass a tax bill. I \\nknow some of my colleagues around here, especially some of my \\nRepublican colleagues, say: Oh, no. We can't go back to healthcare. It \\nis going to make the tax bill a little harder to pass. That is \\nnonsense. It makes the tax bill easier to pass--easier to pass because \\nit helps make the fiscal picture balance, and it helps deliver more tax \\ncuts to our families and our businesses back home.\\n  Some of my Democratic colleagues, drawing on that same estimate from \\nthe Congressional Budget Office, will say: You are going to take \\nhealthcare away from 15 million people. That is nonsense. This bill \\ndoesn't cut a single dime out of ObamaCare, not even one penny, not one \\npenny taken out of Medicaid, not one penny taken out of the subsidies \\nfrom the exchanges, not a single regulation change. It simply says that \\nthe IRS will not fine you if you cannot afford the insurance that \\nObamaCare made unaffordable.\\n  The $300 to $400 billion--even in Washington, that is a lot of money, \\nand that is money that is better left in the pockets of America's \\nworkers and families and on the financial statements of businesses that \\nare looking to expand their operations, increase their wages, and hire \\nmore workers.\\n  No, this hasn't been part of the tax debate for a long time. This \\nChamber considered repealing the mandate as part of our healthcare \\ndebate, but the Obama administration called the individual mandate a \\ntax.\\n  In 2012, the Supreme Court upheld its constitutionality saying that \\nit was a tax. The IRS collects it. You pay it on your 1040. That is \\nabout the ``taxiest'' provision I can think of.\\n  Let's make a commonsense decision, even if it is a little late in the \\ngame. Repeal the individual mandate. Pay for more tax cuts for families \\nand businesses. Make a tax bill easier to pass. Deliver on the promise \\nthat we made to the American people to repeal the most unpopular part \\nof ObamaCare and have a very big victory for the American people.\\n  I yield the floor.\\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\", u'turn': 10, u'speaker': u'Mr. COTTON', u'itemno': 14}, {u'kind': u'speech', u'speaker_bioguide': None, u'text': u'  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, we currently have the highest Federal \\ncorporate tax rate in the developed world. Businesses are moving from \\nhere overseas to seek a friendlier tax environment.\\n  If we are going to compete globally--and we are in a global economy--\\nwe have to have a conducive tax and regulatory environment to do so. We \\ndon't have a conducive tax environment now. We cannot compete globally \\nwith the second highest or the highest corporate tax rate in the \\ndeveloped world.\\n  We also have a tax code that is far too complicated. Taxpayers and \\ncompanies alike spend about 9 billion hours a year--9 billion hours a \\nyear--combined with IRS requirements, and this costs the U.S. economy \\nmore than $400 billion a year. This is just compliance costs.\\n  The Tax Code is also full of costly loopholes which allow businesses \\nand millions of individuals to get away with paying no income tax or no \\ncorporate tax.\\n  After over 30 years, I am pleased to see Congress finally getting \\ndown to the work of doing a tax overhaul. A few weeks ago, we passed a \\nbudget that allows some cuts--about $1.5 trillion. I believe that when \\nwe do cut certain taxes, it does generate a greater economic activity, \\nwhich does in turn mean additional revenue to government. However, \\nthere are limits to that model. We cannot simply assume we can cut all \\ntaxes and realize additional revenue. It is important that tax reform \\ncomes as well.\\n  We have been hearing a lot about cuts, cuts, cuts. If we are going to \\ndo cuts, cuts, cuts, we have to do a wholesale reform. With the \\nnational debt exceeding $20 trillion, we have to take this seriously. \\nRate reductions have to be accompanied by repeal or reform. We cannot \\nsimply rely on rosy economic assumptions, rosy growth rates to fill in \\nthe gap. We have to make tough decisions. We cannot have cuts today \\nthat assume we will grow a backbone in the out-years in terms of the \\nreal reforms we are going to need. We have seen this before. We make \\nthe cuts now; we rely on rosy economic assumptions; and then, in the \\nout-years, if those don't come about, we forget what we were supposed \\nto do in terms of reform. We can't do that today, not with a debt of \\n$20 trillion, not with a deficit of over $600 billion a year adding to \\nthat total debt.\\n  I welcome this opportunity to do tax reform. It is needed. As I \\nmentioned, we have to have a conducive tax and regulatory environment \\nin order to compete, but we have to be realistic as well about what we \\ncan achieve, and we can't push off the reforms for cuts today.\\n  I yield the floor.\\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\", u'turn': 14, u'speaker': u'Mr. FLAKE', u'itemno': 18}, {u'kind': u'speech', u'speaker_bioguide': None, u'text': u'  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, today I rise with my colleague from New \\nMexico, Senator Heinrich, to discuss the Securing America's Voting \\nEquipment Act of 2017, or the SAVE Act, which we introduced earlier \\nthis week.\\n  I know that you are well aware that the Senate Intelligence Committee \\nhas been conducting an in-depth investigation into attempts by the \\nRussians to interfere with our elections last fall. What we have found \\nis that the Russians' active measures preceded last fall, and they \\ncontinue to this very day.\\n  We have an election coming up in November of this year and a major \\nelection next year, and both Senator Heinrich and I believe that it is \\nso important that we act to assist States in protecting the integrity \\nof their voting systems.\\n  Our bill seeks to facilitate information sharing on the threats posed \\nto State election systems by foreign adversaries, to provide guidance \\nto States on how to protect their systems against nefarious activity, \\nand, for States that choose to do so, to allow them to access some \\nFederal grant money to implement best practices to protect their \\nsystems.\\n  Let me be clear that I know of no evidence to date that actual vote \\ntabulations were manipulated in any State in the elections last fall. \\nNevertheless, as early as the summer of 2016, the FBI discovered that \\nforeign-based hackers had gained access to voter registration databases \\nin two States. The Department of Homeland Security confirmed that \\nRussia-linked actors attempted to access voter rolls and registration \\ndata in those two States.\\n  More alarming is that further investigation revealed that many more \\nStates than just two were ultimately found to have had their voting \\nsystems probed by the Russians. The Department of Homeland Security \\nnotified election officials in a total of 21 States that their election \\nsystems had been targeted by Russian Government-linked hackers.\\n  If voter rolls were altered or voting equipment tampered with, a \\ncompromise of these systems could open the door to voter \\ndisenfranchisement and would undermine public confidence and the \\nintegrity of our free and fair elections--a bedrock principle of our \\ndemocracy.\\n  In response to these alarming threats, the SAVE Act would assist \\nStates in hardening their systems. It does not aim to tell States how \\nto conduct their elections. The responsibility for conducting elections \\nwould remain with each State, as has been our country's tradition since \\nits founding. State and local election officials alone, however, cannot \\nbe expected to defend against cyber attacks from foreign adversaries. \\nThat is why our bill seeks to bring to bear the unique authorities, \\ncapabilities, and resources that the Federal Government can offer to \\nState and local election officials.\\n  Let me briefly describe the Heinrich-Collins bill.\\n  First, our bill would codify a decision made by both Secretaries of \\nHomeland Security, Jeh Johnson and John Kelly, to designate election \\nsystems as ``critical infrastructure.'' This designation allows DHS to \\nprioritize providing assistance to election jurisdictions and to \\nestablish formal mechanisms to enhance information sharing and \\ncollaboration within the electoral sector. More than 30 States took \\nadvantage of DHS's offer of assistance last year.\\n  Our bill also addresses a shortcoming that I raised during a hearing \\nbefore the Senate Intelligence Committee in June regarding foreign \\nefforts to compromise American voting systems. During this hearing, we \\nlearned that not a single secretary of state had been cleared to \\nreceive classified information before the 2016 election or in the 6 \\nmonths since voting systems had been declared as critical \\ninfrastructure. This delay is truly inexplicable. We have to be able to \\nshare this critical information in order for State election officials \\nto take the necessary steps to safeguard their systems.\\n  Our bill addresses this limitation on information sharing by \\nauthorizing the Director of National Intelligence to provide security \\nclearances to designated chief election officials in each State. That \\nway, the intelligence community can share appropriate classified \\ninformation with States regarding foreign threats targeting election \\nsystems.\\n  Our bill also mandates that DHS conduct a threat assessment on \\nphysical and electronic risks to voting systems. Then, in collaboration \\nwith stakeholders, the Department will develop best practices to \\naddress those risks.\\n  A few simple measures can make a big difference. Best practices like \\nrelying upon paper ballots, as the State of Maine currently does, and \\nconducting postelection audits to ensure that the tabulation by vote-\\ncounting machines matches the results of the paper ballots can bolster \\nboth resilience and public confidence in the integrity of the voting \\nprocess.\\n  Finally, our bill creates a Federal grant program available for \\nStates to upgrade and safeguard the integrity of their systems by \\nimplementing the best practices that have been identified.\\n  Last year, the Russian Government sought to disrupt our democracy by \\nthreatening the integrity of our elections. It is incumbent upon \\nCongress to\\n\\n\\nassist the States and those charged with conducting elections at the \\nlocal, State, and Federal level to protect them from foreign \\ninterference. Our bill would do just that.\\n  I am very pleased to work with the leader on this effort, Senator \\nHeinrich, and I would urge all of our colleagues to join Senator \\nHeinrich and me in sponsoring this bill.\\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\", u'turn': 18, u'speaker': u'Mr. COLLINS', u'itemno': 22}, {u'kind': u'speech', u'speaker_bioguide': None, u'text': u'  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I want to start by thanking my \\nRepublican colleague from Maine, Senator Susan Collins, for her work on \\nthis legislation. In addition to her excellent work on the Intelligence \\nCommittee, her experience in homeland security and critical \\ninfrastructure was absolutely critical to the drafting of this \\nlegislation.\\n  As current members of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, we \\nare continuing to work on the investigation into Russian interference \\nin the 2016 Presidential election. Yesterday, our committee held an \\nimportant open hearing where we had representatives from companies such \\nas Facebook, Google, and Twitter. We know that Russian Government-\\nlinked actors purchased online advertisements last year in order to \\ninfluence voters and, frankly, in order to divide Americans. \\nAdditionally, Russia used bots and trolls to spread misinformation and \\ndivision organically through social media networks.\\n  While the President has labeled reports of these ads as a ``hoax,'' \\nnow that Facebook has actually released many of those ads and \\nacknowledged their extensive reach last year, I hope we can all agree \\nthat this is a problem which we must solve before future election \\ncycles.\\n  I have called on the Federal Election Commission to consider new \\nguidance on how online advertisement platforms can better prevent \\nforeign nationals from illicitly spending in future U.S. elections. I \\ncertainly support legislation to require the same transparency for \\nonline political ads that we currently enjoy for television or print or \\nradio ads. These are simple, straightforward steps we can and must take \\nto protect the sanctity of our democracy.\\n  We also know, based on intelligence assessments, that as part of \\nRussia's larger hostile effort to interfere in last year's election, \\nRussian actors targeted State election voting centers and State-level \\nvoting registration databases--the very heart of the infrastructure we \\nall rely on for free and fair elections. In my view, these intrusions \\ndemonstrate a troubling vulnerability to potential future cyber attacks \\nand manipulations by foreign hackers of our elections and our \\ndemocratic process.\\n  Our democracy fundamentally hinges on protecting the rights of \\nAmericans to be able to fairly choose their own leaders. That is why I \\nam proud to be partnering with Senator Collins in introducing the \\nbipartisan Securing America's Voting Equipment Act, or the SAVE Act, to \\nprovide increased security for American election systems. I am proud to \\njoin Senator Collins on the floor today to demonstrate our commitment \\nto being able to move forward in a bipartisan and pragmatic way to find \\nsolutions to protect the integrity of that voting process.\\n  Our bipartisan legislation would permanently designate State-run \\nelection systems as ``critical infrastructure,'' and it would require \\nthe Department of Homeland Security to create a Federal grant program \\nto help States upgrade the physical, electronic, and even the \\nadministrative components of their voting systems and develop those \\nbest practices that Senator Collins mentioned in her speech earlier.\\n  The SAVE Act would also require the Director of National Intelligence \\nto sponsor security clearances to the officials responsible for the \\nadministration and certification of Federal elections in each State--\\nusually our secretaries of state. The Director of National Intelligence \\nwould then share all appropriate classified information with those \\nState officials to help them protect their election systems from these \\nkinds of security threats.\\n  Finally, the SAVE Act would create a Federal competition that would \\naward computer programmers who discover vulnerabilities in nonactive \\nvoting systems so that the equipment and the software vendors can work \\nto fix those vulnerabilities.\\n  The SAVE Act does not aim to tell States how to conduct their \\nelections or what policies or procedures or equipment is best where \\nthey are; rather, this bill is designed to facilitate information \\nsharing with States, to provide guidelines on how best to secure those \\nsystems, and to allow States to access funds to develop solutions and \\nimplement best practices in response to these threats.\\n  I consulted closely with my own Secretary of State from New Mexico, \\nSecretary of State Maggie Toulouse Oliver, in drafting this legislation \\nto ensure that it provides the security measures State election \\nofficials need to keep our voting systems secure. I commend Secretary \\nToulouse Oliver for her tremendous leadership in the effort to \\nsafeguard election infrastructure at the State level.\\n  We are at a critical juncture in the Russia investigation in which \\nthe public is beginning to see the tactical evidence of how the Kremlin \\nsought to influence our elections and divide our populous. Until we set \\nup stronger protections of our election systems and take the necessary \\nsteps to prevent future foreign influence campaigns, our Nation's \\ndemocratic institutions will remain vulnerable. But we have the tools \\nto fix those vulnerabilities. I look forward to working with Senator \\nCollins and all of our colleagues on both sides of the aisle to ensure \\nthat we do that.\\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\", u'turn': 20, u'speaker': u'Mr. HEINRICH', u'itemno': 24}, {u'kind': u'speech', u'speaker_bioguide': None, u'text': u'  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Since she \\n     began her tenure on the Colorado Supreme Court in 2006, and \\n     indeed throughout her legal career before her\\n\\n\\n     appointment to the bench, Justice Eid has demonstrated deep \\n     understanding of federal Indian law and policy matters, as \\n     well as significant respect for tribes as governments. Such \\n     qualities and experiences are rare among nominees to the \\n     federal bench and consequently, many in Indian Country \\n     strongly support Justice Eid's confirmation.\\n       The National Native American Bar Association's mission is \\n     to advance justice for Native Americans. As our name implies, \\n     NNABA represents the interests of all populations indigenous \\n     to the lands which are now collectively the United States: \\n     American Indians, Alaska Natives, and Native Hawaiians. Our \\n     members include Native American attorneys, Indian law \\n     practitioners and professors, as well as numerous tribal \\n     court advocates and tribal court judges. As you know, all \\n     branches of the Federal government play an integral role in \\n     justice for Native Americans and their government-to-\\n     government relationship with the United States. The unique \\n     legal posture of Indian tribes to the federal government is \\n     deeply rooted in American history and has always been heavily \\n     intertwined with often-shifting federal Indian policy, but \\n     often a central role in justice for Native Americans rests \\n     with the federal courts. Yet nearly all federal courts have \\n     suffered without any Native voice on the bench and often \\n     without judges with knowledge of federal Indian law or \\n     familiarity with Indian Country. NNABA strongly encourages \\n     the confirmation of judges with experience or interest in \\n     federal Indian law and who respect the role of tribal \\n     sovereigns under the Constitution and treaties with the \\n     United States. It is NNABA's honor and privilege to commend \\n     for your consideration for the confirmation of Justice \\n     Allison Eid, who exemplifies those qualities and who is also \\n     an exceptionally well-qualified candidate in every other \\n     regard, as well as the first Colorado woman to be nominated \\n     to the Tenth Circuit.\\n       Her academic credentials are excellent. Raised by a single \\n     mother in Spokane, Washington, Justice Eid began college at \\n     the University of Idaho and then transferred to Stanford \\n     University where she graduated with distinction and was a \\n     member of the Phi Beta Kappa honor society. After Stanford, \\n     Justice Eid served as a speechwriter to President Ronald \\n     Reagan's Secretary of Education, William Bennett. She went on \\n     to attend the University of Chicago Law School where she \\n     served as Articles Editor on the Law Review, graduated with \\n     High Honors, and was elected Order of the Coif. Justice Eid \\n     began her legal career as a law clerk for Judge Jerry Smith \\n     on the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. \\n     She then served as a law clerk to Justice Clarence Thomas on \\n     the United States Supreme Court.\\n       In private practice at Arnold and Porter following her \\n     clerkships, Justice Eid practiced both commercial and \\n     appellate litigation for a variety of clients, including \\n     significantly for the Hopi Tribe. She was a key part of \\n     litigation teams asserting the Hopi Tribe's sovereign rights \\n     in litigation against the United States Department of the \\n     Interior, for example in the so-called ``Bennett Freeze'' \\n     litigation, wherein the Hopi Tribe sought the right to \\n     develop its lands and resources despite a federal moratorium \\n     on such development.\\n       Justice Eid later became a tenured professor at the \\n     University of Colorado Law School where she taught \\n     Legislation, Constitutional Law, and Torts, and served as the \\n     faculty clerkship advisor. During her time at the University \\n     of Colorado, Justice Eid continued her service in the legal \\n     community, being active in a number of bar organizations and \\n     serving as a frequent speaker and author. In 2005 she was \\n     appointed by Colorado Attorney General John Suthers to serve \\n     as the Solicitor General of Colorado. One year later, \\n     Governor Bill Owens appointed Justice Eid to the Colorado \\n     Supreme Court where she has served for 11 years, and was \\n     successfully retained by the voters of Colorado on a \\n     statewide ballot. While serving as a Justice on the \\n     Colorado Supreme Court, Justice Eid has continued to teach \\n     at the University of Colorado. She also serves as the \\n     Chair of the Supreme Court Water Court Committee which \\n     works to identify rule and statutory changes to achieve \\n     efficiencies in water court cases, while maintaining \\n     quality outcomes for all. Justice Eid was also appointed \\n     by Chief Justice John Roberts to serve on the Federal \\n     Advisory Committee on Appellate Rules--a prestigious \\n     appointment where she has served alongside federal judges, \\n     law professors, and lawyers to craft revisions to the \\n     Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure--including her \\n     support for efforts to allow tribes to file amicus briefs \\n     as of right at the Supreme Court just as state governments \\n     can. Justice Eid is also active in her community and \\n     church. As the mother of two children, Justice Eid has \\n     volunteered numerous hours at her children's schools and \\n     for their extracurricular activities.\\n       NNABA is very concerned that federal appointees, whether \\n     judicial, executive branch or independent agency \\n     representatives, be well versed in and respectful of tribal \\n     sovereignty. Justice Eid has significantly more experience \\n     with Indian law cases than any other recent Circuit Court \\n     nominee. Her Indian law cases generally reflect her respect \\n     for tribes as sovereign governments and understanding of \\n     tribes' roles in our federalism. Justice Eid has been \\n     involved in five Indian law cases, each addressing only a \\n     subset of myriad issues of importance to Indian tribes. We \\n     have examined Justice Eid's record and are heartened by the \\n     respect and fairness she has always shown tribes appearing \\n     before the Colorado Supreme Court. We have canvassed NNABA \\n     members who have appeared before or clerked for Justice Eid \\n     (yes, Justice Eid has hired a Native American law clerk!) and \\n     received unanimous positive feedback.\\n       Justice Eid has knowledge gained from living in and working \\n     in a State which has Indian Country and strong tribal \\n     governments, and also from being the spouse of a noted \\n     American Indian Law practitioner, Mr. Troy Eid, who served as \\n     Chair of the Indian Law and Order Commission, as the United \\n     States Attorney for Colorado from 2006-2009, and who now co-\\n     chairs the national Indian law practice group at Greenberg \\n     Traurig LLP, is admitted to practice before numerous tribal \\n     courts and serves as a Tribal appointee on the Navajo Nation \\n     Commission on Judicial Conduct. Her husband is widely \\n     regarded as an expert in Indian law, and in particular on \\n     tribal law enforcement and access to justice issues. In her \\n     personal life, Justice Eid regularly interacts with tribal \\n     leaders and Native American lawyers and often brings that \\n     knowledge to bear on the bench. We believe her to be a \\n     conscientious, diligent, careful and scholarly jurist. Each \\n     NNABA member we heard from concluded that Justice Eid is a \\n     woman of integrity and extremely well-qualified for the Tenth \\n     Circuit.\\n       NNABA has long sought the nomination of federal judges with \\n     knowledge of federal Indian law, and more generally with \\n     experience on western issues directly impacting Indian tribes \\n     such as water law and public lands. With Justice Neil \\n     Gorsuch's elevation to the U.S. Supreme Court, that knowledge \\n     base and experience is lacking in the current makeup of the \\n     Tenth Circuit, and is a vitally important perspective. In \\n     short, Justice Eid has shown herself to be interested and \\n     engaged and willing to make the federal judiciary more \\n     accessible to tribes, who regrettably often find themselves \\n     in the position of federal court litigants.\\n       On the Colorado Supreme Court, Justice Eid has always \\n     ``gotten it right'' on Indian law matters, as reflected in \\n     her majority opinion in Pawnee Well Users v. Wolfe, 320 P.3d \\n     320 (Colo. 2013) (tribal water rights), in her joining of the \\n     dissent in Southern Ute v. King Consolidated Ditch Co., 250 \\n     P.3d 1226 (Colo. 2011), and in her votes to grant certiorari \\n     in TMR v. TER, 2013 WL 3809175 (Indian Child Welfare Act \\n     case) and Begaye v. People, 2011 WL 6162622 (Batson challenge \\n     involving Native American jury pool). We also note her \\n     important concurring opinion in Cash Advance & Preferred Cash \\n     Loans v. State, 242 P.3d 1099 (Colo. 2010), principally a \\n     case about tribal enterprises' sovereign immunity from suit \\n     and service of process. This opinion illustrates Justice \\n     Eid's respect for tribal sovereignty and we think is \\n     emblematic of the practicality, fairness, the careful \\n     attention to what the law requires, and the accessibility of \\n     writing style that she would bring to the Tenth Circuit.\\n       In sum, while we do not expect that Justice Eid will agree \\n     with tribal interests on every issue, we also believe that \\n     she is immensely well qualified and we are confident that \\n     Justice Eid is a mainstream, commonsense Westerner who will \\n     rule fairly on Indian Country matters. We endorse her \\n     confirmation to serve.\\n       Thank you for considering our views.\\n       And special thanks to Senators Daines and Gardner, who have \\n     consistently solicited feedback from tribes and tribal \\n     organizations regarding federal judicial nominations. NNABA \\n     appreciates your continued commitment to Indian country, to \\n     fortifying the government-to-government relationship between \\n     the United States and tribes, and to ensuring that Native \\n     American voices are heard at the highest levels of the \\n     federal government.\\n       If you have any further questions, do not hesitate to \\n     contact our NNABA Nominations and Endorsements Committee \\n     Chair, and Immediate Past NNABA President Jennifer Weddle.\\n           Respectfully and humbly,\\n\\n                                              Diandra Benally,\\n\\n                                        President, National Native\\n                              American Bar Association, 2017-2018.\\n\", u'turn': -1, u'speaker': u'The RECORDER', u'itemno': 30}, {u'kind': u'speech', u'speaker_bioguide': u'G000562', u'text': u\"  Mr. GARDNER.

Madam Speaker, earlier this week a driver whom law \\nenforcement has identified as Sayfullo Saipov, violently rammed his \\npickup truck into a crowd in Manhattan, killing 8 people and injuring \\n11. Local officials called it the deadliest attack since September 11, \\n2001, in that city.\\n  My heart breaks for those who have lost their lives--for their \\nfamilies, for their friends, and for their colleagues--due to this \\nviolent act.

Imagine \\nthese heroic Americans who intervened under very chaotic circumstances \\nto bring down this criminal. Imagine yourself in that position.\\n  This attack raises many questions about how this individual came to \\nAmerica and how he was allowed to stay. The President's tweets \\nobliquely blame this person or that person, some in Congress, some not \\nin Congress, but he misses the larger point: our Federal Government, \\nthe legislative branch--the first defined in our Constitution--the \\nexecutive branch, and the judicial branch, need to work together to \\ntackle our flawed immigration system.\\n\\n\\n  How can we make it more secure while upholding our values as a nation \\nof immigrants? The Bible reminds us: At one point, you and your \\npredecessors and your family were aliens, too.\\n  These are the questions to which we should be dedicating ourselves. \\nWe have security systems we must perfect, but it requires working \\ntogether. We are supposed to be the adults in the Republic. A true \\nleader would convene a working group of both parties, along with other \\nexperts, to tackle these security challenges brought to light again by \\nthis tragedy. Wouldn't that be constructive? Instead, there is more \\ndivision. That is not a recipe for success.\\n  Let's not forget a comprehensive bill passed in the Senate in 2013, \\non a vote of 68-32 and a bipartisan House companion bill that had 201 \\ncosponsors, but the Republican-controlled House here refused to bring \\nthat bill to the floor for a vote. That bipartisan reform bill on \\nimmigration eliminated the diversity visa lottery by which the murderer \\ngot into this country. Imagine if that bill had been passed. We would \\nbe in a different position.\\n  We can work together, but we must move past the fear-mongering, the \\ntalking points, the cheap political stunts to appeal to a media that \\nruns 24/7 and just looks for more fodder. Our job in Congress is to \\ndefend our Constitution and, in so doing, defend liberty. This includes \\nour primary responsibility to work together to assure that our people \\nfeel safe and secure. We defend the Constitution by defending and \\nprotecting them.\\n  The goal must not be division. The goal cannot be shallow attention \\nand tweets on social media and cable news. Our people have a higher \\ncalling that our Constitution defines.

Mr. Speaker, I received the sad news earlier this week \\nthat the Honorable James (Jim) Martin passed away from this life at the \\nage of 99, in Gadsden, Alabama. Jim Martin was not only a former member \\nof this body, but he was the Congressman for the district of Alabama, \\nwhich I now represent.\\n  James Martin was born in Tarrant, Alabama on September 1, 1918, the \\nson of a railroad engineer and school teacher. Martin attended school \\nin a log cabin. After graduating high school in 1936, he attended a \\nbusiness college, and then started a job as a clerk at Pan-American \\nPetroleum in Birmingham.\\n  In 1941, shortly before America was drawn into World War II, Martin \\ndecided to join the U.S. Army. Martin served as a captain and was part \\nof the American effort to liberate Europe from the Nazis.\\n  Martin and his men liberated concentration camps and saw the horrors \\nof war firsthand. In an interview with the Library of Congress, Martin \\nsaid, ``I'm not the same person I was before World War II.''\\n  After fighting in that war, he came back to Alabama and settled in \\nthe city of Gadsden. It was in Gadsden where he met his future wife Pat \\nHuddleston.\\n  It was in 1962, that Martin decided to enter politics. He challenged \\nthen U.S. Senator Lister Hill, the incumbent Democrat. Martin came \\nwithin 6,000 votes of upsetting Hill.\\n  Alabama voters elected Martin to the U.S. House of Representatives in \\nNovember of 1964. Martin took office as the Member of Congress from \\nAlabama's 7th Congressional District in 1965 which was the year I was \\nborn. He served one term, from January 1965 to January 1967.\\n  To say that Congressman Martin was a trailblazer in Alabama politics \\nis an understatement. His election in 1964 marked a change of course in \\na state that had been dominated by a single party for decades.\\n  During his time in Congress, Martin worked diligently to represent \\nthe wishes and interests of his constituents back in Alabama. He was a \\ngreat leader and one of those rare individuals who could convey his \\nconservative message in words like few others.\\n  In 1966, Martin chose not to seek reelection to Congress, but instead \\ndecided to seek the Governorship of Alabama. While Martin did not win \\nthe election against the wife of George Wallace, Lurleen Wallace, his \\nshowing was remarkable. Martin received more support than any \\nRepublican candidate for governor since Reconstruction.\\n  Then in the 1990s, Martin served as Alabama's Conservation and \\nNatural Resources director under Governor Fob James. Just as Martin had \\nbeen a trailblazer in politics, he did the same during his time serving \\nin this capacity.\\n  Martin convinced the state to purchase Cathedral Caverns in Marshall \\nCounty. It has since become a state park. He also started Alabama's \\nForever Wild Program. Its mission\\n\\n\\nis to secure Alabama's wild and natural wonders and to save them from \\ndevelopment.\\n  After leaving public life, Martin remained active, engaged and \\ninvolved in his community. I would regularly see Congressman Martin \\naround the Gadsden area as he always had a lot of advice for his \\ncongressman.\\n  Martin is survived by his wife, Pat, two sons Douglas Martin, Jr. and \\nRichard H. Martin, and one daughter, Annette Graham Martin, along with \\nmany grandchildren and great-grandchildren.\\n  James Martin's remarkable life and legacy will live on for many \\ngenerations. It is my honor and privilege to recognize him and his \\naccomplishments and have this statement included in the Record of the \\nCongress in which he served, a tribute to his service, his love for his \\nstate and country and his faith in his creator.\\n\", u'turn': 0, u'speaker': u'Mr. ADERHOLT', u'itemno': 2}, {u'kind': u'linebreak', u'speaker_bioguide': None, u'text': u'                          ____________________\\n\\n\\n', u'turn': -1, u'speaker': u'None', u'itemno': 3}], u'header': {u'extension': True, u'vol': u'163', u'wkday': u'Thursday', u'chamber': u'House', u'num': u'178', u'year': u'2017', u'month': u'November', u'pages': u'E1495-E1496', u'day': u'2'}, u'doc_title': u'RECOGNIZING THE LIFE AND LEGACY OF THE HONORABLE JAMES (JIM) MARTIN', u'id': u'CREC-2017-11-02-pt1-PgE1495-3', u'title': u'RECOGNIZING THE LIFE AND LEGACY OF THE HONORABLE JAMES (JIM) MARTIN'}{u'content': [{u'kind': u'linebreak', u'speaker_bioguide': None, u'text': u'                                 ______\\n', u'turn': -1, u'speaker': u'None', u'itemno': 0}, {u'kind': u'title', u'speaker_bioguide': None, u'text': u'                            MORNING BUSINESS\\n', u'turn': -1, u'speaker': u'None', u'itemno': 1}, {u'kind': u'speech', u'speaker_bioguide': u'F000463', u'text': u'  Mrs. FISCHER.

Following basic training, Judith \\nwas stationed at Beale Air Force Base where she met her husband. \\nFollowing the birth of her son, she began her civilian career working \\nin area hospitals.\\n   After pursuing further education, Mrs. Holzapfel eventually became \\nGlenn County's school nurse and continued in that role for the next 30 \\nyears. Her many years of work and\\n\\n\\ndedication has made a difference in health education and quality of \\nlife for thousands of students and their families.\\n   After retiring from her many years of service to Glenn County, Mrs. \\nHolzapfel decided to continue her public services. She ran for a \\nposition on the Glenn County Board of Education, and won by an \\noverwhelming majority.\\n   Mrs. Holzapfel is an active member of many community service \\norganizations throughout the county and devotes her time to helping \\nyouth, veterans, and the impoverished. Above all, as a mother, \\ngrandmother, community activist, and veteran; Mrs. Holzapfel is \\npassionate and dedicated to upholding the values of her family, and of \\nher country.\\n\", u'turn': 0, u'speaker': u'Mr. GARAMENDI', u'itemno': 3}, {u'kind': u'linebreak', u'speaker_bioguide': None, u'text': u'                          ____________________\\n\\n\\n', u'turn': -1, u'speaker': u'None', u'itemno': 4}], u'header': {u'extension': True, u'vol': u'163', u'wkday': u'Thursday', u'chamber': u'House', u'num': u'178', u'year': u'2017', u'month': u'November', u'pages': u'E1489-E1490', u'day': u'2'}, u'doc_title': u'2017 WOMAN OF THE YEAR AWARD WINNER--JUDITH HOLZAPFEL', u'id': u'CREC-2017-11-02-pt1-PgE1489-6', u'title': None}{u'content': [{u'kind': u'speech', u'speaker_bioguide': u'A000360', u'text': u\"  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed \\nin the Record a copy of the article, ``More ACA Plans to Come With No \\nPremiums in 2018,'' by Anna Wilde Mathews and Christopher Weaver that \\nwas published in the Wall Street Journal on October 27, 2017.\", u'turn': 0, u'speaker': u'Mr. ALEXANDER', u'itemno': 0}, {u'kind': u'recorder', u'speaker_bioguide': None, u'text': u'  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in ', u'turn': -1, u'speaker': u'The RECORDER', u'itemno': 1}, {u'kind': u'recorder', u'speaker_bioguide': None, u'text': u\"the Record, as follows:\\n\\n            More ACA Plans To Come With No Premiums in 2018\\n\\n       Insurers selling Affordable Care Act plans have a \\n     compelling new pitch: free health insurance.\\n       When sales of plans on the law's exchanges begin Nov. 1, a \\n     growing number of consumers around the country will be able \\n     to get coverage for 2018 without paying any monthly premium, \\n     according to health insurers and an analysis of newly \\n     available federal data.\\n       In nearly all of the 2,722 counties included in the data, \\n     some consumers will be able to obtain free health insurance \\n     because they qualify for larger federal premium subsidies \\n     that cover the full cost of a plan, according to the new \\n     analysis.\\n       The growing availability of no-premium plans is a side \\n     effect of a decision by President Donald Trump's \\n     administration to end federal payments that are used to \\n     reduce out-of-pocket costs, such as deductibles, for low-\\n     income enrollees. The administration didn't halt--and \\n     indirectly bolstered--the federal subsidies that help \\n     consumers with their insurance premiums.\\n       The new analysis doesn't project exactly how many consumers \\n     could be eligible for the no-premium plans, a figure that \\n     depends on variables including people's income, household \\n     size, age, location and access to other types of health \\n     coverage.\\n       In the coming weeks, insurers are gearing up to promote the \\n     no-premium option. Amid uncertainty about the future of the \\n     2010 health law, known as Obamacare, many insurers have \\n     pulled back from the law's marketplaces. Many of the \\n     remaining ones are worried about losing enrollment next \\n     year--largely among consumers who aren't eligible for \\n     subsidies and won't be able to get premium-free plans.\\n       Insurers hope the no-premium insurance draws in more \\n     enrollees, particularly those they need most: people with few \\n     health needs. Healthy consumers help bolster the stability of \\n     the market by balancing out the health costs of sicker \\n     enrollees.\\n       ``We absolutely will be promoting this opportunity to get \\n     coverage at a zero price,''\\n\\n\\n     said Wendy Curran, a spokeswoman for Blue Cross Blue Shield \\n     of Wyoming, which is mentioning the no-premium plans in \\n     print, radio and social-media advertising. ``We hope those \\n     younger people will say, `Well yeah, if it's not going to \\n     cost me anything, sure.' ''\\n       Ms. Curran said it was ``astounding even to us'' how many \\n     people will be able to get no-premium insurance in Wyoming.\\n       The no-premium plans will also receive a hefty promotional \\n     push from insurance agents. EHealth Inc. and HealthMarkets \\n     Inc., both big national agencies, said they're preparing to \\n     highlight the option in advertising and other outreach.\\n       ``It's just the idea of something free being really \\n     appealing,'' said Nate Purpura, a vice president at eHealth. \\n     The company's surveys have consistently shown that price is \\n     the most important factor in consumers' choice of plan, he \\n     said.\\n       Availability will vary by age and income, but some \\n     enrollees who don't have a very low income may be able to \\n     land zero-premium coverage, according to the analysis of \\n     federal data conducted by consulting firm Oliver Wyman, a \\n     unit of Marsh & McLennan.\\n       The firm found that zero-premium ACA exchange plans would \\n     be available next year to at least some consumers in a total \\n     of 2,692 counties, out of 2,722 in the study.\\n       A 60-year-old making about $36,000 a year could find free \\n     2018 plans in 1,590 counties, while one with income of about \\n     $48,000 could do so in 654 counties, according to the \\n     analysis, which used data released Wednesday for plans \\n     available on HealthCare.gov, the federal marketplace used by \\n     39 states.\\n       For 2017, no-premium plans were available in many places \\n     for the very lowest-income enrollees, but for those at \\n     slightly higher levels, they were much more scarce. For \\n     instance, in 2017, a 60-year-old making about $36,000 could \\n     find free plans in about 300 of the counties.\\n       That is what is different in 2018, said Kurt Giesa, a \\n     partner at Oliver Wyman. The zero-premium plans are ``much \\n     more prevalent now than they were,'' he said.\\n       In California, which isn't included in the federal data, \\n     consumers must pay a minimal $1 a month. But there is a \\n     ``huge increase from last year'' in the number of people who \\n     will be able to buy virtually free plans, said Peter V. Lee, \\n     executive director of Covered California, the state's ACA \\n     exchange. Covered California currently has about 1.1 million \\n     enrollees who receive federal-premium subsidies, and more \\n     than half of them will be able to buy a plan for $1 for 2018, \\n     he said.\\n       The growing availability of no-premium plans is tied to the \\n     complicated dynamics of the 2010 health law, as well as a \\n     recent move by the GOP president.\\n       Under the law's rules, subsidies that help pay for premiums \\n     are available to people making up to about $48,000 a year. \\n     Those subsidy amounts are linked to the cost of the second-\\n     cheapest silver plan in an enrollee's location. So, when \\n     silver premiums go up, subsidies go up.\\n       Earlier this month, Mr. Trump's administration cut off \\n     federal payments to insurers for covering certain out-of-\\n     pocket costs for low-income enrollees in silver plans. In \\n     response, insurers raised premiums on their 2018 policies \\n     sharply to cover the extra expense, now coming out of their \\n     pockets--and in many cases, they loaded the extra boost only \\n     onto the silver plans.\\n       Because the separate premium subsidies, which Mr. Trump \\n     didn't cut, are linked to silver-plan prices, those subsidies \\n     are rising, too. In many states, the costs for cheaper bronze \\n     plans are going up much less rapidly than silver plans, so \\n     many more people will wind up being eligible for no-premium \\n     plans.\\n       On the flip side, those who don't get premium subsidies \\n     under the 2010 law may be responsible for the full brunt of \\n     steep rate increases, though they may be able to mitigate the \\n     impact by staying away from silver plans.\\n       For those who can get free plans, the lure may be \\n     irresistible.\\n       Medica, an insurer that is offering exchange plans in \\n     states including Iowa, Nebraska and Wisconsin, is running ads \\n     in some places that say ``$0 premium plans for individuals \\n     who qualify.'' It is also sending letters to some current \\n     exchange enrollees with bronze plans, who are likely to be \\n     enrolled with Medica in 2018, informing them that they can \\n     stop paying premiums next year. ``That's a nice letter to \\n     get,'' said Geoff Bartsh, a vice president at Medica.\\n       Jerry Dworak, chief executive of Montana Health Co-op, \\n     said, ``of course we're hoping that'' young and healthy \\n     enrollees flock to the no-premium plans.\\n       ``If they see that it's free, why not take it?,'' he said.\\n       Mr. Dworak said that a person making as much as $33,000 a \\n     year could get one of his company's Idaho plans and pay no \\n     premium.\\n       The plans may attract more older consumers than younger \\n     because premiums and subsidies rise with age, making free \\n     plans more available to older people.\\n       And for some, the zero-premium plans won't actually be the \\n     best deal, insurers and insurance agents say. The silver \\n     plans could be cheaper overall for people who use much health \\n     care, despite their higher premium costs, if these people are \\n     eligible for the health law's cost sharing help.\\n       According to HealthCare.gov, for instance, a 40-year-old \\n     man in Cheyenne, Wyo., who makes about $24,000 a year could \\n     get a zero-premium bronze plan, but he could pay as much as \\n     $6,650 over the course of 2018 in deductibles and other out-\\n     of-pocket charges. Or he could get a silver plan that would \\n     cost him around $125 a month, but cap his out-of-pocket costs \\n     at $2,450.\\n       ``There's this trade-off,'' said Michael Z. Stahl, a senior \\n     vice president at HealthMarkets, who said the company's \\n     agents will walk through the pros and cons with clients.\\n\", u'turn': -1, u'speaker': u'The RECORDER', u'itemno': 2}, {u'kind': u'linebreak', u'speaker_bioguide': None, u'text': u'                          ____________________\\n\\n\\n', u'turn': -1, u'speaker': u'None', u'itemno': 3}], u'header': {u'extension': False, u'vol': u'163', u'wkday': u'Thursday', u'chamber': u'Senate', u'num': u'178', u'year': u'2017', u'month': u'November', u'pages': u'S6997-S6998', u'day': u'2'}, u'doc_title': u'HEALTHCARE', u'id': u'CREC-2017-11-02-pt1-PgS6997-4', u'title': u'HEALTHCARE'}{u'title': None, u'content': [{u'kind': u'recorder', u'speaker_bioguide': None, u'text': u'            By Mr. POCAN:', u'turn': -1, u'speaker': u'The RECORDER', u'itemno': 0}, {u'kind': u'title', u'speaker_bioguide': None, u'text': u\"        H.R. 4232.\\n        Congress has the power to enact this legislation pursuant \\n     to the following:\\n       Article I, Section 8, Clause 18 of the Constitution of the \\n     United States, which states:\\n       The Congress shall have the power to make all laws which \\n     shall be necessary and proper for carrying into execution the \\n     foregoing powers, and all other powers vested by this \\n     Constitution in the Government of the United States, or in \\n     any Department or Officer thereof.''\\n\\n\", u'turn': -1, u'speaker': u'None', u'itemno': 1}], u'header': {u'extension': False, u'vol': u'163', u'wkday': u'Thursday', u'chamber': u'House', u'num': u'178', u'year': u'2017', u'month': u'November', u'pages': u'H8444', u'day': u'2'}, u'related_bills': [{u'type': u'HR', u'congress': u'115', u'context': u'TITLE', u'number': u'4232'}], u'doc_title': u'Constitutional Authority Statement for H.R. 4232', u'id': u'CREC-2017-11-02-pt1-PgH8444-16'}{u'content': [{u'text': u'  Executive nominations confirmed by the Senate November 2, 2017:\\n\\n', u'kind': u'Unknown', u'speaker': u'Unknown', u'itemno': 0, u'turn': -1}, {u'kind': u'title', u'speaker_bioguide': None, u'text': u'                          DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY\\n', u'turn': -1, u'speaker': u'None', u'itemno': 1}, {u'kind': u'title', u'speaker_bioguide': None, u'text': u'       PAUL DABBAR, OF NEW YORK, TO BE UNDER SECRETARY FOR ', u'turn': -1, u'speaker': u'None', u'itemno': 2}, {u'kind': u'title', u'speaker_bioguide': None, u'text': u'     SCIENCE, DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY.', u'turn': -1, u'speaker': u'None', u'itemno': 3}, {u'kind': u'title', u'speaker_bioguide': None, u'text': u'       MARK WESLEY MENEZES, OF VIRGINIA, TO BE UNDER SECRETARY OF ', u'turn': -1, u'speaker': u'None', u'itemno': 4}, {u'kind': u'title', u'speaker_bioguide': None, u'text': u'     ENERGY.\\n\\n', u'turn': -1, u'speaker': u'None', u'itemno': 5}, {u'kind': u'title', u'speaker_bioguide': None, u'text': u'                  FEDERAL ENERGY REGULATORY COMMISSION\\n', u'turn': -1, u'speaker': u'None', u'itemno': 6}, {u'kind': u'title', u'speaker_bioguide': None, u'text': u'       RICHARD GLICK, OF VIRGINIA, TO BE A MEMBER OF THE FEDERAL ', u'turn': -1, u'speaker': u'None', u'itemno': 7}, {u'kind': u'title', u'speaker_bioguide': None, u'text': u'     ENERGY REGULATORY COMMISSION FOR THE TERM EXPIRING JUNE 30, \\n     2022.', u'turn': -1, u'speaker': u'None', u'itemno': 8}, {u'kind': u'title', u'speaker_bioguide': None, u'text': u'       KEVIN J.

A bill to amend the Violent Crime Control and Law \\nEnforcement Act of 1994, to reauthorize the Missing Alzheimer's Disease \\nPatient Alert Program, and to promote initiatives that will reduce the \\nrisk of injury and death relating to the wandering characteristics of \\nsome children with autism; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\", u'turn': -1, u'speaker': u'The RECORDER', u'itemno': 0}, {u'kind': u'speech', u'speaker_bioguide': u'G000386', u'text': u\"  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today Senators Klobuchar, Tillis, \\nSchumer, Durbin and I will introduce legislation to help America's \\nfamilies locate missing loved ones who have Alzheimer's disease, autism \\nor related conditions that may cause them to wander. Congressman Chris \\nSmith will introduce a virtually identical companion bill in the House \\nof Representatives today as well.\\n  Our bill, which was introduced for the first time in the 114th \\nCongress, extends an existing program that helps locate individuals \\nwith Alzheimer's disease or dementia. It also adds new support for \\npeople with autism.\\n  We have named the legislation in honor of two boys with autism who \\nperished because their condition caused them to wander. One of these \\nchildren, nine-year-old Kevin Curtis Wills, slipped into Iowa's Raccoon \\nRiver near a park and tragically drowned in 2008. The other, 14-year-\\nold Avonte Oquendo, wandered away from his school and drowned in New \\nYork City's East River a few years ago.\\n  Theirs are not isolated cases. Just a few months ago, a four year-old \\nwith autism drowned in a pool after wandering away from her caretakers. \\nWe've all read or heard the heartbreaking stories of families \\nfrantically trying to locate a missing loved one whose condition caused \\nhim or her to wander off.\\n  Our bill will give communities the tools they need to help locate \\npeople with Alzheimer's disease or other forms of dementia as well as \\nchildren with autism spectrum disorders who wander away from their \\nfamilies or caregivers and into dangerous situations.\\n  My home State of Iowa has the fifth highest Alzheimer's death rate in \\nAmerica and we have about 63,000 Iowans living with the disease, \\naccording to the Alzheimer's Association. Additionally, the CDC \\nidentified 1 in 68 children across the country as having autism \\nspectrum disorders. In Iowa alone, about 8,000 individuals have been \\ndiagnosed with autism spectrum disorders.\\n  This bill will make resources available to equip first responders, \\nlaw enforcement officials, and other community leaders with the \\ntraining and tools necessary to better prevent and respond to these \\ncases as soon as possible. With better information sharing, communities \\ncan play a central role in reuniting autistic children and other \\nindividuals who wander with their families.\\n  Finally, the bill will ensure that local law enforcement agencies and \\nnonprofits that educate and train people on how to proactively prevent \\nand locate missing individuals who wander are eligible for grants from \\nthe U.S. Department of Justice. These grants will facilitate the \\ndevelopment of training and emergency protocols for\\n\\n\\nschool personnel, supply first responders with additional information \\nand resources, and make local tracking technology programs available \\nfor individuals who may wander from safety because of their condition. \\nGrant funding may also be used to establish or enhance notification and \\ncommunications systems for the recovery of missing children with \\nautism.\\n  I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation, which in \\nthe 114th Congress passed the Senate unanimously.

Mr. President, today I wish to honor Susie McMurry.\\n  On November 10, 2017, the Greater Wyoming Council of the Boy Scouts \\nof America will hold their annual ``Strength of America Banquet'' and \\ncelebrate Susie McMurry, a remarkable Wyoming philanthropist. Every \\nyear at this event, the council honors an individual who made \\ninvaluable contributions to the community and demonstrates the values \\nof the Scout oath and law.\\n  Susie McMurry is a perfect choice to receive this special \\nrecognition. She is a role model in our community and truly represents \\na spirit of citizenship, leadership, and service. Throughout her life, \\nSusie has always demonstrated an enduring devotion to God, her family, \\nand Wyoming. She loves her family. She loves her home State of Wyoming. \\nShe loves her country.\\n  She truly exemplifies the Scout promise ``to help other people at all \\ntimes.'' Should an opportunity arise to improve the life of a child, \\nSusie is the first to offer her assistance, time, and resources. Susie \\nstrongly supports programs for children that focus on mentoring, \\ndeveloping leadership skills, encouraging community service, and \\nbuilding self-esteem. She believes ``Children are the sunshine in our \\nlives. If we don't take care of our children, our world will be without \\nsunshine.''\\n  Her parents raised her with a deep understanding of the importance of \\ngiving back. While growing up, her parents always lent a helping hand \\nand opened their homes to individuals in need. Throughout her life, she \\nhas tried to follow their example. For nearly 30 years, she and her \\nhusband, Mick McMurry, were foster parents. They provided a safe and \\ncaring home for hundreds of children in Wyoming.\\n  Susie is a strong, compassionate, and caring woman. In 1946, she was \\nborn in Casper at Memorial Hospital of Natrona County. She called both \\nElk Mountain and Hanna home before eventually moving to Casper. Susie \\ndiscovered her calling to help children early in life. She studied \\nelementary education at Casper College and the University of Wyoming. \\nAfter graduation, she returned to Casper and taught first grade at \\nCrest Hill Elementary School.\\n  She met her husband of 41 years, Mick McMurry, in Casper. On December \\n21, 1973, Susie and Mick McMurry were married in Glenrock, WY. A few \\nyears later, they adopted their daughter, Trudi, and Susie retired from \\nteaching. In 1979, Susie and Mick became foster parents. Their second \\ndaughter, Jillian, was adopted from the foster program. Susie has eight \\ngrandchildren: Lou Davis, Tayla Davis, Tillie Holthouse, Ellie \\nHolthouse, Evie Kaschmitter, Lily Kaschmitter, Max Kaschmitter, and \\nAndrew Kaschmitter. She also has one great-grandchild, Neil Campbell. \\nIn 2015, Susie, the McMurry family, Casper, and the State of Wyoming \\nmourned the loss of her husband, Mick. Susie's compassion and strength \\ncontinues to guide her family and our community.\\n  The McMurry family has a remarkable history of helping people across \\nthe State of Wyoming. Susie explained, ``One of our goals is to teach \\nthe younger generation how to give back, how to participate, and love \\nmaking a difference.'' Mick and Susie established the McMurry \\nFoundation in 1998 with a mission to make a significant and beneficial \\nimpact on the lives of others. Guided by the values of excellence and \\ncompassion, the foundation has awarded more than $50 million since it \\nwas established. It focuses on education, religion, children and \\nadvocacy for children, health and human resources, the arts and \\nhumanities, and favorable business environments.\\n  Buildings across the State bear the McMurry name as a mark of \\ngratitude for their wonderful support. The number of places in Wyoming \\nthat have benefited from the contributions of the McMurry family is \\nincredible, but one organization especially dear to Susie is the \\nWyoming Medical Center. Susie has spent a tremendous number of\\n\\n\\nhours volunteering her time and talents to the benefit of everyone who \\ncomes through the doors. She feels that the health of a community is \\ndirectly tied to the health of its people.\\n  The values that Susie and the McMurry Foundation promote go hand in \\nhand with the mission of the Boy Scouts of America. They both work to \\nensure youth have the knowledge and skills needed to become future \\nleaders of Wyoming. Their continued focus on education, leadership, and \\ncommunity service will serve these young people and our State for \\ngenerations.\\n  Susie's kindness, generosity, and grace are true reflections of her \\ncharacter. She believes that fulfillment in life comes from making a \\ndifference in the lives of others. Whether it is volunteering at the \\nWyoming Medical Center to support patients and families or raising \\nfunds for the Boys and Girls Club of Central Wyoming, she has made a \\nhuge difference in the lives of so many people. Susie continues to have \\na positive and lasting mark on our community.\\n  It is with great honor that I recognize this exceptional member of \\nour Wyoming community. My wife, Bobbi, joins me in extending our \\ncongratulations to Susie McMurry for receiving this honorable \\ndistinction.\\n\", u'turn': 0, u'speaker': u'Mr. BARRASSO', u'itemno': 1}, {u'kind': u'linebreak', u'speaker_bioguide': None, u'text': u'                          ____________________\\n\\n\\n', u'turn': -1, u'speaker': u'None', u'itemno': 2}], u'header': {u'extension': False, u'vol': u'163', u'wkday': u'Thursday', u'chamber': u'Senate', u'num': u'178', u'year': u'2017', u'month': u'November', u'pages': u'S6998-S6999', u'day': u'2'}, u'doc_title': u'TRIBUTE TO SUSIE McMURRY', u'id': u'CREC-2017-11-02-pt1-PgS6998', u'title': None}{u'title': u'SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS', u'content': [{u'kind': u'linebreak', u'speaker_bioguide': None, u'text': u'                                 ______\\n', u'turn': -1, u'speaker': u'None', u'itemno': 0}, {u'kind': u'title', u'speaker_bioguide': None, u'text': u' SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 29--RECOGNIZING THE 100TH ANNIVERSARY OF ', u'turn': -1, u'speaker': u'None', u'itemno': 1}, {u'kind': u'title', u'speaker_bioguide': None, u'text': u\"                        THE BALFOUR DECLARATION\\n\\n  Mr. LANKFORD (for himself and Mr. Manchin) submitted the following \\nconcurrent resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Foreign \\nRelations:\\n\\n                            S.

Following this year's attacks \\non Muslim communities throughout California, Ms. Mellon-Anibaba \\norganized an event she called a ``Statement of Love.'' Her idea was to \\nbring people together to show their support for Muslims in her \\ncommunity. In response to the hateful words and actions she saw \\ndirected at certain minorities, Ms. Mellon-Anibaba created her own \\ndemonstration of support, solidarity, and acceptance. She was \\ndetermined to make a positive impact in her community, and she \\nsucceeded.\\n   Following a particularly disturbing attack on the Islamic Center \\nright in her own community, she brought together over 1,000 people to \\nshow their support for their neighbors.

Mr. Speaker, I rise to pay tribute to Scott Rasmussen, \\nan important member of my team for many years who will be leaving my \\noffice after this week to travel and pursue his varied interests.\\n  Scott is a native Californian who graduated from Brown University in \\n2010, then returned to the Bay Area where he worked in the areas of law \\nand technology. I was soon fortunate to have him join my campaign team, \\nwhere he demonstrated the confidence, intellectual curiosity, \\ndiligence, and political instincts that have served him so well over \\nthe years I have known him--and which I am sure will continue to bring \\nhim success in the future.\\n  Scott helped to form the initial core of my congressional staff in \\n2013, showing a willingness to pitch in and cover any topic that was \\nthrown to him, from answering phones to tackling policy questions. Over \\nthe ensuing years, Scott has taken on new roles and regularly delivered \\nresults for my constituents and the planet. Notable successes include \\nthe passage of the Point Reyes Coast Guard Housing Conveyance Act, \\nwhich will allow a former property in West Marin to be repurposed as \\naffordable housing and community space, and his work on our successful \\nbipartisan effort to strike a nearly half-century old congressional \\nearmark that cost taxpayers millions of dollars each year to ship \\nPennsylvania coal 3,000 miles to American bases in Germany.\\n  With diligence and finesse, Scott has helped to develop a number of \\nkey legislative initiatives, and his intellect and maturity have \\nallowed me to entrust him with sensitive foreign policy matters as \\nwell. Major projects have included my work to expand broadband access \\nto rural communities, and our ongoing efforts to make sure that \\nhomeowners are protected from an unexpected tax bill when they work to \\nreduce water use. Finally, he has worked on the tribal policy portfolio \\nthat is a priority in my office, helping to devise several complex and \\nmeaningful bills for the tribal members I represent.\\n  For six years I have had the benefit of Scott's good work, and I am \\ndeeply appreciative. Along with my family and my staff, I wish Scott \\nthe best of luck as he moves on the next phase of his career.\\n\", u'turn': 0, u'speaker': u'Mr. HUFFMAN', u'itemno': 2}, {u'kind': u'linebreak', u'speaker_bioguide': None, u'text': u'                          ____________________\\n\\n\\n', u'turn': -1, u'speaker': u'None', u'itemno': 3}], u'header': {u'extension': True, u'vol': u'163', u'wkday': u'Thursday', u'chamber': u'House', u'num': u'178', u'year': u'2017', u'month': u'November', u'pages': u'E1492', u'day': u'2'}, u'doc_title': u'HONORING SCOTT RASMUSSEN', u'id': u'CREC-2017-11-02-pt1-PgE1492', u'title': u'HONORING SCOTT RASMUSSEN'}{u'title': None, u'content': [{u'kind': u'metacharacters', u'speaker_bioguide': None, u'text': u'                              {time}  1945', u'turn': -1, u'speaker': u'None', u'itemno': 0}, {u'kind': u'title', u'speaker_bioguide': None, u'text': u'                           ISSUES OF CONCERN\\n', u'turn': -1, u'speaker': u'None', u'itemno': 1}, {u'kind': u'speech', u'speaker_bioguide': None, u'text': u\"  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Mr. Speaker, our American way of life and our Judeo-\\nChristian values are under attack as never before. People understand \\nthat there is the threat out there, but perhaps the magnitude keeps \\ncoming home of how bad and what a great threat it really is.\\n  Radical Islamic terrorists with a backward, evil, 7th century view of \\nthe world are out to destroy and kill us. They seek to terrorize \\nWestern countries and Americans, in particular, into retreat.\\n  Well, instead, we must stand tall. We must have the courage to do \\nwhat is necessary because it does depend on us, as it always has been. \\nAs when Nazism and Japanese militarism threatened the world, it was the \\nUnited States that carried the day for the decent people of the world.\\n  When communism threatened to establish atheistic dictatorships \\nthroughout the world and was on the march, yes, it was the American \\npeople who stood strong and had those policies necessary to hold off \\nthe communist menace until it collapsed, basically, of its own \\ninconsistencies and its own evil nature.\\n  Well, we had great leadership at those other battles, and I say, \\nthank goodness that today we now have a President who actually can \\nspeak the words against and condemn this horrible force that threatens \\nour country and the people of the world.\\n  Yes, we have a President who can actually say those words, ``radical \\nIslamic terrorism.'' For 8 years, we had a President who couldn't use \\nthose words, much less do those things that were necessary to defeat \\nthis threat and to make sure our people were secure.\\n  Some, if not many, of our leaders have been afraid to confront the \\nbasic nature of those who have made repeated terrorist attacks and \\nassaults. Anyone who is not signing on to their fanatical religious \\nagenda becomes a terrorist target, not only Christians, but Jews and \\nother Muslims.\\n  President Trump is, at long last, providing the courageous leadership \\nin this historic battle. Congress needs to support our President. We \\nneed to stand with him and to stand united against this evil, and yes, \\ndefend ourselves. We must not be afraid, and we must not only defend \\nourselves but also do what is necessary to defeat and extinguish this \\nghoulish adversary and end his bloody assault on Western civilization, \\nand yes, on moderate Islam.\\n  Words are not enough. Our homeland is under attack; people are in \\ndanger; our families, our country, and our way of life are under \\nattack. These attackers come from many countries, both men and women. \\nBut in common--these people who have been murdering people and the \\nmayhem they have been creating throughout the Western world, whether it \\nis in France or in the United States or elsewhere, these men and women \\nwho participate in these evil acts of terrorism have something that \\nthey have in common. They all pledge allegiance to radical Islam.\\n  That is our enemy, not Islam, not Islam itself, but the radical \\nfanaticism that terrorists and the Islamic psychopaths that are out \\nthere murdering in the worst possible and ghoulish ways, people, in \\norder to--yes, in order to have--to shock us and in order to intimidate \\nthe West into retreat.\\n  This week, a 29-year-old Uzbek immigrant plowed a truck into people \\nwalking and cycling in a New York City pathway. He killed 8 people, and \\nhe proclaimed that he was inspired by Islam. In fact, he said he was \\nproud of what he had done and even requested the display of his Islamic \\nstate flag in his hospital room.\\n  We need to ask ourselves: Why are we allowing Islamic terrorists like \\nthis into our country in the first place? How much longer will we close \\nour eyes and bury our heads in the sand?\\n  We have even witnessed horrendous terrorist attacks even in my home \\nState. We know that. We have seen it. On December 2, 2015, in San \\nBernardino, 14 innocent and wonderful people were brutally slaughtered \\nand 22 seriously injured by an immigrant from Pakistan--a hotbed of \\nradicalism. And yes, his motive was his fanatic belief in what he \\nconsiders to be Islam. It was truly one of the most evil attacks in our \\nState's history.\\n  In Orlando, on June 12, 2016, 49 nightclubbers out having a good \\ntime, enjoying themselves as Americans--life, liberty, and the pursuit \\nof happiness--they were having a good time, and 49 of these \\nnightclubbers were brutally murdered and mowed down.\\n  All of these innocent lives were slaughtered. Americans who were \\nblown apart at the Boston marathon is no different.\\n  We have American victims staring us in the face saying: What are you \\ngoing to do to bring justice and to protect the Americans that we left \\nbehind, our families? These horrific crimes of cowards mirrors what has \\nhappened to innocent people throughout the world.\\n  Yes, we Americans are suffering. And as I say, we have seen it in \\nFrance, we have seen it in Europe, we have seen it in Muslim countries \\nwhere these fanatics take Christians out and behead them. But they \\nalso, of course, attack moderate Muslims. They are out to try to topple \\nthe government of el-Sisi and Egypt and all the other governments there \\nthat are not committed to the fanatic view of Islam that they hold.\\n  The most recent attacks in New York should, at least, open our eyes \\nto things that we can do here. Maybe we can't stop it all over the \\nworld, but the least we can do is to take steps to protect our own \\ncitizens from this type of fanatical threat that hangs over us.\\n  Well, we need to take specific steps that can and should be done to \\nhelp deal with this danger. I have, in fact, discussed a plan with the \\nPresident--and this is a few months ago--and we have had a lot of work \\nand a lot of things under the bridge since then, but his commitment to \\nborder security includes placing a wall on the Southern border.\\n  Yes, making sure that we have border security, and yes, if it takes a \\nwall on our Southern border, the President is right on target. A wall \\nand beefing up our border will, of course, be expensive. That is why I \\nlaid out a plan to the President and have since offered legislation \\nthat would pay for President Trump's proposed border wall.\\n\\n  The car attack in New York has altered many Americans and alerted \\nmany Americans to something they didn't know about before, and that is \\nthat we have an immigration system, an immigration law that permits \\n50,000 people to immigrate into our country every year--50,000 people \\nwho are chosen by lottery, not by some really looking at them, some \\nexamination of their credentials, seeing what they could contribute, \\nno. A lottery.\\n  And, of course, Senator Schumer in the Senate, I guess, was the man \\nwho actually insisted on this. Well, I am sure he was well-intended, \\nbut what we have now are people--instead of bringing in the people who \\ncan most contribute to our country, he has insisted we leave 50,000 of \\nthem up to a lottery system.\\n\\n\\n  This is insanity. It is forced onto us and has been forced into \\npolicy by liberal left politicians who would flood our country with \\nillegals, which is something they are doing besides just this threat \\nthat we are talking about, because these people who win the lottery, of \\ncourse, are not coming here illegally.\\n  At the same time, the same people who are pushing that type of system \\nare pushing for policies that would flood our country with illegals and \\nhas flooded our country with illegals, that has brought down our \\nhealthcare system, our education system. We brought criminals into our \\ncountry, and we have had an uncontrolled border.\\n  Yes, the people who are responsible for that have also been \\nresponsible for policy that just permitted 50,000 people legally to \\ncome here; and those 50,000 people are people not selected by a \\nrational process but instead by a lottery.\\n  The terrorist murderers in New York, of course, were here. That \\nterrorist murderer, and maybe murderers, they were here on the lottery \\nvisa. They weren't here because they had been selected. In fact, the \\nlottery selected this Uzbeki fanatic Muslim, and he didn't have the \\nskills and the education necessary to live a decent life, and he ended \\nup killing a lot of people in New York. Surprise, surprise.\\n  We should know about these people who are coming into our country, \\nperiod, whether those people are coming illegally. We have had millions \\nof people pouring into our country illegally, and then what do our \\nliberal left politicians on the other side say? ``Oh, we need sanctuary \\ncities to protect them, the ones who are here illegally and have come \\nhere illegally,'' which, of course, does nothing but encourage more \\npeople to come here illegally. And the more who are here illegally are \\npeople who we don't know what they are all about.\\n  Do you think the fanatic Islamic terrorists that I am referring to \\ntoday didn't notice that our border was porous and that people were \\npouring across our border from our Southern border?\\n  Well, we should know about everybody who is coming into the country, \\nand we should choose the very best people who can contribute to our \\ncountry. I have no problem with a very robust legal immigration into \\nour country, no problem at all, and neither do the Republicans that I \\nknow.\\n  What we have a problem with is a flood of illegals coming in, bidding \\ndown the wages of our own citizens, some of them criminals attacking \\nand killing the citizens like we saw in San Francisco--a young lady who \\nwas killed by an illegal who had been sent home. But also, even within \\nthe system that is legal immigrants, we need to know who those people \\nare and select the very best people to come here.\\n  The plan that I offered the President, which will make it easier for \\nhim to accomplish this mission, is a plan that would take that slot in \\nour lottery, 50,000 people who now come in under a lottery like the guy \\nwho just killed those people in New York, instead, let's use that slot, \\nthose 50,000 places in our legal immigration system and offer it to \\nforeigners who are very wealthy, who can be given the privilege of \\npaying $1 million each to come here and eventually become a citizen.\\n  If we can do that, that $1 million and those 50,000 slots will give \\nus all the money we need to build that wall, and it is fitting that we \\nbuild that wall and we secure our borders and beef up our system of \\nimmigration to protect our citizens, and that we actually have people \\nwho want to come here and immigrate here pay for that reform.\\n  We need to implement immigration policies that serve the American \\npeople. That is what should be first and foremost, not some crazy \\nnotion that we are going to, oh, build--get some kind of better spirit \\nby opening up the immigration into our country to anybody who can get \\nhere, and let's let a lottery decide, let's not do it rationally. No.\\n  We need to make sure everybody who comes here is going to contribute, \\nand they are good people. Unless we can all stand together--and the \\nmost important thing is they are coming here because they want to be \\nAmericans, like almost all the legal immigrants who come here, people \\nwho want to be Americans, and we will open our arms, as we have, and as \\nRepublicans who are opposed to illegal immigration have said over and \\nover again.\\n  Well, I have proposed H.R. 2724, and I call on President Trump to pay \\nattention to this. I call all of my colleagues to pay attention to \\nthis. I urge my colleagues to take a look at that legislation. That \\nwill offer us the financial resources we need to bolster our borders, \\nto make sure that there is a wall, but, also, to make sure that we are \\nnot bringing into this country people who are associated with radical \\nIslamic fanaticism that would do us harm.\\n  I am asking my colleagues to look at that legislation. I am asking \\nanyone who is reading the Congressional Record or listening to this, \\nperhaps, to talk to their Congressman on this issue.\\n  Now, in the past 2 weeks, we have been provided information on \\nanother issue that I would like to bring up. Mr. Speaker, may I ask how \\nmuch time I have left.\", u'turn': 1, u'speaker': u'Mr. ROHRABACHER', u'itemno': 3}, {u'kind': u'speech', u'speaker_bioguide': None, u'text': u'  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Mr. Speaker, I will try to bring up something that \\nwe have heard, and we need to discuss this as Americans, because it \\nalso is about a very major flaw in our system that is apparent, things \\nthat have been not right for the last 2 years.\\n  In the past 2 weeks, however, information has been provided to the \\nAmerican people that has exposed the hypocrisy and misinformation, \\nforced down our throats, for months concerning the allegation that \\nPresident Trump colluded with the Russians in order to steal the last \\nelection. Over and over again, fake news filled the airwaves and, of \\ncourse, the newspapers, suggesting that there was a sinister plot that \\nkept Hillary from becoming President of the United States.\\n  The core accusation was the Russians had hacked into the Democratic \\nNational Committee computers. Emails between the Democratic leaders \\nwere taken and handed over to Julian Assange, who is the head of \\nWikiLeaks, and that they were released to the public by WikiLeaks.\\n  The skulduggery of the Democrat leadership and the Clinton campaign \\nwas, thus, exposed by these emails. Yes, that exposure to this \\nskulduggery and this unconscionable activity between the Clinton \\nleadership, and also the Democratic Party leadership, these emails, \\nyes, did have an impact on the election, as many Democrats who \\nsupported Bernie Sanders felt that they had been cheated by their own \\nparty because the proof was being offered to them by these WikiLeaks \\nemails that had been taken from the Democratic National Committee.\\n  Now, we heard over and over again that Trump stole the election \\nbecause he was in collusion with the Russians. The lib-left media, \\nwhich is most of them, found every which way, any little thing that any \\nmember of the Trump team did, as sinister proof that there was \\ncollusion with the Russians, thus, they stole the election. Well, it \\nwas pounded into our heads month after month, even after the election \\nwas over.\\n  But Hillary didn't lose that. That is what we are being told. Hillary \\nlost the election. She didn't want us to believe that it was because \\nshe was a rotten candidate running on a miserable track record and a \\nplatform that undermined her own candidacy, but, instead, she lost \\nbecause the GOP had subterfuge and treachery in which they were working \\nwith Russians, who helped them out to accomplish this horrible crime of \\nstealing the election.\\n  Well, this negative media barrage and this continued attack on \\nPresident Trump did not stop when the election was over. It went on for \\nmonths and months. Everybody should remember that. Month after month \\nafter the election, in what appeared to be, in my point of view, an \\neffort to disrupt our new President's authority and to exercise powers \\ngranted to him by the American voters, that was going to be disrupted, \\nso he could not become a regular President of the United States, as our \\nelection process had determined. Talk about not being loyal to the \\nAmerican way of life.\\n  After months of these obstructionist tactics, the American people are \\nnow learning the whole truth. They are learning that the attack on \\nTrump was\\n\\n\\na total fraud, a power grab by those who lost the election, and an \\nattempt to distract the American people from this wrongdoing.\\n  First and foremost, let's make it clear: the Russians did not hack \\ninto and steal the Democratic National Committee's emails. In terms of \\nthe collusion with the Russians, it is now coming to light there are \\nfar worse things. But the stealing of those emails and then making them \\npublic--and, by the way, they were just making public honest emails. We \\nare not talking about giving the public false information. We are \\ntalking about giving them information the Democrats didn't want them to \\nhave.\\n  But in terms of collusion with the Russians, what is coming to light \\nis that the Clinton Foundation--so these other charges that we have \\nheard about President Trump may be something to distract us about \\nsomething that was being done that was wrong and, of a similar light, \\nthat was wrong and being done by Hillary Clinton and her family.\\n  In terms of collusion with the Russians, it has come to light that \\nthe Clinton Foundation collected more than or around $150 million from \\nRussian oligarchs that Clinton felt was deposited right into the \\nClinton Foundation coffers. These oligarchs then deposited $500,000 \\nright into the Clinton family's pockets for a speech. Yeah, they are \\ngoing to give them a speaker's fee of $500,000 for one speech. All of \\nthis was happening when Hillary was Secretary of State. It was also \\nhappening when our government was making a decision as to whether they \\nshould sell 20 percent of America's uranium reserves to Russia. Why we \\nwould never seriously consider that, I don't know.\\n  But in my research, I have found evidence that, because that did not \\nseem right, the FBI had an informant watching all of this go down, \\nclose up, right there in Russia--an informant. Instead of charging \\nHillary with a crime, which was not done by the FBI, a gag order was \\nplaced on this witness who was working as an informer for the FBI.\\n  That gag order at the time, who put it on this witness?\\n  Well, it was the head of the FBI.\\n  Who was the head of the FBI?\\n  Robert Mueller. That gag order was kept on by Mueller, the gag order \\non the informant that had this information about the negotiations for \\ncontributions to the Clinton fund of $150 million. This guy was kept, \\nand a gag order, all of this time, even while Mueller was head of the \\nFBI. This is the same Mueller who is now the special prosecutor trying \\nto find anything to charge Trump with collusion with the Russians.\\n  That gag order over the witness implicating Hillary was not lifted \\nuntil last week, when some of us stepped up and said: We have to have a \\npublic hearing on this and we need to make sure--not a public hearing \\non any type of negative or, let's say, illegal collusion with the \\nRussian Government by any American politician, which would have \\nincluded Hillary, of course, and will include Hillary and anybody else \\nwho colluded with them.\\n\\n  Yes, I know, that I have advanced the idea of cooperating with the \\nRussians, so this may seem out of place. But I have always felt \\nwhatever we do with the Russians needs to be what is in the interest of \\nthe people of the United States. Certainly giving away 20 percent of \\nAmerica's uranium reserves, and then gagging one of the witnesses to \\nthe discussions that were taking place at the time when, at the same \\ntime, oligarchs in Russia were providing the Clintons with $150 million \\ndonation to their foundation, and a $500,000 donation right into the \\npersonal pockets of Bill Clinton.\\n  Now, we need to move forward on this. As we know, the special \\nprosecutor, Mr. Mueller, who kept the gag order on this witness, who \\ndidn't charge Hillary in the beginning, now has found someone to \\nindict. Paul Manafort has been indicted.\\n  Isn't this interesting?\\n  Our special prosecutor was tasked with trying to see if there was \\nRussian collusion in the last election between the Trump people and the \\nRussians in order to steal the election. And what did he come up with?\\n  Basically, tax evasion by Paul Manafort, who is a longtime politico \\nin this city.\\n  And guess what. The tax evasion he is being charged with happened \\nlong before Paul Manafort had anything to do with Donald Trump. That is \\nwrong. That is wrong. There is something really wrong there. We need to \\nget a new special prosecutor or whatever. We need to have these \\nhearings. Our Republicans need to get tough and we need to make sure \\nthat we are seeking out this information and documenting it.\\n  For example, putting the people under oath. There were a group of \\npeople--policymakers--who made the decision of whether or not to sell \\nthat uranium to the Russians. They need to be put under oath and asked \\nwhether or not anyone representing the Clintons ever talked to them \\nduring that process and encouraged them for this deal of selling the \\nRussians this uranium.\\n  There are all kinds of avenues that we need to follow through on. \\nInstead, Mr. Mueller ends up with some kind of a tax violation by one \\nof the players that happened long before he was even associated with \\nDonald Trump.\\n  Something has gone haywire here. The American people need to see it. \\nEspecially when we understand now there is also evidence that during \\nthat election, the Clinton campaign paid Russian sources--it went \\nthrough an intermediary. He was an English intelligence officer--paid \\nmillions of dollars to the Russians to get a scurrilous false report \\nand video, or tape, or whatever it was, of President Trump in some type \\nof compromising situation.\\n  But we know now that was false and that Hillary Clinton's campaign \\nand these people talking about collusion with the Russians were paying, \\nessentially, the Russians to give them this information.\\n  Now, I would hope that this comes out and this becomes something that \\nis explained and the American people understand. When they see this \\nattack on our President by people who have a totally different view of \\nhow we should be in the world--remember, our last President could not \\nsay the words ``radical Islamic terrorist.'' He had a different \\napproach than Hillary, the Secretary of State. We know what happened in \\nBenghazi and elsewhere. We have a totally different approach to these \\nchallenges America faces overseas. It is all right.\\n  President Obama was elected. Hillary was not elected. President Trump \\nwas elected. These efforts to undermine his authority are the worst \\nkind of repudiation of the American way of life and the American system \\nof government. We Americans must stand firm against radical Islam. We \\nmust stand firm and offer an alternative of strength and courage, as \\ncompared to the cowardice and nonsense that we have seen in the \\npolicies of the last 8 years.\\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\\n\", u'turn': 3, u'speaker': u'Mr. ROHRABACHER', u'itemno': 5}, {u'kind': u'linebreak', u'speaker_bioguide': None, u'text': u'                          ____________________\\n\\n\\n', u'turn': -1, u'speaker': u'None', u'itemno': 6}], u'header': {u'extension': False, u'vol': u'163', u'wkday': u'Thursday', u'chamber': u'House', u'num': u'178', u'year': u'2017', u'month': u'November', u'pages': u'H8438-H8440', u'day': u'2'}, u'related_bills': [{u'type': u'HR', u'congress': u'115', u'context': u'OTHER', u'number': u'2724'}], u'doc_title': u'ISSUES OF CONCERN', u'id': u'CREC-2017-11-02-pt1-PgH8438'}{u'content': [{u'text': u'  Pastor Kenneth Codner, Grace Baptist Church, Bellefonte, \\nPennsylvania, offered the following prayer:\\n  Heavenly Father, I am humbled to be able to stand before You on \\nbehalf of this assembly here today.\\n  Lord, we are sinners, deserving none of Your favor.

This proposal is a tax increase on \\nmiddle class families, and I oppose it.

LCNV \\nserves low-literacy and limited English language proficient adults with \\na selection of low-cost, moderately intensive courses to help them \\ntransition into the workforce or other educational opportunities. LCNV \\nprovides the crucial first steps of language and literacy learning for \\nworkplace, citizenship, and community integration to help adults make \\nmeasurable improvements in their lives.\\n  Each year LCNV gathers at its Annandale headquarters to recognize \\nstudents and members of the community who have achieved exceptional \\nmilestones. I am proud to include in the Record the following 2017 LCNV \\nhonorees.\\n  Community Partnership Awards: Accenture Consulting, Crestwood \\nElementary School, Paul M. Engell Family Foundation.\\n  Volunteers of the Year: Liz Castillo, Alexandra Roncal, Valerie \\nSutter.\\n  I would also like to give special recognition to Patricia Donnelly, \\nwho is retiring from her role as Executive Director of LCNV after \\nleading the organization for more than 15 years. She has three decades \\nof experience in the nonprofit sector, most of which has been in \\neducation and the performing arts. In addition to her role as Executive \\nDirector of LCNV, Patti serves on the Board of the Virginia Literacy \\nFoundation, the Virginia Adult and Continuing Education Board and \\nWETA's Community Advisory Council.

Mr. Speaker, House Resolution 601 provides for the \\nconsideration of a critical bill to provide health insurance and \\nhealthcare to millions of underprivileged children. This package, which \\nincludes two separate bills: H.R. 3922, the Community Health And \\nMedical Professional Improves Our Nation, CHAMPION, Act of 2017; and \\nH.R. 3921, the Healthy Kids Act. This was reported out of the Committee \\non Energy and Commerce after lengthy deliberation and negotiation and a \\nlengthy markup.\\n  The rule provides for 1 hour of debate, equally divided and \\ncontrolled by the chair and the ranking member of the Committee on \\nEnergy and Commerce.\\n  The rule adopts an amendment from the chairman of the Energy and \\nCommerce Committee, modified by a second amendment by the same author, \\ncombining the two bills into the package on the floor today.\\n  Further, the rule waives all points of order and makes in order no \\nfurther amendments to the legislation. However, the minority is \\nafforded the customary motion to recommit.\\n  The congressionally appropriated stream of funding for the Children's \\nHealth Insurance Program expired at the end of September. Funding for \\nother important public health programs, such as community health \\ncenters, the National Health Service Corps, and Teaching Health Center \\nGraduate Medical Education, also expired at the end of September.\\n  While every State that receives Federal funding through these \\nprograms continues to have adequate dollars to maintain health \\ninsurance for every enrolled child, several States are beginning to \\nexhaust their unspent 2017 funds and redistributed funds from the \\nCenter for Medicare and Medicaid Services. With November now upon us, \\nwaiting any longer will only put more\\n\\n\\npressure on those States to begin sending notifications to children and \\nfamilies that they are losing their coverage for those programs; so it \\nis important that we reauthorize funding for the Children's Health \\nInsurance Program and other programs now.\\n  H.R. 3922, the CHAMPIONING HEALTHY KIDS Act, will achieve that \\nimportant task. It is essential to our efforts to ensuring that these \\nprograms continue to meet the healthcare needs of children and families \\nwho have come to rely upon them.\\n  Today, more than 8 million low-income children across our country \\ndepend on the Children's Health Insurance Program for many of their \\nhealthcare services. These include routine doctor visits, \\nimmunizations, prescription medicines, and dental care. Through \\nflexible, capped allotments to the States, the program has been able to \\nsuccessfully support these children, while providing States with \\nopportunities to tailor their respective programs as best meet the \\nneeds of their respective populations.\\n  The CHAMPIONING HEALTHY KIDS Act would extend CHIP for another 5 \\nyears, which is the longest extension since its inception in 1996. An \\nextension through fiscal year 2022 will provide financial stability for \\nevery State's CHIP program and certainty for those children and their \\nfamilies who are covered. Additionally, ensuring coverage for CHIP-\\neligible children will make them less likely to have to enroll in \\nMedicaid or ObamaCare.\\n  This bill also contains and maintains a provision under the \\nAffordable Care Act that provided 23 percent increased matching for 2 \\nyears; then that draws down to an increase of 11.5 percent matching in \\nthe third year; and then, finally, provides funding at pre-ACA levels \\nfor the final 2 years.\\n  These funding levels will provide the States enough time to plan \\ntheir budgets before returning to the regular CHIP matching rates, \\nthereby restoring the fiscally responsible Federal-State Medicaid \\npartnership.\\n  While reauthorizing CHIP funding is the primary focal point of this \\nlegislation, the CHAMPIONING HEALTHY KIDS Act also includes other \\nimportant provisions relating to our Nation's healthcare. The bill \\nprovides a 2-year extension of funding for Federally Qualified Health \\nCenters, community health centers.\\n  One in thirteen individuals nationwide relies upon a community health \\ncenter to receive healthcare services. The Community Health Center Fund \\nplays an important role in supplementing the services that Federally \\nQualified Health Centers are able to deliver to underserved communities \\nby providing care to all Americans, regardless of income or ability to \\npay.\\n  Funding for the Teaching Health Center Graduate Medical Education \\nprogram is also extended for another 2 years.\\n  The legislation includes a 2-year extension of other important health \\nprograms, including funding for the National Health Service Corps, \\nFamily-to-Family Health Information Centers, the Youth Empowerment \\nProgram, the Personal Responsibility Education Program, the Special \\nDiabetes Program for Type 1 Diabetes, and the Special Diabetes Program \\nfor American Indians.\\n  In addition to the important funding streams addressed in this bill, \\nthe Committee on Energy and Commerce incorporated a way to help our \\nNation's territories in a time of need following recent natural \\ndisasters. The bill includes more than $1 billion for the Medicaid \\nprograms in both Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. This funding \\nshould assist our territories in providing care for their populations \\nwho have faced substantial devastation from Hurricanes Irma and Maria.\\n  The Medicare funding issue is unique to Puerto Rico and the United \\nStates citizens living in the territories. This was a problem that \\npredated the hurricanes, but it was exacerbated by the devastation that \\nthe storm brought to the islands. Without a legislative fix from \\nCongress, this will be an ongoing and festering problem until it is \\nproperly addressed, and the bill before us today begins to do just \\nthat.\\n\\n\\n  Additionally, the bill delays the $5 billion in cuts to many of the \\nhospitals across the country from the Affordable Care Act-mandated \\nMedicaid disproportionate share hospital reductions for fiscal years \\n2018 and 2019. I am sure that many of my colleagues have heard from \\nhospitals in their districts whose ability to remain operational and to \\ncontinue to provide care could be jeopardized by these payment cuts.\\n  These cuts are offset in future years, adding an additional $6 \\nbillion in reductions in fiscal year 2021, 2022, and 2023. This delays \\nbut does not fix a problem that ObamaCare created for safety net \\nhospitals. It is one which we will have to revisit, but it delays the \\ncuts that have already been affected by current law and protects these \\nsafety net hospitals which provide care to the neediest citizens in our \\ncountry.\\n  Not only does the CHAMPIONING HEALTHY KIDS Act reauthorize funding \\nfor essential health programs, the bill is fully offset. It will not \\nadd to the national debt. The Committee for a Responsible Federal \\nBudget called this a ``responsible health package,'' noting that the \\n$18 billion cost of the bill is fully offset with savings beyond the \\n10-year budget window.\\n  One of the ways that costs are offset was to alter the qualified \\nhealth plan grace period so that it would align with State law grace \\nperiod requirements. This involved changing, in the Affordable Care \\nAct, the grace period for subsidized individuals from 90 days to 30 \\ndays unless a State specifically allows otherwise.\\n  It also redirected $6.4 million from the Prevention and Public Health \\nFund to help pay for the legislation. This fund is required by law to \\nreceive $2.5 billion in annual appropriations which must be used for \\nprevention, wellness, and public health initiatives administered by the \\nDepartment of Health and Human Services. If Congress--let me say it \\nagain--if Congress does not direct these funds toward specific efforts, \\nthe Secretary of Health and Human Services has the authority to spend \\nthe funds however he or she deems fit.\\n  While we are redirecting these taxpayer dollars, the overarching \\npurpose of the funding is still to improve the health and wellness of \\nAmericans through existing mechanisms, and community health centers \\nwill do just that.\\n  We allow for certain wealthy Medicare beneficiaries with individual \\nincomes of over $500,000 to pay increased premiums in order to offset \\nsome of the cost of authorizing these programs. These beneficiaries \\nwill be subject to higher premiums, thereby increasing their overall \\ncost, but still their cost will be lower than if they purchased \\ninsurance on the exchange.\\n  The CHAMPIONING HEALTHY KIDS Act is a fiscally responsible way to \\nfund some of our Nation's most important public health programs. The \\nbill would ensure continued access to care for children and individuals \\nwho rely on the programs for vital healthcare services.\\n  Mr. Speaker, this is a good bill. Mr. Speaker, these offsets are \\nreasonable. For these reasons, I encourage my colleagues to support \\ntoday's rule and support the underlying bill, and I reserve the balance \\nof my time.\", u'turn': 5, u'speaker': u'Mr. BURGESS', u'itemno': 9}, {u'kind': u'speech', u'speaker_bioguide': u'S000480', u'text': u\"  Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \\nconsume, and I thank the gentleman for yielding me the customary 30 \\nminutes.\\n  Mr. Speaker, 33 days ago, funding for the Children's Health Insurance \\nProgram, which 9 million children rely on for their healthcare and \\nwell-being, expired after the program was allowed to lapse. States \\ncrafted budgets, assuming Federal CHIP funding would arrive on time as \\nit has always done, and they are now scrambling to develop a patchwork \\nsolution to keep the program alive.\\n  Six States and the District of Columbia have warned they will run out \\nof funding by December, next month. Thirteen States say they will soon \\nhave to tell enrollees they could lose coverage without immediate \\ncongressional action. Utah officials have even considered sending \\nletters to enrollees as early as this week letting them know the \\nprogram is being forced to wind down.\\n  The Kaiser Family Foundation has found that 32 States are expected to \\nrun out of funding by March if Congress fails to act. I am glad we are \\nhere today with a bill to reauthorize CHIP and other public health \\nprograms, but they are woefully inadequate.\\n  This bill is paid for by eviscerating funding from one of the most \\nimportant parts, again, of the Affordable\\n\\n\\nCare Act that helps to keep people well: the Prevention Fund. This fund \\nfocuses on children's health, expanding access to lifesaving vaccines \\nand reducing the risk of lead poisoning, among many other things.\\n  This is a particularly heartless cut when you consider that many \\nresidents of Flint, Michigan, still can't get a clean glass of water \\nfrom the faucet or bathe in uncontaminated water 3 years after the \\nwater crisis began. Children there in Flint will be forced to live for \\nthe rest of their lives with impacts ranging from neurodevelopmental \\ndamage and behavioral changes to hypertension and anemia, damage caused \\nby a government that failed to act.\\n  If it fails to adequately fund Medicaid for Puerto Rico and the U.S. \\nVirgin Islands as they continue to try to rebuild following the \\ndevastating recent hurricanes, that would be a compounding of the \\ntragedy. This bill fails to waive the requirement that both of those \\nislands match Federal investment before they can access any of the \\nMedicaid funding, and we don't deal with that at all, even for CHIP.\\n  Seventy percent of Puerto Rico doesn't even have power 6 weeks after \\nHurricane Maria hit. I am proud to say that a lot of New York utility \\nworkers are down there now, and I am sure we will see results soon. \\nResidents of Puerto Rico are washing clothes and bathing in \\ncontaminated streams and rivers, and drinking it as well. A million \\npeople there still don't have any running water. They don't have the \\nability to put up millions of dollars, either, to match these funds \\nbecause they are struggling to survive. We don't address that. These \\nare American citizens, and we have an obligation to help them.\\n  These reauthorizations are a chance to really work together and \\ndeliver, but we are worried about this opportunity because there is no \\nindication that this bill could pass the Senate with the cuts that it \\nhas made to the Affordable Care Act. I am referring, of course, to the \\nones that relate to preventive care. That would be a major tragedy.\\n\\n  As I have already said, so many States are right at the edge of not \\nbeing able to fund the program at all. Other States are ready to tell \\nboth community health services and CHIP that they are no longer \\nproviding for them.\\n  This partisan approach will only delay the extension of the programs \\neven further. I consider that a major dereliction of our duties.\\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time\", u'turn': 6, u'speaker': u'Ms. SLAUGHTER', u'itemno': 10}, {u'kind': u'speech', u'speaker_bioguide': u'B001248', u'text': u\"  Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 30 seconds in response \\nbefore yielding to the chairman of the Rules Committee.\\n  It pains me to hear people talk about the 33-day delay in getting \\nSCHIP funding resubmitted. I just want to assure the House of \\nRepresentatives that Republicans on the Subcommittee of Health in the \\nEnergy and Commerce Committee have been ready to go with this \\nlegislation. We did our legislative hearings early in the summer, as \\nthe gentleman will recall because he was there, and we were ready for \\nour markup in the month of September.\\n  Why was it delayed? Let me reference an article from CQ News, October \\n23, 2017: ``Democrats do not want a children's health insurance bill to \\ncome to the floor this week for a vote, said Frank Pallone, Jr., \\nranking member of the House Energy and Commerce Committee at a district \\nevent. . . .''\\n  `` `The idea is to not have the bill come to the floor this week,' \\nsaid Pallone. . . .''\\n  I include in the Record a copy of the CQ News article.\\n\\n                     [From CQ News, Oct. 23, 2017]\\n\\n          House Democrats Push To Delay Children's Health Vote\\n\\n                           (By Sandhya Raman)\\n\\n       Democrats do not want a children's health insurance program \\n     bill to come to the floor this week for a vote, said Frank \\n     Pallone Jr., ranking member of the House Energy and Commerce \\n     Committee at a district event broadcast on Facebook Live on \\n     Monday.\\n       ``The idea is to not have the bill come to the floor this \\n     week,'' said Pallone, emphasizing that Democrats still want \\n     to find a bipartisan compromise and will not accept the \\n     changes to Medicare or Medicaid that Republicans want to use \\n     to fund the coverage. He later added, ``This is supposed to \\n     come up Thursday. Hopefully, it won't.''\\n       Pallone suggested that the process could be lengthy if the \\n     House passes a partisan bill and the Senate does not act \\n     quickly to pass their bipartisan measure. The two likely \\n     would have to be reconciled through conference negotiations.\\n       ``We're going to just delay this for months, and the end \\n     result could be we don't deal with this until the end of the \\n     year,'' said Pallone, speaking at a community health center.\\n       Democrats disagree with the offsets in House bills to \\n     reauthorize CHIP (HR 3921) and community health centers and \\n     other safety net programs (HR 3922). The CHIP bill's offsets \\n     include increasing premiums for Medicare recipients with \\n     income over $500,000 a year and limiting Medicaid benefits \\n     for lottery winners. In addition, Democrats take issue with \\n     an offset that would bill other insurance before Medicaid for \\n     recipients who use more than one form of coverage.\\n       The offsets for the community health centers include \\n     changes to undermine the 2010 health care law (PL 111-148, PL \\n     111-152) including cutting almost $6.4 billion from the \\n     Prevention and Public Health Fund over 10 years. Republicans \\n     also would allow states to create their own grace periods for \\n     individuals on the exchanges to pay their premiums or use a \\n     default one-month grace period. The current grace period is \\n     three months.\\n       ``If you miss it and you don't pay it, you can't get your \\n     insurance. You've got to re-enroll for the next year,'' \\n     Pallone said about the grace period.\\n       ``The problem is that they haven't been willing to give \\n     much on taking this money from the Affordable Care Act or \\n     Medicare, but why do they even have to come out of health \\n     care at all? Why can't we use another vehicle to pay for \\n     it?'' said Pallone, adding, ``Part of that could be cut back \\n     significantly.''\\n       Democrats also object to the way Puerto Rico's Medicaid \\n     funding in the CHIP bill would be addressed.\\n       ``They're still requiring a state match from Puerto Rico,'' \\n     said Pallone. ``The bill funds a little bit, but it's totally \\n     worthless if Puerto Rico has to come up with the match.''\\n       The island does not have money to contribute, Democrats \\n     say.\\n       Earlier this month, Committee Chairman Greg Walden of \\n     Oregon asked his Democratic colleagues to suggest offsets \\n     that may be more amenable than those currently in the bill \\n     that the committee passed. Last week, Walden said in a \\n     statement that he had not received any Democratic offers.\\n       Democrats contend they have put suggestions on the table.\\n       One idea would require drug companies to help seniors \\n     better afford their prescriptions by closing a funding gap, \\n     known as the ``doughnut hole,'' in Medicare coverage. \\n     Currently, seniors have to pick up more costs after a certain \\n     spending threshold until they hit another limit when Medicare \\n     resumes paying for coverage.\\n       ``We've been making offers back. One of the things we said \\n     is make the drug companies pay for the doughnut hole. We \\n     still have a doughnut hole for Medicare Part D. So if they \\n     pay for the cost of that, that could be used as a payfor,'' \\n     said Pallone.\\n       ``This bill that may go to the floor next week is going \\n     nowhere,'' said Pallone, stating that it would ``be a totally \\n     partisan vote.''\\n       Federal funding for CHIP expired Sept. 30. The Centers for \\n     Medicare and Medicaid Services has redistributed unused CHIP \\n     funds to nine states and territories including Arizona, \\n     California, Minnesota, Washington, American Samoa, Guam, \\n     Northern Mariana Islands, U.S. Virgin Islands and Oregon.

Mr. Speaker, I really appreciate the distinguished \\ngentleman from Lewisville, Texas, Dr. Michael Burgess, who serves \\nseveral roles in this House of Representatives. First of all, he is \\nchairman of the Subcommittee on Health for the Energy and Commerce \\nCommittee--actually, his favorite committee--and then his duties at the \\nRules Committee, and Mike has spent a good number of years in service \\nto the entire body. I want to thank Dr. Burgess for his personally \\nhandling not only this matter, but bringing to Congress a really strong \\nattitude that he has about children.\\n  Dr. Burgess, for a number of years since his early days in Parkland \\nHospital in Dallas, Texas, as a resident and then becoming an \\nobstetrician-gynecologist who served not only the Dallas area, \\nthousands of people, but he brought to that a love of children, women, \\nand families to give precious life to the United States of America, I \\nwant to thank him for his healthy child bill that he brought to the \\nEnergy and Commerce Committee.\\n  Mr. Speaker, let me say this. The gentlewoman from New York, the \\nranking member of the Rules Committee, and the entire committee \\nyesterday spent a great deal of time not only looking at this \\nparticular bill, but other very germane issues related to healthcare. \\nMy colleagues, including\\n\\n\\nthe gentlewoman from New York, really have the best heart in this. I \\nbelieve this is an issue where we agree. We agree that children's \\nhealth is not only an important part of what Congress should be \\ninvolved in but, actually, resolving the issues.\\n  She is very correct. Several weeks ago it was brought up in the Rules \\nCommittee the timeliness of this issue, the appropriateness of the \\nRules Committee handling this bill to get it to the floor so that we \\nwould allow not only the American people to understand what we were \\ndoing, but, really, to put it in play so that this could be handled by \\nthe United States Senate and the President.\\n  I want to congratulate my colleagues. I think that my colleagues, to \\na person, understand the importance of this--and certainly Mike \\nBurgess' leadership at Energy and Commerce Committee--but also the \\nRules Committee. So reauthorizing the Children's Health Insurance \\nProgram, or CHIP, as it is known, is vitally important. It is important \\nbecause there are some 400,000 children in Texas, alone, where Chairman \\nBurgess and I live.\\n  We see not only families, but we see the healthcare community. We see \\nother elected officials and just normal people at home who expect us to \\nget our work done. We are today. In fact, we are not only getting it \\ndone, but, as Chairman Burgess has talked about and even as the \\ngentlewoman, Ms. Slaughter, has talked about, there will be States at \\nthe end of November that will be running on fumes, be running on empty, \\nand a good number of States are funded until probably February or \\nMarch. But that is not a reason for us to delay.\\n  So we are here, respectfully, to ask the entire body, Republicans and \\nDemocrats, and also to let the American people know that the Children's \\nHealth Insurance Program, through the efforts of Mike Burgess and \\nthrough the efforts of Greg Walden as chairman of the committee, who \\nhave worked very diligently to make sure that it not only comes to the \\nfloor, but that the new nuances of the bill that will include many, \\nmany good bipartisan ideas will be offset, and it will be offset. We \\nare going to have to make sure as we move forward that those are \\ncareful instructions that we all understand.\\n  But the bottom line to this is, Mr. Speaker, this Congress, because \\nof the bipartisanship, because of the ability, because of the \\nimportance of CHIP, is handling this today.\\n  We are going to ask all Members if they did not have a chance to see \\nwhat I thought was a robust, distinguished panel that came to us \\nyesterday to talk about this, but also the thoughtful ideas from our \\nMembers about the importance of this, I think we can convince this \\nbody--this body, Republicans and Democrats--that the underlying \\nlegislation helps secure for 5 more years--which is what the goal was, \\n5 more years--to make sure that we can move forward; and it gives \\nStates the authority and the responsibility, gives the American people \\nconfidence that what we are doing to take care of this issue has not \\nonly been done, but presented in such a way that it will be successful.\\n  That is our job, Mr. Speaker. Our job is to take the work that comes \\nfrom the committee of jurisdiction--in this case, the Energy and \\nCommerce Committee--and move that through, look at it, vet it, and make \\nsure the best ideas happen.

For months, House \\nRepublicans have delayed action to fund CHIP and community health \\ncenters. These programs are critical in our communities and cannot \\nsurvive without this funding.\\n\\n\\n  They have always been bipartisan, but, unfortunately, the bill before \\nus today is not. Instead of working with us, Republicans have focused \\non TrumpCare and sabotaged the ACA. Now they have put forward this bill \\nfull of poison pills that will only further delay funding these \\ncritical public health programs, and to turn what has been \\ntraditionally a bipartisan process into a political game does a \\ndisservice to families.\\n  H.R. 3922 eliminates the ACA's Prevention and Public Health Fund \\nwhich helps people in my district and other districts get vaccines, \\nprevent diabetes, and combat heart disease. The reason we put the \\npreservation fund in the ACA in the first place was to reorient our \\nhealth system towards prevention, which ultimately saves money and \\nkeeps people healthier.\\n  We all want to ensure kids have the insurance that they need to \\naccess affordable care, but slashing benefits that will in the long \\nterm hurt the very children and families that CHIP and the community \\nhealth centers help, as this bill does, is the wrong way to go. Through \\nits cuts to the Prevention Fund, this legislation is another attempt by \\nRepublicans to undermine the ACA.\\n  Unfortunately, this is just one of many acts of sabotage that we have \\nseen over the last year from the Trump administration and congressional \\nRepublicans.\\n  On top of these attacks on the Affordable Care Act, H.R. 3922 creates \\na false choice between helping seniors and helping kids. This \\nlegislation makes changes to Medicare that will hurt all seniors' \\nbenefits in the long term.\\n  Democrats have offered solutions that would pay for funding CHIP and \\ncommunity health centers in a way that doesn't rob Peter to pay Paul. I \\nsupport the substitute amendment offered by Ranking Member Pallone \\nwhich would do just that.\\n  Mr. Speaker, I am extremely disappointed that the Republicans have \\nchosen this partisan path for programs that are so dear to our \\ncommunities, and I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on H.R. 3922 and \\nto support the Democratic substitute.\", u'turn': 11, u'speaker': u'Ms. MATSUI', u'itemno': 15}, {u'kind': u'speech', u'speaker_bioguide': u'B001248', u'text': u\"  Mr. BURGESS.

Mr. Speaker, I rise to voice my opposition to this rule \\nand to the underlying bill.\\n  First, by the way, my colleague from California (Ms. Matsui) talked \\nabout the Democratic substitute. But let's be clear, it is our \\nRepublican colleagues, the majority, who would not make a Democratic \\nsubstitute in order that would allow us to come here to have a debate \\non their proposal and what we proposed. How about that for democracy in \\nthe United States House of Representatives? No Democratic substitute.\\n  So let's leave that aside and focus on what we have here today. \\nAgain, opposed to the rule, opposed to the bill.\\n  The Children's Health Insurance Program is vital for millions of our \\nNation's most vulnerable citizens--our children. The gentleman before \\nspoke about 9 million children. Yes. But do you know how long we have \\nwaited for the majority to reauthorize the Children's Health Insurance \\nProgram? The length of time is shameful. But even more shameful is how \\nthe majority intends to pay for the Children's Health Insurance \\nProgram.\\n  This is what the bill does. The bill includes massive cuts to \\nsomething called the Prevention and Public Health Fund. What is the \\nPrevention and Public Health Fund? It is inclusive of many of the \\nprograms that we rely on in order to save lives.\\n  Yes. They are the programs that go to help our community health \\ncenters be able to treat people who come to their door. Twenty-three \\nmillion people in the United States use community health centers. It is \\noften their primary care.\\n\\n  But let me lay out for you what some of these programs are: the \\nCenters for Disease Control childhood vaccines--vaccinations and \\nimmunizations for our kids being cut--lead poisoning prevention. You go \\nto any community in this country, and they will tell you whether it is \\nwater or whether it is paint. Some of our children have the highest \\nlevels of lead, and what we need to be doing is screening them at a \\nvery early age so that we can address the issue. They cut this out, \\nalso the Centers for Disease Control heart disease program, stroke and \\ndiabetes programs, breastfeeding grants for hospitals, childhood \\nobesity prevention, and suicide prevention. We are looking today at an \\nopioid crisis in this Nation that so often results in suicides, and \\nthey are willing to cut the heart out of the Prevention Fund programs \\nto fund the Children's Health Insurance Program.\\n  So we are harming children at one end of the spectrum and robbing the \\nmoney from that end of the spectrum to pay for the Children's Health \\nInsurance Program, which I am a big supporter of. So we are stealing \\nfrom this prevention program.\\n  Now today, my Republican colleagues have offered a tax cut proposal. \\nTake a hard look at it because the richest, the wealthiest, and those \\nwith the most lobbyists are the biggest beneficiaries of these tax \\ncuts, and middle class working families will get the short end of the \\nstick. Those people who make over $1 million--several million dollars--\\nare going to get the benefit of the tax cut. Why aren't we taking that \\nmoney and paying to reauthorize the Children's Health Insurance Program \\nrather than taking the money from the Prevention and Public Health \\nFund?\\n  So instead of providing tax cuts today for the richest 1 percent of \\nAmericans, we could have a strong Children's Health Insurance Program, \\nand we could have a strong Prevention and Public Health Fund that does \\nnot have to make these egregious cuts.\\n  I think there is one more point that people need to know about this \\nbill. The bill cuts something that was in the Affordable Care Act--the \\ngrace period. They cut that back to 30 days. That means if someone \\nmisses one health insurance payment, they can lose their insurance for \\nthe remainder of the year.\\n  Today, our biggest economic challenge as a nation is that people are \\nin jobs that just don't pay them enough to live on. They can't afford \\ntheir healthcare.

Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for yielding, and I rise \\nto extend my support for this rule and the underlying legislation.\\n  This legislation funds critical, bipartisan health programs that help \\nkeep our communities healthy.\\n  Mr. Speaker, I have long been a strong supporter of CHIP because I \\nhave seen it in action back in my home State of Alabama. I served on \\nthe Alabama State School Board back when Alabama implemented our CHIP \\nprogram, known as ALL Kids. ALL Kids was the first CHIP program in the \\ncountry, and it has made a real difference. In fact, the uninsurance \\nrate for children in Alabama has gone from 20 percent pre-CHIP to 2.4 \\npercent today.\\n  For 83,000 Alabama children under 19, the program offers low-cost, \\ncomprehensive healthcare coverage that includes regular checkups, \\nimmunizations, sick child doctor visits, prescriptions, vision care, \\ndental care, and much more.\\n  CHIP has always been a bipartisan program, and I hope this \\nreauthorization will earn bipartisan support for the children of \\nAmerica.\\n  This legislation also reauthorizes the community health centers fund. \\nI am a huge champion of community health centers because, again, I have \\nseen them work in Alabama from the Mostellar Medical Center in Bayou La \\nBatre to Franklin Primary Health in Mobile to Southwest Alabama Health \\nServices in McIntosh. These centers are vitally important to so many \\nAmericans, but especially to low-income families and those in rural \\nareas.\\n  One in 13 people nationwide rely on a health center for their \\nhealthcare needs, and this reauthorization is necessary to ensure those \\nindividuals continue to receive access to medical care.\\n  This legislation also includes many other healthcare provisions to \\nmeet other priorities. Among these provisions, I am pleased the \\nlegislation continues Medicaid disproportionate share hospital \\npayments, or DSH payments, as they are commonly known.\\n  DSH provides funding to hospitals that treat a large number of \\nindigent patients. DSH is absolutely critical to the life of Alabama's \\nhospitals, and failure to renew these important payments could result \\nin numerous hospital closures in our State.\\n  So, Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to \\nget behind this legislation and ensure it gets across the finish line. \\nWe should not let petty political arguments keep us from ensuring that \\nchildren have access to affordable health insurance, keeping the doors \\nopen at community health centers, or allowing Alabama's hospitals to \\ncontinue serving communities in need.\", u'turn': 20, u'speaker': u'Mr. BYRNE', u'itemno': 24}, {u'kind': u'speech', u'speaker_bioguide': u'S000480', u'text': u'  Ms. SLAUGHTER.

They didn't want to hear \\nanything about CHIP or community health centers, just repeal the \\nAffordable Care Act.\\n  My colleagues on the other side suggested that somehow, because of \\nCHIP, they are very concerned about kids. Well, the fact of the matter \\nis, if you repeal the Affordable Care Act, children--everyone--and \\ncommunity health centers would suffer such damage because they would \\nlose their health insurance or the underpinnings of the community \\nhealth centers, which have been financed with the Affordable Care Act, \\nthat any suggestion that somehow because you are concerned now about \\nCHIP or community health centers is belied by the fact that you spent \\nthe last 9 months, through September, trying to repeal the Affordable \\nCare Act. If you really cared about these things, then you would not \\nhave sought that repeal.\\n  Once that repeal seemed to be over in September, then the Republicans \\non the committee and the leadership were willing to talk about CHIP and \\ncommunity health centers. But mind you, the authorization for those two \\nprograms ended September 30. So it was literally too late.\\n  Now my colleagues on the other side say: Oh, well, we are bringing \\nthis bill up today because we really care about kids and community \\nhealth centers.\\n  Exactly the opposite. If you did care, in the sense that you wanted \\nto get legislation passed, then you wouldn't bring this bill up today. \\nWe all know that if the bill is not bipartisan, which it is not, it \\nwill never pass the Senate. What is going to happen is these bills will \\npass on a partisan vote on Friday and, as a consequence, they will go \\nto the Senate and there will be no action and we will have to deal with \\nthis at the end of the year as part of some larger omnibus spending \\nbill or whatever we do at the end of the year.\\n  So anyone who tells you that the Republicans, in trying to pass a \\npartisan bill, are actually moving forward on CHIP or on community \\nhealth centers, that is simply not true.\\n  Now, what are we facing here with these three bills? And I include \\nIPAB, CHIP, and community health centers. What we are really facing is \\nanother effort on the part of the Republican leadership to repeal or \\nsabotage the Affordable Care Act.\\n  All these things are part, in some fashion, of either pay-fors or \\nauthorization of the Affordable Care Act. The fact of the matter is, we \\nare now seeing what I would call piecemeal repeal.\\n  You couldn't repeal it outright, so you do a piecemeal repeal. You \\nrepeal IPAB. You basically use funding from the Prevention Fund and you \\ngut that so you can pay for the CHIP funding. You change the grace \\nperiod so something like half a million people lose their health \\ninsurance. Meanwhile, the President of the United States is out there \\nevery day issuing executive orders to get rid of cost-sharing subsidies \\nto cut back on the outreach program.\\n  If you look at all this, it is nothing more than a piecemeal repeal \\nof the Affordable Care Act. It is sabotaging the Affordable Care Act.\\n  This has not changed. The first 9 months to September, outright \\nrepeal. Now, between now and the end of the year, piecemeal repeal. \\nEvery day, a different bill.\\n  The real inconsistency, which is the best I can say about what is \\ngoing on, is to say that we have to come up with offsets to pay for the \\nChildren's Health Initiative Program and the community health centers, \\nbut we don't have to do it for IPAB. $17.5 million is what it is going \\nto cost, according to the CBO, to repeal IPAB. If you use that money, \\nit would almost pay for the CHIP and the community health centers bill \\nthat will be considered the next day.\\n  So, again, we have this total inconsistency suggesting that somehow \\nwe care about one thing. What is really go on is robbing Peter to pay \\nPaul. The way that you pay for the community health centers and the \\nCHIP bill, basically, sabotaging the Affordable Care Act, is you \\nshorten the grace period from 90 days to 30 days, when people, if they \\ndon't pay their premium, will lose their health insurance. We know that \\nmaybe almost 688,000 people, according to the CBO, will lose their \\nhealth insurance.\", u'turn': 22, u'speaker': u'Mr. PALLONE', u'itemno': 26}, {u'kind': u'speech', u'speaker_bioguide': None, u'text': u'  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. Foxx).

However, prevention, wellness, and public health \\nactivities are allowable, but no Prevention Fund-specific or generally \\napplicable definitions of these terms are to be found in the Public \\nHealth Service Act, the Affordable Care Act, or anywhere else in \\nFederal law.\\n  The Affordable Care Act was not accompanied by committee reports in \\neither Chamber. The Department of Health and Human Services has not \\npublished regulations, guidance, or other information to clarify the \\nDepartment's views about the types of activities that are within the \\nscope of the Prevention Fund.\\n\\n\\n  Annual mandatory appropriations, the Prevention Fund, continue in \\nperpetuity. If Congress does not explicitly allocate the funding, then \\nthe Secretary of HHS has the authority to spend these dollars without \\ncongressional oversight.\\n  This bill takes discretion over some of the--some, not all--some of \\nthe Prevention Fund dollars. It takes it away from the executive branch \\nand redirects these dollars to proven public health programs that enjoy \\nbroad bipartisan support in Congress like community health centers, a \\nprogram that employs 190,000 people and served over 24 million patients \\nin 2015.\\n  This has been supported in the past in other legislation, most \\nrecently in the Cures initiative, where Democrats and Republicans \\nsupported the redirecting of funding for the Prevention Fund for the \\nspecific purpose of preserving public health.\\n  Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\", u'turn': 39, u'speaker': u'Mr. BURGESS', u'itemno': 43}, {u'kind': u'speech', u'speaker_bioguide': u'S000480', u'text': u\"  Ms. SLAUGHTER. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \\nconsume.\\n  Madam Speaker, in May, the Republican majority recklessly passed \\ntheir healthcare repeal bill without any analysis at all from the \\nnonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, finding out a month later that \\nit would have taken insurance away from 23 million people.\\n  I fear the majority is going to make the same dangerous mistake with \\ntheir tax bill. The New York Times reported that some sections of the \\nbill released today are placeholders that will ``allow Republican \\nleaders to work out the details of a new set of revenue-raisers that \\nwould be inserted in the bill before the full House votes on it''--in \\nother words, they will be a surprise.\\n  After the Ways and Means Committee marks up the bill, they will \\nrewrite the bill in a back room and jam it through the House. It is \\nbeyond irresponsible to vote on a bill of this magnitude without \\nknowing how it will impact hardworking Americans.\\n  We employ dozens of well-qualified, nonpartisan expert economists and \\npublic policy analysts with advanced degrees in the Congressional \\nBudget Office precisely for moments like this, and it appears the \\nmajority is again, this year, prepared to move so fast that no Member \\nwill have the benefit of their nonpartisan advice.\\n  So if we can defeat the previous question, I will offer an amendment \\nto the rule that will prevent this massive tax cut bill from coming to \\nthe House floor unless nonpartisan analysis from the experts at the \\nCongressional Budget Office has been available for at least 2 days.\\n  Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my \\namendment in the Record, along with extraneous material, immediately \\nprior to the vote on the previous question.\", u'turn': 40, u'speaker': u'Ms. SLAUGHTER', u'itemno': 44}, {u'kind': u'speech', u'speaker_bioguide': None, u'text': u'  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.\\n  Madam Speaker, we don't have time to spare playing games here with \\nthe CHIP program. It is on life support in many States, with officials \\nscrambling to try to keep it alive. This is a program, you have heard \\nbefore, that 9 million children rely on.\\n  And 2,800 community health centers are at risk of closing their doors \\nif we do not reauthorize the community health centers. That would leave \\nmillions of people without healthcare, cost more than 50,000 jobs, and \\nalready the centers nationwide have been forced to consider cutting \\nservices following the majority's failure to reauthorize the program \\nbefore it expired on September 30.\\n  Everybody knows that these centers do remarkable work. They deliver \\nquality care at lower cost. More than 330,000 veterans relied on them \\nfor healthcare last year alone. They could be reauthorized under a \\nclean bill in seconds. Instead, the majority is putting them at risk \\nthrough this partisan bill, which seems unlikely to pass the Senate, \\nand we will then be nowhere.\\n  If you want to know why only 13 percent of the public approves of \\nCongress under the leadership, just look at the bill before us today. \\nRepublican leaders have turned even the most bipartisan programs into \\nendeavors that seem unlikely to become law.\\n  They have disallowed the Democratic Party to have any substitute with \\nany other ideas that they did not have before so that we can, as Ms. \\nDeLauro mentioned, have an honest debate. We see that time after time \\nin the Rules Committee, the inability for our side to even get \\namendments passed. But not to allow a substitute bill of this magnitude \\nis, I think, really a dereliction of duty. It speaks volumes about the \\ninability to get things done.\\n  And lastly, Madam Speaker, I want to recognize George Agurkis. He is \\nsitting here with me.

Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.\\n  I do want to address one of the things that has come up in the \\ndiscussion, and that is the issue of the language in the underlying \\nbill that supports the citizens, the American citizens in Puerto Rico.\\n  There was a problem in Puerto Rico with their Medicare system, the \\nway people were not automatically enrolled as they were in every other \\nState and territory. There was a problem under the Affordable Care Act \\nwhere they faced a Medicaid funding cliff.\\n\\n  These problems existed prior to the two hurricanes that hit the \\nisland, and a request was made to Chairman Walden and me, on behalf of \\nthe people of Puerto Rico, to fix these problems prior to the storms \\ncoming ashore, and that is what we fixed in the language of this bill.\\n  I might remind this body that, when Hurricane Katrina came ashore \\naround Labor Day of 2005, a similar problem was encountered. \\nUltimately, the State's share of that FMAP payment was made. It was \\nmade with funds from the Deficit Reduction Act, which were allocated on \\nSeptember 30, 2006, over a year later.\\n  The fact is that there are going to be funds available to Puerto Rico \\nto help offset their part, their match of their State's share of the \\nFederal match, but it will likely come through the money that is \\nappropriated for disaster relief. But we are fixing their underlying \\nproblem that existed before the hurricanes. If we don't fix it, it \\ncontinues to be a problem year in and year out, and the American \\ncitizens of Puerto Rico are poorly served by that.\\n  So this body is taking that up today, and I am proud of the fact that \\nour subcommittee and our full committee recognize that and provided \\nthat relief.\\n  Madam Speaker, I want to enter into the Record a letter from Texas \\nHealth Resources, Mr. Barclay Berdan. I want to quote from this letter: \\n``We . . . appreciate your leadership on delaying cuts to Medicaid DSH, \\nwhich took effect on October 1, 2017.''\\n  ``Thankfully, H.R. 3922 would eliminate the scheduled Medicaid DSH \\nreductions in fiscal years 2018 and 2019, thus allowing a critical \\nsource of funding to continue for safety net hospitals.''\\n\\n                                       Texas Health Resources,\\n\\n                                                 November 1, 2017.\\n     Hon. Michael Burgess,\\n     House of Representatives,\\n     Washington, DC.\\n       Dear Representative Burgess: As one of the nation's largest \\n     faith-based, nonprofit health care systems, Texas Health \\n     Resources (Texas Health) provides more than 350 points of \\n     access throughout North Texas, including 29 hospitals (acute-\\n     care, short-stay, behavioral health, rehabilitation and \\n     transitional care) and more than 100 outpatient facilities, \\n     satellite emergency rooms, surgery centers, behavioral health \\n     facilities, fitness centers and imaging centers. The system \\n     also includes a large physician group, home health, \\n     preventive and well-being services as well as more than 250 \\n     clinics and physician offices to provide the full continuum \\n     of care for all stages of life. I am writing to thank you for \\n     your leadership on the Championing Healthy Kids Act of 2017 \\n     (H.R. 3922) to extend funding for the Children's Health \\n     Insurance Program (CHIP). We strongly support a five-year \\n     extension of CHIP funding, along with the elimination of \\n     reductions in fiscal years (FY) 2018 and 2019 to the Medicaid \\n     disproportionate share hospital (DSH) payments.\\n       Texas Health has supported CHIP since its inception, and \\n     the program currently covers 8.9 million children with family \\n     incomes above Medicaid eligibility limits who lack access to \\n     affordable private coverage. The nation's uninsured rate for \\n     children is a record low of 5 percent due in part to Medicaid \\n     and CHIP coverage. While CHIP is authorized by Congress to \\n     operate until October 1, 2019, legislative action is needed \\n     to continue funding beyond FY 2017. Failure to extend CHIP \\n     funding could result in coverage losses for millions of \\n     children and increased financial pressure for states that may \\n     lead to reductions in eligibility and benefits This \\n     legislation safeguards the program by providing for a five-\\n     year extension of funding.\\n       We also certainly appreciate your leadership on delaying \\n     cuts to Medicaid DSH, which took effect on October 1, 2017. \\n     As you know, Medicaid DSH payments support Texas Health's \\n     hospitals in serving north Texas' most vulnerable \\n     individuals--the poor, the elderly, and the disabled. \\n     Congress reduced Medicaid DSH payments in the Affordable Care \\n     Act, reasoning that hospitals would care for fewer uninsured \\n     patients as health coverage expanded. However, the projected \\n     increase in coverage has not been fully realized, and \\n     Congress subsequently delayed the start of the cuts that were \\n     scheduled to begin in FY 2014. As a result, Texas hospitals \\n     will sustain a $148 million cut in vital payments in federal \\n     fiscal year 2018. The cumulative loss for Texas hospitals for \\n     2018 through 2024 is $3.2 billion. Thankfully, H.R. 3922 \\n     would eliminate the scheduled Medicaid DSH reductions in \\n     Fiscal Years 2018 and 2019, thus allowing a critical source \\n     of funding to continue for safety net hospitals.\\n       Thank you for your steadfast leadership on addressing these \\n     important programs by supporting H.R. 3922. As Congress moves \\n     forward on these important issues, we appreciate your \\n     continued willingness to work with us to extend funding for \\n     CHIP, eliminate reductions to Medicaid DSH payments, and \\n     safeguard programs critical to hospitals.

We look \\nforward to working with lawmakers to maintain a strong CHIP program and \\nstrengthen healthcare for children in the future.''\\n\\n     Children's Hospitals Renew Call for Bipartisan CHIP Extension\\n\\n       Children's hospitals urge Congress to protect children and \\n     families by passing a bipartisan five-year extension of the \\n     Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) as soon as \\n     possible.\\n       We are pleased that members of the House Energy and \\n     Commerce Committee have developed bipartisan CHIP policies \\n     that reflect the needs of children, including a five-year \\n     extension of the program that provides for robust CHIP \\n     funding, and continue important beneficiary protections such \\n     as the Maintenance of Effort provision, funding for\\n\\n\\n     the Pediatric Quality Measures Program, express lane \\n     eligibility, and outreach and enrollment grants. These \\n     policies are also included in the bipartisan Senate proposal \\n     on CHIP, and we thank the committees of jurisdiction in both \\n     chambers for including these crucial policies.\\n       If CHIP funding is not extended soon, CHIP-enrolled \\n     children may become underinsured or uninsured altogether. \\n     CHIP is an important bipartisan health coverage program for \\n     over 6 million low-income children. CHIP builds off of a \\n     strong Medicaid program by providing age-appropriate and \\n     affordable coverage for children who fall above Medicaid \\n     eligibility levels, but lack access to other health coverage \\n     options.\\n       Concerning reports indicate that states are taking steps to \\n     limit programs in order to address the looming funding \\n     shortfall, despite receiving federal redistribution funds. We \\n     urge Congress to act now and avoid potentially disastrous \\n     consequences caused by further delay by enacting a strong, \\n     bipartisan five-year extension of CHIP.\\n       Children's hospitals thank Congress for its long-term \\n     bipartisan commitment to CHIP and the children it serves. We \\n     look forward to working with lawmakers to maintain a strong \\n     CHIP program and strengthen health care for children into the \\n     future.\\n\", u'turn': 44, u'speaker': u'Mr. BURGESS', u'itemno': 51}, {u'kind': u'speech', u'speaker_bioguide': u'B001248', u'text': u\"  Mr. BURGESS.

It is a \\n     vote about what the House should be debating.\\n       Mr. Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of \\n     Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the \\n     previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or \\n     control the consideration of the subject before the House \\n     being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous \\n     question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the \\n     subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling \\n     of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the \\n     House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes \\n     the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to \\n     offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the \\n     majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated \\n     the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to \\n     a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to \\n     recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (R-Illinois) said: \\n     ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman \\n     from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to \\n     yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first \\n     recognition.''\\n       The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous \\n     question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an \\n     immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no \\n     substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.'' \\n     But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the \\n     Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in \\n     the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition, \\n     page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the previous \\n     question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is generally \\n     not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member \\n     controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of \\n     offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by \\n     voting down the previous question on the rule. . . . When the \\n     motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the \\n     time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering \\n     the previous question. That Member, because he then controls \\n     the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for \\n     the purpose of amendment.''\\n       In Deschler's Procedure in the U.S. House of \\n     Representatives, the subchapter titled ``Amending Special \\n     Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on \\n     such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on \\n     Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further \\n     debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues: \\n     ``Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a \\n     resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control \\n     shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous \\n     question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who \\n     controls the time for debate thereon.''\\n       Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does \\n     have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only \\n     available tools for those who oppose the Republican \\n     majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the \\n     opportunity to offer an alternative plan.\\n\", u'turn': -1, u'speaker': u'None', u'itemno': 54}, {u'kind': u'speech', u'speaker_bioguide': u'B001248', u'text': u'  Mr. BURGESS.

Mr. President, today I wish to recognize and \\ncelebrate the career of Minnesota Adjutant General Richard C. Nash. \\nMajor General Nash retired on October 31st, after leading the Minnesota \\nNational Guard for the past 7 years. His leadership has ensured the \\nexcellence of the Minnesota National Guard.\\n  Major General Nash enlisted in the infantry in 1972 and quickly rose \\nthrough the ranks, earning a commission as a second lieutenant \\nfollowing completion of officer candidate school. Since then, he has \\ncommanded at all levels, starting as a company level commander and \\nrising to lead the U.S. Divisions-South supporting Operation Iraqi \\nFreedom in 2010.\\n  In November of 2010, Major General Nash was appointed by Governor Tim \\nPawlenty to be the adjutant general of the Minnesota National Guard. In \\nthis role, he has skillfully commanded Minnesota's Army and Air \\nNational Guard units not only in missions in Minnesota, but also as \\nthey have served across the globe, in places such as Iraq, the Sinai \\nPeninsula, and the Baltics. Under Major General Nash's stewardship, the \\nMinnesota National Guard has performed every mission reliably and with \\ndistinction.\\n  I have had the honor of working closely with Major General Nash \\nduring my time in office. He has been a tireless advocate for the Guard \\non issues ranging from installations, to the Guard's renewable energy \\nuse, to the important task of ensuring the Guard's annual priorities \\nare met. One area I worked particularly closely with Major General Nash \\non has been our efforts to expand medical, education, and retirement \\nbenefits that had been previously denied to National Guard soldiers \\ndeployed under the 12304b authority. Major General Nash has been a \\nstrong voice on this issue, and his work was critical to my efforts to \\nenact bipartisan legislation to ensure Minnesota Guardsmen and \\nReservists have access to these services. Our veterans have earned \\nthese benefits through their service and sacrifice to our country, and \\nthey should not be denied those benefits.\\n  In addition to his exemplary leadership of the Minnesota Guard's \\nservice in missions foreign and domestic, Major General Nash deserves \\nspecial recognition for his work preparing the force for future energy \\nand sustainability challenges. In particular, his work developing the \\nMinnesota Guard's sustainable infrastructure has made the Minnesota \\nGuard a pioneer in the use of solar and geothermal energy initiatives. \\nIn 2011, Minnesota National Guard facilities set a goal to reduce \\nenergy consumption by 3 percent. Forty-one Minnesota National Guard \\narmories participated in this program and energy consumption was \\nreduced by an average of 5.4 percent year over year through the use of \\ngeothermal and solar thermal heating, water reuse, solid waste \\nrecycling, as well as natural and LED lighting. Furthermore, all new \\nconstruction projects under Major General Nash's leadership have been \\ndesigned to LEED standards. These developments are so important because \\nthey reduce the Guard's reliance on fossil fuels and foreign oil, \\nsupport jobs in the local economy, and reduce energy costs for the \\nGuard, allowing them to invest more in our civilian soldier's \\nreadiness, training, and education. The work Major General Nash has \\ndone to prepare for future energy and sustainability challenges has \\nensured that the Minnesota National Guard will continue to lead the \\ncountry on the battlefield and at home.\\n  Finally, I want to note with my gratitude Major General Nash's many \\nyears of service as a judge in my annual poetry contest that allows \\nMinnesota students to write about a military veteran who has made a \\ndifference in their lives. Each year, he spends hours reading these \\nheartfelt poems and helping me decide which ones will hang in my Senate \\noffice.\\n  I would like to extend my best wishes to Major General Nash upon his \\nretirement and wish him the best of luck in his future endeavors. Thank \\nyou, General Nash. Your service to our Nation and our State has been \\nindispensable and invaluable. Above all, it has made a difference to \\nthe men and women who served under you.\\n  Thank you.\\n\", u'turn': 0, u'speaker': u'Mr. FRANKEN', u'itemno': 0}, {u'kind': u'linebreak', u'speaker_bioguide': None, u'text': u'                          ____________________\\n\\n\\n', u'turn': -1, u'speaker': u'None', u'itemno': 1}], u'header': {u'extension': False, u'vol': u'163', u'wkday': u'Thursday', u'chamber': u'Senate', u'num': u'178', u'year': u'2017', u'month': u'November', u'pages': u'S6999', u'day': u'2'}, u'doc_title': u'TRIBUTE TO MAJOR GENERAL RICHARD C.

I want \\nto make a difference in America because this is the place I call home.\\n  Let me tell you also about Mario Delgado.\\n  In Mario's words, he says: I know what it is like to live like a \\nshadow in a room full of light, keeping my head down to make sure that \\nI don't get sent back to a country that I know nothing of.\\n  So Mario kept his head down. He studied, worked through high school \\nto help pay the bills, and saved up money for the future. Mario expects \\nto graduate from college next year. He wants to work in the renewable \\nenergy industry. He says he intends to help America with the \\nadvancement of fusion energy.\\n  And then there is Marla, who started attending school in Framingham, \\nMassachusetts, when she was in the first grade. She describes learning \\nAmerican history, listening to popular music, and watching the Disney \\nchannel like the rest of her friends, but something was different.\\n\\n\\n  Unlike her friends, she realized she couldn't get a driver's license. \\nAs a teenager, she suffered the crushing fear that every knock on the \\ndoor could mean that she would never see her loved ones again. She \\nfeared that applying for college would mean exposing her family, a \\ncruel reality for someone who was the valedictorian of her graduating \\nclass.\\n\\n\\n  When DACA was enacted, a life of fear became a life of possibility. \\nMarla could now drive. She could earn and save money. She could go to \\ncollege and contribute to her community.\\n  Marla not only went to college, she graduated at the top of her \\nclass. She bought a home and is now contributing her talents to the \\nCommonwealth's innovation economy.\\n  Last week, Marla bravely came to me as a DREAMer, in front of her \\ncoworkers, because she wanted to make a difference.\\n  Madam Speaker, DREAMers are bright, young people who are American in \\ntheir hearts and in their minds. They are American in every way but on \\npaper, and their dream for a better future is unmistakably American.\\n  Their families have often endured poverty, violence, and persecution, \\nbut despite it all, they have excelled and charted their own path to \\nsuccess. Though they know no other country, they grew up with the \\nthreat of deportation and that their families could be torn apart at \\nany given moment.\\n  The DACA program showed them a way to come out of the shadows, to \\nlift their heads and reach for their dreams, and give back to a country \\nthey call home. Through DACA, 800,000 young people have been able to \\ncontribute to our workforce and our Armed Forces.\\n  As Marla put it, 800,000 is not just a number; it is birthdays, \\nschool events, graduations, homes, and memories.\\n  Reversing DACA would mean sending these talented young people to a \\ncountry they don't even know, where they could potentially be our \\ncompetitors in our workforce.\\n  We have all the tools we need to prevent that from happening and keep \\nDREAMers like Richard, Mario, and Marla in our communities, where they \\ncan help us build successful futures. All we need is for leadership to \\nallow us a vote.\\n  What these young people deserve is no different than what we want for \\nour own children. If we fail to pass the Dream Act, we not only fail \\nthem, we fail to meet our potential as a country. Let's do what the \\nvast majority of Americans are asking us to do. Let's give our DREAMers \\nand the Dream Act a vote.\\n\", u'turn': 1, u'speaker': u'Ms. CLARK of Massachusetts', u'itemno': 1}, {u'kind': u'linebreak', u'speaker_bioguide': None, u'text': u'                          ____________________\\n\\n\\n', u'turn': -1, u'speaker': u'None', u'itemno': 2}], u'header': {u'extension': False, u'vol': u'163', u'wkday': u'Thursday', u'chamber': u'House', u'num': u'178', u'year': u'2017', u'month': u'November', u'pages': u'H8390-H8391', u'day': u'2'}, u'doc_title': u'DREAMERS', u'id': u'CREC-2017-11-02-pt1-PgH8390-3', u'title': u'DREAMERS'}{u'content': [{u'kind': u'linebreak', u'speaker_bioguide': None, u'text': u'                                 ______\\n', u'turn': -1, u'speaker': u'None', u'itemno': 0}, {u'kind': u'title', u'speaker_bioguide': None, u'text': u'                          HON.

Mr. Speaker, today, the Republicans released their tax \\nplan. Unsurprisingly, it is a gift-wrapped tax cut to the rich. \\nChristmas came early, Mr. Speaker. From huge corporate tax cuts to the \\nelimination of the alternative minimum tax paid by the wealthiest \\nAmericans, this tax plan will hurt our economy and prioritize the top \\nearners of our country. But there is one person--maybe a group of \\npeople--who is very thrilled about this tax plan, Mr. Speaker, and that \\nperson is Mr. Money Bags. Mr. Money Bags is really going to benefit \\nfrom this tax plan.\\n  First of all, the President himself will greatly benefit from the tax \\nplan. It is impossible to know exactly how much because we still don't \\nhave his tax returns. He has refused to release them. We would really \\nappreciate, and we demand, frankly, that the American\\n\\n\\npeople know exactly how much he is going to benefit from this tax plan.\\n  Mr. Speaker, as the vice chair of the House Budget Committee, I saw \\nfirsthand how the Republicans rammed through a budget plan that paved \\nthe way for the massive Ryan-McConnell tax giveaway to the wealthy. \\nFrankly, as a new Member, I find it an affront to the legislative \\nprocess and an affront to families across the United States in red and \\nblue States alike that we did not have hearings on that budget, that we \\nare not going to have hearings on this tax plan, which is a complete \\nrewrite of the U.S. economy that is going to be pushed through, \\napparently, in 2 weeks or less. We still have no score on this because \\nwe just saw the details of a tax plan today.\\n  The Republicans have made this habit of relying on fake logic and \\nfaulty assumptions. They did it with healthcare and the budget, and it \\nis safe to assume that is what we are looking at here.\\n  These cuts do not pay for themselves. Despite the claims that this \\ntax plan is really going to help middle class Americans, the reality is \\nthat it is going to hurt millions of American families just to fast-\\ntrack tax cuts for millionaires, billionaires, and large corporations.\\n  If the Republicans are so opposed to so-called government handouts, \\nas we are always told they are called, then why is it that they seem to \\nbe more willing to hand out everything we have to the wealthiest people \\nin this Nation?\\n  Now, we are still exploring all of the details of this tax plan that \\nwas just released today, but there is no question that this bill is \\ngoing to make sure that the wealthiest individuals and the largest \\ncorporations in this country get a tax cut of a million dollars. If you \\nhappen to be in the top one-tenth of 1 percent, then bingo, Mr. \\nMoneybags is going to get a million dollars in a tax cut every year.\\n  Consider this: if this tax bill lines up with the budget resolution, \\nthen 80 percent of the Republican tax cut goes to the top 1 percent by \\n2027; the average tax cut for the top 1 percent in 2027 would be \\n$207,000; for millionaires, the cut would be $230,000; and, as I said, \\nfor the top one-tenth of 1 percent, you get to have a million dollars a \\nyear. For the middle class, on the other hand, 42 million middle class \\nhouseholds would face a tax increase.\\n  Let's not be fooled by this idea that the standard deduction is going \\nup, and let me tell you what that means. It means that, along with the \\nstandard deduction going up, you are also getting your credits for \\nindividual children taken away, the itemization of it.\\n  So if you have a family with several children, as many Americans do, \\nyou will actually end up probably being able to deduct less.\\n  Let's also be clear that when you eliminate the deduction for \\nproperty taxes and State and local taxes, and you cut all of the \\nservices that are going to be required to be cut if you are going to \\npay for this tax cut, then you will end up paying more in your States, \\nboth in terms of the SALT deduction, but also in terms of all of the \\nincreased taxes you are going to have to pay at the local level to fund \\nthings like infrastructure and education.\\n  Let's be clear that this plan gives a $4 trillion tax cut to the \\nwealthiest 1 percent and largest corporations, taxes 42 million working \\nfamilies more, and borrows millions from the future to give those tax \\ncuts.\\n  Last week, in the Rules Committee, I offered an amendment to the \\nRepublican budget resolution that would have stopped some of the most \\negregious impacts of the billionaire's budget.\\n  My amendment would have said that none of the tax cuts proffered in \\nthis plan should apply to households in the top 1 percent of income \\nearners. It would have plainly said that the United States is not in \\nthe business of giving massive tax cuts to those who are already \\nincredibly wealthy.\\n  Mr. Speaker, I talked about some of the millionaires in my district, \\nbecause I do have some. I am fortunate to have a good economy in \\nSeattle, where we have a $15 minimum wage, where we have paid family \\nleave for everybody, yet business is still booming, the economy is \\ndoing well. We have people who have done well, and they would like to \\npay their fair share.\\n  For decades, Republicans have prioritized the interests of \\ncorporations and the wealthiest ahead of working class families.\\n  What is being proposed in this budget, this tax plan, is exactly what \\nRepublicans in Kansas proposed in 2012.\\n\\n  In 2012, a Republican Governor and Republican Legislature in Kansas \\npassed through the same thing. They said: Let's make sure that we have \\ntax benefits for these passthrough corporations--by the way, Donald \\nTrump owns 500 passthrough corporations; he will benefit greatly from \\nthis--and let's make sure that we reduce the tax rates on the \\nwealthiest. In doing so, we will make sure that we are investing in the \\neconomy.\\n  That meant, by the way, all those tax cuts had to be paid for. So \\nthere was a $700 million cut to the Kansas State budget, which resulted \\nin schools not being able to operate full time, resulted in roads being \\nin disrepair, and ultimately resulted in Kansas' bond ratings going \\ndown.\\n  In the end, that GDP growth that we were promised, the economic \\ngrowth that was guaranteed if you were to put the money into the top \\ncorporations and the top income earners that were supposed to somehow \\ntrickle down, that growth never came to be.\\n  So, guess what happened, Mr. Speaker? The Republican Legislature in \\nKansas rolled back those tax cuts. They said: That trickle down thing \\ndidn't work.\\n  The promises of economic growth didn't work, and ultimately they had \\nto move it back. Finally, Kansas is starting to come out of that by \\ninvesting in working families.\\n  Ultimately, I believe, and I think Democrats believe, if you invest \\nin regular folks, if you put the money into working families, you give \\nthem a tax cut and you make sure that they are actually paying less, \\nnot more, even if you say that you are giving them a deduction, in the \\nend, they are paying more in this tax plan. But if you invest the money \\nthere, instead of taking $270 billion that is proposed by repealing the \\nestate tax--which only a tiny portion of people pay, by the way; that \\nestate tax--and 5,400 families are going to get $270 billion in this \\nRepublican tax plan. I say, let's take that money and give it to \\nworking families instead of those.\\n  I think that we have a lot of different options. The Congressional \\nProgressive Caucus has put forward our own budget, a people's budget, \\nwith our own tax principles. The bottom line is: we believe in ordinary \\nAmericans. We believe if you invest there and you give people the \\nopportunity to work in good jobs, to earn good wages, and to really \\nmake sure that they have dignity, respect, and can save for the future \\nand send their kids to college, that ultimately builds our economy.\\n  So I am really honored to be doing this Special Order hour with my \\ngood friends and colleagues. We are going to do a little bit of a back-\\nand-forth here.\\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Gallego) to \\nhave him talk a little bit about what we are hearing. Is it true? Is it \\nhypocrisy? What do you think about those debts and deficits?\", u'turn': 3, u'speaker': u'Ms. JAYAPAL', u'itemno': 4}, {u'kind': u'speech', u'speaker_bioguide': u'G000574', u'text': u\"  Mr. GALLEGO. Mr. Speaker, we know that the Republican tax plan is a \\nmassive, unconscionable giveaway to millionaires and billionaires. We \\nknow that it will blow up the deficit and do nothing to raise wages or \\ncreate solid middle class jobs.\\n  What we don't know, Mr. Speaker, is how much the GOP tax proposal \\nwill personally benefit Donald Trump. That is because, unlike every \\nother American President, Donald Trump has refused to disclose his tax \\nreturns.\\n  Trump claimed that he couldn't release his returns throughout the \\ncampaign because he was ``under audit.'' But, Mr. Speaker, he never \\nprovided any concrete proof. More importantly, the IRS confirmed that \\nbeing under audit in no way prohibits someone from making their returns \\npublic. In fact, President Nixon did just that while he was in office.\\n\\n\\n  More recently, when The Economist magazine asked Trump about \\nreleasing his returns, he said: ``I don't know. That's a very \\ninteresting question. I doubt it. I doubt it . . . Nobody cares about \\nmy tax return except for the reporters. Oh, at some point I'll release \\nthem. Maybe I'll release them after I'm finished. . . .''\\n\\n\\n  That is right, Mr. Speaker, we will have to wait until Trump leaves \\noffice just to find out just how much money he made thanks to his own \\ntax reform bill. And my Republican friends are apparently just fine \\nwith that. There is a shocker. They don't care that Donald Trump is \\nusing his office to enrich himself. They don't care that we can't even \\nsay with any certainty exactly how much richer he is going to get. They \\ndon't care about the debt. They don't care about the deficit. They \\ndon't care about making our tax system fairer. Literally, the only \\nthing they care about and that truly matters to House Republicans is \\nthat they get to cut taxes for the richest Americans, the people who \\nneed a tax cut least of all.\\n  Mr. Speaker, Donald Trump does not need a tax cut, neither does \\nSecretary Mnuchin or Secretary DeVos or Secretary Tillerson or Paris \\nHilton, but they are going to get one if Republicans have their way.\\n  In 2012, Paul Ryan said: ``We have a debt crisis right in front of \\nus, and what brings down great empires, past and future, is debt.''\\n  In 2013, Paul Ryan said: ``Our debt is the biggest threat to this \\ncountry. We have to tackle this problem before it tackles us.''\\n  In 2016, Donald Trump said: ``I am the king of debt. I love debt.''\\n  It certainly seems like Speaker Ryan has come around to President \\nTrump's way of thinking. Republicans are planning to add $1.5 trillion \\nto our national debt, and they couldn't be happier about it.\\n  Here is the simple reality, Mr. Speaker. Republicans only care about \\ndeficits when they want to cut spending on programs for the poor or for \\nveterans or for the elderly or for our children. Republicans only care \\nabout debt when they want to slash Social Security and Medicare. Mr. \\nSpeaker, Republicans only care about debt and are only fiscally \\nresponsible when there is a Democrat in the White House.\\n  The American people are now seeing right through this hypocrisy, just \\nlike they see right through Donald Trump's excuses about his tax \\nreturns. They want us to reject this Republican tax plan, and it is \\nabout time we started listening to them.\", u'turn': 4, u'speaker': u'Mr. GALLEGO', u'itemno': 5}, {u'kind': u'speech', u'speaker_bioguide': u'J000298', u'text': u'  Ms. JAYAPAL. Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Gallego for his incredible \\nleadership. One of the things, when we think about this plan, there is \\nreally--it is a three-step plan.\\n  Number one, transfer trillions of dollars of wealth and tax cuts from \\nmiddle class working families to the top 1 percent.\\n  Number two, explode the deficit, which we know is part of this deal. \\nWe are going to explode the deficit.\\n  Number three, use that exploding deficit as a way to cut spending.\\n  But most of all, I am not sure that the numbers add up. So I wanted \\nto ask my good friend from the Progressive Caucus, Representative Ted \\nLieu from California, to just weigh in with his wisdom around what \\nexactly is going on with these numbers and what are we seeing in this \\nbudget. Does it add up?\\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr. Ted Lieu).', u'turn': 5, u'speaker': u'Ms. JAYAPAL', u'itemno': 6}, {u'kind': u'speech', u'speaker_bioguide': u'L000582', u'text': u\"  Mr. TED LIEU of California. Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative \\nJayapal for yielding.\\n  You know, today is Thursday, so we first have to ask: Why does Jared \\nKushner still have a security clearance?\\n  But I digress. We are going to talk about the GOP's disastrous tax \\nplan. The reason we know that it is a disaster is one simple fact: the \\nmath doesn't add up.\\n  So if you believe that 2 plus 2 equals 5, then this tax plan is for \\nyou. For the rest of us, it is going to explode the deficit and add to \\nthe Federal debt.\\n  What does that mean?\\n  That means massive cuts to Medicare, to Medicaid, to other vital \\nprograms that are protecting seniors and all Americans who depend on \\nsome of these programs in order to survive.\\n  Now, we can look at this tax plan and we can say, ``Hey, it might \\ngive tax breaks to the wealthy who are then going to trickle down,'' \\nexcept in the history of the United States, that kind of trickle-down \\neconomics has never worked. If you look at how the tax plan is \\nconstructed, it really chafes States such as California, New York, New \\nJersey, Washington, and other States by eliminating the State and local \\ntax deduction.\\n  When you do that, it causes filers to not be able to deduct their \\nState and local taxes; and in California, New York, New Jersey, \\nWashington, and other States, there's going to be tax increases to \\nmiddle class families.\\n  In addition, because the way the tax plan is constructed, it has the \\npotential to lower housing prices because it also caps your mortgage \\ninterest rate deduction. That is why the National Association of Home \\nBuilders came out opposing this plan, and they have put out something \\nwhich is deeply concerning. They are saying this could potentially \\ncause a housing recession.\\n  You also have the National Federation of Independent Business, which \\nrepresents small businesses across America, opposing this plan.\\n  Why?\\n  This is a big tax giveaway to the ultrawealthy. If you look at an \\nearly analysis by The Washington Post, they say that 80 percent of this \\ntax plan's benefits will go to the top 1 percent.\\n  If you look at this tax plan, it is going to hurt middle class \\nAmericans in order to fund those at the very top. This is not something \\nwe should be doing in our country.\\n  I also request this Speaker work with Democrats on a bipartisan \\nbasis. We are not opposed to tax reform. We are opposed to stupid tax \\nreform. And this is just a really stupid plan that, again, explodes the \\ndeficit, adds to our Federal debt, and whacks States like California, \\nNew York, and New Jersey, as well as Washington State. So I urge that \\nRepublicans work with Democrats and come up with a plan that actually \\nhelps middle class Americans instead of going after them.\\n\", u'turn': 6, u'speaker': u'Mr. TED LIEU of California', u'itemno': 7}, {u'kind': u'speech', u'speaker_bioguide': u'J000298', u'text': u\"  Ms. JAYAPAL. Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative Lieu.\\n  I wanted to just point out that there was a study that was done out \\nof Wharton on the tax plan. It wasn't on this most recent version, but \\nI think the majority of the things that are in this are still true in \\nwhat they analyzed. What they came out with and said is that the \\nassumption of 3 percent growth does not make sense; that, really, what \\nthey are looking at is 1.3 to 1.4 percent, ultimately, growth, and that \\nit would create a $10 trillion deficit over time. I believe it was $3 \\ntrillion in the first 10 years. I have to go back and check that \\nnumber.\\n  Essentially, what they are staying is it doesn't work. The person who \\nactually wrote the 1981 tax cut under Ronald Reagan, who was working \\nfor Jack Kemp at the time, wrote an op-ed in The Washington Post, I \\nbelieve it was, and said: ``This theory of trickle-down economics \\ndoesn't work. We were wrong when we did that, when we said that back \\nthen, and it is wrong to look at that same idea today.''\\n  Now, Representative Lieu said Democrats are not opposed to tax \\nreform. That is right if it was real reform. We do think that the Tax \\nCode could be simplified, that it could be fair so that small \\nbusinesses and working families and folks who are really investing in \\nthe economy are the ones to get the benefits of any tax reform, that we \\nwould close some of the tax loopholes. Unfortunately, this is not tax \\nreform. What has been proposed is not tax reform. It is tax giveaways \\nto the wealthiest.\\n  I want us to be very clear about what the majority is trying to do \\nhere. They are trying to rewrite the U.S. economy with absolutely no \\nhearings. It is, frankly, outrageous that we would not even have a \\nhearing on a major tax bill that is going to affect every single person \\nin this country.\\n  We should have hearings. I don't know what happened to regular order. \\nPeople talk about regular order, but as a new Member who was just \\nelected last year for my first year in Congress, I can tell you I have \\nnot seen regular order. I sat on the Judiciary Committee. We don't have \\nhearings in the Judiciary Committee. The majority of the bills that \\ncome to the floor are bills that we have never had an opportunity to \\nhave a hearing on. When you look at this tax plan, I believe we should \\nbe able to have more than 2 weeks to vote on it.\\n  I think every single American should understand what is in the plan \\nand at least have the opportunity to decide whether or not it is \\nbeneficial for them. Unfortunately, Mr. Speaker, I don't think that is \\nhappening.\\n  Let me just summarize what we think is happening in this current\\n\\n\\nversion of the tax proposal that has been put forward.\\n  First of all, it is a win for the well connected and the wealthy. \\nThat is what the Ryan-McConnell tax bill is. President Trump promised \\nthe tax reform would benefit the middle class, not the wealthy; but, \\nunfortunately, rhetoric does not match reality. Instead, this bill that \\nwe are looking at now would create a new passthrough loophole that \\nwealthy individuals would exploit to lower their own taxes.\\n  Just as an example, a version of this loophole was used by University \\nof Kansas Basketball Coach Bill Self to avoid paying more than $125,000 \\nin State taxes in 1 year alone. The alternative minimum tax, which we \\ncall the AMT, which ensures that the wealthy at least pay more of their \\nfair share, is eliminated in the Ryan-McConnell plan.\\n  While little is known about President Trump's taxes, we do know that, \\nwithout the AMT, the President would have paid $31 million less in \\ntaxes in 2005 alone. So you see why Mr. Moneybags over here is so \\nimportant to this discussion, because that is ultimately who is going \\nto benefit.\\n  Now, Speaker Ryan also believes, as I mentioned, that we should give \\na windfall to the ultrawealthy by eliminating the estate tax. Again, \\nthat estate tax is paid by less than 5,400 families across the Nation, \\nand in 2016, not one person paid the estate tax in seven States.\\n  So what happens to middle class families? Because if all these \\nwealthy folks are going to get all the money, then the question is: So \\nwhat happens for middle class families? Because that is really where \\nthe attention should be. That was what was promised by Donald Trump.\\n  Speaker Ryan and the Republican establishment have attacked \\ncommonsense policies used by millions of middle class families in order \\nto pay for this tax giveaway to the wealthy. So Republicans have taken \\naway the ability to write off your State and local tax bills, forcing \\nmillions of families to pay taxes twice on the same dollar earned, \\nexcept for property taxes, up to a mere $10,000. That is the cap that \\nthey are proposing on property taxes.\\n  Americans that are hit with significant medical costs, for example, \\nthose who have cancer or ALS or Alzheimer's, would lose their ability \\nto write off these costs under the Republican plan.\\n  The Ryan-McConnell tax bill also eliminates deduction for personal \\ncasualty losses. A big blow if you are a victim of crime, theft, or \\ndisaster. It also excludes--it eliminates the exclusion for dependent \\ncare assistance program, which is an incredibly important benefit for \\nworking families.\\n  So in the end, you just have to ask yourself: In order to give \\ntrillions of dollars of tax cuts to the wealthiest and the biggest \\ncorporations, what does that mean for working families?\\n  It means working families are going to foot the bill over and over \\nagain. I believe this is a bad deal for middle class families, for \\nAmerica, and for our economy.\\n  One last thing I forgot to mention is that there is actually an \\nincentive. After all of the talk of bringing jobs back to America, \\nthere is actually an incentive in this bill to take work and jobs to a \\ntax-haven country because the amount of taxes that you would pay on \\nthat is actually lower than the amount of taxes you would pay if you \\nwere to start a factory here in Iowa or Kansas or somewhere in the \\nUnited States. If you were to actually create jobs here, you would have \\nto pay a higher tax rate than if you were to create that same factory \\nin some tax-haven country in other parts of the world where you don't \\nhave to pay--you would end up not paying the same amount of taxes. So \\nthis is a bad deal for middle class families.\\n  I don't know if my friend, Mr. Jeffries, would like to speak on the \\ntax excellence, so I am really thrilled now to be able to turn this \\nover to a member of the Progressive Caucus, a leader on our Judiciary \\nCommittee, Representative Hakeem Jeffries from New York.\", u'turn': 7, u'speaker': u'Ms. JAYAPAL', u'itemno': 8}, {u'kind': u'speech', u'speaker_bioguide': u'J000294', u'text': u\"  Mr. JEFFRIES. Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative Jayapal, my good \\nfriend and tremendous colleague on both the House Budget Committee and \\nthe House Judiciary Committee, the distinguished gentlewoman from the \\ngreat State of Washington, for her tremendous advocacy, for anchoring \\nthis Congressional Progressive Caucus Special Order, and for addressing \\nthe American people on this critically important issue, so-called tax \\nreform put forth by House Republicans today in a manner that is clear-\\neyed, that is authentic, that is comprehensive, and that will hopefully \\nawaken the American people to the notion that this is an attempt by \\nHouse Republicans to do nothing more than to jam tax cuts for \\nmillionaires and billionaires down the throats of the American people.\\n\\n\\n  Now, I represent the Eighth Congressional District in Brooklyn and \\nQueens. I am proud to be a Member of the House of Representatives, \\nproud to be from the city of New York. And we are generous people in \\nNew York City; generous people in New York State. In fact, New York \\nState regularly sends tens of billions of dollars more to the Federal \\nGovernment than we get back in return.\\n  The State of Connecticut sends billions of dollars more to the \\nFederal Government than they get back in return. So does New Jersey. So \\ndoes California. So does Illinois. So does Pennsylvania. And, for \\ndecades, we have allowed that generosity to continue to show itself in \\nterms of the fact that we get shortchanged in homeland security \\ndollars, transportation and infrastructure dollars, and a whole host of \\nother Federal funds that disproportionately make its way to other parts \\nof the country, often to States in the deep South.\\n  We are generous people. But at what point is enough enough? And \\ntoday, you have crossed the line by putting a target on the backs of \\npeople in New York, and New Jersey, and Pennsylvania, and Illinois, and \\nCalifornia, and several other States, including people who live in \\nplaces like Charleston, South Carolina, or other cities that may have \\nrelatively modest State taxes, if any at all, but who are taxed at the \\nlocal level, or who pay property taxes.\\n  And so everyone throughout the United States of America, tens of \\nmillions of people, are going to be hurt by this Republican tax plan, \\nbecause of the limitations on deductibility related to State and local \\ntaxes, because of the draconian limitations on deducting property \\ntaxes, and because of the limitations placed on middle class homeowners \\nas it relates to the mortgage interest deduction. You can't make this \\nstuff up.\\n  The Republican tax plan is nothing more than a Ponzi scheme to \\nprovide a windfall to millionaires and billionaires, the wealthy and \\nthe well-off, to special interest corporations, and to hide it in the \\nnotion that it is a middle class tax cut. The Republican tax plan won't \\nhelp the middle class. It will hurt the middle class. It is a Ponzi \\nscheme. It will undermine Medicare and Medicaid. It will impose \\nbillions and billions of dollars in additional deficit. It will force \\nyour children and grandchildren to shoulder approximately $1.5 trillion \\nin additional debt. And this is all being done in order to provide \\nmassive tax cuts to millionaires and billionaires, the overwhelming \\nmajority of whom will be the ones who disproportionately benefit from \\nthe so-called tax reform plan. Yes, it is a Ponzi scheme.\\n  And why do I say that? Well, because what you are going to hear is \\nthat trickle-down economic theory; supply-side economic theory; or the \\nlatest word craft that they have come up with, dynamic scoring, will \\nresult in a situation where these massive tax cuts for millionaires and \\nbillionaires, and for special interest corporations, will somehow \\nmagically result in unprecedented economic growth. Sounds good.\\n  The only problem is that it is a failed, fraudulent, and fake \\nargument. It is a fantasy that has no basis in reality.\\n  When Ronald Reagan, in 1981, cut taxes for the wealthy and for the \\nwell-off, we didn't get unprecedented economic growth, we got massive \\ndeficits.\\n  When George W. Bush cut taxes for the wealthy and for the well-off in \\n2001 and 2003, we didn't get unprecedented economic growth, we got a \\nGreat Recession--the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression.\\n  When the Republican Governor of Kansas moved forward with what he\\n\\n\\ncalled the Kansas experiment, massively cut taxes for the wealthy and \\nfor the well-off in Kansas, so much so that the wealthiest 300,000 \\nfolks from Kansas didn't pay a single dollar in taxes at all--the \\npeople of Kansas were promised unprecedented economic growth, \\nunprecedented job creation--this is the Republican Governor of Kansas--\\nwhen he cut taxes, you didn't get unprecedented economic growth. What \\nyou got were prison riots, overcrowded classrooms, and crumbling \\ninfrastructure.\\n  The Republican tax plan is nothing more than a Ponzi scheme. Supply-\\nside economics has failed; trickle-down economics has failed; dynamic \\nscoring is a fantasy. We would say in Brooklyn: Don't believe the hype. \\nWe will surgically communicate to the American people why the \\nRepublican tax plan will hurt the middle class, hurt working families, \\nhurt children, hurt senior citizens, and hurt those who aspire to be \\npart of the middle class.\\n  And one last point that I would make: I am shocked that you would put \\na target on the back of people who are paying State and local taxes--\\npresumably because you think this is a deduction that the American \\npeople no longer deserve--but then in your same tax plan you allow \\ncorporations and businesses, wealthy titans of corporate America who \\nrun these companies, to continue to deduct State and local taxes on \\ntheir corporate tax returns. Seriously? You don't even pretend to have \\nequitable treatment? Oh, I forgot: corporations are people, too.\\n  This is an extraordinary scheme that they are going to try to jam \\ndown the throats of the American people. But we are here, as Democrats, \\nto make sure that the American people understand that you are being \\noffered a raw deal. We are going to present to you and fight for a \\nbetter deal for middle class tax cuts, for tax cuts for small \\nbusinesses, tax cuts for working families, and to make sure that people \\nin America continue to pay their fair share.\\n  Mr. Speaker, I thank the distinguished gentlewoman from Washington \\nfor yielding to me.\", u'turn': 8, u'speaker': u'Mr. JEFFRIES', u'itemno': 9}, {u'kind': u'speech', u'speaker_bioguide': u'J000298', u'text': u\"  Ms. JAYAPAL.

Mr. Speaker, what strikes me is, when you don't have a \\nprocess, you don't have discussion and debate, and you try to jam \\nsomething through, it means you are trying to hide a whole lot. So I \\njust wanted to say that there is an article in The Washington Post \\ntoday about winners and losers in the Republican tax plan, and here is \\nwhat they say are winners.\\n  This isn't a Democrat saying this. This is The Washington Post \\nsaying, big corporations--number one winner, big corporations. American \\nmegabusinesses would get a substantial tax reduction.\\n  And, by the way, that is not just on one level, that is a number of \\nlevels. And my colleagues over here know that this is the number one \\nplan here, because there is a clear difference of opinion. You all \\nthink that, if you invest in these big corporations and in the \\nwealthiest individuals, you would rather put your faith into those \\nfolks rather than middle class families across the country who could \\nactually build our economy.\\n  So this bill cuts the top rate that large corporations would have to \\npay the biggest one-time drop in the big business tax rate ever; I \\nrepeat, the biggest one-time drop in the big business tax rate ever.\\n  On top of that, you would get some new tax breaks if you are a \\ncorporation, so you would get to lower your bills.\\n  What I have seen in the polling is that Americans across the country \\nthink that corporations are already getting too good of a deal and they \\nshould pay their fair share. And what millions of struggling families \\nacross the country want is for somebody to actually fight for them, \\nsomebody to fight for people who are going to work every day, who are \\ndoing everything they can to have an American life that pays them \\nenough money to get a job to put food on the table, to send their kids \\nto college, to retire with dignity, a better deal than the raw deal \\nthat they are getting right now. But that is the number one winner.\\n  The second biggest winner, according to The Washington Post: the \\nsuperrich. And that was the estate tax that I mentioned, which only \\nbenefits 5,400 families across the United States who pay that estate \\ntax. But we are going to put hundreds of billions of dollars into \\nrepealing the estate tax so that those 5,400 families can continue to \\nearn more and more money on the backs of the middle class.\\n  And, of course, the third one is anyone paying the alternative \\nminimum tax. That is Donald Trump. The biggest part of his tax bill \\nthat he paid, on the one tax return that he released, was from the \\nalternative minimum tax. But that alternative minimum tax is now \\ngetting eliminated in this bill to benefit Donald Trump. And it forces \\npeople who earn more than $130,000 to calculate their taxes twice.\\n  There is one more. They said, ``Hedge funds, doctors, and lawyers''--\\nthat is the fourth one that they mention--as the wealthiest hedge fund \\nmanagers, who are going to, ultimately, get a sizable discount, while \\n``under the GOP bill, high-earning small-business owners will only pay \\na tax rate of 25 percent on 30 percent of their business income,'' the \\npassthrough business rate.\\n  The reality is that even though there are some small businesses that \\nare passthrough entities, most of those small businesses do not get the \\nmajority of their income as passthrough income, they get it from other \\nthings. The only people who really benefit from that passthrough are \\nthose hedge fund managers and folks like that.\\n  Who are the losers? Small-business owners. The National Federation of \\nIndependent Business, which represents 325,000 small businesses said: \\nUh-uh, we are not supporting the GOP bill. Why? ``It leaves too many \\nsmall businesses behind.''\\n  So Main Street is hurting under this proposal.\\n  Who else? Like you said, people in high-tax blue States. So say good-\\nbye to most of the State and local tax deductions from States like \\nCalifornia, New Jersey, New York, Connecticut, and my State. My home \\nState of Washington is really going to be hurt by this because we don't \\nhave an income tax, so we have very high property taxes, and we have \\nvery high other sales taxes. None of that would be--well, property tax, \\naccording to this plan, you would get a tiny, little cap on it of \\n$10,000.\\n  And then who else is a big loser? The working poor. Here is what The \\nWashington Post says: ``While the bill includes lots of tax breaks for \\nbig businesses and the rich, the bottom 35 percent of Americans do not \\nget any extra benefits.''\\n\\n\\n  So there is one more loser here, which is interesting. It says, \\n``charities.''\\n  The National Council of Nonprofits says that charitable deductions, \\nwhen Americans chip in to take care of folks who have been hurt by \\ndisasters across the country or they contribute to nonprofits or \\nothers, that those charitable deductions are likely to go down under \\nthis bill because, interestingly and ironically, the Republicans still \\nenable ``the wealthy to continue deducting\\n\\n\\ntheir charitable giving.'' But most people would not be able to get the \\ntax break because they probably stop itemizing their deductions, so you \\nwould actually lose all of that.\\n  So I don't know, Mr. Jeffries. I think we are going to have a lot of \\nwork to do here to make sure that the American people understand \\nexactly what this proposal is and to really get the word out.\", u'turn': 11, u'speaker': u'Ms. JAYAPAL', u'itemno': 12}, {u'kind': u'speech', u'speaker_bioguide': u'J000294', u'text': u\"  Mr. JEFFRIES. Well, I appreciate you going through that important \\nlist. I think it can be distilled, you know, quite simply.\\n  The winners of the Republican tax plan are the billionaire boys club; \\nthe losers are the American people, everyday Americans, all premised, \\nagain, on, and you are going to hear this over and over again, dynamic \\nscoring--sounds great--trickle-down economics.\\n  You know, I figured out that trickle-down economics essentially \\nmeans, for the middle class, you may get a trickle, but you are \\nguaranteed to stay down, because there is no evidence--no evidence from \\nthe Reagan experiment, no evidence from the Bush experiment, no \\nevidence from the Brownback experiment in Kansas, no evidence--that if \\nyou cut taxes for the wealthy or the well off, for special interest \\ncorporations, whether you do it directly or through passthrough \\nentities, that when you cut those taxes, it results in strong, \\nunprecedented economic growth. In fact, our history tells us precisely \\nthe opposite.\\n  Bill Clinton raised the top tax rate on high-income earners from 35 \\npercent to 39.6 percent. Did we suffer from a recession as a result of \\nincreasing taxes on millionaires and billionaires so that they would \\npay their fair share? No, quite the opposite--unprecedented economic \\ngrowth, 20 million-plus jobs created during 8 years of Bill Clinton.\\n  Then George W. Bush comes into town, and we actually had a balanced \\nbudget at that time. What does he do? Deficits don't matter according \\nto the Bush administration. We are going to stimulate tremendous \\neconomic growth by cutting taxes on millionaires and billionaires \\nbecause of trickle-down economics, supply-side economics, dynamic \\nscoring, lower the tax rate from 39.6 on millionaires and billionaires \\nto 35.\\n  What happened? We lost more than 500,000 jobs in 8 years of the Bush \\nPresidency.\\n  Barack Obama comes into town and we had all of these doom-and-gloom \\nprojections from my good friends on the other side in terms of what was \\ngoing to happen. He campaigns on millionaires and billionaires paying \\ntheir fair share, raises the top tax rate from 35 percent to 39.6 \\npercent. Twelve million-plus private sector jobs were created during 8 \\nyears of the Obama Presidency.\\n  That is why I say that the Republican tax plan is nothing more than a \\nPonzi scheme based on a failed, fraudulent, phony theory of trickle-\\ndown economics that has no basis in reality.\\n  I thank the distinguished gentlewoman from Washington for yielding \\nand being so generous and thoughtful in her discussion.\", u'turn': 12, u'speaker': u'Mr. JEFFRIES', u'itemno': 13}, {u'kind': u'speech', u'speaker_bioguide': u'J000298', u'text': u\"  Ms. JAYAPAL. I thank the gentleman from New York for his thoughts.\\n  Once again, I would just draw your attention back to who the real big \\nwinner is here in this Republican tax plan. It is Mr. Moneybags.\\n  So if you have got money in bags, millions of dollars, if you are a \\nlarge corporation, if you are a billionaire, then you are going to \\nbenefit from this plan--yes, you will. And you know who is going to pay \\nfor that is middle class working families across the country who are \\ngoing to see their taxes go up, who are going to see their services \\ncut, who are going to ultimately be a part of the plan that has three \\nparts.\\n  The number one part for the Republican plan is transfer trillions of \\ndollars of wealth from middle class America to the wealthiest in the \\ncountry who don't need it; number two, explode the deficit, because \\nthere is no way to pay for this unless you cut a bunch of stuff; and \\nthen, number three, cut more. Use the exploding deficit as an \\nopportunity to cut spending even more: raid Social Security; raid \\nMedicare; raid Medicaid.\\n  This is all part of the budget that was passed last week by \\nRepublicans. Let me say, there were 20 Republicans who voted against \\nthat budget, and I congratulate them for their courage in voting \\nagainst that budget. It was a close vote. If we had just gotten a \\ncouple more, we would have been able to defeat that budget, and we \\nwould have been able to at least require a more thoughtful process for \\nhow we move forward on tax reform, because part of what that budget \\nvote did is to allow this process to move forward with less democracy, \\nwith less vetting, and with less knowledge for the American people.\\n  Once again, I would say that the only reason to do this without a \\nreal debate, to rewrite the American economy without a real debate, is \\nif you want to hide who is going to benefit from it. We know who is \\ngoing to benefit. It is right here. Mr. Moneybags is going to benefit. \\nWorking people are going to suffer.\\n  So I know that we Democrats are absolutely committed to making sure \\nthat working families across this country, the vulnerable, the low-\\nincome, the folks who are struggling every day, who are just making it, \\nwho feel like this economy is not working for them because it is \\ncontrolled by corporations, by lobbyists, by folks who are here not \\nworking for the American people but working for their own special \\ninterests, we know that Americans want that to stop. Unfortunately, \\nthis plan does not do that.\\n  So Democrats are going to fight every step of the way. The \\nCongressional Progressive Caucus is going to fight every step of the \\nway. We have our own People's Budget. We have a real proposal for how \\nto invest in infrastructure, in jobs, in education, in healthcare to \\nmake sure that Americans across the country, whether you are in a red \\nState or a blue State, whether you are a Republican or a Democrat, \\nwhether you are in rural America or urban America--I actually believe \\nwe all want the same things, which is we want to be able to put food on \\nthe table; we want to be able to put a roof over our head; we want to \\nbe able to go to a job and feel dignity about that job; we want to be \\nable to send our kids to college or to higher education so they can get \\nthe skills and training they need and not be mired in student debt--\\nacross the country, $1.4 trillion of student debt that we have, even \\nlarger than credit card debt--and we want to be able to retire with \\ndignity.\\n\\n  So, ultimately, my friends, what we are going to have to do as \\nDemocrats--and I hope that there are Republicans across the aisle who \\nwant the same things and who know that this is a bad deal for middle \\nclass families, for working families, for folks who are just struggling \\nto make it, who want to have that better deal, better jobs, better \\nfuture, we Democrats are going to fight for that.\\n  I hope that we have colleagues on the other side of the aisle who \\nrecognize that their districts in blue States, red States, urban, and \\nrural will suffer if this plan goes through.\\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\", u'turn': 13, u'speaker': u'Ms. JAYAPAL', u'itemno': 14}, {u'kind': u'speech', u'speaker_bioguide': None, u'text': u'  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

He is a fitting recipient of a Congressional \\nVeteran Commendation.\\n  During his deployment to Vietnam, Phillip Duprey faced grave and \\nmortal danger while conducting intelligence collection as a member of \\nthe Army Security Agency for the IV Division of the 101st Airborne \\nDivision. 1LT Duprey's leadership, dedication, and bravery undoubtedly \\nsaved the lives of many. For his service and valor in combat, 1LT \\nDuprey received numerous medals including the Bronze Star and the \\nNational Defense Service Medal.\\n  1LT Duprey's service and sense of duty did not finish with the end of \\nhis military career. Upon returning to the great state of Texas, 1LT \\nDuprey dedicated his civilian life to the uplifting and betterment of \\nhis community. As a highly respected citizen, he is active in numerous \\ncommunity organizations, including twenty-two years on the Cedar Park \\nChamber of Commerce. Additionally, he served on the Cedar Park City \\nCouncil for six years, the last two as Mayor pro tem. 1LT Duprey has \\ndedicated himself to serving his community and is an embodiment of the \\nArmy values of honor, loyalty, and selfless service. For these reasons \\nand many more, his community came together to honor 1LT Duprey as Cedar \\nPark Citizen of the Year in 2000 and 2014.\\n  I commend First Lieutenant Phillip Duprey's selfless service to the \\nU.S. Army, the nation, and his community.

Mr. President, although nearly half of those graduating \\nfrom law school are women, only about a third of the Federal judges are \\nfemale. This week, we had the honor of adding three more.\\n  I rise to congratulate these three successful women because their \\nadditions to the Federal court system are historic. They serve as more \\nevidence that well-qualified women are becoming more confident in \\nstepping forward and serving our great Nation.\\n  Amy Coney Barrett, Joan Louise Larsen, and Allison Eid are three more \\ncracks in that glass ceiling. Their confirmations are proof that \\nsuccessful women can balance responsibility and seize opportunity when \\nit knocks on their doors. These accomplished nominees are not joining \\nthe Federal bench because of a frivolous attempt at trying to balance \\nout the gender disparity in our courts. They will be donning the black \\nrobes because they will have earned it.\\n  Amy Coney Barrett, our new judge for the Seventh Circuit, climbed to \\nthe ranks by clerking for Judge Laurence Silberman on the DC Circuit \\nand Justice Scalia on the U.S. Supreme Court. In working with her \\nhusband, who is a successful lawyer in his own right, she has balanced \\nfamily responsibilities while having achieved personal success. At the \\nage of 30, she was hired as a professor at one of the Nation's best law \\nprograms, Notre Dame. Over the past 6 years, she has sat on the \\nAdvisory Committee on Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure on the \\nrecommendation of Chief Justice Roberts.\\n  Joan Louise Larsen, the next U.S. circuit judge for the Sixth \\nCircuit, is proof that hard work pays off. After graduating at the top \\nof her class from Northwestern, Judge Larsen clerked for Justice Scalia \\non the U.S. Supreme Court before serving as a Deputy Assistant Attorney \\nGeneral in the U.S. Department of Justice, Office of Legal Counsel. She \\nmost recently sat on the highest court in her State, the Supreme Court \\nof Michigan. She has done this while raising two children with her law \\nprofessor husband.\\n  Allison Eid, the newest judge for the Tenth Circuit, has demonstrated \\nbrilliance throughout her career. After graduating from Stanford, she \\nworked as an assistant speechwriter for William Bennett, President \\nReagan's Secretary of Education. After graduating from law school with \\nhonors, she clerked for Justice Clarence Thomas of the U.S. Supreme \\nCourt. She has served with distinction on the Colorado Supreme Court \\nsince 2006. With her husband, Troy, the first Egyptian American to \\nserve as a U.S. district attorney, she has helped to raise two \\nchildren.\\n  These three successful women should serve as role models to girls and \\nboys across this Nation. They are proof that women do not need to stand \\nback while others find success, and their confirmations are evidence \\nthat, when women support each other, they will achieve at the highest \\nlevel. They also demonstrate the power of families when they work \\ntogether to accomplish goals.\\n  We should be proud to have confirmed these three great women to the \\nFederal bench. All of us receive letters from children who ask \\nquestions about: What do you do in the U.S. Senate? Weeks like this one \\nshould be part of our response. We empower those who have empowered \\nthemselves regardless of their gender. We shape our legal system by \\nfilling it with qualified women who are dedicated to preserving and \\nprotecting our Constitution--the framework of our free Nation. We \\nproclaim that hard work is to be rewarded. These three important \\nconfirmations are further proof that young women do not have to choose \\nbetween raising families and rising to the top of their chosen \\nprofessions.\\n  I stand here today and send a message to every little girl who \\nwonders about politics and every young woman who faces the challenges \\nof starting out in her career: You can do this too. We love you, and we \\nsupport you. Be confident when you want to step forward and serve your \\ncommunity and serve your country.\\n  The judicial nominees who were voted on this week exemplify the best \\nof our Nation's legal community. Their confirmations to the Federal \\nbench have added significant talent to our Nation's system of justice. \\nThe work being done by the President and by this Senate in shaping the \\nFederal courts with those who will follow the rule of law is historic. \\nPresident Trump should be applauded for nominating such well-qualified \\npeople to be on the Federal bench.\\n  All of the nominees voted on this week will make exceptional \\nadditions to the Federal bench, and I hope that the President will send \\nmany more like them for us to consider.

Mr. President, this week, we have the unique opportunity \\nto move forward on promises we made to the American people last year, \\nconfirming judges and providing tax relief to hard-working Americans. \\nThe American people sent us to Congress to complete this critical work, \\nand we must stop at nothing to do it. We have already taken significant \\nsteps to address both of these issues by confirming 13 judges, with 5 \\nmore this week, and passing a budget with instructions for tax reform.\\n  There is still much more that we need to do, and I stand ready to \\nstay here until that job is done. Most people can't go home until their \\nwork is finished; I don't think we should either. Imagine dropping your \\ncar off at the auto mechanic and, instead of staying to finish the job, \\nthey leave at 3 p.m. to go home because that is convenient for their \\nschedule; yet you still have to pay them for a full day's work. That is \\neffectively what we have been doing here in Congress, and that needs to \\nstop. We need to work as much as possible to ensure that the Federal \\njudiciary is filled with judges that will uphold the Constitution and \\nbring us closer to providing tax relief for the American people.\\n  We need to have a fully occupied, fully functioning Federal judiciary \\nto ensure that Americans' constitutional rights are upheld. In almost \\n10 months, we have started to address the issue of judicial vacancies \\nby confirming 13 judges, most notably Justice Gorsuch, who has already \\nserved as a strong, conservative voice on the Supreme Court. As a \\nfellow westerner, I was proud to vote for such a qualified judge to \\nserve in our Nation's highest Court.\\n  Beyond the vacancy we filled on the Supreme Court, there are \\nvacancies on all levels of our Federal judiciary. We cannot forget the \\nimportance of every single court that makes up the Federal system. We \\nmust prioritize confirming judges to fill these openings, especially \\nthose deemed judicial emergencies. The fact that we have so many \\njudicial emergencies is incredibly concerning and should be a wake-up \\ncall to all Senators, especially those who are slowing down this \\nimportant process.\\n  The President is continuing to send us well-qualified nominees, and \\nChairman Grassley has done an excellent job of moving nominees through \\nthe committee process. I am especially encouraged that this week we are \\nconfirming five more judges, including four circuit court judges. This \\nis the pace we need to keep. If that means working 24/7 to continue \\nconfirming these constitutionalists, you can count me in. Confirming \\nFederal judges is a unique duty of the U.S. Senate, and we cannot allow \\nobstructionism from the other side of the aisle to prevent us from \\nfilling vacancies throughout the country.\\n  It is clear that when judges are brought to the floor for a vote by a \\nhealthy majority, the gridlock being caused is purely political. \\nBecause of this, leadership is having to file cloture on all of these \\njudicial nominees, and some of my colleagues across the aisle\\n\\n\\nare just running the debate clock on these nominees instead of actually \\ndebating. We have what is known as a 1-hour rule in the Senate, and I \\nthink it is time to start enforcing it.\\n  Members are entitled to their opinions, and, as the deliberative \\nbody, we should debate nominees. But if you are going to debate a \\nnominee, I think you actually need to come here and speak about them. \\nYou can't just hide behind your desk and run the debate clock. If you \\nhave a problem with a nominee, then you should come to the floor and \\nvoice your concerns. If you are not willing to do this, then you \\nshouldn't hold this nominee hostage to an artificial clock. This is \\nwhat is wrong in Washington. We should use debate time on a nominee to \\ndebate the nominee, and if there is no more debate, then we should vote \\non that nominee and move on to the next one.\\n  The Constitution guarantees the right to a speedy trial. As the body \\nthat confirms judges to make that constitutional right possible, we \\nhave a critical responsibility, and we need to do whatever it takes to \\nfulfill this duty. In order to deliver swift justice throughout the \\ncountry, these seats need to be filled.\\n\\n  I am ready and willing to work day and night, weekends and holidays, \\nto do what Nevadans sent me to Washington to do and to accomplish. As \\nthe leader mentioned last week, we should work through the week of \\nThanksgiving. Hard-working Americans don't go home until their work is \\ncomplete, and neither should we. That work also includes reforming our \\nTax Code, providing desperately needed relief to the middle class.\\n  Today Chairman Brady and the Ways and Means Committee released a \\ndraft of their tax bill, which is another enormous step forward in \\nproviding meaningful tax relief to Nevadans and other hard-working \\nAmericans across this country. Middle-class tax relief is particularly \\ncritical to the residents of my home State of Nevada. Whether it is the \\nsingle mother from Gardnerville who doesn't receive child support, \\nworks full time, and is simply trying to make ends meet or the \\nentrepreneur in Elko who is fighting hard to get his small business off \\nthe ground and wondering whether he will ever catch a break and be able \\nto afford his first employee, I continue to hear from diligent, hard-\\nworking Nevada families and small business owners who are struggling to \\ncover their expenses and get ahead in life.\\n  For too many people, the American dream--previously achievable \\nthrough hard work, sheer determination, and playing by the rules--feels \\nas though it is slipping away. That is in part because, for too long, \\nNevadans and Americans across this country have faced stagnant wages \\nand slow economic growth.\\n  Under the failed economic policies of the previous administration, we \\nhave suffered through 8 years of historically low economic growth. In \\nfact, in those 8 years, we didn't have a single year in which the \\neconomy grew by 3 percent. As a result, wages and workers suffered. As \\na result, job creation suffered. And as a result, middle-class \\nAmericans like you and your neighbors suffered.\\n  We still bear the scars of the Obama-era economic policies today. \\nMedian household incomes in Nevada are $7,000 lower today than they \\nwere 10 years ago. Nevada families are more likely to be living \\npaycheck to paycheck than families living in nearly every other State. \\nIt is fair to say--in Nevada at least--the recession has never really \\nended. To me, this situation is unacceptable. I am doing everything in \\nmy power to right the economic wrongs that have been committed by the \\nprevious administration.\\n  Under the leadership of the new administration, however, we are \\nstarting to see our economy improve. There are positive signs \\neverywhere. Last week, the Commerce Department announced that for the \\nsecond quarter in a row, the economy had grown by at least 3 percent. \\nThis impressive growth occurred despite hurricanes that destroyed the \\nhomes and businesses of our good friends and colleagues in Texas and in \\nFlorida. Despite these natural disasters, if 3 percent economic growth \\nis possible under the leadership of President Trump and a unified \\nRepublican government, just think about how much more we can add to \\nthis growth by passing comprehensive tax reform.\\n  As a member of that tax writing committee, I have been working with \\nmy colleagues to craft a tax package that accomplishes three major \\ngoals: First, create more jobs; second, increase wages; and third, \\nboost Americans' competitiveness worldwide.\\n  What does tax relief mean to you, the average Nevadan who works hard \\nand is trying to provide a better life for his or her children and save \\nfor a secure retirement? It means cutting your taxes so that you can \\nkeep more of your hard-earned money. It means a bigger child tax credit \\nto help you confront the increasing costs of raising children. It means \\na simpler and fairer tax code that you yourself can understand. Lower \\nrates for business mean more jobs, higher wages, and growth in our \\ncommunities--all of which will benefit you. Taken together, all these \\nthings mean that you will have a profound increase in your take-home \\npay and your economic opportunities.\\n  A recent study by the White House Council of Economic Advisers found \\nthat reducing the corporate tax rate by 15 percent alone would increase \\nhousehold incomes by an average of $4,000. A similar study by a Boston \\nUniversity economist put the increase at $3,500. I don't know about \\nyou, but I think the average American could do a lot with an additional \\n$3,500 to $4,000 in his or her bank account.\\n  As a son of a school cook and an auto mechanic, I understand the \\ndiscipline and the hard work that go into every dollar and every \\npaycheck, and I am working to see that you have more of it in your back \\npocket. I am confident that we will fulfill these promises, but that \\nwill take a commitment from our colleagues to stay here and work.\\n  In addition to overhauling the Tax Code and confirming judges, we \\nhave many other significant legislative responsibilities to complete. I \\nbelieve we must spend as much time as necessary, including working \\nthrough the scheduled November constituent work period, to fulfill our \\ncommitment to the American people.\\n  I yield the floor.\\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\", u'turn': 0, u'speaker': u'Mr. HELLER', u'itemno': 0}, {u'kind': u'speech', u'speaker_bioguide': None, u'text': u'  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I rise to speak about the nomination of \\nProfessor Stephanos Bibas, on whom we have just invoked cloture, but \\nbefore I do that, I want to take a quick moment to observe that we had \\na big development today--a big development in that the House of \\nRepresentatives, the majority Ways and Means Committee members, led by \\nKevin Brady and Speaker of the House Paul Ryan, have unveiled a tax \\nreform plan that is a very exciting step forward in our ambition to \\nbring tax relief and is a direct pay raise to hard-working Americans \\nwhom we represent, creating an environment where we could have much \\nstronger economic growth and much more opportunity and rising wages for \\nthe American people.\\n  So I congratulate Chairman Brady and all the members of the Ways and \\nMeans Committee. I know this process has a long way to go, but they are \\noff to a great start with a very solid bill. I look forward to \\ncontinuing to work with my colleagues on the Finance Committee as we \\nfinalize our version of the pro-middle-class, pro-growth tax reform, \\nand I am excited to see that step forward.\\n  Madam President, let me get back to the issue of the candidacy of \\nProfessor Stephanos Bibas and say how enthusiastically I support his \\ncandidacy to serve as a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the \\nThird Circuit.\\n  I thank the President for nominating Professor Bibas, I thank \\nChairman Grassley for moving Professor Bibas through the nomination \\nprocess of his committee, and I thank Leader McConnell for bringing \\nProfessor Bibas's nomination to the floor. I also thank my colleagues \\nwho just voted to invoke cloture so that later today we can vote to \\nconfirm this terrifically well-qualified man to a really important \\ncourt.\\n  Let me touch on some of his qualities. Professor Bibas has a \\ntremendous wealth of experience in the law as a legal scholar and a \\npracticing attorney, so much so that the American Bar Association voted \\nto give him a unanimous rating of ``well-qualified,'' and let me tell \\nyou why. No. 1, he starts with outstanding academic credentials. \\nProfessor Bibas graduated summa cum laude and Phi Beta Kappa from \\nColumbia University, and he did so at the age of 19. After Columbia, he \\nstudied at Oxford University in England and earned his law degree from \\nYale University.\\n  He has clerked at the highest levels of our Federal court system. He \\nclerked for U.S. Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy and Judge \\nPatrick Higginbotham on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth \\nCircuit.\\n  The fact is, Professor Bibas is an accomplished legal scholar. For 16 \\nyears, he has served as law professor at two outstanding universities--\\nthe University of Iowa College of Law and the University of \\nPennsylvania School of Law. Professor Bibas has been a prolific author \\nwhose academic writings are frequently cited by the U.S. Supreme Court, \\ncourts of appeals, and other law professors. He has written two books \\nand more than 60 articles, many of which have focused on criminal law \\nand procedures. In fact, in his writings, he has expressed views \\nregarding criminal justice reform that I suspect many of my Democratic \\ncolleagues would share. For instance, Professor Bibas has criticized \\nwhat he sees as the overuse of plea bargains in our courts as being \\nunfair to criminal defendants who then never get their day in court.\\n  So there is no question that Professor Bibas has very extensive \\nacademic credentials, but he is also an experienced attorney. He has \\nserved on both sides of our criminal justice system. He has been a \\nprosecutor, and he\\n\\n\\nhas been a defense attorney. He has a balanced perspective from both \\nsides of this part of our judicial system. He served as a Federal \\nprosecutor in New York City, where he prosecuted over 100 criminal \\ncases.\\n  Currently, he is the director of the Supreme Court Clinic at the \\nUniversity of Pennsylvania. Professor Bibas also argued six cases \\nbefore the U.S. Supreme Court. He won a landmark U.S. Supreme Court \\ndecision for a criminal defendant in the Padilla v. Kentucky case, a \\ncase that held criminal defense attorneys must advise their noncitizen \\nclients about the deportation risk associated with a guilty plea. That \\nwas a Professor Bibas case. He has represented dozens of other clients \\nbefore the Supreme Court, and most of those cases were pro bono \\nclients--clients he did not charge any fees because they couldn't \\nafford experienced counsel. He voluntarily provided that service for \\nthem.\\n  Over the course of the work he has done, as a result of the work he \\nhas done for the Supreme Court, he has been praised by both Justices \\nKagan and Ginsberg. Justice Ginsberg praised him as ``among the very \\nbest of lawyers presenting cases to the Supreme Court.''\\n  I hope all of my colleagues will support Professor Bibas's \\nnomination. He has outstanding credentials, he has a wealth of \\nexperience, and I hope everyone will see that in his background.\\n  I must state I am disappointed that Senator Durbin, our colleague \\nfrom Illinois, has stated that he opposes Professor Bibas's nomination. \\nSenator Durbin has stated that his opposition is because of an \\nunpublished academic paper that Professor Bibas drafted in 2009. In \\nthat paper, he proposed the consideration of the use of corporal \\npunishment as an alternative to imprisonment for certain criminal \\noffenses, but Professor Bibas has stated unequivocally that he decided \\nnot to publish the paper because he realized that idea was wrong, was \\ndeeply offensive, and he does not support corporal punishment for \\ncriminals.\\n  Professor Bibas also testified at his confirmation hearing that he \\nfully understands and respects the difference between the role of a \\nprofessor who considers theoretical questions and writes about them, on \\nthe one hand, versus, on the other hand, a judge who is deciding cases \\nthat impact the lives of real people.\\n  One of the most important reasons I am an enthusiastic supporter of \\nProfessor Bibas is his clear understanding of the role of a judge in \\nthe American constitutional system. From my review of his record and \\nfrom my conversation with him, it is clear he understands the proper \\nrole of a judge is to apply the law, including the Constitution, as \\nwritten and not to make policy himself and that his obligation is to \\ntreat everyone absolutely equally, regardless of race, sex, wealth, \\npolitical affiliation, political connections, or anything else.\\n  Unfortunately, many liberals and progressives have a very different \\nview of a judge. Many of my colleagues and others believe the \\nConstitution is a living document, by which they mean that it really \\nmeans whatever a judge decides it means. Under this view, changes to \\nthe law and Constitution can be made by unelected, unaccountable judges \\nwho then substitute their policy preference for the preference of the \\nAmerican people as reflected in their elected representatives. Some who \\nhold this view even think judges should take into account such factors \\nas a person's race, sex, wealth, or political affiliation in deciding \\ncases. In my view, that is a deeply flawed view of the law and is \\nfundamentally inconsistent with the principles of the separation of \\npowers that is essential to our democracy, the sovereignty of the \\nAmerican people, and the fair and equal application of the law to all \\npeople. Contrary to this view, Professor Bibas understands the proper \\nrole of a judge is to apply the law as written and to treat everyone \\nwho comes before him equally, not to impose his policy preferences or \\nimpose the law differently for different people.\\n  Finally, let me say a word about Professor Bibas's temperament and \\nsuitability for the bench. I think it is very clear that not only does \\nhe understand the role a judge is supposed to play, but he is a man of \\ncharacter and of a temperament that makes him very fit to be a judge. I \\nwill give you an example. In one letter of support for his nomination, \\na bipartisan group of 121 law professors from across the ideological \\nspectrum stated that ``his fair-mindedness, conscientiousness, and \\npersonal integrity are beyond question.''\\n  In another quote, ``We have no doubt that his judicial temperament \\nwill reflect these qualities and that he will faithfully discharge his \\nduty to apply the law fairly and evenhandedly in all matters before \\nhim.''\\n  I am very pleased and proud to support Professor Bibas's nomination \\nto the Third Circuit. I am completely confident he has the intellect, \\nexperience, temperament, and respect for the limited role of a judge in \\nour system, those attributes that are necessary for him to excel as a \\nFederal appellate judge, and I am pleased to speak on behalf of this \\nhighly qualified nominee. I urge all of my colleagues to support his \\nconfirmation.\\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that notwithstanding rule \\nXXII, all postcloture time on the Bibas nomination expire at 1:45 p.m. \\ntoday.\", u'turn': 2, u'speaker': u'Mr. TOOMEY', u'itemno': 2}, {u'kind': u'speech', u'speaker_bioguide': None, u'text': u'  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sasse).

Mr. President, I see my friend and colleague from \\nPennsylvania on the floor. We have worked together on a number of \\nthings over the years, including now, working together to impose and \\nreally enforce sanctions against North Korea, putting together a bill \\nmodeled after the Iran sanctions bill so we are serious about working \\nto get China and others to come to the table. I thank my colleague for \\nhis work on that.\\n  Where we disagree strongly is on the bill that has emerged from the \\nHouse of Representatives, the so-called tax reform bill. The Senator \\nfrom Pennsylvania said people should be excited to see it. I can assure \\nyou, if you are a millionaire or billionaire, you are going to be \\nreally excited about the bill that is coming out of the House and \\nsupported by President Trump.\\n  I want to talk a little bit about tax reform because we need tax \\nreform in America. We need to simplify our Tax Code. It has been gummed \\nup over many years with special tax breaks that are there not because \\nthey make good sense for the American people but because somebody was \\nable to hire a high-priced lobbyist to give them a break the rest of \\nthe country does not enjoy. We need to simplify our Tax Code, and we \\nneed to reform our Tax Code.\\n  Unfortunately, what we are seeing come from Republicans today, \\nsupported by the Trump administration, doesn't do that. In fact, what \\nit will do is provide full-time employment for tax accountants around \\nthe country because it creates all sorts of special provisions for \\npowerful, special interests. It will dramatically cut taxes for big \\nmultinational corporations and for millionaires and billionaires, and \\neverybody else is going to be left to pick up the bill in one way or \\nanother.\\n  Now we know why this has been cooked up behind closed doors for so \\nlong. People knew it would have a lot of turbulence when it emerged. \\nSecondly, we know why there is such a desperate effort to ram this huge \\ntax proposal through the House and the Senate--because people don't \\nwant the American people to figure out exactly what is in it because \\nwhen they do, they are going to see it is bad for everybody but the \\nfolks who are at the very top or who are very powerful.\\n  The good news is that people have scrambled to begin to look at this. \\nIn fact, certain groups like Realtors--we all have Realtors in all our \\nneighborhoods. They are often very connected to our community. They \\nknow exactly what is going on. So they have been monitoring this \\nRepublican tax plan and raising concerns about it. In fact, they said \\njust a few days ago that because there was this effort ``to speed tax \\nlegislation through the House by Thanksgiving and get it to Mr. Trump \\nby the end of the year, `we didn't feel like we could wait,''' said the \\nrepresentatives from the National Association of Realtors.\\n  So they began to do an analysis of the impact, and here is what they \\nhad to say today when they caught a glimpse of what was actually in the \\nRepublican Trump bill. They said that\\n\\n\\nthey are reviewing the details, but at first glance it appears to \\n``confirm many of our biggest concerns'' about the plan. ``Eliminating \\nor nullifying the tax incentives for homeownership puts home values and \\nmiddle class homeowners at risk.''\\n  We will be hearing more from them, but they commissioned a study that \\nwas done by PricewaterhouseCoopers, which concluded that if you have \\nadjusted gross income between $50,000 and $200,000 and you are a \\nhomeowner, on average, you are going to see your taxes go up. They also \\nconcluded that home values around the country would fall by 10 \\npercent--not sure when they would begin to recover, but they would fall \\nby 10 percent. Home values would go down, and taxes for middle-class \\nhomeowners would go up.\\n  Homebuilders, who are a really important part of our economy, are \\nalready against this strongly. They have made it clear that this would \\nhurt new homebuilding around the country, which, as we know, is an \\nimportant driver in our economy.\\n  Even NFIB, the National Federation of Independent Business, took a \\nlook at the bill and said: ``[It] leaves too many small businesses \\nbehind.''\\n  I will tell you exactly who this helps. This helps big, multinational \\ncorporations. When you drop the tax rate to 20 percent, they get a $2 \\ntrillion tax windfall. I would be happy to talk to my colleagues about \\ncorporate tax reform that doesn't blow up the deficit, but this \\nproposal is a $2 trillion giveaway to big, multinational corporations \\nunder the theory that somehow, when you give a big tax break to a \\nmultinational corporation, it is actually going to increase the wages \\nof their workers. Well, we know that just isn't so. We know it from \\nindependent analysts.\\n  The nonpartisan, professional Congressional Research Service has \\nlooked at the claims of the proponents of this bill and said: No, this \\nisn't going to be a big boost to workers; it is going to be a big boost \\nto the owners of the corporations.\\n  If you don't like nonpartisan analysis--and you know we have a new \\nwhole machinery of fake news around here and around this country--why \\ndon't we listen to the CEOs themselves? Here is what Reuters reported \\nin a headline: ``CEOs suggest Trump tax cut may lift investors more \\nthan jobs.'' That is what the CEOs say. Do you know what? We know from \\nour own experience and our own observations that is absolutely true.\\n  Let's look at the real world. We have seen record increases in \\ncorporate profits over the last many years--record increases. Did that \\nextra money, did those bigger profits go to higher wages for American \\nworkers? They did not. They have been flat. They have been stagnant. We \\nhave had a growing gap between rising corporate profits and the wages \\nof people who work for those corporations. So now we are going to give \\nthose same multinational corporations another $2 trillion windfall and \\nthink it is going to somehow trickle down to the workers? It just is \\nnot the case. That is not how they are using their profits.\\n  The owners of those corporations will pocket the overwhelming lion's \\nshare for themselves. We know that because that is what they have been \\ndoing already, and giving them another $2 trillion isn't going to \\nchange that pattern.\\n  To add insult to injury, not only is this going to be a tax windfall \\nfor big corporations that have record profits right now, but because of \\nthe way this is designed with respect to the international Tax Code, it \\nis going to create incentives for American corporations to move from \\nBaltimore, MD, overseas or from any other place in the United States \\noverseas. I am not just talking about moving their profits to tax \\nshelters, which you see happen today. You know they park their profits \\nin the Cayman Islands, and they park their intellectual property in \\nlow-tax havens. Because of the way they have designed this--a 10 \\npercent average international rate--they are actually encouraging \\nAmerican businesses and corporations to move their operations and their \\njobs overseas.\\n  Let's look at another part of the plan. We keep hearing from our \\ncolleagues that this is going to help folks in the middle class. Let's \\nlook at the estate tax. If you are an American couple today and your \\nestate is less than $11 million, you don't pay one penny in Federal \\nestate tax--not one. Somehow it became an imperative of the \\nRepublicans, who put together this plan, to give a tax break to people \\nwith estates of over $11 million. So, first, they lift that cap from \\n$11 million to somewhere like $20, $22 million, and then they get rid \\nof it altogether. That doesn't help a single American household with an \\nestate that is less than $11 million. We are talking about 2 out of \\nevery 1,000 American households that will benefit. That apparently was \\na big priority of the Trump administration and the Republicans, who put \\ntogether this plan.\\n  So who is going to pay for it? Who is going to pay for the $2 \\ntrillion tax cut for big multinational corporations? Who is going to \\npay for the windfall tax break for big, big estates? Everybody else. \\nThat is why the Realtors are against it. That is why the homebuilders \\nare against it. That is why others are already against it, along with \\nlots of other groups. Middle-class taxpayers are going to have to pick \\nup the tab.\\n  Do you know what they do in this bill, this Republican bill? They \\neliminate the ability of Americans to deduct their State and local \\ntaxes. Except for property taxes, all of those State and local taxes \\nare now going to be paid on twice. You are going to pay your State and \\nlocal government, and then out of that same dollar, you are going to \\npay your Federal tax. That is double taxation.\\n  Here is the irony. If you are a corporation in one of those States, \\nyou get to deduct your State and local taxes in whatever State it may \\nbe. If you are a corporation, you get to take that deduction. If you \\nare workers, if you are homeowners, no, you don't get to take that \\ndeduction. You are going to pay more.\\n  Here is the really ironic thing. After they provide these big tax \\nbreaks to multinational corporations and millionaires and billionaires \\nand raise taxes on millions of middle-class families, they are still \\nleaving this country with a $1.5 trillion debt. It is written right \\ninto the budget.\\n  I served as the senior Democrat on the House Budget Committee for a \\nlong time. Speaker Ryan used to be the chairman of that committee. He \\ntalked at length about the dangers of rising national debt. Do you know \\nwhat? This is a serious issue. I used to think my Republican colleagues \\nwere serious about it, but now we discover they were only using that as \\na lever to justify their cause for cutting Medicare, cutting Medicaid, \\ncutting Social Security, cutting education: Oh, the debt is really \\nhigh; we have to cut all these things. But tax cuts for big \\ncorporations and millionaires and billionaires, let's add that to the \\nnational credit card. That is $1.5 trillion to be paid for by everybody \\nelse--our kids and grandkids.\\n  Do you know what will happen? We will pass this tax cut for the \\nspecial interests and powerful Americans, and then all of a sudden, I \\nassure you, our Republican friends will rediscover their concern about \\nthe national debt. They will rediscover it once they get through with \\nthis windfall tax cut, and then they will want to come around and cut \\nMedicare and Medicaid and education.\\n  Do you know how we know that? They have already told us. In the \\nbudget that passed this Senate and the House, they called for cutting \\nMedicare by almost $500 billion--$473 billion to be exact--cutting \\nMedicaid by a trillion dollars, cutting education investments very \\ndeeply, cutting our investments in national infrastructure. So we know \\nthat once they blow up the debt by another $1.5 trillion, they are \\ngoing to come right back and say to seniors on Medicare or Americans \\nwho rely on Medicaid or our kids whose education we want to invest in: \\nSorry, now we have that national debt we just created. Let's come back \\nand cut everything else.\\n  I really hope that everyone will take a step back. We should not rush \\nthrough something that will do great damage to the country and great \\ndamage to the middle class just because of someone's political \\nimperative to get something--anything--done. The reality is that while \\nwe do need tax reform, we don't want to mess things up even worse than \\nthey are today.\\n  I would welcome the opportunity to work on a bipartisan basis for \\ngenuine\\n\\n\\ntax reform and simplification of the Tax Code, but I will not support \\nany effort that hikes our national debt by $1.5 trillion in order to \\ngive big tax breaks to multinational corporations and millionaires and \\nbillionaires. We can do a whole lot better. We should do better.\\n  Thank you.\", u'turn': 4, u'speaker': u'Mr. VAN HOLLEN', u'itemno': 4}, {u'kind': u'speech', u'speaker_bioguide': u'F000062', u'text': u\"  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, last Thursday, Leader McConnell filed \\ncloture on four circuit court nominees, including two nominees who had \\nbeen voted out of the Judiciary Committee that very morning.\\n  Voting on four controversial circuit court nominees in 1 week is \\nhighly unusual, as is voting on nominees just days after they have \\nmoved out of committee.\\n  Senators who aren't on the Judiciary Committee deserve time to \\nconsider nominees, review their backgrounds, and make an informed \\ndecision for their vote.\\n  But that is not what is happening in the Senate this week. Instead, \\nRepublican Senate leadership is pushing President Trump's judges \\nthrough as quickly as possible.\\n  Jamming through as many controversial judges as possible in as short \\na time as possible--to lifetime appointments, no less--is \\nirresponsible. I cannot remember a time when we had cloture votes on \\nfour circuit nominees in 1 week.\\n  It is important to understand the context in which we find ourselves.\\n  After failing to repeal the Affordable Care Act and with the \\nRepublican tax reform plan facing opposition within his own party, \\nPresident Trump has turned more and more to Executive orders to \\ninfluence policy.\\n  As we have seen, move after move has run into opposition in Federal \\ncourts. So it is really no surprise that Republicans are trying to \\nstack those courts with ideological judges whom they hope and expect \\nwill uphold the President's harmful policies.\\n  Consider how many Trump actions have or will see time in the \\ncourtroom, and you begin to understand why Republicans are rushing to \\nfill these vacancies--after allowing countless vacancies to remain \\nunfilled at the end of the last administration.\\n  In each of the following cases, the President and Senate Republicans \\nseem to hope that the outcome will be different with a transformed \\njudiciary.\\n  The President's Muslim travel ban has been struck down by multiple \\ncourts who ruled that the ban is based on religion and suspending the \\nrefugee program is discriminatory, with no basis in fact. The President \\nwent so far as to personally insult some of the judges who heard \\narguments on the travel ban.\\n  The President's decision to end the DACA program is also likely to \\nfind its way into the courtroom. Beginning on March 5, 2018, it is \\nestimated that around 1,000 DACA recipients per day will lose their \\nprotection from deportation. By ending the program and thrusting \\n690,000 young people into legal limbo, the President ensured that \\nlawsuits would be filed, and he certainly is hopeful that conservative \\njudges are on the stand to hear the cases.\\n  We have also seen the Trump administration make moves to restrict \\nwomen's access to healthcare. One woman had to go to Federal court \\ntwice to challenge the government's efforts to restrict her access to \\nreproductive care. The full D.C. Circuit chided the attempt to \\n``bulldoze over constitutional lines'' and deny this 17-year-old young \\nwoman court-approved reproductive care. Republicans tried to block \\nthree of President Obama's nominees to this same court and now are \\nrushing to fill its one vacancy as quickly as is possible. That is not \\na coincidence.\\n  President Trump's voter fraud commission will also certainly end up \\nin legal battles. At least eight lawsuits have been filed against the \\nPresident's Presidential Commission on Election Integrity, created to \\ninvestigate false claims that 3 million people voted illegally last \\nyear. It is possible the commission has already violated Federal laws \\nwith regard to how it handled sensitive information. This is already \\nthe subject of ongoing litigation.\\n  These are just a handful of Trump actions that will see time in \\ncourt. They highlight not only what is at state, but also why the \\nPresident is so anxious to hurry judges that he has selected on the \\nbench.\\n  I would add that Republicans are now rushing to fill judicial \\nvacancies for this President after spending years blocking President \\nObama from filling many of these same vacancies. It actually is the \\nmost egregious effort I have ever seen.\\n  This record of obstruction dates back to 2001 during the Clinton \\nadministration. Senate Republicans used secret holds on nominees to \\nprevent judicial nominees from receiving committee hearings or floor \\nvotes. This resulted in Republicans ``pocket filibustering'' nearly 70 \\nof President Clinton's circuit and district court nominees, preventing \\ntheir confirmation. As discussed by Senator Leahy when he served as \\nchair and ranking member of the committee, Republicans would block \\nnominees through pocket filibustering, which meant they would deny \\nnominees hearings or up-or-down votes in committee. This is a chart \\nthat lists those nominees.\\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have the chart printed in \\nthe Record following my remarks.\\n  In the first 5 years of the Obama administration, Republicans forced \\nObama's district court nominees to wait nearly three times as long and \\ncircuit court nominees nearly twice as long as Bush nominees for \\nconfirmation votes. During the final 2 years of his Presidency, Senate \\nRepublicans engaged in a historic blockade of judicial nominees.\\n  It wasn't just the unprecedented decision to block Chief Judge \\nMerrick Garland for the Supreme Court.\\n  During the final 2 years of President Obama's administration, only 22 \\njudicial nominees were confirmed--and just nine in the final year.\\n  That is the lowest number of judges confirmed in a 2-year Congress \\nsince President Truman was in office. Contrast this with the last 2 \\nyears of the Bush administration when Democrats were in the Senate \\nmajority and still confirmed 68 of his nominees.\\n  In the last 2 years under President Obama, there were 53 article III \\njudicial nominees pending in the Senate at the end of 2016. That is 53 \\nnominees who Republicans either refused to hold hearings on or refused \\nto confirm once they were on the floor.\\n  In fact, of those 53 nominees, 25 had been voted out of committee and \\nwere waiting for confirmation on the Senate floor. All they needed was \\nfor the Republican leadership to bring them up for a floor vote.\\n  Twenty-three of those 25 nominees had been unanimously voice-voted \\nout of committee with overwhelming bipartisan support. Still, \\nRepublicans refused to confirm them.\\n  Since my colleagues have spent some time noting that three of the \\ncircuit court nominees we are considering this week are women, I would \\nlike to note that half of the nominees Republicans blocked from \\nbecoming circuit and district court judges last year were women.\\n  Here is the point: Republican leadership wanted those seats, \\nincluding the Supreme Court, left open in the hopes that a Republican \\nwould be elected President and pick new judges. They ignored the needs \\nof country and the judiciary for their own political wants.\\n  Two of the nominees we are considering this week--Amy Coney Barrett \\nand Stephanos Bibas--are filling seats that President Obama had \\nnominated African-American women to. Neither were confirmed because \\nRepublican home-State senators didn't return blue slips. That is a \\nfact.\\n  Judge John Bush, who now sits on the Court of Appeals for the Sixth \\nCircuit, was likewise confirmed only because Leader McConnell refused \\nto return a blue slip on a well-qualified woman, Kentucky Supreme Court \\nJustice Lisabeth Tabor Hughes, whom President Obama had nominated last \\nyear.\\n  Republicans exploited the blue slip process during the Obama \\nPresidency, but today we hear constant rumors that Republicans want to \\ndo away with the process--another tool allowing them to ram through \\nmore judges.\\n  It is worth noting that, even though Democrats had sincere, \\nlegitimate concerns about the writings of John Bush--which included him \\nequating slavery and abortion--his nomination was rushed through by \\nLeader McConnell.\\n  John Bush was confirmed just 73 days after he was nominated. In fact, \\nPresident Trump's first four circuit court\\n\\n\\nnominees waited just 84 days, on average, from nomination until \\nconfirmation. By contrast President Obama's first four circuit court \\nnominees waited an average of 213 days. That is nearly three times \\nlonger.\\n  The hypocrisy we are seeing on display is stunning. With that in \\nmind, I want to say a few words about the nominees themselves.\\n  Our Nation's appellate courts are the final deciders of the vast \\nmajority of cases, so a nominees experience matters a great deal to me. \\nHowever, the first nominee we voted on, Professor Amy Barrett, who has \\nnow been confirmed to the Seventh Circuit, had very limited experience.\\n  She did not have any experience as a judge, and she only worked on \\none trial before becoming a professor.\\n  Practically speaking, this meant the only record on which we could \\njudge her was her academic writings. In those writings, I was \\nespecially troubled by her position that Supreme Court precedents can \\nsimply be set aside when a Justice disagrees with them.\\n  The National Women's Law Center wrote that these writings ``raise \\nserious concerns'' about how Professor Barrett, if confirmed, ``would \\ninterpret, apply, and follow precedent, including Supreme Court \\nprecedent.'' In fact, they point out that Professor Barrett's ``prior \\nwritings consistently suggest that she believes precedents like Roe and \\nCasey should be considered weaker and are susceptible to challenge. . . \\n.''\\n  That is why I was unable to support Professor Barrett's nomination.\\n  The second nominee we voted on was Justice Joan Larsen for the Sixth \\nCircuit. Justice Larsen, who currently serves on the Michigan Supreme \\nCourt, has deeply troubling views on Presidential powers.\\n  In fact, she advocated for the Bush administration's view that the \\nPresident had the authority to disregard a law that Congress had just \\npassed, which prohibited the U.S. Government from using torture.\\n  It is no surprise that President Trump, who has shown contempt for \\nthe other coequal branches of government, nominated Justice Larsen. Her \\nviews are undoubtedly part of why the President included Justice Larsen \\non his short list of Supreme Court nominees last year.\\n  President Trump repeatedly made clear that he was only considering \\nnominees for the Supreme Court who passed his litmus tests, including \\nto overturn Roe v. Wade. Recall President Trump's interview with ``60 \\nMinutes'' immediately after he won the election. He said, ``I'm pro-\\nlife. And the judges are going to be pro-life.''\\n  He added that his judges were going to be ``very pro-Second \\nAmendment.''\\n  We heard from 30 groups who were concerned about Justice Larsen's \\nnomination, and several highlighted the danger of this litmus test.\\n  As Lambda Legal wrote, ``A decision by this Committee to advance her \\nnomination will be rightfully understood as not only a threat to Roe \\nbut also to the LGBT cases that were built upon Roe's foundation.''\\n  I opposed Justice Larsen's nomination.\\n  The third nominee we are considering is Justice Allison Eid for the \\nTenth Circuit. She was also included on President Trump's short list of \\nSupreme Court nominees last year.\\n  Since 2006, Justice Eid has served on the Colorado Supreme Court. A \\nreview of her opinions shows why the Denver Post wrote in September \\nbefore her hearing: ``On the state's high court, Eid has earned a \\nreputation as one of its most conservative members.'' Here are just a \\ncouple of examples.\\n  In 2014, the Colorado Supreme Court held that a worker who fell down \\na flight of stairs at her workplace and suffered multiple aneurysms as \\na result deserved to be compensated under the State's workplace \\ncompensation law. Justice Eid dissented, arguing that the employee did \\nnot deserve any compensation for her injuries, in City of Brighton v. \\nRodriguez.\\n  In 2012, Justice Eid was the lone dissenting vote when the Colorado \\nSupreme Court upheld a new redistricting map that was drawn to protect \\nresidents' constitutional right under the ``one person, one vote'' \\nstandard. The old map had unequal populations and was redone with the \\nextensive work of a trial court.\\n  On appeal, Justice Eid was the only dissenting judge, and she argued \\nto throw out the trial court's work because she believed it had not \\ngiven ``adequate weight'' to one entirely optional factor.\\n  Justice Eid's record has also led a number of organizations to oppose \\nher nomination, including the AFL-CIO, the Leadership Conference on \\nCivil and Human Rights--LCCR--and Planned Parenthood.\\n  I opposed Justice Eid's nomination.\\n  The final nominee we will vote on is Professor Stephanos Bibas for \\nthe Third Circuit. Like Professor Barrett, much of his legal career has \\nbeen spent in academia, so our job in reviewing his record is to \\ncarefully consider his writings.\\n  Professor Bibas's writings have focused on criminal law, and he has \\npushed forward controversial ideas about punishment. His most troubling \\nproposals were set out in a paper he wrote in 2009.\\n  In it, he argued that, for a wide variety of crimes, ``the default \\npunishment should be non-disfiguring corporal punishment, such as \\nelectric shocks.''\\n  Bibas also suggested ``putting offenders in the stocks or pillory, \\nwhere they would sit or stand for hours bent in uncomfortable \\npositions. Bystanders and victims could jeer and pelt them with rotten \\neggs and tomatoes (but not rocks).''\\n  For more severe crimes, he advocated ``multiple calibrated \\nelectroshocks or taser shots,'' with medical personnel on hand to \\nensure ``that the offender's health could bear it.''\\n  These views are shocking and outside of the mainstream. A few years \\nbefore Professor Bibas wrote his article, this body had already debated \\nand passed the Detainee Treatment Act in 2005, which prohibited \\n``cruel'' and ``degrading'' punishment of prisoners.\\n  I appreciate that Professor Bibas testified to the Judiciary \\nCommittee that he now understands that his views on use of corporal \\npunishment for prisoners are, in his words, ``wrong and deeply \\noffensive.''\\n  He came to this conclusion only after he repeatedly made public \\npresentations on his paper, including one to a Federalist Society \\nChapter entitled, ``Corporal Punishment, Not Imprisonment: The Shocking \\nCase for Hurting Criminals.''\\n  I cannot support Professor Bibas's nomination and will vote no.\\n  In closing, as my colleagues consider how they will vote on these and \\nother nominees, I would urge them to consider the broader context in \\nwhich we are considering this President's judicial nominees.\\n  We have a President who has demonstrated contempt for the rule of law \\nand for the independence of the federal judiciary. I am deeply \\nconcerned that this President expects the courts to just rubberstamp \\nhis policy preferences.\\n  For every judicial nomination, we have to consider carefully the \\nnominee's record and reflect on whether they can truly be fair, \\nindependent, and impartial--whether they will respect the rule of law. \\nFor these reasons and the records of the four nominees I have just \\ndiscussed, I cannot support them.\", u'turn': 5, u'speaker': u'Mrs. FEINSTEIN', u'itemno': 5}, {u'kind': u'recorder', u'speaker_bioguide': None, u'text': u'  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in ', u'turn': -1, u'speaker': u'The RECORDER', u'itemno': 6}, {u'kind': u'recorder', u'speaker_bioguide': None, u'text': u'the Record, as follows:\\n', u'turn': -1, u'speaker': u'The RECORDER', u'itemno': 7}, {u'kind': u'title', u'speaker_bioguide': None, u'text': u'                          CLINTON ADMINISTRATION: SENATE REPUBLICANS BLOCKED FROM CONFIRMATION VOTES OVER 60 JUDICIAL NOMINEES\\n                                                        [Source: Congressional Research Service]\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n                                                                                                  Hearing Date(s)                       Markup Date (if\\n                                             Name            Circuit/Court      First Nom Date        (if any)      Final Action Date         any)\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n                                                                      Circuit Court\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n1.................................

The Senator from Iowa.', u'turn': 6, u'speaker': u'The PRESIDING OFFICER', u'itemno': 11}, {u'kind': u'speech', u'speaker_bioguide': u'G000386', u'text': u\"  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, we are about to vote on our fourth \\ncircuit court nominee this week, and I am glad to speak in support of \\nthe nomination of Professor Bibas to serve on the Third Circuit Court \\nof Appeals. That court sits in Philadelphia. Professor Bibas is a \\nhighly qualified nominee. His background as a well-regarded legal \\nscholar and Supreme Court advocate will serve him well as a judge on \\nthat circuit.\\n  Additionally, Professor Bibas received a rare, unanimously ``well \\nqualified'' rating from the American Bar Association. My Democratic \\ncolleagues on the Judiciary Committee have expressed to me that the \\nABA's ratings are very important to their evaluation of nominees. Yet \\nall of the Democratic members of the committee voted against Professor \\nBibas in the committee, despite his having received the highest rating \\npossible. This is consistent with their votes against Professor Amy \\nBarrett, Justice Joan Larsen and Justice Allison Eid, all of whom \\nreceived ``well qualified'' ratings. It appears that my Democratic \\ncolleagues don't actually treat the ABA's ratings as particularly \\nimportant when it comes right down to practice.\\n  Professor Bibas is the son of a Greek immigrant who came to this \\ncountry after surviving the Nazi occupation of Greece. He boasts \\nimpressive academic credentials. He graduated from Columbia University \\nat the age of 19. He then received degrees from the University of \\nOxford and Yale Law School. After law school, Professor Bibas clerked \\nfor Judge Patrick Higginbotham of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the \\nFifth Circuit and then for Justice Anthony Kennedy of the U.S. Supreme \\nCourt.\\n  Following these prestigious clerkships, Professor Bibas became an \\nassistant U.S. attorney in the Southern District of New York. His \\nexperience as a prosecutor gave him a firsthand view of the problems \\nand injustices in the American criminal justice system. He decided to \\npursue a career as an academic, focusing then on improving the criminal \\njustice system for all involved.\\n\\n  Professor Bibas's first stint as a professor was in my home State of \\nIowa at the University of Iowa College of Law. He taught criminal law \\nand procedure there for 5 years. We were certainly lucky to have a \\nprofessor of his caliber. Professor Bibas then took a position on the \\nfaculty of the University of Pennsylvania Law School, where he has been \\nteaching since.\\n\\n\\n  Professor Bibas has been prolific in his academic writings, \\npublishing numerous articles on all aspects of criminal law. His \\nacademic work culminated in the publication of his book entitled ``The \\nMachinery of Criminal Justice.'' That book was published in 2012. In \\nthis book and in many of his articles, Professor Bibas criticized the \\ncurrent model of bureaucratic ``assembly line'' justice and America's \\nhigh incarceration rate. Much of his work is devoted to finding \\nsolutions to these problems. His academic work has certainly had an \\nimpact on the law. In fact, Professor Bibas is one of the most cited \\nlaw professors in judicial opinions. One study shows that he is the \\n15th most cited legal scholar by total judicial opinions, and he is the \\nfifth most cited in the area of criminal law--not bad for a relatively \\nyoung professor.\\n  Professor Bibas has also had a positive impact on colleagues and \\nstudents. The Judiciary Committee received a letter from 121 law \\nprofessors throughout our country representing a diverse range of \\nviewpoints. These professors support Professor Bibas's nomination, \\npointing to his--and this quote comes from the letter--``influential \\ncontributions to criminal law and procedure scholarship,'' as well as \\nhis ``fair-mindedness, conscientiousness, and personal integrity.''\\n  Professor Bibas also received a letter in support of his nomination \\nfrom many colleagues at the University of Pennsylvania. They stated \\nthat he has been ``an outstanding scholar, teacher, and colleague'' at \\nPenn.\\n  Professor Bibas also has extensive litigation experience. He is \\ncurrently the director of the University of Pennsylvania Law School's \\nSupreme Court Clinic. In this role, he and his students have \\nrepresented numerous litigants who could not otherwise afford top-\\nflight counsel. He has argued numerous cases before the Supreme Court, \\nand he obtained a significant victory in the landmark case of Padilla \\nv. Kentucky, which established a defendant's Sixth Amendment right to \\naccurate information about deportation before pleading guilty.\\n  One of our Supreme Court Justices, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, in a personal \\nletter to Professor Bibas that the Judiciary Committee received, called \\nhim one of the ``very best lawyers presenting cases to the Court.'' It \\nis kind of nice, if you are considered kind of a strict \\nconstructionist, that you get a letter like that from one of the more \\nactivist members of the Supreme Court.\\n  Some of my Democratic colleagues criticize Professor Bibas during his \\nconfirmation hearing for two really isolated events in the long and \\nillustrious career he has had.\\n  First, Democrats criticized Professor Bibas for prosecuting a minor \\ntheft of only $7 when he was an assistant U.S. attorney. This case took \\nplace nearly 20 years ago. But it was Professor Bibas's supervisor who \\nmade the decision to charge the defendant and, of course, required an \\nunderling by the name of Bibas to pursue the case even after it started \\nto fall apart.\\n  In his hearing, Professor Bibas readily acknowledged that the \\ndefendant should not have been prosecuted, and the professor stated \\nthis to our committee:\\n\\n       I learned from that mistake, and as a scholar, I have \\n     dedicated my career to trying to diagnose and prevent the \\n     causes of such errors in the future--inadequate Brady \\n     disclosure, new prosecutor syndrome, tunnel vision, jumping \\n     to conclusions, partisan mindsets. And I have testified \\n     before this committee on those very issues. And so I made a \\n     mistake. I apologized. I learned from it, and I have tried to \\n     improve the justice system going forward.''\\n\\n  Some of my colleagues have also criticized Professor Bibas for a \\nsingle article that he wrote but never published. This article endorsed \\nlimited forms of corporal punishment as an alternative to lengthy \\nprison sentences. But Professor Bibas reconsidered this idea soon after \\ncompleting the article. He concluded that it was a bad idea and did not \\npublish it. He completely disavowed the position in his book published \\nshortly thereafter.\\n  When asked about corporal punishment at his hearing, Professor Bibas \\nstated:\\n\\n       It is wrong. It is not American. It is not something I \\n     advocate. I categorically reject it.\\n\\n  Additionally, Professor Bibas's position on corporal punishment was \\nwell-intended. He was motivated to address overly harsh and \\nunproductively long prison sentences. As he said at his hearing, he \\nwanted to offer an answer to the question, ``Is there some way, any \\nway, we can avoid the hugely destructive effect [of imprisonment] both \\non prisoners' own lives and on the families, the friends, the \\ncommunities?''\\n  In the time since Professor Bibas wrote the article, he has offered \\nmore creative solutions to the disruptions caused by lengthy prison \\nsentences. As an example, instead of suffering through forced \\nindolence, prisoners could work and develop work-related skills in \\nanticipation of their release from prison.\\n  Professor Bibas's scholarship, as I have stated and quoted from, is a \\ntestimony to his devotion to the rule of law and the notion of equal \\njustice before the law. It is very clear that he cares very deeply \\nabout how the criminal justice system impacts defendants, victims, \\nfamilies, and entire communities. As you can tell, I am very confident \\nthat Professor Bibas will make an excellent judge on the Third Circuit \\nCourt of Appeals.\\n  I yield the floor.\", u'turn': 7, u'speaker': u'Mr. GRASSLEY', u'itemno': 12}, {u'kind': u'speech', u'speaker_bioguide': None, u'text': u'  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, President Trump will be leaving on a \\nlengthy trip to Asia. He will be visiting Japan, the Republic of Korea, \\nChina, the Philippines, and Vietnam. In each of those countries, we \\nexpect that the No. 1 national security issue that will be talked about \\nis North Korea.\\n  North Korea's dangerous activities are certainly putting not only the \\nregion but the global community at risk. They have a nuclear weapons \\ncapability. They currently have the ability to explode a nuclear \\ndevice. They are working on delivery systems that could very well reach \\nnot just the region but the United States. They are violating \\ninternational commitments. They have done dozens of tests this year \\nalone, all in violation of those international commitments.\\n  We have had a strong policy to try to isolate North Korea. The United \\nStates has led in the imposition of sanctions. We introduced this year \\nand passed the Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act. \\nIt passed this body by a 98-to-2 vote. I notice the chairman of the \\nSenate Foreign Relations Committee is on the floor, and he was one of \\nthe strong architects of that legislation. The United Nations Security \\nCouncil passed Resolutions Nos. 2270, 2321, and 2375. The President has \\nissued Executive Order No. 13810.\\n  We have been asking for rigorous enforcement of sanctions. We could \\ndo more. One of the points I hope the President will be talking about \\nduring his trip is robust and rigorous enforcement of the sanctions \\nthat are out there. And I see there is activity taking place in the \\nBanking Committee. We have legislation in the Senate Foreign Relations \\nCommittee. If additional sanction authority is needed, let's do that. \\nThat is important.\\n  But what additional things can we do, and what should the President \\nbe promoting as he visits Asia? First, let me give you a few \\nunacceptable alternatives.\\n  We cannot lead with military intervention. The casualties could be \\nastronomical. The technology to develop nuclear weapons would still \\nremain. Our allies are certainly not in agreement with that policy. \\nThere is no congressional authority for the use of force.\\n  A second alternative that is not acceptable is to just continue the \\ncurrent course. North Korea is developing a delivery system that will \\nthreaten not just Japan and the Republic of Korea but also Guam and the \\nUnited States. We will see an arms race if we do not effectively stop \\nNorth Korea's nuclear program.\\n  President Trump's statement, in my view, made the challenges even \\nmore dramatic. His ``America first'' statements isolate America and \\nmake it more difficult for us to get the type of support we need. I \\nthink his reckless statements make it more likely rather than less \\nlikely that we will use a military option.\\n  What we need is a surge in diplomacy. A surge in diplomacy can very \\nwell start with the meeting between President Xi of China and President \\nTrump of the United States. We have a\\n\\n\\ncommon agenda. Neither China nor the United States want to see a \\nnuclear North Korea. Both China and the United States recognize that \\nthe Kim Jong Un regime in North Korea is unreliable. We are both \\nlooking for an off-ramp so we don't need to use a military option.\\n  China has the capacity to turn the pressure on North Korea through \\nsanctions that could change the equation in North Korea. China and \\nNorth Korea have a common agenda. Both want to preserve the regime of \\nKim Jong Un--Kim Jong Un for obvious reasons; China, because they do \\nnot want to see a unified Korean Peninsula under Western influence.\\n  Our objective is for North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons. \\nChina needs to be convinced that our objective is the same as theirs. \\nWith that, they could instill greater pressure on North Korea, and \\ndiplomacy could work.\\n  What should be our objective? We have to be realistic. In the short \\nterm, it should be containment. Freeze the current program. Stop the \\ntesting. Make it clear that we cannot allow these programs to continue. \\nUltimately, we want to see a nonnuclear Korean Peninsula.\\n  We know that in the past--the 1994 framework agreement with North \\nKorea lasted for 8 years. So there is an ability to make progress, but \\nwe have to develop confidence between the parties.\\n  In conjunction with this, let me urge us not to lose sight of the \\nNorth Korean people. Let's continue our focus on the human rights \\nproblems in the country. Let's work with our allies, particularly Japan \\nand the Republic of Korea, and let's rigorously enforce the sanctions \\nuntil progress is made.\\n  We can achieve an alternative outcome in North Korea, but it requires \\nU.S. leadership, and President Trump needs to engage on that issue. We \\nneed confidence building, and we need to make sure that we make \\nprogress. Time is not on our side, but there is still time to make \\nprogress. Without a diplomatic surge, there are only unacceptable \\noptions. Our goal should be a more peaceful, stable, and prosperous \\nnortheast Asia community.\\n  I yield the floor.\", u'turn': 9, u'speaker': u'Mr. CARDIN', u'itemno': 14}, {u'kind': u'speech', u'speaker_bioguide': None, u'text': u'  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and \\ncongratulate Cole Nicholson of Bondurant, Iowa for earning the rank of \\nEagle Scout.\\n  The Eagle Scout designation is the highest advancement rank in \\nscouting. Approximately two percent of Boy Scouts earn the Eagle Scout \\nAward. The award is a performance-based achievement with high standards \\nthat have been well-maintained over the past century.\\n  To earn the Eagle Scout rank, a Boy Scout is obligated to pass \\nspecific tests that are organized by requirements and merit badges, as \\nwell as completing an Eagle Scout Project to benefit the community. For \\nhis project, Cole saw a need for exercise stations, consisting of\\n\\n\\nitems like bars, boxes, and balance beams, around Lake Petocka in \\nBondurant. After going through the approval process with the city and \\nraising the $1,600 from friends and local organizations, Cole led a \\nteam that installed the equipment last October, and has already seen \\npeople using them. He completed his Eagle Scout journey at the young \\nage of 14, years younger than most Eagle Scouts earn their ranking. The \\nwork ethic Cole has shown in his Eagle Scout Project and throughout his \\nscouting career speaks volumes about his commitment to serving a cause \\ngreater than himself and assisting his community.\\n  Mr. Speaker, the example set by this young man and his supportive \\nfamily and community demonstrates the rewards of hard work, dedication, \\nand perseverance. I am honored to represent Cole and his family in the \\nUnited States Congress. I ask that my colleagues in the United States \\nHouse of Representatives join me in congratulating him on obtaining the \\nEagle Scout ranking and in wishing him nothing but continued success in \\nhis future education and career.\\n', u'turn': 0, u'speaker': u'Mr. YOUNG of Iowa', u'itemno': 2}, {u'kind': u'linebreak', u'speaker_bioguide': None, u'text': u'                          ____________________\\n\\n\\n', u'turn': -1, u'speaker': u'None', u'itemno': 3}], u'header': {u'extension': True, u'vol': u'163', u'wkday': u'Thursday', u'chamber': u'House', u'num': u'178', u'year': u'2017', u'month': u'November', u'pages': u'E1491-E1492', u'day': u'2'}, u'doc_title': u'TRIBUTE TO EAGLE SCOUT COLE NICHOLSON', u'id': u'CREC-2017-11-02-pt1-PgE1491-6', u'title': u'TRIBUTE TO EAGLE SCOUT COLE NICHOLSON'}{u'content': [{u'kind': u'speech', u'speaker_bioguide': None, u'text': u\"  The SPEAKER.

Mr. President, the Senate continues to press forward \\nconfirming President Trump's outstanding nominations to the Federal \\ncourts. Already this week, we have confirmed two strong, smart, and \\ntalented women to serve on our Nation's circuit courts. Today we will \\nconsider two more well-qualified nominees: Allison Eid and Stephanos \\nBibas.\\n  First, we will confirm Allison Eid, whom the President has nominated \\nto serve on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit. Justice \\nEid has big shoes to fill in taking that seat--it became vacant when \\nNeil Gorsuch ascended to the Supreme Court. It is a hard act to follow. \\nYet I have every confidence she will excel in the role. You see, \\nnominees such as Justice Eid and Professor Bibas are more than just the \\nsum of their credentials--although theirs are indeed impressive, and I \\nwill expand on those credentials in just a moment--nominees such as \\nthese also believe, like Justice Gorsuch, that the role of a judge is \\nto apply the law equally to everyone and to do so as the law is \\nactually written, not as they wish it might be.\\n  As Judge Gorsuch said, ``A judge who likes every outcome he reaches \\nis very likely a bad judge--stretching for results he prefers rather \\nthan those the law demands,'' or, put a different way, ``I don't think \\nthere are red judges, and I don't think there are blue judges. All \\njudges wear black.'' That is the view of Neil Gorsuch. That is the view \\nof Allison Eid and Stephanos Bibas. That is just the kind of fair-\\nminded judge we want serving on the bench and just the kind of fair-\\nminded judge we are confirming this week, including the exceptional \\nnominees before us.\\n  Justice Allison Eid graduated from the University of Chicago Law \\nSchool with high honors. She earned the opportunity to clerk for Fifth \\nCircuit Judge Jerry E. Smith and then for Justice Clarence Thomas \\nbefore joining the faculty of the University of Colorado School of Law, \\nwhere she served as a professor for our colleague Senator Gardner. When \\nhe introduced his former professor before the Judiciary Committee, \\nSenator Gardner noted how much she cared about ``robust debates and \\nhearing the views of others.''\\n  ``Justice Eid,'' he said, ``was open to their views, engaging with \\nthem, and [was] never biased against different perspectives.''\\n  Later, Justice Eid was appointed to serve as Colorado's solicitor \\ngeneral and, in 2006, to the Colorado Supreme Court. Two years later, \\n75 percent of Coloradans voted to retain her. Her time on the State's \\nhigh court has been marked by clear and precise writing and judicial \\nindependence.\\n  One of Justice Eid's former clerks wrote a column in the Denver Post \\nin support of her nomination. As a jurist, this clerk wrote, ``Eid \\ncommits her full mental energy and attention to each case, carefully \\nmastering every legal and factual detail in order to conduct a rigorous \\nanalysis dictated ultimately by the law.'' In addition, this former \\nclerk added a personal touch to Justice Eid's incredible resume:\\n\\n       For women striving to achieve that elusive balance between \\n     family life and a successful career, it can be hard to find \\n     strong role models. But Colorado's Allison Eid is a shining \\n     example.\\n\\n  Justice Eid is clearly well qualified for the position to which she \\nhas been nominated. She is just the kind of fair-minded judge people \\nwould want hearing their case. I look forward to supporting her \\nnomination today, and I ask each of my colleagues to join me in \\nconfirming the nomination of this extremely well qualified jurist.\\n  I would ask them to join me in supporting Professor Bibas too. \\nProfessor Bibas has served as assistant U.S. attorney. He has \\nexperience in private practice. He has clerked for a circuit court \\njudge and for Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy. Today he is a \\nprofessor at the University of Pennsylvania Law School, where, \\naccording to the former dean of students, he ``enjoys\\n\\n\\nthe give and take of discussion'' and is ``very fair, considerate, and \\nencouraging.''\\n  Moreover, as a bipartisan group of more than 100 law professors put \\nit in a letter to the Judiciary Committee, Professor Bibas's ``fair-\\nmindedness, conscientiousness, and personal integrity are beyond \\nquestion,'' and in their view, ``his judicial temperament will reflect \\nthese qualities and . . . he will faithfully discharge his duty to \\napply the law fairly and evenhandedly in all matters before him.''\\n  Professor Bibas also reminded us that he, like Justice Gorsuch and \\nJustice Eid, believes in a fair-minded approach to the law. In his \\nwords, ``People need to know and believe that judges will apply the law \\nimpartially and evenhandedly to all litigants, regardless of their \\nwealth or power.'' He is right.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Jeannie Klever, \\nwho has an extensive record of service in Sutter County, California, \\nwhich she has called home for the past 27 years. Jeannie embodies the \\nqualities of a community activist and public servant, and we are proud \\nto honor her today. Growing up in the 60's, Jeannie experienced a \\nmixture of gender and racial inequalities which influenced and shaped \\nher career choices. Her activism began at an early age when during \\nschool she protested an end to the Vietnam War. She also advocated for \\nmore on-site tutors for students of color and when met with opposition, \\nJeannie volunteered as a tutor through the rest of her school years. \\nShe strongly believes education was and remains the path out of \\npoverty.\\n   Jeannie's desire to help families with special needs children was \\ndue to the challenges her family endured after her brother was \\ndiagnosed with severe autism. She operated a Family Resource Center \\nthat delivered support services and resources to families of low income \\nand special needs adults and children. She taught self-advocacy for the \\nlocal school's individualized education programs and medical service \\nneeds students.\\n   Jeannie's community and public service involvement is extensive. \\nJeannie has been a member of and continues to support several nonprofit \\norganizations. For the past 15 years, she has sponsored an annual Art \\nContest for Sutter Union High School students. In 2008, Jeannie joined \\nthe local Democratic Party's central committee as a way to increase \\ncommunity engagement where she served three terms. In 2013, Jeannie \\njoined the U.S. House of Representatives as my district representative \\nserving Yuba and Sutter counties until her recent retirement.\\n   Jeannie continues to volunteer in the community and helps families \\nin need when she can. Jeannie has learned to appreciate the art culture \\nand enjoys mixed media arts as a way to relax. She and her husband Dale \\nare enjoying family time with their children and two grandchildren.\\n\", u'turn': 0, u'speaker': u'Mr. GARAMENDI', u'itemno': 3}, {u'kind': u'linebreak', u'speaker_bioguide': None, u'text': u'                          ____________________\\n\\n\\n', u'turn': -1, u'speaker': u'None', u'itemno': 4}], u'header': {u'extension': True, u'vol': u'163', u'wkday': u'Thursday', u'chamber': u'House', u'num': u'178', u'year': u'2017', u'month': u'November', u'pages': u'E1491', u'day': u'2'}, u'doc_title': u'2017 WOMAN OF THE YEAR AWARD WINNER--JEANNIE KLEVER', u'id': u'CREC-2017-11-02-pt1-PgE1491', u'title': None}{u'title': u'PUBLICATION OF BUDGETARY MATERIAL', u'content': [{u'text': u'COMMITTEE ALLOCATIONS OF THE FISCAL YEAR 2018 CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON ', u'kind': u'Unknown', u'speaker': u'Unknown', u'itemno': 0, u'turn': -1}, {u'kind': u'title', u'speaker_bioguide': None, u'text': u'                               THE BUDGET\\n\\n                                         House of Representatives,\\n\\n\\n                                      Committee on the Budget,\\n\\n                                 Washington, DC, November 2, 2017.\\n       Mr. Speaker, pursuant to section 5206 of H.

Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize the \\n100th anniversary of the Navy Pier and commemorate the beginning of the \\nPier's second century as a public community resource and treasured \\nChicago landmark. After 100 years of significant impact, Navy Pier has \\nbeen reimagined and adopted the new mission: Navy Pier is the\\n\\n\\nPeople's Pier, Chicago's lakefront treasure, welcoming all and offering \\ndynamic and eclectic experiences through partnerships and programs that \\ninspire discovery and wonder; Navy Pier opened to the public in 1916 \\nand originally named ``Municipal Pier No. 2; Navy Pier was built under \\nnationally-known architect Charles Sumner Frost, based on Daniel \\nBurham's ``Master Plan of Chicago.'' Municipal Pier was the first of \\nits kind to accommodate both the commercial shipping industry and \\nrecreation and entertainment for the public drawing over 3 million \\nvisitors annually.\\n  In 1917 it was adapted to house several regiments of soldiers, Red \\nCross, and ``Home Defense'' units and served as a barracks during World \\nWar I. It was officially renamed Navy Pier in 1927 as a tribute to the \\nNavy personnel who were housed at the Pier during the conflict. From \\n1941 to 1947, the Pier was leased to the U.S. Navy as a naval training \\ncenter for 60,000 recruits. One of those pilots who qualified for \\nmilitary service was President George H. W. Bush.\\n  Navy Pier was the original home to the University of Illinois at \\nChicago from 1946 to 1965, and more than 100,000 students attended \\nclasses during that time. Dubbed `Harvard on the Rocks,' the University \\nshared the space with the Chicago Police Department's Traffic Division, \\nthe North Pier Terminal Company, and several military detachments. The \\nPier was designated a Chicago historic landmark in 1977; between the \\nyears of 1978 through 1982, Navy Pier was host to ChicagoFest, a summer \\nmusic festival full of food, fun, and festivities. ChicagoFest \\neventually grew to become the Taste of Chicago, drawing millions of \\nguests to the Pier and spurring millions of dollars in economic impact.\\n  The Pier re-opened in 1995 following a $150 million redevelopment \\nhaving improvements made to nearly every aspect of the three-quarter \\nmile long public Pier. Since that renovation, year-round entertainment, \\nshopping, dining, attractions and exhibitions have positioned the Pier \\nas one of the most unique settings in the world; in July of 2011, Navy \\nPier, Inc., the newly formed nonprofit entity entrusted with the \\noperation and redevelopment of Navy Pier put forth The Centennial \\nVision, a framework for reimagining Navy Pier as a unique public space \\nand cultural mecca. The Centennial Vision's purpose is not only to \\nexpand the Pier's audience, but to enrich the experience of its guests. \\nThe Vision, divided into two phases, establishes a framework befitting \\nChicago, a world-class city, with a vibrant architectural, cultural, \\nand recreational landscape and includes a 30-year Sustainable Master \\nPlan to address the Pier's long-term environmental impact.\\n  With the completion of the Centennial Vision's ``Phase 1'' in 2016, a \\nrecord 9.26 million guests enjoyed new amenities such as the state of \\nthe art Centennial Ferris Wheel, Chicago-centric food experience, \\nredesigned south dock promenade with increased access to the waterfront \\nand recreational boat experiences, and over 245 free public arts and \\ncultural programs.\\n  As the Pier now enters ``Phase 2'' of the redevelopment with \\nextensive plans to upgrade the built environment and Pier structures \\nsuch as the Family Pavilion and Crystal Garden. In 2017, with the \\ncompletion of 13-acre Polk Bros Park, the new Chicago Shakespeare \\nTheater and expanded Chicago, Children's Museum, the Pier projects to \\nsee attendance increase by as much as 26 percent as guests enjoy \\ninnovative, free public programming, participatory arts, cultural \\nshowcases, and the Pier's sustainable, recreational footprint; and the \\nPier currently employees over 3,000 individuals, is home to 77 \\nbusinesses and 5 nonprofit organizations. The redevelopment is expected \\nto generate 1,565 permanent and 1,659 temporary jobs across the city.\\n  I am honored to represent Navy Pier and congratulate Marilynn \\nGardner, President & CEO; Patrick Sheehan, Chief Development and \\nStrategy Officer, the Board of Directors and the multitude of \\nindividuals working that make the Pier a fascinating and enjoyable \\ndestination. Enjoy this landmark celebration and always remember, ``To \\naccomplish great things we must not only act, but also dream; not only \\nplan, but also believe.''\\n\", u'turn': 0, u'speaker': u'Mr. DANNY K.

Mr. Speaker, I rise in recognition of National Obesity \\nCare Week on behalf of the over 90 million adult Americans living with \\nobesity today.\\n  Treating obesity is more than just eating right and exercising and is \\ncaused by a number of factors that are often out of that person's \\ncontrol. These include genetics, socioeconomic status, and \\nphysiological, psychological and environmental factors.\\n  As important, obesity is also linked to over 50 disorders including \\nType 2 diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease. In fact, \\nover $1.42 trillion is spent in the U.S. on direct and indirect costs \\nfor health related conditions related to obesity a year.\\n  National Obesity Care Week aims to advance an evidence-based \\nunderstanding of obesity and widespread access to comprehensive and \\nappropriate care. Unfortunately, at 31.6 percent, Illinois has the 18th \\nhighest adult obesity rate in the nation--4 million people--almost a \\nthird of our population. This must change. I urge my fellow Members, \\nthe scientific community, and researchers, to treat obesity seriously--\\nas the chronic disease that it is--and I urge the medical community to \\nhave conversations with their patients, their students, and their \\ncolleagues about obesity and how we can effectively treat this disease.\\n\", u'turn': 0, u'speaker': u'Mr. SHIMKUS', u'itemno': 2}, {u'kind': u'linebreak', u'speaker_bioguide': None, u'text': u'                          ____________________\\n\\n\\n', u'turn': -1, u'speaker': u'None', u'itemno': 3}], u'header': {u'extension': True, u'vol': u'163', u'wkday': u'Thursday', u'chamber': u'House', u'num': u'178', u'year': u'2017', u'month': u'November', u'pages': u'E1498', u'day': u'2'}, u'doc_title': u'RECOGNIZING NATIONAL OBESITY CARE WEEK', u'id': u'CREC-2017-11-02-pt1-PgE1498-3', u'title': u'RECOGNIZING NATIONAL OBESITY CARE WEEK'}{u'content': [{u'text': u'  (Mr. POE of Texas asked and was given permission to address the House \\nfor 1 minute.)', u'kind': u'Unknown', u'speaker': u'Unknown', u'itemno': 0, u'turn': -1}, {u'kind': u'speech', u'speaker_bioguide': u'P000592', u'text': u\"  Mr. POE of Texas.

Mr. Speaker, House Resolution 600 provides for the \\nconsideration of a bipartisan bill reported by the House Ways and Means \\nCommittee and the Energy and Commerce Committee.\\n  The rule provides for 1 hour of debate equally divided and controlled \\nby the chairs and ranking members of the Committee on Energy and \\nCommerce and the Committee on Ways and Means.\\n  The rule adopts the amendment in the nature of a substitute \\nrecommended by the Committee on Ways and Means.\\n  Further, the rule waives all points of order and makes in order no \\nfurther amendments to the legislation. However, the minority is \\nafforded the customary motion to recommit.\\n  Mr. Speaker, on behalf of millions of seniors in my home State of \\nTexas and all across the United States, I am grateful that the House is \\nconsidering H.R. 849, the Protecting Seniors' Access to Medicare Act of \\n2017.\\n  This bill has been championed by my good friend from Tennessee, Dr. \\nPhil Roe, in this Congress and in previous\\n\\n\\nCongresses. It accomplishes a very simple task: To repeal the unpopular \\nIndependent Payment Advisory Board created under the Affordable Care \\nAct.\\n  This repeal has strong bipartisan support in both the Energy and \\nCommerce Committee, on which I serve, and in this entire body.\\n  As of today, there are 270 Republican and Democratic cosponsors to \\nthe bill who all agree that the creation of this board was a very bad \\nidea.\\n  More than 800 organizations representing every State support this \\nbill. If I may add, this includes seniors, patient advocacy groups, \\nphysician groups, and other healthcare provider organizations.\\n  This board is charged with broad, sweeping powers to reduce Medicare \\nspending when Medicare spending exceeds an arbitrary target.\\n  The board is a panel composed of 15 members appointed by the \\nPresident, confirmed by the Senate for up to two consecutive 6-year \\nterms. Fewer than half of the Independent Payment Advisory Board \\nmembers can be healthcare providers, and no one--and this is an \\nimportant point--on the board may receive outside income. So that means \\nby its very definition that this board is comprised of people who \\ncannot be practicing physicians.\\n  The other members will come from the ranks of think tanks, unions, \\nand academia.\\n  For a panel with so much authority over Medicare spending, there \\ncould be little to no clinical expertise amongst the board members.\\n  Is this what Americans really want?\\n  Now, here is some good news. The board has yet to be formed. Hooray \\nfor that. According to the 2017 Annual Report on the Boards of Medicare \\nTrustees from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services' Office of \\nthe Actuary, the Independent Payment Advisory Board may not be formed \\nuntil at least 2021, based on the current Medicare spending rate \\nprojections.\\n  Well, that is good news to seniors and their doctors and their \\nfamilies, but these projections are just numbers and they can change. \\nIn fact, last year the projection was very different, that the \\nIndependent Payment Advisory Board would be triggered this year rather \\nthan the delay.\\n  The concern of many of us here in the House and hundreds of \\nstakeholders I have heard from is that under the law, the Independent \\nPayment Advisory Board's proposals are required to be implemented by \\nthe Secretary of Health and Human Services unless Congress acts by \\ncreating its own proposal to achieve the exact same savings or by \\npreventing the automatic implementation process as defined by law.\\n  So what is that process?\\n\\n       The law mandates immediate introduction of legislation \\n     encompassing the Independent Payment Advisory Board proposed \\n     bills in Congress--\\n\\n  Stop and think about that for a minute. That is not a bill introduced \\nby a Member of Congress. That is a bill introduced by an outside board. \\nThat is a bill introduced by the administration. Let me recapitulate.\\n\\n       The law mandates immediate introduction of legislation \\n     encompassing the Independent Payment Advisory Board proposed \\n     bills in Congress and establishes strict deadlines for \\n     committee and Senate floor consideration, and places limits \\n     on the appropriations process.\\n       While Congress is permitted to modify the type of cuts to \\n     Medicare, it must achieve identical savings amounts to \\n     Medicare spending as contained in the board's plan. The law \\n     bars Congress from changing the Independent Payment Advisory \\n     Board fiscal targets in any other legislation it considers, \\n     and it creates procedures whereby a super majority vote is \\n     required in the Senate to waive this requirement.\\n       If the Independent Payment Advisory Board fails to report \\n     recommendations or never becomes operational, the Secretary \\n     of the Department of Health and Human Services is given the \\n     power to implement the cuts unilaterally.\\n\\n  Well, you might think that, then, of course this would be under \\njudicial or administrative review, but the Independent Payment Advisory \\nBoard is exempt from administrative or judicial review.\\n  No matter what your views are on the Affordable Care Act, we should \\nall agree that giving this much power to a panel of unelected and \\nunaccountable officials or a Cabinet Secretary, whoever he or she may \\nbe in any administration, giving away this much power is simply bad \\npolicy. The House shouldn't be for that.\\n\\n\\n  This process is extremely complicated, and maybe that was the intent \\nof the people who wrote the provision creating this board under the \\nAffordable Care Act.\\n  I also fundamentally believe that the Independent Payment Advisory \\nBoard infringes on the separation of powers by shifting authority from \\nthe legislative to the executive branch. Not only does the creation of \\nthis board significantly limit Congress' authority, it eliminates \\nneeded transparency from hearings and debate. It eliminates any \\nmeaningful opportunity for stakeholder input.\\n  I believe leaving Medicare payment decisions in the hands of those \\nwho are unelected and unaccountable, with little congressional \\noversight, will actually harm seniors' access to quality healthcare.\\n  Congress has played an integral role in shaping policies that best \\nreflect the needs of our districts and our States, and our constituents \\ndemand that. That is the reason they sent us here.\\n  Lastly, as a physician, I treasure the doctor-patient relationship. I \\nbelieve we must do more to honor this relationship and prevent the \\nFederal Government from further eroding this precious commodity.\\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\", u'turn': 5, u'speaker': u'Mr. BURGESS', u'itemno': 9}, {u'kind': u'speech', u'speaker_bioguide': u'S000480', u'text': u\"  Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \\nconsume, and I thank the gentleman for yielding me the customary 30 \\nminutes.\\n  Mr. Speaker, the Independent Payment Advisory Board was created, in \\nfact, by the Affordable Care Act, as we have heard. It will be a 15-\\nmember panel composed of Presidentially appointed and Senate-confirmed \\nexperts charged with developing proposals to prevent Medicare costs \\nfrom getting too high. It is about fiscal prudence.\\n  The majority and its allies, however, spread many mistruths about the \\nboard. It has even been called a death panel, if you remember that. In \\nreality, nothing could be further from the truth. Its recommendations \\nmay not increase cost-sharing premiums or taxes, or reduce benefits. \\nThey have no way to do that.\\n  Not a single soul has been nominated to the board. It is not yet \\ninstituted as an entity. Today, in the absence of an appointed board, \\nthe Secretary of Health and Human Services is directed to submit \\nrecommendations to Congress if a trigger is met.\\n  The independent Medicare actuaries predict that this board will not \\nbe triggered until at least 2021, 4 years from now.\\n  Mr. Speaker, I think we have to ask: Why are we spending time today, \\nwith everything facing us, addressing a problem that could exist 4 \\nyears from now? Is the majority so desperate to undermine the \\nAffordable Care Act that they are repealing a panel whose sole purpose \\nis keeping Medicare costs in line?\\n  According to Gallup, 55 percent of the public approves of the \\nhealthcare law. They want to see it strengthened, not eviscerated.\\n  In contrast, under the majority's leadership, Congress has an \\napproval rating of just 13 percent.\\n  Should 13 percent be telling 55 percent what they need to do?\\n  Instead, since the majority has so far been unable to repeal it, they \\nare going to undermine it brick by brick. The President is even \\nsabotaging the Affordable Care Act administratively, slashing the \\nbudget to publicize the law by 90 percent, and cutting the open \\nenrollment period in half.\\n  In the interest of public service, let me say that the enrollment \\nperiod started yesterday and continues to December 15. Please go and \\ntake care of your health insurance.\\n  What the White House has done is make a direct attempt to cause chaos \\nto weaken signups under the open enrollment period that began this \\nweek.\\n  The Kaiser Family Foundation estimated that, as a result of the \\nAffordable Care Act, Medicare growth has been historically low. The \\ngrowth in healthcare prices is at its lowest level in 50 years. The \\nnonpartisan Congressional Budget Office projected that Medicare growth \\nrates will remain beneath this panel's targets until 2021, hence the \\nreason for not doing a panel for 4 more years.\\n  It is really too bad that this Congress and the majority insist on \\nsabotaging\\n\\n\\nthe Affordable Care Act, chipping away at its benefits. We should be \\nstrengthening it. Remember that every President since Theodore \\nRoosevelt just about has tried to do a healthcare bill like the one \\nthat we have today. Perhaps just because Barack Obama did it that there \\nis so much problem with it in the majority.\\n  There is a bipartisan Senate bill crafted by Senator Alexander and \\nSenator Patty Murray that the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office \\nfound last week would save money, stabilize the insurance marketplace, \\nand reduce the debt by $3.8 billion. That is all without anyone losing \\ntheir insurance.\\n  Why won't we take up that bill?\\n  We never get an answer for that question.\\n  What is it about trying to take healthcare away from poor people or \\nthat we won't put a bill on the floor that has all the advantages and \\nsavings that we know and that is totally bipartisan? Is it because the \\nmajority knows it will pass?\\n  Our Nation has urgent problems. Our infrastructure is crumbling, \\neducation costs skyrocket so high so fast that it is unattainable to \\nmany students. We desperately need to stabilize our health insurance \\nmarkets by passing the compromise by Senators Alexander and Murray. \\nThat is what we should be doing here today.\\n  There are Members on both sides of the aisle who want to see \\nimprovements to the board, but that is not what the bill does. It \\nterminates it altogether. It is the wrong approach at definitely the \\nwrong time.\\n  Regardless of what you think about this board, we should be able to \\nagree that this Congress has more important things to do than address a \\nproblem that might not exist for 4 years, if at all.\\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\", u'turn': 6, u'speaker': u'Ms. SLAUGHTER', u'itemno': 10}, {u'kind': u'speech', u'speaker_bioguide': u'B001248', u'text': u'  Mr. BURGESS.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the \\nrule for my bill, H.R. 849, the Protecting Seniors' Access to Medicare \\nAct of 2017.\\n  Mr. Speaker, this bill would repeal the Independent Payment Advisory \\nBoard, or IPAB, which was created solely as a cost containment \\nmechanism as part of the Affordable Care Act. It has nothing to do \\nabout quality of care or access to care. I can't think of anything more \\nimportant, Mr. Speaker, that this Congress should be doing than \\nproviding quality care and access to care for our senior citizens of \\nthis country, some 58 million of them.\\n  Whatever your feelings may be about the ACA, this provision has had \\nstrong bipartisan opposition from its beginning, and it was not \\ncontained in the House Democrat's version of the bill, but was jammed \\nin by the Senate at the end.\\n  If you still need convincing on just how unpopular this provision of \\nthe law is, ask yourself: How often do we see a bill come to the floor \\nunder a rule that has 270 bipartisan cosponsors?\\n  Passing this bill will send a strong message to our Senate colleagues \\nthat the time to act is now.\\n  Mr. Speaker, the overwhelming bipartisan support for Members is only \\noutdone by the overwhelming nationwide coalition of support.\\n  Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from the Protect My \\nDoctor and Me coalition, a letter that has been signed by nearly 800 \\ngroups representing patients, providers, and all sectors of the \\nhealthcare industry with support in all 50 States.\\n\\n                                                September 6, 2017.\\n       Dear Member of Congress: The undersigned organizations--\\n     representing Medicare beneficiaries and patients, all sectors \\n     of the healthcare industry as well as employers and other \\n     purchasers of health care--believe strongly that the Medicare \\n     program must protect patient access to quality healthcare. \\n     The Independent Payment Advisory Board (IPAB), a provision of \\n     the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA), not \\n     only poses a threat to that access but also, once activated, \\n     will shift healthcare costs to consumers in the private \\n     sector and infringe upon the decisionmaking responsibilities \\n     and prerogatives of the Congress. We request your support to \\n     repeal IPAB.\\n       IPAB, as constructed under PPACA, is a board comprised of \\n     Presidential appointees who will be charged with making \\n     recommendations to cut Medicare expenditures if spending \\n     growth reaches an arbitrary level. Once the Secretary of \\n     Health and Human Services (HHS) implements an IPAB \\n     recommendation, that action is not subject to administrative \\n     or judicial review. As constructed, IPAB is granted \\n     unprecedented powers--even the ability to change laws \\n     previously enacted by Congress--with virtually no oversight.\\n       The potential impact of this board causes deep concern \\n     among our organizations and the millions of Americans we \\n     represent. IPAB proponents suggest that the board will be an \\n     asset in developing needed healthcare delivery reforms. That \\n     goal, however, is not realistically achievable. The law \\n     requires IPAB to achieve scoreable savings within a one-year \\n     time period. Thus, instead of pursuing long-term reforms that \\n     may not achieve immediate savings, IPAB is more likely to \\n     consider short-term savings in the form of payment cuts for \\n     healthcare providers. This was, in fact, the conclusion of \\n     the Congressional Budget Office, which stated that IPAB is \\n     most likely to focus on payment rates or methodologies for \\n     services provided by non-exempt providers.\\n       This would be devastating for patients, affecting access to \\n     care and innovative therapies. Already, the number of \\n     physicians unable to accept new Medicare patients due to low \\n     reimbursement rates has been increasing over the past several \\n     years. IPAB-generated payment reductions would only increase \\n     the access difficulties faced by too many Medicare \\n     beneficiaries. Furthermore, payment reductions to Medicare \\n     providers will almost certainly result in a shifting of \\n     health costs to employers and consumers in the private \\n     sector.\\n       Under IPAB's provisions, the responsibility for enacting \\n     healthcare system changes of this magnitude would be \\n     transferred from the legislative branch to the executive. \\n     More specifically, an unelected board without adequate \\n     oversight or accountability would be taking actions \\n     historically reserved for the public's elected \\n     representatives in the U.S. House and Senate. This is an \\n     unacceptable decisionmaking process for a program that \\n     millions of our nation's seniors and individuals with \\n     disabilities rely upon.\\n       Moreover, if IPAB does not act within the law's required \\n     timeframe or if IPAB members are not appointed by the \\n     President or confirmed by the Senate, the law transfers \\n     IPAB's responsibilities solely to the HHS Secretary. This \\n     places an enormous degree of power in the hands of one \\n     unelected individual.\\n       We strongly support bringing greater cost-efficiency to the \\n     Medicare program. We also advocate continuing efforts to \\n     improve the quality of care delivered to Medicare \\n     beneficiaries.\\n       The Independent Payment Advisory Board will achieve neither \\n     of these objectives and will only weaken, not strengthen, a \\n     program critical to the health and well-being of current and \\n     future beneficiaries. We urge Congress to eliminate the IPAB \\n     provision.\\n           Sincerely,\\n       1 in 9: The Long Island Breast Cancer Action Coalition; 60 \\n     Plus Alabama; 60 Plus Association; A Partnership of \\n     Diabetics;

Mr. Speaker, let me just read one paragraph:\\n  ``IPAB, as constructed under PPACA, is a board comprised of \\nPresidential appointees who will be charged with making recommendations \\nto cut Medicare expenditures if spending growth reaches an arbitrary \\nlevel. Once the Secretary of Health and Human Services implements an \\nIPAB recommendation, that action is not subject to administrative or \\njudicial review. As constructed, IPAB is granted unprecedented powers--\\neven the ability to change laws previously enacted by Congress--with \\nvirtually no oversight.'' Peter Orszag, President Obama's Office of \\nManagement and Budget Director, said it was the largest transfer of \\npower from the legislative branch to a bureaucratic branch since the \\nFederal Reserve, and that is a mouthful.\\n  Democrats and Republicans may not always agree on how to get things \\ndone around here, but when you can bring 270 House Members together on \\none bill, it is pretty clear that something needs to be done \\nimmediately.\\n  We were lucky this summer that the Medicare trustees report indicated \\nthat IPAB would not trigger until 2021 or 2022, but our back is against \\nthe wall and we must act. We cannot afford to let 15 unelected, \\nunaccountable bureaucrats make decisions for our Nation's 58 million \\nMedicare enrollees with no checks from Congress.\\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this.\\n  I refer also to a bipartisan letter I signed on December 17, 2009, \\nthat was written to the Speaker of the House at that time, Nancy \\nPelosi, which said the following:\\n  ``Finally, as the people's elected representatives, we must oppose \\nany proposal to create a board that would surrender our legislative \\nauthority and responsibility for a Medicare program to unelected, \\nunaccountable officials within the very same branch of government that \\nis charged with implementing the Medicare policies that affect so many \\nAmericans.''\\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this rule and support \\nthe final passage because that will show the American people you stand \\nwith America's seniors.\", u'turn': 9, u'speaker': u'Mr. ROE of Tennessee', u'itemno': 13}, {u'kind': u'speech', u'speaker_bioguide': u'B001248', u'text': u'  Mr. BURGESS.

Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend for yielding me time.\\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of Protecting Seniors' Access to \\nMedicare Act, sponsored by my colleague and fellow physician, \\nRepresentative Roe.\\n  ObamaCare's establishment of the Independent Payment Advisory Board, \\nor IPAB, is perhaps the most insidious part of the Affordable Care Act.\\n  With IPAB, 15 unelected bureaucrats would be in power to make health \\ncoverage decisions for 55 million Americans who are Medicare \\nbeneficiaries. Care would be rationed, physicians like myself would be \\nunable to pursue the course of treatment we think is appropriate for \\nour patients, seniors would lose access to the best care, all without \\nany input from Congress or any accountability to voters.\\n  With all of the divisiveness that we see in Washington, the IPAB \\nrepeal bill we consider today is genuinely bipartisan. Mr. Speaker, I \\nurge my colleagues to give an overwhelming bipartisan vote and show the \\ncountry we are serious about keeping our promises to our seniors.\", u'turn': 11, u'speaker': u'Mr. DUNN', u'itemno': 15}, {u'kind': u'speech', u'speaker_bioguide': u'B001248', u'text': u\"  Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 1\\\\1/2\\\\ minutes.\\n  Mr. Speaker, I did want to delineate the membership of this board, as \\nis outlined in the Affordable Care Act. The board will be appointed by \\nthe President with the advice and consent of the Senate, with the \\nadvice and consent of the Secretary or the Administrator of the Centers \\nfor Medicare and Medicaid Services, and the Administrator of the Health \\nResources and Services Administration. All of those individuals will \\nserve as ex officio nonvoting members. But here are the qualifications \\nfor the actual board:\\n  ``The appointed membership of the board shall include individuals \\nwith national recognition for their expertise in health finance and \\neconomics, in actuarial science, health facility management, health \\nplans, and integrated delivery systems, and reimbursement of healthcare \\nfacilities. . . .''\\n  Missing from that picture, of course, are the people who actually \\nprovide the care to people who are involved in that doctor-patient \\nrelationship. Almost as an afterthought, here at the end of that \\nparagraph, ``allopathic and osteopathic physicians.''\\n  The other aspect is that no member of the board can receive outside \\nincome. That may be a good idea, but that guarantees there will not be \\na practicing physician on that board. I think that is a significant \\noversight.\\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\", u'turn': 12, u'speaker': u'Mr. BURGESS', u'itemno': 16}, {u'kind': u'speech', u'speaker_bioguide': u'S000480', u'text': u\"  Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 1 minute.\\n  Mr. Speaker, I am very troubled by this. I don't want to insult my \\nlearned colleagues, but it plainly says in the legislation that IPAB \\ncannot ration healthcare, cannot raise taxes or increase deductibles \\nand copayments. Under the current law, section 1899A, 42 U.S.C. clearly \\nstates: ``The proposal shall not include any recommendation to ration \\nhealthcare; raise revenues or Medicare beneficiary premiums; increase \\nthe cost sharing, including deductibles, coinsurance, and copayments; \\nor otherwise restrict benefits or modify eligibility criteria.''\\n\\n\\n  I regret I have to do that, because it is a direct contradiction of \\nwhat my good friends on the other side have told the country and what I \\nassume that they believe.\\n  Mr. Speaker, Russia interfered with our 2016 election. That much is \\nclear from special counsel Mueller's investigation, which led to \\nindictments against two Trump campaign aides. The legitimacy of our \\nelectoral system is at stake, and it is time the Republican-controlled \\nCongress sets aside the partisan politics and treats this threat with \\nthe gravity it deserves.\\n  If we defeat the previous question, I will offer an amendment to the \\nrule to bring up Representative Swalwell and Representative Cummings' \\nbill, which would create a bipartisan commission to investigate the \\nRussian interference in the 2016 election.\\n\\n\\n  Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of the \\namendment in the Record, along with extraneous material, immediately \\nprior to the vote on the previous question.\", u'turn': 13, u'speaker': u'Ms. SLAUGHTER', u'itemno': 17}, {u'kind': u'speech', u'speaker_bioguide': None, u'text': u'  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Mr. Speaker, one of the worst political stories I have \\nheard in my lifetime is what we just talked about, the ``death panel,'' \\nwhat it is going to do, even though it is prohibited by the written law \\nto do the things that it has been accused of being able to do. Most of \\nthat, PolitiFact talked about the death panel part of it and said that \\nthat was the 2009 lie of the year. But here we are, 8 years later, and \\nwe keep hearing mistruths about the panel and its intent. The board is \\nabout keeping Medicare growth in line, nothing more, nothing less.\\n  So let's be honest about what the bill really is about: attacking the \\nAffordable Care Act.

One of the most egregious examples of ObamaCare's \\noverreach is the Independent Payment Advisory Board, IPAB.\\n  The architects of ObamaCare designed the IPAB as a panel of 15 \\nunelected and unaccountable people who were tasked with making \\narbitrary cuts to Medicare after a certain level of spending is \\nreached.

Mr. Speaker, I would like to include in the \\nRecord the following letter:\\n\\n                                Congress of the United States,\\n\\n                                Washington, DC, December 17, 2009.\\n     Hon. Nancy Pelosi,\\n     Speaker, House of Representatives,\\n     Washington, DC.\\n       Dear Madam Speaker: In July, 75 members of the U.S. House \\n     of Representatives wrote to express strong opposition to \\n     proposals, such as the ``Independent Medicare Advisory \\n     Council (IMAC) Act of 2009'' and the ``Medicare Payment \\n     Advisory Commission (MedPAC) Reform Act of 2009'' (H.R 2718, \\n     S. 1110, S. 1380), that would divest Congress of its \\n     authority for Medicare payment policy and place this \\n     responsibility in an executive branch commission or board. \\n     This letter clearly stated opposition to the inclusion of \\n     these or any other similar proposals in health reform or any \\n     other legislation, but with recent developments, we, the \\n     undersigned members, believe it is imperative to restate our \\n     strong opposition to any proposal or legislation that would \\n     place authority for Medicare payment policy in an unelected, \\n     executive branch commission or board.\\n       Consistent with the July letter, on November 7, 2009, the \\n     House passed the ``Affordable Health Care for America Act'' \\n     (H.R. 3962) did not include provisions to create an unelected \\n     Medicare board. Yet, at present, the Senate is considering \\n     the ``Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2009,'' \\n     which includes provisions to create an ``Independent Medicare \\n     Advisory Board'' (IMAB) that would effectively end Congress's \\n     authority over Medicare payment policy.\\n       To create an unelected, unaccountable Medicare commission \\n     as envisioned in the Senate's IMAB proposal would end \\n     Congress's ability to shape Medicare to provide the best \\n     policies for beneficiaries in our communities around the \\n     country. Through the legislative process, and from Medicare's \\n     beginning, Members have been able to represent the needs of \\n     their communities by improving benefits for seniors and the \\n     disabled, affecting policies that fill the health care \\n     workforce pipeline, and ensuring that hospitals are equipped \\n     to care for diverse populations across our individual \\n     districts. Such a responsibility is one that is not taken, \\n     nor should be given away, lightly.\\n       These proposals would severely limit Congressional \\n     oversight of the Medicare program, and to place this \\n     authority within the executive branch, without Congressional \\n     oversight or judicial review, would eliminate the \\n     transparency of Congressional hearings and debate. Without \\n     the open and transparent legislative process, Medicare \\n     beneficiaries and the range of providers who care for them \\n     would be greatly limited in their ability to help develop and \\n     implement new policies that improve the health care of our \\n     nation's seniors. An executive branch Medicare board would \\n     also effectively eliminate Congress's ability to work with \\n     the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to create and \\n     implement demonstration and pilot projects designed to \\n     evaluate new and advanced policies such as home care for the \\n     elderly, the patient-centered medical home, new less invasive \\n     surgical procedures, collaborative efforts between hospitals \\n     and physicians, and programs designed to eliminate fraud and \\n     abuse.\\n       The creation of a Medicare board would also effectively \\n     eliminate state and community input into the Medicare \\n     program, removing the ability to develop and implement \\n     policies expressly applicable to different patient \\n     populations. Instead, national policies that would flow from \\n     such a board would ignore the significant differences and \\n     health care needs of states and communities. Geographic and \\n     demographic variances that exist in our nation's health care \\n     system and patient populations would be dangerously \\n     disregarded. Furthermore, all providers in all states would \\n     be required to comply even if these policies were detrimental \\n     to the patients they serve. Such a commission could not only \\n     threaten the ability of Medicare beneficiaries, but of all \\n     Americans, to access the care they need.\\n       Finally, as the people's elected representatives, we must \\n     oppose any proposal to create a board that would surrender \\n     our legislative authority and responsibility for the Medicare \\n     program to unelected, unaccountable officials within the very \\n     same branch of government that is charged with implementing \\n     the Medicare policies that affect so many Americans. \\n     Therefore, we must strongly oppose the creation of IMAB, \\n     IMAC, a reconstituted MedPAC or any Medicare board or \\n     commission that would undermine our ability to represent the \\n     needs of the seniors and disabled in our own communities. \\n     Again, we urge you to reject the inclusion of these or any \\n     like proposal in health reform or any other legislation.\\n           Sincerely,\\n       Richard Neal, Gary Ackerman, Shelley Berkley, Brian \\n     Bilbray, Tim Bishop, Marsha Blackburn, Mary Bono Mack, Ginny \\n     Brown-Waite, Michael Burgess, G.K.

It is a \\n     vote about what the House should be debating.\\n       Mr. Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of \\n     Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the \\n     previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or \\n     control the consideration of the subject before the House \\n     being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous \\n     question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the \\n     subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling \\n     of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the \\n     House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes \\n     the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to \\n     offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the \\n     majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated \\n     the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to \\n     a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to \\n     recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (R-Illinois) said: \\n     ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman \\n     from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to \\n     yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first \\n     recognition.''\\n       The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous \\n     question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an \\n     immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no \\n     substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.'' \\n     But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the \\n     Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in \\n     the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition, \\n     page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the previous \\n     question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is generally \\n     not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member \\n     controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of \\n     offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by \\n     voting down the previous question on the rule. . . . When the \\n     motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the \\n     time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering \\n     the previous question. That Member, because he then controls \\n     the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for \\n     the purpose of amendment.''\\n       In Deschler's Procedure in the U.S. House of \\n     Representatives, the subchapter titled ``Amending Special \\n     Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on \\n     such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on \\n     Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further \\n     debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues: \\n     ``Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a \\n     resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control \\n     shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous \\n     question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who \\n     controls the time for debate thereon.''\\n       Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does \\n     have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only \\n     available tools for those who oppose the Republican \\n     majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the \\n     opportunity to offer an alternative plan.\\n\", u'turn': -1, u'speaker': u'None', u'itemno': 27}, {u'kind': u'speech', u'speaker_bioguide': u'B001248', u'text': u'  Mr. BURGESS.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to join my constituents in \\ncelebrating the 100th birthday of Mrs. Thelma Kouzes, a truly \\nremarkable woman and a beloved member of the Northern Virginia \\ncommunity. Mrs. Kouzes was born Thelma Virginia Loss on July 26, 1917 \\nin Audubon, Iowa. She proudly says she is a first-generation American, \\nthe daughter of immigrants whose parents came to the United States from \\nDenmark. She grew up in Iowa, was raised by hardworking parents, and \\nexperienced the hardships of the Great Depression. She moved to \\nWashington, D.C. in 1938 to work for President Roosevelt's \\nAdministration. There she met her late husband Thomas Kouzes--also a \\nfirst-generation American whose parents came to the U.S. from Greece.\\n  Mrs. Kouzes has led an amazing life. Shortly after she moved to D.C., \\nshe experienced culture shock when she attended a segregated religious \\nservice. Because of experiences like this she became a proud and \\npassionate civil rights activist. She remained steadfast in her \\ncommitment to justice and equality--including marching alongside Dr. \\nMartin Luther King, Jr.; in the March on Washington for Jobs and \\nFreedom in 1963--even when others in her community criticized her \\nefforts. She was an active member of the\\n\\n\\nAmerican Field Service, UNICEF, the UN, the American Cancer Society, \\nand American Mothers. She is proud to say that she helped to save the \\npublic schools in Virginia during the period of desegregation, along \\nwith hundreds of Northern Virginian mothers.\\n  She and her late husband hosted 174 international students from 34 \\ndifferent countries between 1960 and 2004. She also placed more than \\n400 international students with American families. After her husband \\ndied, she continued her devotion to hosting international students.\\n  Mrs. Kouzes was elected the 53rd National Mother by the American \\nMothers organization, chosen by a jury composed of representatives from \\nlocal government as well as religious and educational leaders.\\n  These are just a few examples of the many accomplishments of her \\nlife.\\n  Mrs. Kouzes has been part of our great American story, lending her \\nvoice to the vibrancy of our community and offering her experience and \\nwisdom to those around her. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me \\nin thanking Mrs. Kouzes for her decades of contribution to the Northern \\nVirginia area, and in wishing her a happy and healthy 100th birthday.\\n\", u'turn': 0, u'speaker': u'Mr. CONNOLLY', u'itemno': 2}, {u'kind': u'linebreak', u'speaker_bioguide': None, u'text': u'                          ____________________\\n\\n\\n', u'turn': -1, u'speaker': u'None', u'itemno': 3}], u'header': {u'extension': True, u'vol': u'163', u'wkday': u'Thursday', u'chamber': u'House', u'num': u'178', u'year': u'2017', u'month': u'November', u'pages': u'E1498-E1499', u'day': u'2'}, u'doc_title': u'CELEBRATING THE 100TH BIRTHDAY OF MRS.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today with my colleagues in the \\nClimate Solutions Caucus in recognition of a problem that concerns many \\nof us--climate change.\\n  It is hard to deny that our climate is changing. Whether caused by \\ncyclical weather changes or impacted by man's role, it is clear we are \\nseeing changes in the polar ice and a rise in temperatures. It is one \\nof my goals in Congress to keep the momentum we have seen in previous \\ndecades of continuing improvement in our environment. We all want to \\nleave our planet cleaner for our children and grandchildren.\\n  It is my hope to advance the dialogue and advocate for more renewable \\nand diverse energy sources. Top defense authorities, such as Secretary \\nMattis, have been vocal on how climate change has affected the DoD's \\nthreat assessments, resources, and operation readiness, but Congress \\nmust do more to combat this threat.\\n  As an incoming freshman in the 115th Congress, I have made it my \\nmission to get things accomplished. I have joined the Bipartisan \\nClimate Solutions Caucus, and have advocated for an incremental \\nimprovements approach to address climate change, while recognizing that \\nthe issue is a matter of national security. During the FY18 National \\nDefense Authorization Act debate, I as well as some of my other House \\ncolleagues, led the charge to ensure adoption of Section 336, which \\nrecognizes climate change as a national security issue, and allows the \\nDOD to assess its risks and determine next steps to mitigate such \\nthreats. This section ensures that the Armed Forces are prepared to \\nhandle the effects of a changing climate as it relates to military \\noperations. By conducting studies within the Services and Combat \\nCommands, DoD will be able to better understand the problem. Congress \\nhas a duty to ensure that the DoD is resilient and prepared for \\nanything that may threaten its mission and operations and I hope to see \\nthe text of Section 336 in the final NDAA bill.\\n  It is in America's best interest to improve clean energy technology \\nand expand production of renewable energies. Environmental practices do \\nnot need to come at the expense of economic growth though. We must \\nencourage greater environmental stewardship amongst the private sector \\nand foster economic success. Omaha now has 30 percent of energy from \\nwind and it's growing. I support continued use of solar, ethanol, and \\nsources of hydrothermal.\\n  As members of the Bipartisan Climate Solutions Caucus, we proactively \\nseek pragmatic\\n\\n\\nsolutions to address environmental concerns. It is a priority of mine \\nto have all members recognize the impacts of climate change and our \\nrole to leave a cleaner planet for our children and grandchildren. I am \\ncommitted to ensuring energy independence for our country and North \\nAmerica and ensuring that the use of renewable energy gains a larger \\nshare of our overall energy production.\\n\", u'turn': 0, u'speaker': u'Mr. BACON', u'itemno': 2}, {u'kind': u'linebreak', u'speaker_bioguide': None, u'text': u'                          ____________________\\n\\n\\n', u'turn': -1, u'speaker': u'None', u'itemno': 3}], u'header': {u'extension': True, u'vol': u'163', u'wkday': u'Thursday', u'chamber': u'House', u'num': u'178', u'year': u'2017', u'month': u'November', u'pages': u'E1490-E1491', u'day': u'2'}, u'doc_title': u'CLIMATE SOLUTIONS CAUCUS', u'id': u'CREC-2017-11-02-pt1-PgE1490-5', u'title': u'CLIMATE SOLUTIONS CAUCUS'}"
