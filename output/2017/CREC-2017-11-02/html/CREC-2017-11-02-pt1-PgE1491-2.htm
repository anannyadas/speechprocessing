                            HON. DAVID YOUNG

                                of iowa

                    in the house of representatives

                       Thursday, November 2, 2017

  Mr. YOUNG of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and 
congratulate David Maxwell of West Des Moines, Iowa for being named one 
of West Des Moines Chamber's Citizens of the Year for 2017.
  The West Des Moines Chamber every year recognizes a Citizen of the 
Year, a community member who ``demonstrates an unparalleled dedication 
to service and general betterment of the community.'' David is the 
Associate Principal at Valley High School in West Des Moines, a role he 
has served in since 2005. Over the past year, David, along with 
Clinical Social Worker Mark Hillenbrand, helped to organize several 
West Des Moines equity, diversity and multicultural discussions, 
bringing together the community and students to tackle educational 
inequality and ensure that all students have equal opportunities to 
have a quality education.
  Mr. Speaker, I am proud to represent community leaders like David in 
the United States Congress and it is with great pride that I recognize 
him today. I ask that my colleagues in the United States House of 
Representatives join me in congratulating David for this outstanding 
recognition and in wishing him nothing but continued success.

                          ____________________
