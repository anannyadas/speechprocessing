  Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Ms. Christine 
Ivory of Live Oak, California, who has dedicated herself to serving her 
community by advocating for its agricultural industry. After serving on 
the Board of Directors for the Yuba-Sutter Farm Bureau for six years, 
she is to become its President. She has immersed herself in the issues 
of the agricultural community by serving on eleven of the farm bureau's 
committees. In her work at the Yuba Sutter Farm Bureau, Ms. Ivory takes 
particular pride in educating youth on the importance of agriculture. 
She has been instrumental in maintaining and growing her community's 
agriculture education programs, such as FFA and 4-H.
   Ms. Ivory is also committed to the preservation of agricultural 
lands and serves in many organizations working towards this goal. She 
dedicates her time to many community organizations providing for 
economic development and community improvement. Through her extensive 
involvement in the agricultural industry and many service 
organizations, Ms. Ivory has demonstrated that she is invested in the 
Yuba and Sutter county communities.
