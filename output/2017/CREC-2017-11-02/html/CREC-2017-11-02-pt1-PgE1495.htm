                       Thursday, November 2, 2017

  Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Cathie Wicks, 
whose entire professional career has been spent in Yolo County, 
California advocating to improve the quality of life for rural 
children, families, and communities.
   Cathie is the founder and immediate past Executive Director of RISE, 
Inc. (Rural Innovations in Social Economics, Inc.). Ms. Wicks has over 
35 years of non-profit administrative experience, including extensive 
grant project development and supervision, rural program design, 
implementation and project based fund control experience. Cathie is 
also a lifetime mission-builder in innovative leadership programs for 
teens, with an interest in intervention models for motivated at- risk 
youth.
   Cathie's early work history includes raising sheep, which began as a 
hobby. In the early 1970's, she started her career in the anti-poverty 
upward mobility programs focused on continuing education and 
diversified education. She also co-founded a non-profit to leverage 
grants from outside the community. Cathie served as Executive Director 
of RISE for the next 25 years. Her work didn't stop there, Cathie 
integrated her grant writing skills to assist Yocha Dehe Wintun Nation 
in grant writing, policy development and programs designed to enhance 
the community.
   Cathie is the face of non-profit success in rural Western Yolo 
County, building programs, trends, strong organizations, and fiscal 
success modes that have improved the quality of life in rural 
communities. Cathie enjoys spending time with her children and 
grandchildren, still raises sheep with her son, enjoys golf and travels 
with friends, family and colleagues.
