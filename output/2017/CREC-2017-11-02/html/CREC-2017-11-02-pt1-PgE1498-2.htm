                       Thursday, November 2, 2017

  Mr. CARTER of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the 
service and achievements of an esteemed and valued citizen of Killeen, 
Texas. Colonel Raul Villaronga, U.S. Army Retired, has dedicated 
himself to serving his community and is an embodiment of the Army 
values of honor, loyalty, and selfless service. He is a deserving 
recipient of a Congressional Veteran Commendation.
  His commission as an Infantry 2nd Lieutenant in 1959 began his 24 
years of service in which he completed assignments in Fort Bragg, the 
Panama Canal Zone, Vietnam, Germany, and Fort Hood. While assigned to 
the 8th Special Forces Group, he participated in numerous classified 
Mobile Training Teams in Central and South America. COL Villaronga 
deservingly received awards including the Silver Star, the Legion of 
Merit, the Bronze Star, and the Meritorious Service Medal as a 
testament to his exemplary service.
  COL Villaronga is a respected citizen serving in numerous roles 
showcasing his commitment to community and nation. Returning from the 
Army, COL Villaronga served three terms as Mayor of Killeen. As Mayor, 
he founded the Killeen Youth Advisory Commission and worked on the 
Joint Use Agreement for the Robert Gray Army Airfield. As Chairman of 
the Killeen League of United Latin American Citizens Council 4535 
Foundation, COL Villaronga has been responsible for the donation of 
over $175,000 in scholarships for local graduating seniors. He 
continues to serve veterans in his community alongside his wife. His 
tireless efforts have made Central Texas a place that we're proud to 
call home.
  COL Villaronga's patriotism and commitment to service reflect the 
very best values of Central Texas. He is a hero who has devoted his 
life to defending our freedoms abroad and serving his community at 
home. I join his wife, Julia, along with his family and friends in 
wishing him the best in the years ahead.
