                       Thursday, November 2, 2017

  Mr. SWALWELL of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize Wells 
Middle School in Dublin, California for its designation as a 2017 
National School of Character.
  Wells Middle School is the only school in California to receive the 
2017 National School of Character Award. The administration of Wells 
Middle School has worked diligently to meet the stringent standards 
necessary to receive this distinction. It has minimized incidences of 
cheating and bullying while maximizing student and parent engagement.
  At Wells Middle School, character education is made a priority by the 
administration and teachers. The character education program focuses on 
bringing relevant, engaging and versatile resources directly to the 
students. The school makes an extensive effort to prioritize the 
success of its students.
  One example is the Response to Intervention program. This program 
provides a network of instructional sessions for teachers and students, 
which work to address academic and behavioral concerns. This 
programming stresses inclusivity and adaptability as it seeks to meet 
the needs of all Wells Middle School students.
  In addition to the National School of Character designation, Wells 
Middle School was named a 2017 California Gold Ribbon School by the 
California Department ofEducation and a 2017 California School of 
Character.
  I am honored to have such an incredible school within my district, 
and as a Wells Middle School student, benefited myself from its focus 
on character. The continual effort of Wells Middle School to promote 
the success of its students both academically and behaviorally, serves 
as a statewide example of an ideal institution for holistic student 
growth. Our community is better and stronger as a result of its 
tireless dedication.
  I want to congratulate Wells Middle School on receiving the 2017 
National School of Character Award, and I wish the school and its 
students continued success in the years to come.

                          ____________________
