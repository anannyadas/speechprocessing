  Mr. JONES. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor St. Matthew Original 
Free Will Baptist

[[Page E1498]]

Church in my hometown of Farmville, North Carolina. This congregation 
recently celebrated 61 years of serving our Lord and Savior, Jesus 
Christ. The passion and commitment from this church has helped to 
spread the Word and Humility of Christ throughout the town of Farmville 
and surrounding communities for many years.
  The ministry and community outreach performed by the people of St. 
Matthew have helped meet the needs of so many. I am proud and honored 
to call these people my neighbors.
  I want to thank the church family of St. Matthew and Pastor Jesse F. 
Warren III as they continue to improve the quality of life for so many 
people and commend them on this milestone in their ministry. I pray 
that they will be blessed with many more years of service to our Lord 
and Savior, Jesus Christ.
  As it is written in the book of Hebrews 6:10, ``God is not unjust, He 
will not forget your work and the love you have shown Him as you helped 
His people and continue to help them.''
  Congratulations on your 61 years of service.

                          ____________________
