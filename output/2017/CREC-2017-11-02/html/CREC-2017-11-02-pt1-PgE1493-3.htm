  Mr. KELLY of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, today I rise in memory of Army 
Staff Sergeant (SSG) Joe Nathan Wilson who paid the ultimate sacrifice 
while defending our great nation on November 2, 2003, during Operation 
Iraqi Freedom. SSG Wilson was mortally wounded in an attack on a CH-47 
Chinook helicopter near Fallujah, Iraq. Fifteen other servicemen were 
killed in the crash. He died from his injuries in a Kuwait hospital. 
SSG Wilson was assigned to Alpha Battery, 2nd Battalion, 5th Field 
Artillery Regiment, 3rd Corps Artillery, Fort Sill, Oklahoma.
  According to the Associated Press, an Ohio serviceman said he 
survived because of the heroic act of SSG Wilson. Sergeant (SSG) Joe 
Mlinar said SSG Wilson cradled his head with his body to shield him 
when the helicopter crashed.
  SSG Wilson was remembered on a memorial website by a fellow soldier. 
Staff Sergeant (SSG) Benjamin Dunlap of Stroud, Oklahoma, said SSG 
Wilson was a leader, ``I served with SSG Wilson during our tour in 
Iraq. He was the epiphany of the NCO corps. He was always leading by 
example. He could never be seen without a smile on his face. I 
considered him to be my friend. He was a friend to all who knew him.''
  SSG Wilson graduated from Crystal Springs High School in Crystal 
Springs, Mississippi in 1992. Robert Green, the Crystal Springs High 
School athletic director, said SSG Wilson was a standout student, ``He 
was a nice young man, especially on the football field.'' Shortly after 
graduation, SSG Wilson enlisted in the U.S. Army. Maxine Adams, SSG 
Wilson's mother, said he always wanted to be in the military, ``He was 
a great son. It was important to Nate to be an accomplished person.'' 
Patricia Fortenberry, SSG Wilson's sister, is proud of her brother's 
service, ``He was a great brother. He was my best friend.''
  Shortly after SSG Wilson's death, the city of Crystal Springs 
designated November 2nd as an official day to recognize his service to 
our nation. His family hosts a picnic and speakers are included at the 
event. It is held at the Joe Nathan Wilson Sportsplex and Memorial Fire 
Station in Crystal Springs which is named in his honor. Sally Garland, 
mayor of Crystal Springs, said the city will begin a new tradition in 
honor of SSG Wilson. Beginning this year, flags will be lowered to 
half-staff on the anniversary of his death.
  SSG Wilson was buried at Brushy Creek Cemetery in Hopewell, 
Mississippi. SSG Wilson is survived by his mother, Maxine Adams; his 
wife, Erica; his daughter, Yasmin; his three nephews, Jaydan Adams, 
Jordan Adams, and Specialist (SPC) Jerrick Wilson; his two nieces, 
Kawanza Fortenberry and Latria Wilson.
  SSG Wilson's bravery under fire demonstrated his devotion to his 
comrades and to our nation. His service will always be remembered.
