  Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Ms. Catherine 
Morris, who has dedicated her 30 years in Dixon, California to serving 
her community. As the pastor of the Dixon United Methodist Church, she 
has had countless opportunities to serve her congregation as well as 
the community as a whole. Outside of her role as pastor, her passion 
has been serving the youth of the Dixon community. Through her work 
with Dixon Family Services, Dixon Advocates for Children, and the Safe 
Schools Task Force, Ms. Morris works to keep the youth in her community 
safe and provide them with opportunities for success.
   Ms. Morris' leadership also extends to Dixon's senior communities. 
She is an advocate for securing affordable senior housing and adequate 
senior transportation services. Her support for senior programs in her 
community is ongoing, and she regularly assists seniors in finding the 
programs and services which can best serve their needs.
   Ms. Morris is a devoted servant to the people of Dixon. Anyone who 
knows her will tell you that her generous spirit, endless energy, and 
genuine warmth make her a beloved and respected member of the Dixon 
community.
