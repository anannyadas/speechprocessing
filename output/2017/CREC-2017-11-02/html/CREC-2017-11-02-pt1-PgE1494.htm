                     TRIBUTE TO ANDY AND AMY WALSH

                                 ______
                                 

                            HON. DAVID YOUNG

                                of iowa

                    in the house of representatives

                       Thursday, November 2, 2017

  Mr. YOUNG of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and 
congratulate Andy and Amy Walsh of Waukee, Iowa for being named the 
2016 Waukee Citizens of the Year.
  Andy and Amy own and operate Mickey's Irish Pub in Waukee, Iowa. The 
establishment is known as a place for an after work getaway and a place 
to get a good bite to eat. But what makes the Walsh's stick out is how 
much they give back to the community. Several organizations, including 
Waukee Crime Stoppers, Waukee Police Citizens' Academy, the Raccoon 
River Valley Trail Bike Association and the annual BACooN Ride, have 
seen countless hours of their involvement outside of work. They have 
helped many charities and organizations through discounted and donated 
food and drinks from their business, and every year they host a free 
Thanksgiving dinner for city residents. It is because of people like 
Andy and Amy, and their kindness and generosity, that Iowa communities 
are some of the strongest in the country.
  Mr. Speaker, I am honored to represent community leaders like Andy 
and Amy and it is with great pride that I recognize them today. I ask 
that my colleagues in the United States House of Representatives join 
me in congratulating Andy and Amy for this outstanding recognition and 
in wishing them nothing but continued success.
