                 TRIBUTE TO EAGLE SCOUT COLE NICHOLSON

                                 ______
                                 

                            HON. DAVID YOUNG

                                of iowa

                    in the house of representatives

                       Thursday, November 2, 2017

  Mr. YOUNG of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and 
congratulate Cole Nicholson of Bondurant, Iowa for earning the rank of 
Eagle Scout.
  The Eagle Scout designation is the highest advancement rank in 
scouting. Approximately two percent of Boy Scouts earn the Eagle Scout 
Award. The award is a performance-based achievement with high standards 
that have been well-maintained over the past century.
  To earn the Eagle Scout rank, a Boy Scout is obligated to pass 
specific tests that are organized by requirements and merit badges, as 
well as completing an Eagle Scout Project to benefit the community. For 
his project, Cole saw a need for exercise stations, consisting of

items like bars, boxes, and balance beams, around Lake Petocka in 
Bondurant. After going through the approval process with the city and 
raising the $1,600 from friends and local organizations, Cole led a 
team that installed the equipment last October, and has already seen 
people using them. He completed his Eagle Scout journey at the young 
age of 14, years younger than most Eagle Scouts earn their ranking. The 
work ethic Cole has shown in his Eagle Scout Project and throughout his 
scouting career speaks volumes about his commitment to serving a cause 
greater than himself and assisting his community.
  Mr. Speaker, the example set by this young man and his supportive 
family and community demonstrates the rewards of hard work, dedication, 
and perseverance. I am honored to represent Cole and his family in the 
United States Congress. I ask that my colleagues in the United States 
House of Representatives join me in congratulating him on obtaining the 
Eagle Scout ranking and in wishing him nothing but continued success in 
his future education and career.
