  Mr. CARTER of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor First 
Lieutenant Phillip Duprey of the United States Army for his dedication 
and service to our country. 1LT Duprey's extraordinary patriotism, 
citizenship, and commitment to community and service reflects the best 
values of Central Texas. He is a fitting recipient of a Congressional 
Veteran Commendation.
  During his deployment to Vietnam, Phillip Duprey faced grave and 
mortal danger while conducting intelligence collection as a member of 
the Army Security Agency for the IV Division of the 101st Airborne 
Division. 1LT Duprey's leadership, dedication, and bravery undoubtedly 
saved the lives of many. For his service and valor in combat, 1LT 
Duprey received numerous medals including the Bronze Star and the 
National Defense Service Medal.
  1LT Duprey's service and sense of duty did not finish with the end of 
his military career. Upon returning to the great state of Texas, 1LT 
Duprey dedicated his civilian life to the uplifting and betterment of 
his community. As a highly respected citizen, he is active in numerous 
community organizations, including twenty-two years on the Cedar Park 
Chamber of Commerce. Additionally, he served on the Cedar Park City 
Council for six years, the last two as Mayor pro tem. 1LT Duprey has 
dedicated himself to serving his community and is an embodiment of the 
Army values of honor, loyalty, and selfless service. For these reasons 
and many more, his community came together to honor 1LT Duprey as Cedar 
Park Citizen of the Year in 2000 and 2014.
  I commend First Lieutenant Phillip Duprey's selfless service to the 
U.S. Army, the nation, and his community. He is a hero who has devoted 
his life to defending our freedoms abroad and serving his community at 
home. I join 1LT Duprey's family, friends, and neighbors in celebrating 
his outstanding achievements.
