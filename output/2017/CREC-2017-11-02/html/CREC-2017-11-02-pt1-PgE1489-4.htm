                       Thursday, November 2, 2017

  Mr. YOUNG of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and 
congratulate Rose Bass of Adel, Iowa on receiving the Volunteer of 
Excellence Award from the Girl Scouts of Greater Iowa.
  The Girl Scouts of Greater Iowa strives to help give girls the 
courage, confidence and character necessary to make the world a better 
place, and they rely on countless volunteers to help instill these 
values. The Volunteer of Excellence Award recognizes those volunteers 
who have given outstanding service to help guide girls directly through 
the Girl Scout Leadership Experience or supporting the mission of the 
Girl Scouts of Greater Iowa. Rose leads Girl Scout Troops 468 and 505 
in the Adel area.
  Mr. Speaker, I am honored to represent community leaders like Rose in 
the United States Congress and it is with great pride that I recognize 
her today. I ask that my colleagues in the United States House of 
Representatives join me in congratulating Rose for this outstanding 
recognition and in wishing her nothing but continued success.

                          ____________________
