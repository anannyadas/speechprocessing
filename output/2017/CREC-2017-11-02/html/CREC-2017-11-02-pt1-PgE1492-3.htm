                       Thursday, November 2, 2017

  Mr. CARTER of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Corporal Pete 
Aranda, Jr., U.S. Army, a decorated soldier from Round Rock, TX. In all 
aspects of life, CPL Aranda goes beyond the call of duty. It is my 
honor to award him the Congressional Veteran Commendation.
  CPL Aranda enlisted in the Army in 1988 and served a short stint in 
the 3/64 Armor, 3rd Infantry Division in Germany. He then deployed in 
the spring of 1991 as a medic to Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, and Kuwait. As 
testament to the quality of his service, CPL Aranda received numerous 
medals and commendations, including the Combat Field Medical Badge, 
Expert Field Medical Badge, Army Commendation Medal, National Defense 
Medal, and two Southwest Asia Campaign Medals. A true patriot, Corporal 
Aranda continued to honorably serve after his discharge from active 
duty as a Respiratory Therapist at the 349th General Hospital, U.S. 
Army Reserve.
  In 1995, CPL Aranda returned home to Port Arthur, Texas where he 
worked for the Beaumont Health Department. In civilian life, CPL Aranda 
has served those around him with boundless altruism. His commitment to 
his community can be seen through his involvement in and leadership of 
many organizations, including the Greater Houston Red Cross, Camp 
Allen, the Talking Book Program and the Texas Stream Team. CPL Aranda's 
tireless efforts have touched the lives of many and have helped make 
Central Texas a place people are proud to call home.
  A reflection of the best values of our nation, CPL Aranda's service 
to his community and country has made a resounding impact on those 
around him. I thank CPL Pete Aranda, Jr., a leader with a servant's 
heart, for his dedication and service.
