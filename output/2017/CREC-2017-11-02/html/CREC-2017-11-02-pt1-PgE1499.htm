  CELEBRATING THE 175TH ANNIVERSARY OF ST. PETER'S EVANGELICAL CHURCH

  Mr. DENT. Mr. Speaker, I consider it a great privilege to recognize 
St. Peter's Evangelical Lutheran Church--located in Allentown, 
Pennsylvania--on the occasion of its 175th anniversary.
  In 1842, St. Peter's Union Congregation organized and purchased a 
tract of land for a physical building and cemetery in what was formerly 
known as Rittersville. On November 5th, the Lutheran sect of the 
congregation began conducting services in the new building; however, 
both the Lutheran and Reformed congregations shared the meeting space, 
holding alternating services. The surrounding area was mostly comprised 
of German and Dutch immigrants, many of whom worked at nearby Bethlehem 
Steel Mill. The United States offered them a chance of a new life, and 
St. Peter's served as a focal point for a community of shared faith and 
family ethics.
  Until 1897, the services were primarily conducted in German, but soon 
after, the Church purchased an English pulpit Bible. That same year, 
electric lights were installed, indicating an embrace of modernity as 
the Church entered the new century.
  On June 29, 1913, St. Peter's Evangelical Lutheran Church placed the 
cornerstone for the current church at 1933 Hanover Avenue in Allentown. 
The first service was held on November 2nd.
  As St. Peter's Evangelical Lutheran Church celebrates its 175th 
anniversary as a congregation and its 104th anniversary in its current 
building, the Church continues to serve the east side of Allentown and 
its ever changing neighborhood. May the next 175 years bring continued 
congregational growth, community impact, and diligent ministry.
