  Mr. YOUNG of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and 
congratulate Carol Wood of Council Bluffs, Iowa for receiving the 
Rotary International Vocational Service Leadership Award. The award was 
presented to Carol at the Rotary District Conference in Omaha, 
Nebraska. Carol has been a Rotary member since 1993 and is a member of 
the Noon Rotary Club of Council Bluffs, Iowa.
  Carol received this award for exemplifying integrity and high ethical 
standards in her vocation and in the community. She is President and 
CEO of Children's Square U.S.A. in Council Bluffs, a non-profit 
organization that has helped children and families in need for 135 
years. Carol's dedication and leadership has helped youth succeed in 
their vocational pursuits.
  Mr. Speaker, I am honored to represent community leaders like Carol 
in the United States Congress and it is with great pride that I 
recognize her today. I ask that my colleagues in the United States 
House of Representatives join me in congratulating Carol for this 
outstanding recognition and in wishing her nothing but continued 
success.
