CREC-2017-11-01-pt1-PgE1485-0|Mr. RUTHERFORD|R000609|CREC-2017-11-01-pt1-PgE1485|"  Mr. RUTHERFORD. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to ask the United States 
House of Representatives to join me in recognizing Meredith Corey-
Disch, a leader and business owner in my district, who was a recipient 
of a spot at the James Beard Foundation's Inaugural Class of the 
Women's Entrepreneurial Leadership Fellowship program. This program, 
hosted at the prestigious Babson College, aims to help female chefs and 
owners grow their businesses by cultivating women's leadership in the 
culinary industry.
   Meredith Corey-Disch and her business partner, Sarah Bogdanovitch, 
are exceptional entrepreneurs. Their business was founded on the belief 
that it should be local, community focused space that provides organic, 
traditional foods with shared work and fair pay. ``Community Loaves'' 
began in 2011 in Jacksonville, as an organic bike-delivered 
subscription bakery. The pair then opened a bread shop in 2014, where 
they served all-organic bread and pastries for breakfast and lunch. 
They kept the business community focused by holding special pizza 
nights and farm to table dinners in their garden and invited 
surrounding neighbors to these events.
   Meredith began her love of bread making through an apprenticeship in 
a bakery, while brainstorming ways she could start a business people 
would enjoy back in her hometown of Jacksonville. She can be described 
as thoughtful, kind, generous, and creative. With these skills, along 
with her passion of bread making, Meredith will continue to spread her 
passion throughout Northeast Florida. We need more creative small 
business owners like Meredith. She has been a true example of 
leadership for women in Northeast Florida and I look forward to seeing 
her future culinary successes.
   Mr. Speaker, I applaud Meredith Corey-Disch for her leadership in 
not only the culinary community, but in Northeast Florida as well.

Blancett, USN, Retired of Salado, Texas. With a career spanning over 
two decades, CAPT Blancett is a true patriot, a faith-filled citizen, 
and unquestionably a deserving recipient of a Congressional Veteran 
Commendation.
  CAPT Blancett joined the Navy at age 29 and was stationed in Guam, 
where he helped fulfill the spiritual needs of others. CAPT Blancett 
went on to serve his country in eight other stations around the world, 
with duties ranging from Public Affairs Officer, to teaching a course 
in the Naval War College, to furthering the spiritual state of his 
fellow sailors through various tactics with the Chaplain Corps.
  CAPT Blancett's love of country is matched only by his commitment to 
his community. Upon retirement, the call to serve continued to burn 
inside. CAPT Blancett has gracefully served as Mayor of Salado since 
2014 where he has been a champion of the Village's growing economy and 
its hard-working citizens. He is beloved by the Village of Salado for 
his leadership, commitment to faith, and passion for his community.
  CAPT Blancett serves the people of Salado with the same dedication, 
honor, and humility with which he served his country. He is an 
exemplary man who shows the utmost commitment to his family, community, 
and above all, his faith. May we all follow the example of great men 
such as CAPT Blancett, and live a life of hard work, loyalty and 
service to others.

Louisiana (Mr. Abraham) for 5 minutes."|0
CREC-2017-11-01-pt1-PgH8303-1|Mr. ABRAHAM|A000374|CREC-2017-11-01-pt1-PgH8303|"  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. Speaker, I have a map beside me. It is not a Verizon 
or an AT&T map showing its coverage. What this is is a snapshot, a 
moment in time, of the number of airplanes in the United States' 
airspace at any moment, over 90,000 flights a day. Think about that. 
That is over 200,000 takeoffs and landings.
  We, in the United States, have the safest and the busiest airspace in 
the world; yet there are some in Congress who want to privatize this to 
a board made up of 13 members only. I personally think it is more of a 
monopolization, not a privatization of our airspace.
  This is the taxpayers' airspace. This is not the airspace that we 
should be giving away to a 13-member board, or the control of.
  Those who want to pass this AIRR Act, H.R. 2997, want us to compare 
it to Canada. Well, I have flown in Canada. Look at the map: below the 
line in the United States, above the line in Canada. It is not even 
apples to apples. It is not apples to oranges. It is apples to 
elephants.
  And you say, well, that makes no sense. No, it doesn't. It does not 
make any sense to give control of this airspace, where our wonderful 
men in uniform and women who fly the military aircraft, the pilots like 
myself, but, more importantly, the carriers that carry all of us to 
here and there, the ability to control this airspace.
  I am a small-government guy, Mr. Speaker, but there are three 
instances where government needs to be involved in the lives of our 
citizens: national defense, national intelligence, and national 
airspace.
  I would argue that I have probably been in more control towers than 
any Member of Congress, and when you walk in, there are wonderful 
controllers who are looking at modern equipment, computer screens, 
display lights, who are moving aircraft here and there, very 
efficiently, very professionally.
  There are those who have stood at this podium, Mr. Speaker, and held 
up pieces of paper like this and have scared our people into saying: 
Oh, this is the way controllers transfer control of airplanes from 
airspace to airspace.
  That is a gross mischaracterization of what is happening. They use 
this as a backup if a grid goes down, but they don't use it to move 
traffic. They use modern computers.

  The NextGen, or what we call the next generation of modernization of 
FAA, is called ADS-B, Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast. It 
allows separation of aircraft to come down. It has saved billions--that 
is with a B--in fuel and other costs, and yet we want to give all this 
modern equipment to the control of a 13-member board? I think not.
  We have all had delays in airports. Most of them, I will tell you, 
are weather. But how many of us have pulled up in a plane and we are 
waiting for another plane to back out of a gate? That is not an air 
traffic control issue. That is an issue with controlling the gates at 
the airport, and that goes back to the airlines.
  How many of us have been delayed because they come on and when we are 
just fixing to board the plane, oh, you have a maintenance issue, or we 
are waiting for another pilot crew to get off one aircraft to pilot 
your aircraft? Again, those who would want to pass this act would make 
you believe that that is air traffic control's fault. No, it does not 
have to do with air traffic control.
  CBO has said that if we give this airspace control to a 13-member 
private board, it will cause a $100 billion deficit addition--$100 
billion. The Congressional Review Service has said that if we do that, 
that automatically allows sequester to take place. We don't need that. 
We are trying to get out of that now. Our wonderful men and women in 
uniform are having a hard enough time meeting quotas, meeting 
equipment, meeting training, everything, because of the sequester.
  This would hurt military retirement funding. This would hurt our 
Border Patrol, men and women there protecting us from terrorist 
activity on a daily basis.
  Mr. Speaker, we need modernization, but we don't need privatization. 
It is a bad idea any way you look at it.
  We do need to pass a long-term FAA reauthorization act. I am all for 
that. Our FAA needs to have the stability of funding where they can 
look down the road more than 6 months at a time and plan for what is 
coming down and what they need to do to keep our airspace safe.
  So, Mr. Speaker, we don't need this H.R. 2997 passed. We need just to 
fund FAA for a long time.

Solutions Caucus to speak on the issue of climate change. The caucus is 
a bipartisan group of members committed to implementing economically 
viable options to reduce climate risk.
  The caucus has a ``Noah's Ark'' membership rule. Members can only 
join in pairs, one from each party. Under the leadership of co-chairs 
Mr. Curbelo and Mr. Deutch, the caucus is helping to break the partisan 
gridlock on this issue and show that promoting climate solutions can be 
truly bipartisan.
  The formation and rapid growth of the Climate Solutions Caucus 
represents a recognition of both the challenges and opportunities and 
has demonstrated that there is bipartisan will to take action.
  In recognition of the fact that 60 Members of Congress have come 
together to fight climate change in a bipartisan fashion, I organized 
this time for my colleagues to join me on the floor to let the American 
people know what we, as their elected leaders, are doing to address 
climate change.
  We know, from scientific evidence, that our climate is changing. The 
global average temperature has increased by about 1.4 degrees 
Fahrenheit over the last 100 years. Sea levels are rising, the ocean is 
becoming more acidic, precipitation patterns are changing, and heat 
waves are becoming more frequent and longer in duration.
  Each of these changes produces a cascade of effects that impact our 
lives and livelihoods, including flooding, changes in crop yields, 
power shortages, declines in fisheries, and increases in cardiovascular 
disease.
  Recent events in our own country, such as devastating hurricanes in 
the Southeast and wildfires in the West have brought this issue to the 
forefront of everyone's minds. Now climate


change can't be directly blamed for all these problems, but the 
evidence strongly suggests that it contributes to each of them, and 
there are things that we can do to limit its effects.
  Climate change also has a significant impact on public health. A 
groundbreaking study published just this week in a medical journal, The 
Lancet, unequivocally showed that climate change is a serious public 
health threat. The study involved 24 institutions from around the world 
and included staggering statistics, such as the fact that air pollution 
caused 1.9 million premature deaths in Asia in 2015, and that the range 
of common disease-transmitting mosquitoes increased 9.5 percent since 
1950.
  We know that high temperatures exasperate health problems and that 
burning fossil fuels creates pollution that causes cardiovascular 
disease. The National Academies estimate that air pollution causes 
around $120 billion per year in health-related damages, including 
healthcare costs, missed days of work and school, and premature death.
  We also know that changing climate has altered the range, in some 
cases accelerated the spread of vector-borne diseases likes Zika and 
the West Nile virus. Responsibly transitioning to a clean energy 
economy will not only reduce the greenhouse gas emissions that 
contribute to climate change, but it will also reduce air pollution and 
help all Americans breathe easier.
  What I want to talk about for a few minutes, before I turn to some of 
my colleagues, is a very common misperception about the relationship 
between implementing climate solutions and growing jobs.
  Some people think that this is a zero-sum game. That is, they think 
if you have more of one, you get less of the other. But that is simply 
not true.
  Implementing climate solutions can grow jobs, especially new high-
paying jobs. The U.S. needs to take advantage of these economic 
opportunities. Regardless of what we do here in the U.S., the rest of 
the world has committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions and 
reaching the targets laid out in the Paris Agreement, as have many 
cities, States, and companies here at home.
  To achieve that goal, significant technological development and 
innovation will be needed, as well as infrastructure, markets, and 
distribution channels to get that technology to the people and places 
that need it.
  The national economies that produce this clean energy technology will 
benefit greatly. The U.S. still leads the world in technology and 
innovation. Countries around the world try to recreate the innovation 
ethos that exists in Silicon Valley and in other places across our 
Nation.
  The United States also has the workers who are needed to build these 
innovations. So we have what it takes, and if we seize the opportunity 
to invest in clean and climate-resilient technologies, then our economy 
and the American people will benefit as the world adapts to climate 
change and America grows good-paying jobs all across our Nation.
  But if we let this opportunity pass us by, then profits and jobs will 
instead flow to foreign countries that develop the technologies the 
world needs, and American cities and States will be forced to buy 
foreign products as they upgrade to climate-resilient infrastructure.


  That is why I will soon be introducing a bill called Challenges and 
Prizes for Climate Act. This bill will establish five or more prize 
challenges overseen by the Department of Energy to harness the 
ingenuity of the research community in the private sector to solve big, 
complex climate problems.
  Challenges have been used in the past by a wide range of 
organizations, including the XPRIZE, who used the challenge to jump-
start the commercial space transportation industry. This industry is 
now flourishing.
  I was just recently at SpaceX in California and saw their impressive 
manufacturing facility they have there. The U.S. is now relying on 
SpaceX in order to bring supplies up to the International Space Station 
and their plans to soon be flying astronauts. This commercial space 
transportation industry began with those who reached to try to meet 
this challenge and get the XPRIZE.
  The Federal Trade Commission also used the prize challenge to help 
bring a robocall blocking service to the market, something that we can 
all very much appreciate. That is why I am going this direction.
  My bill will create challenges that fall under five themes: carbon 
capture and reuse, energy efficiency, energy storage, climate 
adaptation and resiliency, and data analytics for better climate 
predictions.
  Using authority from the America COMPETES Act, the Department of 
Energy will convene working groups from across agencies, universities, 
nonprofits and the private sector to help plan the challenges, and even 
to contribute to the prizes.
  The goal of the challenge is not just to reward the winner of the 
best solution, but also to bring visibility to the range of innovations 
competing for the prize and to help society envision the future. This 
bill will help us see what our clean energy future will look like, and 
I urge all of my colleagues to support it.
  Mr. Speaker, I want to begin hearing from the bipartisan group of 
climate leaders who have joined me here on the floor this evening.
  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. 
Fitzpatrick), my Republican colleague."|3
CREC-2017-11-01-pt1-PgH8374-4|Mr. FITZPATRICK|F000466|CREC-2017-11-01-pt1-PgH8374|"  Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague, Mr. Lipinski, for 
his leadership on this issue.
  Mr. Speaker, serving as good stewards of our environment is something 
that each and every one of us are called to do no matter who we are or 
where we come from.
  It is critical in order to preserve public health. The reality is 
climate change is real and humans are a contributing factor. Congress 
must take serious and reasonable steps to combat it.
  As an Eagle Scout and a conservationist who grew up in Bucks County, 
Pennsylvania, I have always been captivated by the natural beauty of 
our open spaces and wild places. We have it all in Bucks County: 
preserved farmland, amazing parks, expansive forests, and historic 
rivers. I believe that with these natural treasures comes a special 
responsibility to care for and protect our natural resources at the 
local, State, and Federal level.
  Climate change and the irresponsible management of our resources put 
a strain on the health of our communities and our children. Clean air 
and clean water are essential to the health, safety, and well-being of 
the next generation of Americans.
  Mr. Speaker, protecting our Nation's open spaces unites us as 
Americans. That is why I joined 16 other House Republicans on House 
Resolution 195 to encourage American innovation to improve 
environmental policy and to protect, conserve, and be good stewards of 
our environment.
  I introduced the Udall-Eisenhower Arctic Wilderness Act, H.R. 1889, 
with Congressman Jared Huffman from California. This bill designates 
the 1.5 million-acre land of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge as a 
component of the National Wilderness Preservation System to protect it 
from damaging activities like oil and gas drilling.
  I have voted to protect the methane rule for stream protections.
  The Climate Solutions Caucus will continue to be the group that shows 
Washington how to forego the political gamesmanship and get to work on 
ways we can improve our environment, address the realities of climate 
change, and increase innovation with an eye towards sustainability.
  Protecting our environment cannot be partisan, Mr. Speaker. We have 
to come together to get this done as Americans."|4

my colleague who I have been working with for a number of years here in

CREC-2017-11-01-pt1-PgH8374-6|Mr. McNERNEY|M001166|CREC-2017-11-01-pt1-PgH8374|"  Mr. McNERNEY. Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Lipinski for his leadership on 
this.
  Mr. Speaker, I want to talk a little bit about climate. We know that 
climate is changing, and we have seen it.


In California, we had horrific wildfires that claimed 40 lives and 
destroyed thousands of structures. We have seen hurricanes more 
frequently, more devastating, and more powerful than ever before. So 
the effects are there. We see it happening.
  Now, the thing that we are faced with is that there is a significant 
section of people that deny climate change. You can sort of see why 
they are denying it. I mean, if something is in your interest, you are 
going to be able to talk yourself into just about anything.
  The big benefit of denying climate change is that we can continue to 
use fossil fuels. If you are a company that uses fossil fuels or 
produces fossil fuels, yeah, this is what you want. But there are costs 
of denial, and the costs of denial are clear.
  We are seeing weather. We just talked about that. We are seeing 
health effects. We have seen that both in terms of elevated 
temperatures, causing people to have heat problems. We are seeing 
disease vectors moving to the temperate zones from the Equator. We are 
also going to see significant infrastructure costs, like we see in 
Puerto Rico now. These are real costs that we are going to pay for the 
denial of climate change.

  Now, what are the benefits of climate change?
  Well, there are significant benefits, from my point of view.
  First of all, we have been spending American taxpayer dollars to 
develop technology to fight climate change, or to reduce carbon 
emissions.
  I will tell you a little story about my own career. I was working at 
a company called U.S. Wind Power. With some amount of taxpayer dollars, 
we developed the leading technology for wind energy. Of course, what 
happened was that the funding stopped, tax credits ended, and that 
technology that we developed with taxpayer dollars went to Europe. They 
built thousands of windmills in Germany, and they made a lot of money 
based on that technology that we developed and paid for right in the 
United States of America.
  We also know that renewable energy production creates more jobs than 
fossil fuel production for the same amount of energy. We are talking 
about a potential to create millions of jobs in this country. Not only 
that, but renewable energy has a stable price market feature. Unlike 
fossil fuels, which have highs and lows over a 10-year cycle, fossil 
fuels are going to be nice and stable, will be predictable. And 
businesses love predictability. So I think this is also another very 
good argument.
  Lastly, if we reduce fossil fuels and go to clean energy, we are 
going to have cleaner air and cleaner water, a healthier environment, 
and we can reach sustainability. I think the benefits are pretty clear.
  So where are we now?
  Well, there are still significant resources out there determined to 
muddy the waters and confuse people about climate change. I have three 
publications here I want to illustrate. One is called ``Clexit for a 
Brighter Future.'' Now, the point of this is that we need to exit the 
Paris and United States climate treaties because fossil fuels are what 
we need to power the future.
  Another one is called ``The Mad, Mad, Mad World of Climatism.'' This 
one, if you look it up, is biased, and it seems to be paid for by oil 
interests.
  The last one I want to show is a respected magazine that is called 
National Geographic. And the cover page shows ``The War on Science.''
  So I think we have a pretty good case to make for moving forward with 
action on climate change.
  There will be significant costs if we don't. Renewable energy is more 
than cost competitive these days. As I mentioned, I worked in the wind 
energy business. We see wind and solar being more cost competitive--
more than cost competitive, really--with coal and oil for energy 
production.
  So we have the technology, we have the means, and we have the desire 
to do this, yet we are still hung up here in Washington in terms of 
following through with government support that is needed with the right 
sort of policies that will encourage us to reduce fossil fuel 
reduction.
  Now, one of the great bright spots we see--as Mr. Lipinski, my friend 
from Illinois, pointed out--is that there is a bipartisan Climate 
Solutions Caucus that has been formed over the last two terms. In order 
to join, you have to have a Member of the other party. If I am a 
Democrat, I have a Member of the Republican Party join.
  What we are doing in that caucus is creating legislation that will 
help reduce carbon emissions in an economic and prosperous way. I think 
good things have a potential to happen. I encourage the caucus to 
continue, and I hope it continues to grow."|6

yield to the gentleman from New York (Mr. Faso)."|7

Illinois, for holding this Special Order this evening, to highlight the 
important work being done by the Climate Solutions Caucus, to develop 
economically viable solutions to address climate change.
  Mr. Speaker, changing weather patterns and extreme weather events 
threaten nearly every aspect of New York State's economy, including our 
agricultural and outdoor recreational sectors. The recreational economy 
alone generates $42 billion in consumer spending each year, while 
supporting over 300,000 Empire State jobs. As we work to address 
climate change in a bipartisan manner, we must employ a variety of 
techniques that both mitigate impacts and support economic growth.
  I am currently working with my Agriculture Committee colleagues on 
conservation legislation for the next farm bill that will provide 
important data points on conservation programs and outcomes, allowing 
legislators and regulators to most efficiently use taxpayer dollars to 
achieve real conservation results for our farms. These incentive 
programs support farming practices that, among other benefits, like 
increasing yield, lowering the amount of fertilizers that are employed, 
pull carbon from the air and sequester it in the soil.
  In addition to sequestering carbon in the soil. We can also work to 
reduce emissions through greater efficiency in the transportation 
sector. Indeed, the transportation sector is one area where 
CO2 emissions have risen in the last 20 years, unlike, for 
instance, the electric generation sector.
  One easy fix would be to modernize the air traffic control system to 
fly planes on more direct satellite guided routes because direct routes 
save fuel. When Canada switched to a modern air traffic control system, 
the national fleet was able to reduce emissions in that nation by 
millions of tons per year.
  These commonsense changes are great steps forward in combating 
climate change, but our work is far from over. We must address the real 
impacts of man-made climate change and emphasize the need to develop 
and create jobs with a goal of protecting our environment. It is 
critical that we work together to develop smart solutions that will 
conserve our natural resources and protect our communities and 
infrastructure for future generations.

  Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to be a member of the Climate 
Solutions Caucus, and I look forward to working with my colleagues. I, 
particularly, want to applaud our distinguished friend from Illinois,

level rise mean to their communities.
  Mr. Speaker, I am really pleased to join with my colleagues from the 
bipartisan Climate Solutions Caucus this evening to highlight the 
importance of taking action on climate change, something that matters 
so much to my constituents at home in Oregon, but also to the country 
and to the planet.
  This is an important issue that really is a moral imperative. This is 
about preserving our natural resources for our children, our 
grandchildren, and for generations to come. Addressing climate change 
is also vital to our Nation's economy, as we have had some discussion 
about that this evening, and also to national security, but, really, 
the health of the planet.
  Now, the district I am honored to represent out in Oregon is 
breathtakingly beautiful, and it is really full of potential. The 
majestic Columbia River is the northern boundary of the district, and 
the rugged Pacific Ocean is on the western boundary. It has a thriving 
outdoor recreation economy. As my colleague from New York mentioned, 
that is an important sector that cares a lot about the changing 
climate.
  I also have in my district the heart of Oregon wine country. People 
in my district fish. They fish in our rivers, our lakes, and our ocean. 
They hike in our forests. They ski in our back country and on our 
mountains. We rely on those natural resources in our backyard to 
support a significant part of our economy, but we are very vulnerable 
to the effects of climate change.
  My constituents are already experiencing challenges: Our wine and 
agricultural industries are concerned about drought as global 
temperatures continue to rise. Coastal communities are worried about 
the vitality of the commercial fishing and shellfish industries as high 
levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere change ocean chemistry.
  I was really thrilled that we had an Oregonian from Oregon State 
University come to the Climate Solutions Caucus and talk about adapting 
to ocean acidification.
  Our region has faced higher spring and summer temperatures and 
earlier snowmelt, and, as a result, a snowboard shop in my district is 
now selling more skateboards and fewer snowboards.
  Climate change is not a partisan issue. Nationwide, fishers, farmers, 
small-business owners, and our servicemen and -women are changing the 
way they do their jobs because of climate change, regardless of 
political affiliation.
  The economic, health, and environmental consequences of climate 
change are well known, and our understanding about how to address 
climate change continues to improve.
  People in the United States and around the world are facing threats 
from rising sea levels, from ocean acidification, from more frequent 
and severe weather events from record droughts and flooding and rising 
global temperatures. We can no longer sit back and debate whether we 
should take action. The time is now. It is critical that we support 
scientific research about the climate and that we build on, rather than 
break down, decades' worth of progress on this issue.
  Now, one important area of research is the connection between extreme 
weather events and climate change. Although it is not possible to say 
that climate change causes one particular extreme weather event, it is 
critical that we know more about climate change and how it increases 
the frequency and the severity of these events. Learning more about 
this correlation can help families, communities, and businesses make 
informed choices and adopt climate strategies.
  Now, this year has seen poignant example after example with so many 
devastating extreme weather events. We need to do everything we can to 
make sure our communities are prepared to keep families safe.
  We have had wildfires in the Western United States for a long time, 
but since the mid-1980s, they have been increasing in frequency and in 
duration, threatening lives, threatening public health and property. It 
has been unusually hot and very dry in the Northwest.
  Fires and severe smoke create dangerous conditions for all 
populations. In Portland, Oregon, on Labor Day, the sky was gray, full 
of smoke from wildfire. This is especially problematic for pregnant 
women, for seniors, for children, for anyone with chronic health 
conditions like asthma. Residents and communities miles away from the 
wildfires saw ash falling on their homes, their cars, and throughout 
their neighborhoods.
  This year's hurricanes have devastated communities, of course, across 
Texas, across the Southeast, and in the U.S. islands. About 70 percent 
of our fellow citizens in Puerto Rico are still without power.
  These storms are increasing in frequency and severity, and lives are 
being lost every year.
  Mr. Speaker, it is so important that we take action, and that is why 
I am so pleased to be here today to help highlight the importance of 
this issue.
  As Representative Lipinski noted and others have, Mr. McNerney and 
others, we can take action to address climate change and grow the 
economy. It is not an excuse to say this will be bad for the economy, 
because we can grow those renewable energy industries. There is so much 
potential in wind power, wave energy, solar energy. Those are good, 
high-paying, family-wage jobs. We can grow those economies and address 
climate change at the same time.
  Mr. Speaker, addressing climate change is going to save lives; it is 
going to save property. I am so pleased to be part of this bipartisan 
group that is working together in equal number of Democrats and 
Republicans to call attention to this important issue, and I will 
continue to work with the caucus to emphasize the importance of 
congressional action.
  Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues on the bipartisan Climate 
Solutions Caucus for their dedication to this effort. I know it is 
quite a relief to my constituents back home in Oregon to know that 
there are bipartisan Members who are committed to addressing this 
critical issue.

  Again, Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues for their dedication to 
this effort. I look forward to the progress that we will make together 
on behalf of our constituents, our communities, our country, and our 
planet."|10

(Mr. Deutch)."|11
CREC-2017-11-01-pt1-PgH8374-12|Mr. DEUTCH|D000610|CREC-2017-11-01-pt1-PgH8374|"  Mr. DEUTCH. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend, Mr. Lipinski, for 
yielding and for his thoughtful and passionate leadership in combating 
climate change, and thanks to the strong bipartisan cross section of 
Members who have come to the floor tonight to talk about the importance 
of tackling climate change.
  Mr. Speaker, I rise today to call on my colleagues, all of them, to 
join the bipartisan Climate Solutions Caucus. I started this caucus 
with my fellow Floridian, Congressman Carlos Curbelo, to start a new 
dialogue around climate and Congress because we are already facing 
difficult challenges. We can't ignore it. We can't bury it in political 
fights. We need to have an open discussion not only for our future, but 
for the impact of climate change that we are facing today.
  It is no coincidence that this project started with two Members from 
south Florida. A 2015 study projected that some south Florida cities 
could be underwater within this century. The study's author said some 
cities appear already to be lost.
  Climate change is already here for Floridians. The effects have hit 
Florida first.
  Scientists have warned of warming average global temperatures and the 
changing climate for decades. Dr. Andrew Clarke of the British 
Antarctic Survey has spent 40 years at the bottom of the planet 
watching it disappear. Dr. Clarke said: ``You can see the entire 
environment changing in front of your eyes.''
  We now have climate change right before our eyes in south Florida. We 
see the rate of sea level rise outpace the global rate tenfold. We see 
the high-water mark jump 1 inch every


year. Just this week, we see the tides flooding our neighborhoods.
  The limestone that serves as the foundation of our State is porous. 
Saltwater pushes up through the limestone from below the surface.
  Lower bridge heights will block boats from reaching open waters. With 
165 miles of canals, Fort Lauderdale faces significant threats of 
rising seas. Who in south Florida hasn't driven around their 
neighborhood and noticed more puddles, more water accumulating on the 
sidewalks and streets?
  While many Americans might be able to ignore climate change, ignore 
the science, based on their own personal experience and your own 
personal experience at home, we can't. Looking out our windows, we see 
what is already there.
  By the year 2100, almost 300 U.S. cities would lose at least half of 
their homes, and 36 American cities could be completely destroyed. One 
in eight Florida homes could be underwater. Those Florida homes 
represent half of the total expected loss in housing value caused by 
climate change over the next 84 years. These aren't risks of a distant 
future. These are the burdens we are placing on our children and on our 
grandchildren.
  In response, and through the work of the South Florida Climate 
Compact, Miami Beach has initiated a sea level rise plan to lift roads, 
build up seawalls, and install pumps to clear water in the streets. 
Fort Lauderdale is fixing roads and drains and sending vacuum trucks 
into the streets to prevent saltwater damage, upgrading building codes 
and flood elevation requirements, and requiring higher seawalls.
  In Florida, you can't put climate change out of sight or out of mind, 
but it is not just hitting Florida and it is not just the sea level 
rise or increasing temperatures.
  The National Climate Assessment has documented regional climate 
impacts hitting every area of the United States:
  In the Northeast and Midwest, dramatic increases in heavy 
precipitation events overwhelm drains and levies, causing flooding and 
accelerating erosion;
  In the Great Plains and Southwest, drought and wildfires strain 
demands for scarce water resources;
  In Alaska, receding sea ice and melting glaciers are damaging 
infrastructure;
  On the coasts, increases in carbon dioxide and warming seas lead to 
coral bleaching and ocean acidification that is taking its toll on 
fisheries and the ecosystems.
  The diverse and interconnected impacts that we already see throughout 
our country explain why we already have 60 Members who belong to this 
new dialogue, the Climate Solutions Caucus, 30 Democrats and 30 
Republicans committed to changing the conversation and pushing 
solutions that will create more resilient communities.
  We are committed to understanding the impacts of climate change, the 
impact on our national security; to investing in clean, innovative 
energy protection; to protecting our public health; and to overcoming 
the political obstacles that hold up public policy solutions.
  It is time for Congress to come together and admit the challenges 
that our constituents are already facing at home. It is time to build 
consensus.
  Through the bipartisan Climate Solutions Caucus, we have brought 
together Members from regions in every part of the country who are 
experiencing their own climate change challenges. I invite every Member 
of the House of Representatives to join us. Lift up the voices of your 
constituents, your farmers, your city officials, your developers, 
doctors, scientists, and, most importantly, the families whom you 
represent.
  If you are watching at home, call your Member of Congress and urge 
them to join the Climate Solutions Caucus and help us start the 
difficult work of building truly bipartisan consensus that will help us 
tackle climate change together and help us create resilient American 
communities of the future.
  Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my friend, Mr. Lipinski, again for 
organizing tonight's discussion."|12

pulling this effort together this evening.
  Mr. Speaker, climate change is real, and I applaud my colleagues on 
the Climate Solutions Caucus for working together in a bipartisan 
effort to try and find common ground and to seek to work together to 
pass legislation to address this very real threat.
  I believe the greatest opportunity we have here is to include efforts 
to move our Nation toward a greener economy as part of a comprehensive 
infrastructure bill.
  We must address climate change for three reasons: first, the Earth is 
part of the divine creation, and we have an obligation to preserve and 
protect our precious gift; second, moving toward a green economy that 
retrofits homes and buildings and installs solar and wind farms will 
create good jobs at good wages that simply cannot be exported; and, 
third, the main topic I wish to address this evening, is moving toward 
a green economy, reducing our dependency on foreign oil, and addressing 
climate change is essential to our national security.


  Americans rarely talk about it and sometimes forget, but we supported 
Osama bin Laden against the Russians in Afghanistan. We supported 
Saddam Hussein in Iraq after we lost the Shah after the Iranian 
Revolution. We supported the Assads in Syria. And we still maintain a 
close relationship with the Saudis, despite their support for 
Wahhabism. Why? Because our national economic strategy and security has 
relied for decades on access to foreign oil.
  Our meddling in local affairs to ensure the oil spigot flowed freely 
has sowed distrust across generations throughout the Middle East.
  By moving towards a green economy and eliminating our dependence on 
foreign oil, we can clearly say to the Middle East: We never wanted 
your land, we never wanted your money, and now we don't need your oil. 
All we want is for people of the region to stop trying to kill each 
other. It will take some time, but moving towards an economy 
independent of foreign oil is the best way to get there.
  In addition to eliminating our dependence on foreign oil, we must try 
to stall the rapid rise in extreme weather events, droughts, and 
desertification that is destabilizing huge swaths of the Middle East 
and Africa. The number of refugees in the world has grown from 35 
million only 10 years ago to 65 million today. War and violence are 
exacerbated by the instability caused by climate change.
  One of the most violent regions in the world today is Syria. The 
instability in Syria began with droughts that destroyed the livelihoods 
of the Syrian people that rely upon an economy which is 85 percent 
agrarian. When people lost their farms, they fled to the cities looking 
for work, but, of course, they could not find it. Then they looked to 
the Assad government, but, of course, were ignored. Fomented by the 
Arab Spring, they began to revolt. The result? The Syrian Government 
has killed almost a half million of its own people and millions more 
refugees. This story is being repeated throughout the region.
  Although the people suffering are thousands of miles away from the 
United States, our national security is threatened by these failing 
states. The rise of ISIS in Syria and Iraq is a prime example of the 
impact of failed states on Western security. Mass migrations by those 
seeking to alleviate suffering, millions seeking political and economic 
reforms place pressure on corrupt and incompetent governments that are 
unable to respond to the needs of a population seeking opportunity and 
hope.
  Our enemies who wish to foment instability--Russia, Iran, North 
Korea, and violent terrorist factions--are aided by the effects of 
climate change and the instability it causes. We must do everything we 
can to stall the growth of this nefarious trend.


  The good news is that there is a growing bipartisan consensus in the 
Climate Solutions Caucus and the armed services community that we must 
act. The Armed Services Committee in the 2008 National Defense 
Authorization Act acknowledged that ``climate change is a direct threat 
to the national security of the United States,'' and that ``the 
Department of Defense must ensure that it is prepared to conduct 
operations both today and in the future, and that it is prepared to 
address the effects of changing climate on threat assessments, 
resources, and readiness.''
  Secretary of Defense Mattis has said, ``Climate change can be a 
driver of instability, and the Department of Defense must pay attention 
to the potential adverse impacts generated by this phenomenon.''
  Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Joseph Dunford has said 
that climate change and rising sea levels pose serious long-term 
threats to the country. The number of natural disasters will increase 
in the coming years, along with ``the requirement for humanitarian 
assistance'' and the response required for the military for civilian 
disasters.
  Mr. Speaker, I want to thank again my colleagues for the work that 
they have done to try and bring the issue of climate change to the 
American people, and to try and find solutions to this very real 
problem that is not only affecting us here at home, but our national 
security throughout the world."|16

  Mr. Speaker, we are out of time to debate the reality of climate 
change. Its effects are already here. Recently, each year has brought 
with it record-breaking droughts, hurricanes, and natural disasters.
  My home State of California just experienced our deadliest wildfire 
season yet. This year alone, natural disasters will cost more than $22 
billion in recovery efforts. That is why I am proud to work with my 
colleague and cofounder of the Climate Solutions Caucus, Mr. Curbelo, 
to introduce the bipartisan Coastal State Climate Preparedness Act, 
H.R. 3533, which will help coastal States better plan for extreme 
weather events and implement climate change adaptation strategies.
  We can save lives, homes, and billions of tax dollars by encouraging 
these vulnerable communities to prepare their infrastructure for the 
impacts of climate change.
  After severe weather events like Hurricanes Maria and Harvey, it is 
imperative that we invest in readying our infrastructure for the next 
extreme weather event. Moreover, we also need to invest in developing 
renewable energy sources.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues in the House to join me and Mr. 
Curbelo in this effort."|18

from Illinois for leading this special discussion tonight. I am 
grateful to have the opportunity to come here for a few minutes. And 
more than anything, I thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, 
Republicans and Democrats, who have stepped up and said: Enough of the 
demagoguery, enough of the fact-less conversation. Let's focus on what 
is happening in the world, on how human beings are contributing to it, 
and let's try to make the situation better.
  I oftentimes say that, on this climate issue, neither the deniers nor 
the alarmists have much to offer. It is the men and women who are 
willing to sit at the table and have a sober conversation that can 
really help solve this problem. There are a lot of people who are 
counting on us to solve this problem.
  Sea level rise is a reality. It is happening all over the world. Mr. 
Speaker, you might understand why this might be important to me. I 
represent a community where most people live near sea level and near 
the sea. This is a real concern, especially in the Florida Keys, one of 
the most attractive and dynamic parts of the country, an area that is 
recovering. We hope our fellow Americans will help us continue 
recovering after Hurricane Irma.
  The Florida Keys and most of south Florida are significantly exposed 
to this sea level rise challenge, and we know that human activity is at 
least, in part, responsible for this dynamic. The Climate Solutions 
Caucus is not about blaming people. It is not about pointing the 
finger. It is about coming up with solutions.
  I think there are really three phases to our caucus and our work. The 
first phase was to bring Republicans and Democrats together, sit at the 
table, have a discussion about our different perspectives on this 
issue, invite in some key witnesses to help inform us. We have done 
that. We have done a good job. Caucus members have a very good 
relationship, a good rapport.
  The next phase has been to block anti-climate legislation. We have 
done that successfully here with some appropriations amendment where 
the caucus has come together and said: No. We are not going to prohibit 
the Defense Department from assessing the risks associated with climate 
change.
  Again, this is critical in my district. I happen to represent Naval 
Air Station Key West, where the men and women of the Navy work hard to 
train and prepare to defend our country overseas. That is a facility 
that is exposed to this threat.
  We came together and we defeated an amendment that would have 
prohibited the Defense Department from assessing these risks.
  I am really excited for the next phase of the caucus, which I hope we 
can reach during this Congress, which is to find legislation that we 
can all get behind and say that these are reasonable solutions that not 
only help the environment and help guarantee that we are going to hand 
off to our children and grandchildren the same beautiful Earth that we 
inherited, but also that we are going to provide opportunities for 
American innovation and growth, and new good jobs, high-paying jobs, 
for young men and women from all over this country. That is going to be 
very exciting, and we are all working together to get to that day where 
we can promote an agenda in this Congress that will bring Republicans 
and Democrats together behind a pro-environment, pro-growth policy that 
will save this planet and keep our country on the cutting edge of 
innovation, leading the world.
  This is a not an issue that we should shy away from. We should rise 
to this occasion. This is the country that has led the entire world 
through a host of different challenges over the last couple centuries. 
We can also do it on this climate issue, but I think we can only do it 
if we do it together.
  Mr. Speaker, I thank all of my colleagues, but especially my 
Democratic colleagues tonight who have led this Special Order, 
organized this Special Order. I think we all would like to invite our 
colleagues from both sides of the aisle to join the caucus, especially 
on my side. We are up to 30 Republicans, 30 Democrats. That is very 
exciting. When I arrived here a couple years ago, I probably had only 
two or three Republican colleagues who were even willing to discuss 
this issue, and now there are 30 on the record. Let's keep the caucus 
growing, let's keep it strong, let's work together, and let's change 
the world for the better."|20

for pointing out some of the victories that we already have had here on 
this House floor, the Climate Solutions Caucus. That is just the 
beginning. There will be plenty more to come as we grow this caucus and 
do the work that we are here to do.
  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr. Panetta), 
a freshman Member who is already making a big splash here getting a lot 
done in Washington, working especially on a bipartisan basis on a lot 
of these issues, getting some good things done.

I


think he and I know best that we had good teachers to help us 
understand what it takes to get things done here in the United States 
Congress, and, most importantly, that is the ability to work together.
  Mr. Speaker, I am proud to stand here today with all of my 
colleagues, Republicans and Democrats, who are on the Climate Solutions 
Caucus. As you have heard tonight, and as we know, the Climate 
Solutions Caucus is a bipartisan caucus that gives Democrats and 
Republicans the opportunity to sit down and to discuss ways not only to 
protect our environment, but to protect our homes, our Nation's 
economy, and our Nation's security.
  Yes, this caucus consists of people from separate political parties, 
but all of us are united in our belief that we must have this dialogue 
to defend our future.
  Being from the central coast of California, where we have over 120 
miles of stunning coastline in my district, we understand the 
vulnerability that comes with rising sea levels, something that can 
impact our economy, our security, and, of course, our daily lives.
  The co-chairs of the Climate Solutions Caucus, Florida 
Representatives Carlos Curbelo and Ted Deutch, they understand and they 
appreciate that threat, for earlier this year Florida was pummeled by 
Hurricane Irma and the subsequent severe flooding, a storm that 
affected the lives of millions of Americans and cost billions in 
recovery and cleanup efforts.
  We have seen that at times of crisis like that, despite the damage 
and despite our differences, our government and even this Congress can 
come together and put back together those communities. That is our 
government during an emergency, and at times where there are storms, 
where there is damage, we are motivated to come together and govern.
  This year, my district saw this type of governing due to damage it 
suffered during the major winter storms earlier in 2017.


  Every county in my district saw devastation. One county in 
particular, Monterey County, suffered an extreme amount of damage--the 
town of Big Sur, along the coast of California, in particular. The 
northern route of Highway 1, going into Big Sur, suffered a knockout of 
a major bridge. The southern route had a major landslide, leaving that 
community isolated.
  But I can tell you, 2 weeks ago, I stood on the brand-new bridge that 
was built. And as I was standing there, to me, it was a story of the 
people of Big Sur, very resilient, always coming back from these types 
of situations. But it was also the story of government working, people 
and government coming together, getting things done to help people.
  Now, just prior to that, I had read a New York Times editorial, where 
the title of that editorial was, ``We Used to Build Things.'' And it 
was by David Brooks, and he talked about this big fire called the Big 
Burn, back in the early 1900s, that started in Washington and Oregon 
and spread throughout the upper West, all the way into Montana. And 
from that devastating fire arose something, and that was the U.S. 
Forest Service.
  When I read that article, it reminded me that, throughout the history 
of this Nation, we have always built things to help people. We have 
engineered infrastructure to energize our economy, and we have expanded 
agencies to embolden and to empower our communities and the people who 
live there.
  So now, after the storms on the West Coast, after the flooding in the 
Midwest, and after the hurricanes on the East Coast, it is our turn. It 
is time for this generation, our generation, to build things in a smart 
and resilient fashion, so that future generations are secure and safe 
in their homes and in their communities. And we need to start by 
focusing on and building infrastructure that is strong and stable to 
sustain the inevitable intense storms of the future.
  Now, we know, and what has been confirmed by the nonpartisan Federal 
Government Accountability Office, that extreme weather events are 
already costing U.S. taxpayers billions and billions of dollars each 
year. According to that GAO report, the Federal Government spent more 
than $350 billion over the last decade on losses to private property 
and disaster assistance programs from natural disasters.
  Now, that amount doesn't even include the massive price tag on the 
recovery effort from this year's hurricanes and fires that are expected 
to be amongst the costliest in our Nation's history. And we know that 
it is going to get worse as storms are more intense, and recovery 
efforts are going to cost more. So we need to recognize and we need to 
realize the need for smart rebuilding.
  Now, after the 2012 hurricane up in New York, Hurricane Sandy, there 
was a Rebuilding Task Force that was put together, and it recommended 
that Federal flood protection measures should entail that projects 
receiving Federal dollars, they should comply with elevation and flood-
proofing measures to avoid rebuilding them after future storms. The 
report wanted to ensure that we do not need to pay multiple times to 
repair for flooding damages in flood-impacted areas.
  In 2015, the administration put forward the Federal Flood Risk 
Management Standard. That was a standard that set out that federally 
financed infrastructure projects must be built to withstand future 
storms and flooding. That standard was meant to ensure that taxpayer 
dollars are spent wisely and communities are protected.
  However, in August, this administration decided to roll back the 
Federal Flood Risk Management Standard, a decision that was compounded 
by its poor timing, as it was announced 2 weeks before the hurricanes 
that ripped apart Houston, Florida, and Puerto Rico.
  So last month, Congressman Curbelo and I introduced the Federal 
Infrastructure Flood Resiliency Act, a bipartisan bill that ensures 
that Federal agencies complete implementation of a Federal Flood Risk 
Management Standard; such a standard that will not just benefit our 
coastal communities, it will help our government, and it will help our 
country, because we know that every dollar that is invested in flood 
mitigation efforts results in $4 in saved flood recovery costs. This is 
something that Republicans and Democrats understand.
  After Hurricane Harvey, the Governor of Texas, Mr. Abbott, stated: 
``As we go through the build-out phase, and rebuilding Texas, part of 
our focus must be on rebuilding in a way that will prevent a disaster 
like this from happening again.''
  Mr. Speaker, by investing in more resilient project designs, our 
communities will be able to recover quickly, and they will be protected 
against any future flooding. Taking these prudent steps will save 
taxpayer dollars and prevent future loss of life and property. It is a 
commonsense step that we can take toward responsible, bipartisanship 
governing; and it is this type of governing that needs to happen all 
the time.
  Now, when I stood on that bridge, and I was there celebrating the 
reopening of that bridge, the reopening to Big Sur, I also thought that 
this was government at its best, where the government came together, it 
responded, it reacted in record fashion, and it reconstructed a major 
bridge.
  So yes, it made me proud, but it also made me realize that we need to 
stop just governing by crisis. We need to start governing with 
leadership. We need to come together to get things done, not just in 
emergency situations, not just for natural disasters of today, but we 
need to start governing for tomorrow.
  The Climate Solutions Caucus understands and believes that we, in 
Congress, need to lead. We need to do that by coming together. We do 
that by talking about the effects of climate change. We do that with 
Flood Risk Management Standard legislation, and we don't necessarily do 
it for us. We do it for our children.
  That is leadership, and that is why I am proud to be on the Climate 
Solutions Caucus."|22

colleagues for their leadership on this issue. The time to take action 
on climate is now. We can't leave this problem to future generations to 
solve for us. As we heard this evening, there is no shortage of good 
ideas for how to do so.


  I want to close by reading the mission statement of the Climate 
Solutions Caucus, which reminds us of the many reasons why our 
bipartisan group has come together to take action:
  ``The members of the Climate Solutions Caucus acknowledge the fact 
that, if left unaddressed, the consequences of a changing climate have 
the potential to adversely affect the health of all Americans and the 
strength of our economy, consequently imposing substantial costs on 
both State and Federal budgets.
  ``By seeking to reduce climate risk, we will, in turn, ensure the 
protection of our economy, infrastructure, and public safety, all while 
attaining energy independence from the world's most volatile regions. 
Therefore, it is our goal to take a market-based approach to 
substantially reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the United States in 
order to leave a better planet and stronger economy for future 
generations.''
  Mr. Speaker, this is something that all Americans can endorse and 
support. It is a better world and a better country.
  So I thank, again, all my colleagues for joining me here tonight, and 
for their work, all of the 60 members--30 Democrats, 30 Republicans--
for their work on the Climate Solutions Caucus.
  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

Martinez, the coward, fled the scene, but he was caught. Get this, Mr.

has been deported over 20 times. But the criminal does his time, gets 
deported, and just comes back into the United States.
  Our border protectors do the best they can, but they are outmanned, 
outgunned, and outfinanced by the drug cartels, criminal gangs, and 
outlaws trying to enter the United States.
  The Border Security for America Act authorizes a border wall, both 
physical and virtual, puts more boots on the ground, more boats in the 
water, and gives more equipment to our law enforcement.
  We must keep criminals like Martinez out of the United States.
  And that is just the way it is.

CREC-2017-11-01-pt1-PgE1486-0|Ms. ROYBAL-ALLARD|R000486|CREC-2017-11-01-pt1-PgE1486|"  Ms. ROYBAL-ALLARD. Mr. Speaker, I rise to congratulate the City of 
Bell on its 90th anniversary. I am deeply honored to represent this 
city as part of California's 40th Congressional District, and I ask my 
colleagues to join me in paying tribute to Bell and its residents on 
the city's anniversary.
  The foundation of the City of Bell can be traced back to the arrival 
of the first group of settlers in the mid-1870s. Among the settlers 
were the city founder James George Bell and his wife and children. They 
moved to a property on Gage Avenue that is now known as the Bell House. 
The house is now a historic landmark filled with antique furnishings, 
vintage clothing, and photographs, and is open for the public to visit.
  In 1898, the town's name was officially changed from Rancho San 
Antonio to Bell, in honor of its pioneer founders. The City of Bell was 
incorporated in 1927 and is a small, vibrant community composed of 
young families, small businesses, and an industrial district.
  Between 1920 and 1935, Bell experienced a growth spurt where schools, 
businesses, and community organizations were established, such as the 
Bell Chamber of Commerce and Bell High School.
  Since its incorporation, the city has expanded its facilities, 
obtained land for public parks and recreational areas, and acquired 
basic amenities such as a city hall, parks, a fire department building, 
and a police department.
  The city has recently enhanced transparency and accountability within 
the city government. In 2013, the city's website earned an A- from a 
non-profit organization that examines state and local government 
transparency. Through the city website, the public can now watch live 
streaming council meetings, look up city contracts, view warrant 
payments and public officials' salaries and compensations, and review 
budget information.
  Over the years, Bell has become a vibrant city with an innovative 
approach to enhancing its services and infrastructure in order to 
support its growing community. Bell encourages programs that provide 
recreational activities and community services, preserve and improve 
the environment, and protect the safety of Bell residents.
  In 2016, the Bell City Council adopted a five-year strategic plan, 
which outlines the top five targets for the city: economic development, 
community outreach, public image, developing and improving strong city 
management, and fiscal sustainability.
  Currently, the City of Bell is mostly composed of a large Latino 
population and a growing Lebanese American community. Bell's commitment 
to community engagement can be seen through the various programs it 
offers to youth, adults, and seniors.
  Over 700 children are participating in the city's soccer program and 
parents turn out in large numbers to support their kids. Some parents 
even become team coaches. The city has also developed new adult sports 
programs, and has been renovating parks by establishing maintenance 
procedures for the synthetic fields.
  Ernest Debs Park, which is home to the youth soccer program, includes 
a synthetic soccer field with covered bleachers and a covered fitness 
zone that are available to residents every day of the week. The largest 
park in the city is Veterans Memorial Park, which commemorates the 
contributions of war veterans to our country and our freedom. Veterans 
Memorial Park includes a veterans monument, a rose garden, a baseball 
field with stadium seating, two large park pavilions, and batting 
cages.
  Family events such as the city's annual street festival, the Summer 
Concert Series, and the Bell 5K Run/Walk have also been developed to 
promote community, health, and fitness in the city. The city's 
smartphone application has made it possible for its residents to report 
street improvements, pickup of bulky items, and graffiti removals 
through the touch of a button.
  The new City of Bell Technology Center has provided a safe learning 
environment where both adults and youth can access computers. This 
Technology Center provides free afterschool computer skills training 
classes, which include introductions to computer equipment and 
operation, word processing techniques, e-mail correspondence, and 
fundamental skills required for safe web access.
  As the City of Bell celebrates its 90th anniversary this month, the 
community will also be celebrating some of the following achievements: 
a ``Certificate of Achievement for Excellence in Financial Reporting'' 
by the Government Finance Officers Association of the United States and 
Canada; the establishment of a Planning Commission; the initiation of a 
``Business of the Month'' effort to highlight local businesses; a 
partnership with the Bell Chamber of Commerce to establish the Bell 
Family Food Truck Night; and adoption of the city's Strategic Plan and 
the new city logo.
  That new logo is shaped by a bell design, and includes the city's 
motto: ``Home . . . in the center of it all'' to inspire civic pride 
and civic engagement in the community.
  The City of Bell has made huge strides in the past couple of years 
and does not show any sign of slowing down. I ask my colleagues to join 
me in sending our best wishes and congratulations to Bell on its 90th 
anniversary. This small, diverse, vibrant community makes residents 
proud and visitors feel at home. I expect more great things to come in 
Bell's future.

Sergeant Will Williams, U.S. Army, Retired, of Round Rock, Texas, for 
his selfless dedication and service to our nation and his continued, 
unparalleled contributions to his community. I am honored to award him 
a Congressional Veteran Commendation.
  Following his enlistment in 1976, SGT Williams contributed 24 years 
of service that included deployments from Panama and Somalia, to Desert 
Shield and Desert Storm as an Army Ranger, Small Weapons Specialist 
with the 2nd Division. His commitment to keeping our nation safe is in 
his blood. Three generations of his family served in combat roles in 
the United States Army, and among the three they share 4 Bronze Star 
Medals.
  SGT Williams' service and sense of duty did not culminate with his 
military service. Upon returning to Round Rock, SGT Williams dedicated 
his civilian life to the uplifting and betterment of his community. In 
2013, he helped raise $50,000 for Dell's Children's Hospital and over 
$10,000 for the Ronald McDonald House. In Round Rock, SGT Williams 
organized a food drive, sent out a care package to deployed soldiers, 
and provided clothing and supplies to 300 foster kids through Project 
Care.
  His service has been recognized and appreciated throughout the 
community. SGT Williams was recognized with the Service to Mankind 
Award by the Round Rock Sertoma Club, received the Leadership Award 
from the ``Heart of Texas Award'' organization, and was honored with 
the Governor's Lone Star Achievement Award from Texas Governor Greg 
Abbott.
  I commend First Sergeant Will Williams' selfless service to his 
community and nation. His commitment to excellence and citizenship 
reflect the best values we hold as Americans. I join his family, 
friends, and colleagues in saluting his great work and dedication to 
our country.

Orta for his selfless service to our nation.
   Albert Orta's extensive career began in 1947 after completion of his 
entry level training at Lackland Air Force Base as a member of the 
United States Air Force. There, he tracked and noted weather cycles. 
Soon thereafter, he was promoted to work on the base's radar and 
communication equipment as an electronics technician.
   After his service with the United States Air Force, Mr. Orta 
continued to serve his country as an engineer with the United States 
Department of Defense at Lackland Air Force Base. His talents for 
engineering were well recognized and his responsibilities increased. 
Early in his career, he found himself traveling to well over fifty 
countries briefing Commanding Generals and U.S Embassy Ambassadors on 
communicative data and command post installation projects on behalf of 
the United States Military. His missions took him to Europe, the 
Philippines, Indo-China and to countries in Africa and South America, 
just to name a few.
   Mr. Orta also worked on military aircraft as a radar engineer and 
found himself assisting on the improvements and installation of radar 
systems in the early B series military aircraft: B29, B36, B47 and B52. 
Mr. Orta's work was so noted as a leader and accomplished engineer that 
he was assigned to equipping and testing radar systems in the early F 
series military aircraft: F84, F86A, F89, F102 and F106. His proud 
accomplishment was his role as the lead engineer in the development and 
installation of new radar technology for the United States Air Force's 
F102 Delta Dagger, a $6 million project at the time of his assignment.
   Mr. Orta's outstanding accomplishments and his willingness to serve 
our nation faithfully and to the best of his abilities in all positions 
was recognized by President Jimmy Carter and a host of Generals and 
Ambassadors acknowledging his incredible service to our nation through 
his work with the U.S. Department of Defense.
   Albert Orta and Mary Louise Guerrero married in June of 1949 and are 
blessed with 12 children, 31 grandchildren, and 29 great-grandchildren. 
Throughout his career and travels he recognized that sharing stories of 
his travels were important life lessons. There is no greater devotion 
of a father who returned home from a mission to share the experiences 
he encountered of a different life, different culture and hardships to 
emphasize the importance of hard work, the importance of quality 
education, to learn to be resilient and to appreciate the freedoms we 
enjoy today. He stands proud that his children and grandchildren are 
successful in their own professional careers; some educators, leaders 
in the private industries, medical field, financial advisors, some with 
a heart for public service and some who proudly served our country in 
the military.
   Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues in the United States House of 
Representatives to join me in honoring Albert O. Orta for his 
distinguished career and his proud service to our country; and to Mary 
Louise Orta for her service in standing alongside her husband, 
supporting him and their family throughout his missions.

back in Ohio: I am so very proud of you, your courage, your goodness, 
and your honor.
  Mr. Speaker, meanwhile, President Trump and the Republicans are doing 
everything to railroad tax breaks through this Congress to the top 1 
percent with no open hearings, with deals being cut in the Speaker's 
office. So I say: Whoa.
  It is worth taking a step back to talk about what a good tax plan 
contains. A good tax plan puts money back in the pockets of middle 
class working families and small business owners. A good tax plan spurs 
job creation right here in the U.S.A. Yet everything we have seen and 
heard from the Republicans does exactly the opposite.
  The goal should be to create more stability in our economy, not raise 
the deficit. We have got to stop businesses from shipping jobs overseas 
as companies hold their money offshore. They should bring it back home.
  Tax reform shouldn't be negotiated in secret. Why should lobbyists 
know more about the bill than Members of Congress? A tax bill shouldn't 
explode our deficit or threaten your 401(k) plan or hurt Medicare and 
Medicaid.
  It is time for Republicans to do their jobs, put forward a budget-
balancing tax plan that helps American families, not just billionaires 
and multimillionaires; and bring the plan forward in sunlight, not 
backroom dealings.

as I may consume.
  Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of H.R. 2936, the Resilient 
Federal Forests Act of 2017.
  As I stated last Congress, our national forests are facing an 
epidemic of declining health, which is a direct result of policies 
which have led to a dramatic decrease in managed acres creating 
catastrophic wildfires that have increased in size and frequency.
  The past two fire seasons have been some of the most expensive on 
record, and this year appears to be no exception. Secretary of 
Agriculture Sonny Perdue recently announced that wildland fire 
suppression costs for this fiscal year have exceeded $2 billion, making 
2017 the most expensive year on record.
  While the suppression costs are staggering, these fires come at a 
greater cost to local communities, private property, and pristine 
landscapes. Most importantly, they also result in the loss of life.
  For too long, our good folks at the Forest Service have been unable 
to do the work needed to manage our forest fuel loads. Over the years, 
the problem has compounded with more severe fires. Furthermore, these 
fires have consumed more and more of the Forest Service budget that was 
intended for management. This cycle has gone on for far too long.


  In the 2014 farm bill, we took meaningful steps to empower the Forest 
Service to carry out its mission. With passage of this bill, we will 
provide the Forest Service another tool to carry out their duties.
  This bill builds on the success of the farm bill to allow the Forest 
Service and their partners to manage our forests using sound science 
and environmental protections without fear of frivolous litigation. 
Further, it promotes good stewardship through restoration projects that 
protect our watersheds after catastrophic fire.
  As fuel loads increase in our national forests, the cost of inaction 
increases every day. This legislation allows the Forest Service to 
account for the environmental consequences of inaction, hopefully 
expediting treatments where needed.
  Finally, this issue extends beyond just fire. While they have not yet 
gone up in smoke, some of our national forests continue to deteriorate 
as a result of insect and disease infestations, leaving what was 
pristine and productive habitat so many in this Congress seek to 
protect.
  Mr. Chairman, I ask my colleagues to support this commonsense 
legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time.

         Committee on Education and the Workforce, House of 
           Representatives,
                                 Washington, DC, October 25, 2017.
     Hon. K. Michael Conaway,
     Chairman, Committee on Agriculture,
     House of Representatives,
     Washington, DC.
       Dear Mr. Chairman: I write to confirm our mutual 
     understanding with respect to H.R. 2936, the Resilient 
     Federal Forests Act of 2017. Thank you for consulting with 
     the Committee on Education and the Workforce with regard to 
     H.R. 2936 on those matters within my committee's 
     jurisdiction.
       The Committee on Education and the Workforce will not delay 
     further consideration of this bill. However, I do so only 
     with the understanding this procedural route will not be 
     construed to prejudice my committee's jurisdictional interest

  Mr. Chairman, H.R. 2936 addresses some valid concerns regarding 
forest management. The bill would simplify forest management activities 
while also tamping down on overzealous regulations and policy decisions 
made by activists and bureaucrats who have adopted a sue and settle 
strategy to pursue their agenda. This is one of the main reasons why I 
am a cosponsor of H.R. 2936.
  While this bill isn't exactly what I would do if I was in charge of 
putting the bill together, we need to do something to address forest 
management concerns, and I believe that this bill seeks to do that and 
moves us in the right direction. So I am supportive of moving the 
process along so that we can negotiate with our Senate colleagues and 
find a workable solution to address these issues.

Resilient Federal Forests Act. When we fail to actively manage our 
forests and Federal lands, we put ourselves and our neighbors at risk. 
It is time to better manage our fire-prone forests and fix how we pay 
for wildfire suppression.
  California just experienced the deadliest wildfire in our history, 
and 2017 is on track to be the worst fire season on record. We can't 
wait until next season. We have got to put the right policies in place 
now.
  The Resilient Federal Forests Act gives us the tools to immediately 
reduce the threat of catastrophic wildfires. It allows us to expedite 
the removal of dead trees and rapidly mitigate disease-infested areas. 
It enables us to responsibly manage our forests and improve ecosystems, 
and it permanently solves the fire borrowing problem. No longer will we 
deplete forest restoration and management accounts to pay for wildfire 
suppression. This will give our firefighters the resources they need 
without hindering prevention efforts.
  As California recovers from this year's fires, this bill will help us 
mitigate future wildfires. I urge my colleagues to pass this bill and 
help improve the health and resiliency of our Federal forests.


  Mr. Chairman, I include in the Record a letter from the Association 
of California Water Agencies in support of H.R. 2936.

                                                    Association of


                                    California Water Agencies,

                                                 October 31, 2017.

   ACWA Support for H.R. 2936--Resilient Federal Forests Act of 2017

       The Association of California Water Agencies (ACWA) 
     respectfully requests your support for H.R. 2936, The 
     Resilient Federal Forests Act of 2017. ACWA's 430 public 
     water agency members supply over 90 percent of the water 
     delivered in California for residential, agricultural, and 
     industrial uses.
       Recent severe drought and one of the most destructive 
     wildfire seasons on record have focused renewed attention on 
     the health of California's headwaters. That attention is well 
     placed because the forests, meadows and source waters that 
     play a critical role in our water supply and water management 
     system are threatened by factors ranging from climate change 
     to incomplete management to a lack of planning and 
     coordination.
       H.R. 2936 addresses many of these factors. It incentivizes 
     and rewards collaboration with local governments and 
     stakeholders by expediting environmental review for 
     collaborative projects up to 30,000 acres in size. It also 
     includes important provisions that will increase the yield 
     and protect the quality of our headwaters.
       Additionally, H.R. 2936 solves the perennial ``fire 
     borrowing'' problem, in which federal land management 
     agencies must raid non-fire suppression accounts in order to 
     pay for suppression activities. H.R. 2936 ends this practice 
     by allowing FEMA to transfer funds to the Forest Service/BLM 
     when all fire suppression accounts have been exhausted.
       As stated in ACWA's headwaters framework, ACWA believes 
     with more effective management ``healthy headwaters'' could 
     provide multiple benefits to California's water management 
     system and the environment. These benefits include: Increased 
     Water Supply Reliability; Improved Water Quality; Reduced 
     Impacts from Catastrophic Wildfires; Increased Renewable 
     Energy Supplies; Improved Response to Climate Change; and 
     Enhanced Habitat.
       ACWA encourages you to vote for H.R. 2936.

Minnesota, Congressman Peterson, for yielding this time.
  It is clear, I think, for everybody in this Chamber to know how 
devastating the fires have been, not only in California over the last 
recent weeks but throughout the West, and it has been this way for 
several years.
  It is long overdue for Congress to address the many issues facing our 
forests under Federal management, and that is what this legislation 
attempts to do.
  Years of mismanagement have contributed to the rise of catastrophic 
wildfires, not only in my home State of California but throughout the 
West. The heart of the problem is simple: money that Congress has 
allocated to prevent wildfires has been used instead to put them out.
  Now, there are other factors involved as well to be sure, but for 
years what we have done with densely overgrown forests that need 
managing is we have set ourselves up to allow these densely overgrown 
forests to be the subject of very destructive fires if something should 
go wrong; and, of course, we have lightning strikes and we have other 
natural conditions that cause these fires.
  This year alone, the United States Forest Service has spent about 
$2.4 billion on putting out fires and has transferred nearly $576 
million from management activities. These management activities would 
go to thinning the forests and to allow for better overall growth. This 
would be a preventive means to decrease the ability of these fires to 
grow.
  I have concerns with some of the provisions in this legislation and 
believe it can be improved with some modifications, specifically to the 
way fire borrowing is addressed and the size of categorical exemptions 
under public disclosure laws, but this is a work in progress, and we 
can deal with that.
  Let me be clear. We must reform the way our Federal forests are 
managed, particularly the impacts as a result of the changing climate 
that we have and as it becomes more pronounced, such as drought 
conditions."|9

only help with wildfire suppression, putting out these fires, but it 
will benefit the environment. With more effective management, healthier 
headwaters will provide for an estimated increased water supply of 
300,000 acre-feet of additional water--that is significant, certainly 
in a State like California--and improved water quality downstream.
  In closing, I urge my colleagues to work together to improve this 
legislation before it is sent to the Senate for consideration, because 
it is very clear in recent weeks, in recent months, and over the last 2 
years that the status quo is unsustainable. We must do a better job in 
managing our forests."|12

yielding me time.
  Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the Resilient Federal Forests Act 
of 2017. The National Forest System is governed by the principle of 
multiple use--conferring maximum sustainable benefits in the form of 
wildlife habitat, recreation, clean air and water, and timber harvests.
  Sadly, government red tape and the constant threat of litigation has 
caused paralysis by analysis at the Forest Service leading to a 
decrease of public recreation activities and a reduction of timber 
output.
  In the counties surrounding the Apalachicola National Forest in 
Florida's Second District--Franklin, Leon, Liberty, and Wakulla--the 
lack of timber management not only means fewer jobs, but it also 
creates a smaller tax base which means fewer resources to provide basic 
services like law enforcement and good schools.
  Under the Resilient Federal Forests Act of 2017, forest management 
will be driven by forest health and not by fear of litigation. This 
improves stewardship and strengthens communities. I encourage all of my 
colleagues to support this important legislation."|14

parts of this bill that deal with forest resilience, and I yield to 
people who know a lot more about forests than I do.
  But I am concerned that H.R. 2936 is harmful for all of the species 
that rely on forests for habitat and that the bill specifically 
includes provisions that specifically attack and undermine the 
Endangered Species Act.
  The bill allows the Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management 
to unilaterally determine if authorized logging and forestry management 
actions would adversely affect listed species or critical habitat 
without ever consulting experts at the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 
as is required by the Endangered Species Act.
  Furthermore, the bill declares that, for purposes of the ESA, all 
logging and other forestry activities carried out pursuant to the bill 
are ``nondiscretionary'' actions. Deeming these actions to be 
nondiscretionary serves as a direct waiver of the Endangered Species 
Act regulations and protections and allows forest activities to violate 
the ESA and jeopardize species.
  Another provision exempts the Forest Service and BLM from 
implementing regulations that require consultation on management plans 
when a new species is listed as threatened or endangered or there is a 
new critical habitat designation.
  This, in particular, will have profound implications for species that 
have been proposed or are candidates for listing under the ESA that 
rely on these lands for habitat, such as the North American wolverine.
  In short, this bill dismantles interagency consultation that is 
integral to wildlife protection under the Endangered Species Act.
  America's forests are home to over 400 threatened or endangered 
species, including the Florida panther, native wild trout, and the 
black-footed ferret. We cannot allow this bill to strip protections for 
these iconic species and eliminate environmental review processes for 
our Nation's forests. So on this basis--the threat to the Endangered 
Species Act--I urge my colleagues to vote ``no.''

  As far as the endangered species, I remember hearing about how this 
little spotted owl only could mate in virgin forests, and then it turns 
out some pair were reported to have mated in a Kmart sign. But 
endangered species will do best in managed forests where we clear 
underbrush and where we make fire lanes--where we manage the forests. 
The forests do better, and you stop the wildfires.
  If you want to just leave it to nature, nature will destroy massive 
numbers of acres of land. So we have a responsibility. Even in the

Resilient Federal Forests Act. My district is home to three national 
forests, Ottawa, Hiawatha, and Huron-Manistee. So when we use the term 
``in our neck of the woods,'' we mean it.
  We understand how vitally important proper management of forests is 
for our environment, our economy, and our special way of life in 
northern Michigan and the Upper Peninsula. I live right in the middle 
of the Ottawa National Forest, so this issue really does hit close to 
home for me.
  Now as we have seen the devastation from forest fires in the West, it 
is more important than ever to have this debate. But it is impossible 
to talk about the need for wildfire suppression without talking about 
proper forest management. These two go hand in hand--or at least they 
should go hand in hand.


  All too often, we hear rhetoric that managing our forests and 
removing dead or dying trees is a bad thing. This can't be further from 
the truth.
  When we leave these dried, rotting trees laying on the forest floor, 
they become an incendiary breeding ground for fires. Those fires cost 
the Forest Service billions of dollars and countless hours of manpower 
to extinguish. Last year alone, we spent $2.9 billion on suppression 
efforts. This leaves barely any financial resources to allocate towards 
actually managing our forests.
  H.R. 2936 seeks to end this cycle. Let's get at the problem now so it 
doesn't become a disaster later. This is not a partisan issue. This is 
a commonsense solution for our federally owned forest land.
  Mr. Chairman, I include in the Record a letter from the Forest 
Products Industry National Labor Management Committee and a letter from 
the Intertribal Timber Council.

                                                 October 31, 2017.
     Hon. Rob Bishop,
     House of Representatives,
     Washington, DC.
     Subject: Support for HR 2936, The Resilient Federal Forests 
         Act of 2017.
       Dear Congressman Bishop: As chair of the Forest Products 
     Industry National Labor Management Committee, I am writing in 
     strong support of HR 2936, The Resilient Federal Forests Act 
     of 2017. I urge you to vote in support of HR 2936 when it 
     comes to the floor of the House of Representatives for a vote 
     on Wednesday, November 1.
       The Forest Products Industry National Labor Management 
     Committee is a non-profit trust formed to pursue the common 
     public policy interests of the working men and women in the 
     forest products industry. Collectively, the Committee 
     represents more than two million workers across the nation, 
     including lumber and sawmill workers, woodworkers, 
     machinists, carpenters, and pulp and paper workers.
       The balanced and sustainable management of our federally-
     owned forests has been of significant interest to the 
     Committee since it was founded in 1990. Since that time, the 
     Committee has engaged on numerous pieces of federal forest 
     and related legislation.
       HR 2936 is a bipartisan measure that will address the 
     growing economic and environmental threats posed by 
     catastrophic wildfires. HR 2936 provides a responsible 
     budgetary solution and targeted forest management reforms to 
     improve the health and resiliency of America's forests. 
     Adoption of these proposals will enhance federal forest 
     stewardship; protect forest ecosystems from catastrophic fire 
     and disease; and preserve rural, family wage jobs.
       The Forest Products Industry National Labor Management 
     Committee urges you to vote in support of HR 2936, the 
     Resilient Federal Forests Act of 2017, when the measure comes 
     to the floor of the House of Representatives for a vote this 
     week.

yielding.
  Mr. Chairman, many of my colleagues have asked, because of the recent 
fires in my district, how I will be voting on this measure today. Well, 
I am a ``no.''
  My district experienced the worst wildfires in California history. 
Fires burned close to 300,000 acres, killed 43 people, forced more than 
100,000 people to evacuate, decimated some 7,000 homes, and left 10,000 
people homeless in the city of Santa Rosa alone.
  Our fires didn't burn Forest Service lands and they didn't start on 
public land, so nothing in this bill that we are discussing here today 
could have prevented the devastation in my district.
  I agree that we should be doing more to prepare for catastrophic fire 
events, but this bill doesn't achieve that goal. Instead, it guts 
longstanding protections and fails to fix the budgetary issues that 
plague fire management. In


fact, this bill could make things worse by creating more red tape for 
agencies when they are actively responding to wildfires.
  That is why I joined Representative Huffman to introduce an amendment 
that would have more directly addressed the risk of wildfires. We 
incorporated provisions based on:
  Representatives Simpson's and Schrader's Wildfire Disaster Funding 
Act that gives land management agencies access to funding to fight 
wildfires without jeopardizing other agency programs;
  Legislation that I dropped today that is the companion bill to 
Senators Cantwell's and Risch's Wildland Fires Act, which provides 
funding to help communities prepare for wildfires and target high-risk 
areas for prescribed burns. The gentleman from Nevada (Mr. Amodei) is 
the coauthor of that legislation;
  We incorporated Representatives LaMalfa's and Schrader's Electricity 
Reliability and Forest Protection Act, which passed the House earlier 
this year, and allows for hazardous vegetation management on Federal 
lands that abut electrical transmission lines;
  We also incorporated Representative Ruiz's Wildfire Prevention Act 
that allows States to apply for hazard mitigation grants for wildfire 
prevention projects.
  Instead of considering controversial measures that will meet a dead 
end once it gets to the Senate, we should pass these bipartisan, 
practical, and effective solutions.
  The fires that tore across my State must not be used as an excuse to 
undermine fundamental environmental laws that protect public lands. 
They should motivate us to work together to protect communities from 
the devastation that my constituents are facing today."|24

  Montana faced a devastating wildfire season. Over 1 million acres 
have burned in our State. Lives were lost. Our livelihoods were 
threatened. Wildlife habitats were destroyed. We breathed the smoke as 
the clouds hung in the air.
  Earlier this week, the gentleman from Arkansas and I met with 
conservationists, the Forest Service, local leaders, and key 
stakeholders, including the Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation. They all 
affirmed that litigation and an inability to inappropriately manage our 
forests are the problem that lead to severe wildfires.
  When catastrophic wildfires strike, we keep treating the symptoms--
suppressing the fires--and somehow think that the next wildfire will be 
different. We have to address the underlying issues. We have to reform 
how we manage our forests. We have to make our forests healthier and 
our wildfires less severe. We can begin that process today.
  The people of Montana need relief and a long-term solution. I 
encourage my colleagues to support this bill."|26

     NLBMDA Praises Reintroduction of Resilient Federal Forests Act

       Washington, DC.--The National Lumber and Building Material 
     Dealers Association (NLBMDA) praises the introduction 
     yesterday of the Resilient Federal Forests Act by (H.R. 2936) 
     Rep. Bruce Westerman (R-AR). The legislation helps protect 
     the national forest system by implementing best practices 
     intended to lessen the threat of wildfires. Original 
     cosponsors for the bipartisan bill include Reps. Raul 
     Labrador (R-ID), Tom McClintock (R-CA), Cathy McMorris 
     Rodgers (R-WA), Rick Nolan (D-MN), Collin Peterson (D-MN), 
     and Scott Tipton (R-CO).
       Rep. Westerman introduced the legislation during the 
     previous Congress in 2015, where it passed the House of 
     Representatives by a vote of 262-167 with support from 21 
     Democrats who crossed the aisle to support the bill.
       The U.S. Forest Service manages over 190 million acres. Of 
     this, 46 million acres is designated as allowable for timber 
     harvest. Timber harvests from federal forests declined by 78 
     percent between 1987 and 2015, from 11.3 to 2.5 billion board 
     feet. This is far below the long-term, sustainable capability 
     of these lands of 12.2 billion board feet per year.
       Poor land management during the past 30 years has led to 
     declining health of national forests. This has resulted in 
     fewer jobs and productivity in the forestry sector, fewer 
     board feet of domestically produced lumber entering the 
     market, and a marked increase in acreage ravaged by insects, 
     disease and fire.
       ``The Resilient Federal Forests Act strikes a balanced 
     approach in managing the national forest system by making 
     more land available for logging in an environmentally 
     sustainable way,'' said Jonathan Paine, NLBMDA President and 
     CEO. ``NLBMDA thanks Congressman Westerman for his leadership 
     on this important issue.''
       NLBMDA supports greater sustainable harvesting of federal 
     forests to meet long-term demand for lumber as part of a 
     comprehensive plan that does not place U.S. private forests 
     at a competitive disadvantage."|29

real forest management in stark relief for those of us who live out 
West.
  The current laissez-faire forest policy, with random desperate 
measures to fight increasingly horrific fires that threaten and destroy 
rural and now--as we have seen in California--suburban communities is 
completely inadequate and increasingly costly to the taxpayer.
  This bill, contrary to what some have said, rewards communities that 
have proactive, collaborative programs; stewardship programs; rural 
advisory committees; and wildfire protection plans to manage their 
forests without redundant NEPA processes.
  A few thousand acres out of the millions acres of Federal forest land 
are now going to be enabled to be managed for wildlife successional 
forest habitat; removal of dangerous roadside and infrastructure 
threatening vegetation; insect and disease infestations; reducing 
hazardous fuel in the forests; and,


frankly, doing a little reforesting of salvage projects, which should 
have been allowed years ago.
  We also pilot a few arbitration projects to stop the endless 
frivolous litigation of every single forest project, at least in 
Oregon, and I think elsewhere.
  SRS payments continue to rural communities whose way of life has 
been, basically, taken away from them by the endless frivolous 
litigation in our Federal forests. Counties, for the first time, get 
some revenue from the very stewardship contracts that we want to 
encourage, but not at the expense of rural communities' economic 
health.
  Many are still stuck in the recession, and this bill is critical to 
their revival. Oregon counties in the Oregon and California railroad 
areas also get the opportunity to be made whole again, like the 
original statute said.
  I think it is important to note for a lot of our friends out there 
that the current regional forest plans still apply and are not 
undermined. We just give flexibility to the Forest Service folks within 
the regions to do what they think needs to be done to keep those 
forests healthy. We empower good management.
  For those of you who are interested in innovation, this bill actually 
calls out cross-laminated timber and other thoughtful uses of forests 
and timber that can bring environmental and timber groups together like 
it should be in the 21st century.
  Finally, most important of all for some folks, we actually get 
wildfire disaster funding included as a reasonable topic of 
conversation and get out of the current fire-borrowing policy that is 
preventing the Forest Service and BLM from doing good forest management 
to prevent those fires in the first place.
  On balance, frankly, this is a very good bill and it is much-needed 
at this time."|31

tools to better manage our national forests.
  To keep our forests healthy and productive, we must ensure we have 
skilled loggers to safely work in those forests. I thank Representative 
Westerman for including my bill, the Future Logging Careers Act, in his 
bill that is on the floor today.
  My bill will allow 16- and 17-year-olds to learn the logging business 
by working in family-owned mechanized logging operations under the 
supervision of their parents. That will allow the next generation of 
loggers to learn valuable skills, prepare to take over family 
businesses, and provide the wood products needed to support our 
economy.
  I learned of the need for this bill after meeting two Idaho loggers 
from third-generation logging families, Tim Christopherson from Idaho 
County and Tom Mahon from Adams County.
  Mahon's 16-year-old son, J.T., was working under his father's 
supervision when a Forest Service employee sent him home. J.T. couldn't 
work in the woods because logging doesn't have an exemption that has 
long been enjoyed by family farms under the Fair Labor Standards Act."|33

  Mr. Chairman, I include in the Record a letter from the National Wild 
Turkey Federation and a letter from the National Association of 
Counties, Western Interstate Region, in support of H.R. 2936.

                              National Wild Turkey Federation,

                                     Edgefield, SC, June 26, 2017.
     Hon. Rob Bishop,
     Chairman, Natural Resources Committee,
     House of Representatives, Washington, DC.
     Hon. Raul Grijalva,
     Ranking Democrat, Natural Resources Committee, House of 
         Representatives, Washington, DC.
       Dear Chairman Bishop and Representative Grijalva: On behalf 
     of the National Wild Turkey Federation (NWTF) and its 230,000 
     members, we urge you to take swift Committee action on H.R. 
     2936 the Resilient Federal Forest Act of 2017. The NWTF is a 
     leader in wildlife habitat conservation in North America and 
     is dedicated to the conservation of the wild turkey and 
     preservation of our hunting heritage. We are currently 
     working towards our 10-year Save the Habitat. Save the Hunt 
     initiative in which we aim to conserve or enhance 4 million 
     acres of critical habitat, recruit 1.5 million hunters and 
     open 500,000 acres for outdoor enjoyment
       Active forest management is crucial to establishing healthy 
     and sustainable forests and decisions for forest management 
     should be based on sound science. As such, the common sense 
     solutions offered in H.R. 2936 are imperative to the health 
     and future of our nation's forests and important to the NWTF 
     to help achieve our objectives. In total, H.R. 2936 has many 
     reasonable solutions to the challenges that the managing 
     agencies face to increase the pace and efficiency of active 
     forest management on our nation's federal lands. We take this 
     opportunity to highlight those solutions that we believe will 
     make the most immediate difference and offer recommendations 
     as to how we believe the bill can be further improved.
       We support increased availability for Categorical 
     Exclusions (CE) in order to deal more effectively and 
     efficiently with threats like pests and disease and for 
     addressing urgent wildlife needs like critical habitat for 
     endangered species. We are especially supportive of the CE 
     that will allow for activities that enhance early 
     successional forests for wildlife habitat. Unlike some 
     critics of CEs who will suggest, they do not exempt the 
     action from the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), 
     rather they apply the NEPA review to like or similar actions 
     to expedite the process. These are administered under Council 
     on Environmental Quality regulations and other guidance. 
     Increased use of CEs is one of the best opportunities we have 
     in the short term to increase the pace of active forest 
     management.
       Funding the cost of fighting catastrophic wildfires outside 
     of the agency budget is paramount to the agency's ability to 
     deliver on other aspects of their mission. We are supportive 
     of a fix that will allow catastrophic wildfires to be 
     considered a disaster. Until agencies are freed from the 
     burden of fighting catastrophic wildfires through their 
     annual budgets we will be unable to make meaningful progress 
     towards proactive forest management. We recommend capping the 
     firefighting budget at the current 10-year average to protect 
     further erosion of the U.S. Forest Service budget in other 
     important mission delivery areas.
       We support the bill's provisions for large scale 
     reforestation on fire-impacted lands. While public input and 
     review is essential to public lands management, currently it 
     can result in delayed action and result in an inability to 
     accomplish the necessary objectives. We believe the deadlines 
     set for plan development and public input, as well as the 
     prohibition on restraining orders and preliminary injunctions 
     strike a reasonable balance. We recommend that this provision 
     of the bill clarify that proper ecological restoration is 
     allowed as a mechanism to salvage forests post catastrophic 
     events as reforestation may not always be the best action for 
     the ecological good.
       The NWTF strongly supports arbitration as an alternative to 
     litigation. This will conserve valuable U.S. Forest Service 
     resources and expedite work getting done on the ground. 
     Additionally, we support the provision that does not allow 
     plaintiffs challenging a forest management activity to 
     receive any award or payment obligated from the Claims and 
     Judgment Fund.
       We support the approach for allowing evaluation of only 
     action/no-action alternatives for collaborative Forest Plans, 
     Resource Advisory Committee and Community Wildfire Protection 
     Plan projects. Limiting the number of alternatives will 
     expedite the development of environmental assessments and 
     allow work to get done on the ground more quickly. We also 
     support the requirement to look at consequences of a no-
     action alternative as a no-action decision would still have 
     an impact on the resource.
       We understand budget concerns counties face and are 
     supportive of a portion of retained receipts from stewardship 
     contracts going to the counties. Stewardship Contracting is 
     an important tool for active forest management. Ultimately 
     this change will remove one impediment to utilizing 
     Stewardship Contracting and help garner support from the 
     counties. We recommend modifying this section to reflect that 
     payment should come only from retained receipts on completed 
     projects, versus strictly from timber value within ongoing 
     projects. This will maintain the ``exchange of goods for 
     services'' function of Stewardship Contracting while also 
     preserving the balance of timber dollars and the investment 
     of matching funds from organizations like the NWTF to expand 
     the scope and scale of projects, thus accomplishing more 
     active management and fire protection across the landscape 
     and within counties.
       We appreciate the recognition of the importance of funding 
     planning activities for forest management. We are concerned 
     that the provision could potentially provide justification 
     for the U.S. Forest Service staff to refrain from fully 
     utilizing product value and


     partner match dollars for on the ground work. While we feel 
     the 25% threshold is too high, the provision of allowing some 
     of the stewardship project revenues to cover the costs of 
     planning additional projects could be beneficial and 
     incentivize project planning.
       We also appreciate the common-sense amendments to the 
     Endangered Species Act (ESA) that will improve the process of 
     protecting endangered and threatened species and their 
     habitat. The bill overturns the ``Cottonwood'' court 
     decision, which directs that if additional critical habitat 
     is designated under an approved Forest Plan or Resource 
     Management Plan, a section 7 programmatic re-consultation of 
     the entire Forest Plan needs to be done. The U.S. Fish and 
     Wildlife Service and the Obama Administration argued that the 
     section 7 consultation needs only to be done on the portion 
     of the project covering the additionally designated acreage 
     of critical habitat. The remedy in this bill will greatly 
     reduce the debilitating process that the federal court 
     decision directs. The bill also affirms current U.S. Fish and 
     Wildlife Service policy that no ESA section 7 consultation is 
     required if the U.S. Forest Service or Bureau of Land 
     Management determines through informal consultation that the 
     proposed action will not likely have an adverse affect on 
     species or critical habitat. We further support the 90 day 
     threshold on a CE established by this bill because it will 
     conserve agency resources and expedite management activities 
     on the ground.
       We commend Congressman Westerman, the co-sponsors, and 
     Chairman Bishop for their dedication to restoring and 
     maintaining our federal forests under management informed by 
     science, and offering the appropriate reforms to management 
     practices. We respectfully urge that you expeditiously report 
     H.R. 2936 out of Committee and to the House floor.
           Sincerely,
                                             Rebecca A. Humphries,
     Chief Executive Officer."|36

expensive year on record, with over $2 billion spent to combat fires 
that have burned almost 9 million acres of land.
  As of October 29, State and Federal firefighters responded to 8,300-
plus fires, covering over 1.1 million acres in California alone, nearly 
doubling the amount of acres burned in 2016.
  A complete lack of forest management in California has left our 
forests more combustible than ever, leading to one of the worst 
wildfire seasons in our State's history. That is why the bill of my 
colleague, Mr. Westerman, H.R. 2936, is very important.
  The Resilient Federal Forests Act includes what I believe to be 
critically important reforms in forest management, such as expedited 
environmental reviews and the availability of categorical exclusions 
for forest management activities to help achieve these goals.
  Our Federal lands are hurting. They are in desperate need to be 
managed in order to not have these disasters each and every year. We 
can either thin the trees and the brush out, or watch them


go up in smoke every year and become part of our brown skies, instead 
of the blue skies that we would normally enjoy.
  We can't afford this inaction anymore. We need to move this 
legislation and clean up California's forests for all."|39

member of the Agriculture Committee for his support, and also Mr. 
Westerman from Arkansas, the author of this bill.
  The Resilient Federal Forests Act of 2017 is a bipartisan solution to 
address the growing economic and environmental threats from 
catastrophic wildfires.
  As we have heard already, 2017 has had the costliest wildfires on 
record, with the Forest Service spending over $2 billion. We have had 
the loss of communities and lives lost. The greatest cause of this 
uptick in wildfires is the severe lack of forest management.


  This legislation pairs a responsible budget fix with forest 
management reforms, improves the health and resiliency of our Nation's 
forests and rangelands, and provides Federal Land Management agency 
tools to increase the pay scale and cost efficiency of forest 
management projects without sacrificing environmental protections.
  The bill permanently solves the wildfire borrowing problem by 
allowing FEMA to transfer limited funds to the Forest Service or BLM 
when the rest of their wildfire suppression funding has been exhausted.
  It prevents wildfires by authorizing the tools for the Forest 
Service, tools that they are looking for in the Bureau of Land 
Management that they can implement immediately to mitigate insect and 
disease infestation, prevent damage to municipal watersheds and 
critical infrastructure quickly, harvest wildfire, kill trees to pay 
for the reforestation, and the bill encourages quick reforestation that 
accelerates habitat improvement.
  This bill does incentivize collaboration, supports local government, 
and modernizes the Secure Rural Schools Act.
  Mr. Chairman, I would just ask my colleagues for their support of 
H.R. 2936, the Resilient Federal Forests Act of 2017, and I yield back 
the balance of my time."|41
CREC-2017-11-01-pt1-PgH8326-42|Mr. BISHOP of Utah|B001250|CREC-2017-11-01-pt1-PgH8326|"  Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume.
  As we make this transition, let me try and sum up where we are at 
this particular time.
  This particular bill was done in coordination with the U.S. Forest 
Service under both the Obama administration and the Trump 
administration. This has the approval of local governments, Tribes, 
sportsmen's groups, and labor unions. The last time we had this bill, 
it had a good bipartisan vote on it, but these are issues that the 
Forest Service needs and they can use on day one of their issue.
  What the Forest Service needs are resources, obviously. We know that. 
But they also need the tools that they need to actually do their work.
  Now, there are some on the fringe who are going to say that 
everything is wrong here, but I would encourage them to get rid of the 
usual rhetoric and to pocket the dogma for a minute and realize that 
what we need to do is come up with a system that affects the planning 
process.
  The Forest Service admits they have 50 to 60 million acres of 
forestland today that is ready to be a catastrophic catastrophe. They 
want to treat 25 percent of what they own a year. They are only 
treating 2 to 3 percent. That means, of the 50 to 60 million acres they 
have that are in dire situations right now, they can only treat 3 a 
year. That would take them 20 years to try and get through what needs 
to be treated unless we give them new tools to reform the system to 
make that process going in, and that is exactly what this bill does: it 
rewards collaboration; it tries to stop unnecessary litigation; it 
comes up with arbitration concepts that are in there; it expands the 
ability of streamlining the process so they can get to work.
  Our people need the resources to do their job. They need the tools. 
We should make it very clear that money alone is not going to solve the 
problem of wildfire catastrophe. What we have to do is solve the 
conditions that create the catastrophic wildfires in the first place, 
and that means that we need to make sure that we are doing things so we 
can prohibit what has happened, which has been devastating to people 
and their property; which has destroyed habitat for species, endangered 
and unendangered; and which has created conditions of pollution in our 
atmosphere.
  All that has to take place. Everything in this bill is what the 
experts in the Forest Service said they can do on day one after it is 
passed. It needs to take place. It needs to be in addition to the 
financial solving of the wildfire situation. You need to have these 
reforms, and that is what we are pushing in this bill. It is why it is 
so desperately needed and why it was worked out with the experts in the 
field.
  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time."|42
CREC-2017-11-01-pt1-PgH8326-43|Mr. GRIJALVA|G000551|CREC-2017-11-01-pt1-PgH8326|"  Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume.
  I rise in opposition to H.R. 2936, the so-called Resilient Federal 
Forests Act of 2017. Perhaps a better name would be the ``Log America's 
Forest Act of 2017.''
  But before I address the many concerns with the underlying bill, I 
must commend my colleagues across the aisle for attempting to deal with 
the biggest barrier to improved management of our national forests: the 
enormous cost and impact of wildfire suppression on the Forest Service 
budget.
  Over 50 percent of the Forest Service budget is eaten up by wildfire, 
and if things don't change, the agency predicts that it will increase 
to two-thirds in just 5 years. Unfortunately, the budget fix in this 
bill falls short.
  First, it requires Congress to appropriate an amount equal to the 10-
year average before emergency funding is available. We know that 
climate change results in longer and more intense wildfire seasons, 
making the 10-year average irrelevant to the ever-increasing need for 
funding. Because the average is too low, the real number will keep 
growing, meaning the amount of funding that must be taken from the 
Forest Service accounts will continue to grow. Fighting fires will 
continue squeezing out money for the active management my Republican 
colleagues are so eager to prioritize.
  Second, requiring the President to declare each fire a national 
emergency before releasing funds is unnecessarily bureaucratic and 
could delay emergency operations.
  We need a holistic fix for the wildfire budget that makes money 
available in advance of a critical emergency, but Republicans would 
rather play politics with fire to undermine environmental safeguards.
  This is not the first time we have seen the bill, this piece of 
legislation. House Republicans sent a version to the Senate in the 
113th and the 114th Congresses, where it languished on the shelf 
because our colleagues on the other side of the Capitol found it too 
extreme.
  Rather than view that experience as an opportunity to seek compromise 
this time around, today we are considering a bill that is even more 
extreme and polarizing. They doubled the environmental review waivers, 
added language to undermine the Endangered Species Act, and scaled back 
protections for national monuments and roadless areas.
  We are told that this is all in the name of decreasing wildfire risk 
and protecting communities. The truth is that it is just more of the 
same from House Republicans who will look for any excuse to advance 
their extraction-above-all agenda.
  Wildfires are a huge problem in this country due, in large part, to 
climate change, something this bill ignores. By the way, they are 
becoming more frequent and more intense, and they pose a growing threat 
to public safety and local communities.
  This bill is not about forest health or wildfire mitigation. It is 
about increasing the number of trees removed from our forests. 
Republicans would rather scare us into weakening environmental 
safeguards than work on a possible bipartisan solution to wildfire 
management.


  A serious proposal would recognize the Forest Service and the 
Department of the Interior have ample authority within current law to 
conduct fire treatment on our public lands. In fact, the 2009 
Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration Program, established the 
last time Democrats controlled the House, has resulted in the treatment 
of over 1.45 million acres of national forests to reduce the risk of 
catastrophic fire and the improvement of over 1.33 million acres of 
wildlife habitat.
  In just 5 years, the program generated more than $661 million in 
local labor income and an average of 4,300 jobs per year. The projects 
have attracted new partners and strengthened community relationships, 
leveraging over $76.1 million in partner matching funds. Collaborative 
programs like this bring people to the table and result in more acres 
treated, more local jobs, and more successful projects. Again, all of 
this has taken place within the framework of the current law.
  Increased funding for programs like Collaborative Forest Landscape 
Restoration should be a priority for Republicans, but this program was 
zeroed out by the Trump administration budget, and extreme proposals 
like this bill chip away at the principal pillars of law that make 
collaboration possible. Our constituents and our forests deserve 
better.

CREC-2017-11-01-pt1-PgH8326-46|Mr. GOSAR|G000565|CREC-2017-11-01-pt1-PgH8326|"  Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 2936, 
the Resilient Federal Forests Act of 2017, introduced by my friend and 
colleague Bruce Westerman.
  Our forests and the communities that live, work, and rely on them 
desperately need improved management practice to reduce these forest 
fire disasters and to increase resiliency.
  I was very pleased with the quick work by my friend and former 
colleague OMB Director Mick Mulvaney for addressing the wildfire 
funding crisis at the United States Forest Service, requesting $576.5 
million for wildfire suppression and recommending active management 
reforms.
  Now, while the Trump administration came through in a big way for 
Western communities that have been ravaged by catastrophic wildfires, 
Congress must pass H.R. 2936 and get serious about combating 
catastrophic wildfires before they get started.
  The Resilient Federal Forests Act is a bipartisan, comprehensive 
piece of legislation that simplifies the cumbersome planning process 
and reduces the cost of implementing proactive forest management 
strategies.
  H.R. 2936 empowers local communities by getting them involved in the 
decisionmaking process. It empowers Tribal communities to be part of 
the solution and help reduce the risk of wildfire.
  The bill removes incentives for extreme special interest groups to 
file frivolous lawsuits. In fact, it requires litigants opposing active 
management projects to propose an alternative plan as opposed to just 
saying ``no.'' Imagine that, solutions over lawsuits.


  Mismanagement has left our forests vulnerable to insects and disease 
and ripe for catastrophic wildfires. It is clear the system is broken. 
Western communities are tired of being victims, and this bill allows us 
to be proactive and to prevent disasters before they become a risk.
  Mr. Chairman, I include in the Record two letters, one from the 
Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies and the second from the 
National Association of Home Builders, in support of H.R. 2936.
         Association of Fish & Wildlife Agencies,
                                    Washington, DC, June 26, 2017.
     Hon. Rob Bishop,
     Chairman, House Natural Resources Committee, House of 
         Representatives, Washington, DC.
     Hon. Raul Grijalva,
     Ranking Democrat, House Natural Resources Committee, House of 
         Representatives, Washington, DC.
       Dear Chairman Bishop and Ranking Democrat Grijalva: The 
     Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies (Association) is 
     pleased to support H.R. 2936, the ``Resilient Federal Forest 
     Act of 2017'' (RFFA). All 50 state agencies are members of 
     the Association. Founded in 1902, the Association's mission 
     is to protect the interests and authorities of the states to 
     manage fish and wildlife within their borders, including on 
     federal land. The Association works closely with the federal 
     land management agencies to deliver on the ground 
     conservation of fish, wildlife and their habitats for our 
     citizens.
       The Association is particularly appreciative of changes 
     made by the Committee staff at the request of the 
     Association. These changes make more prominent in federal 
     statute the states' authority to manage fish and wildlife on 
     U.S. Forest Service (USFS) and Bureau of Land Management 
     (BLM) lands. Nothing in the amended language is intended to 
     change any existing federal, state or tribal authority. It 
     simply makes more evident the state-federal jurisdictional 
     relationship which Congress has affirmed. Federal-state 
     cooperation in this arena is compelled because the USFS and 
     BLM own the land and thus the habitat, and the state fish and 
     wildlife agencies manage the fish and wildlife. Robust 
     cooperation will provide that both land/habitat objectives 
     and fish and wildlife population objectives are met.
       The RFFA is vitally needed to restore the health of our 
     Nation's federal forests on USFS and BLM lands. 
     Unfortunately, the USFS and BLM have fallen significantly 
     behind in meeting objectives for early successional stage 
     forest habitat, for a number of reasons. Significantly, 
     federal court decisions and increasing uninformed litigation 
     has created ``paralysis by analysis'' to quote a former USFS 
     Chief. Congress mandated that the federal forests were to be 
     managed for water quality, wildlife habitat, recreation, and 
     timber harvest. Active forest management by the federal 
     professional managers in cooperation with the state fish and 
     wildlife agency professional managers has been replaced by 
     natural resource management decisions being made by the 
     federal courts. A return to active forest management will 
     facilitate realization of all of the public values of federal 
     forests.
       The Association much appreciates that the fire-borrowing 
     problem is addressed in HR 2936. While most catastrophic 
     fires occur in the western United States, this is a national 
     problem because the funds for every national forest and 
     public land unit are affected. This remedy will prevent the 
     USFS and BLM from having to borrow from other appropriated 
     line-items (for example, wildfire prevention, wildlife, 
     recreation and water quality) to pay for the cost of 
     catastrophic fire suppression, which cost consumes over 50% 
     of the USFS budget. We respectfully urge the Committee to 
     further protect the USFS budget by capping the 10-year 
     average cost of catastrophic fire costs at its current level. 
     The 10-year average is used by the USFS in building their 
     budget request. The 10-year average continues to rise and 
     unless it is capped it will continue to erode other important 
     budget line items such as wildlife, water quality, fire 
     prevention and recreation in the President's budget.
       The Association further appreciates the process relief 
     provided to National Forest Plans (NFP) and (potentially) 
     Resource Management Plans (RMP) developed by collaborative 
     deliberation. It is appropriate that a collaborative-
     developed plan, which often takes years to deliberate and 
     conclude, be subject to only two options under NEPA, proceed 
     or not proceed. It is very reasonable to assume that the 
     collaboratively deliberated process has examined and rejected 
     the other options, and only the action or no action need be 
     analyzed.
       The bill's establishment of a pilot binding arbitration 
     process as an alternative to litigation in each FS Region is 
     certainly welcomed by the Association. Not only is the cost 
     of defending the land management plan a burden on the 
     agencies, but the planned for management work on the ground 
     is lost, perhaps never to be resurrected on that site. We 
     commend Congressman Westerman and the Committee for settling 
     on this significant improvement to litigation reform that was 
     in HR 2647 from the last Congress.
       We also appreciate the increase in acreage ceilings for the 
     statutorily endorsed Categorical Exclusions (CEs) under NEPA. 
     CEs must avoid sensitive areas and must be consistent with 
     standards and guidelines in Forest Plans. Early forest 
     successional stage habitat, for instance, cannot be just 
     incidental to be effective in providing habitat for deer, 
     elk, wild turkey, neo-tropical migratory songbirds and other 
     species which are dependent on this habitat type. While an 
     acreage ceiling is an easy metric to measure success, the 
     desired forest future condition should really determine the 
     size of the timber harvest.
       Additionally, the Association supports the proposed common-
     sense amendments to the Endangered Species Act. First, H.R. 
     2936 overturns the Cottonwood decision, which directs that if 
     additional critical habitat is designated under an approved 
     FP or RMP, a section 7 programmatic re-consultation of the 
     entire FP needs to be done. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife 
     Service (USFWS) and the Obama Administration argued that the 
     section 7 consultation needs only to be done on the project 
     covering the additionally designated acreage of critical 
     habitat. This remedy will greatly reduce the debilitating 
     process that the federal court decision directs. Second, the 
     bill affirms that no ESA section 7 consultation is required 
     if the USFS or BLM determine during informal consultation 
     that the proposed action is ``not likely to adversely affect 
     a species or designated critical habitat'', which is already 
     USFWS policy. And third, if any consultation on a categorical 
     exclusion established by the bill is not concluded after 90 
     days, the action shall be considered to have not violated 
     section 7(a)(2) of the ESA.
       The Association is committed to working with our partners 
     in the USFS and BLM to manage our federal forests to fulfill 
     their public values as Congress mandated. HR 2936 makes 
     significant improvements to and would expedite the process 
     that governs approval of the USFS and BLM management plans. 
     We urge that your Committee expeditiously report HR 2936 from 
     the Committee to the House floor.
       We look forward to continuing to work with you to move this 
     bill quickly through the legislative process. If you have any 
     questions, please contact AFWA Government affairs Director 
     Jen Mock Schaeffer.

spate of catastrophic fires in the Western United States, we came 
together in a truly bipartisan fashion and passed something called the 
Healthy Forests Restoration Act. It authorized up to 20 million acres 
to be treated to remove


hazard fuels in what is called the WUI, the wildland-urban interface, 
and in threats to municipal water supplies. We also authorized $760 
million a year.
  Well, it has been 13 years. We authorized 20 million acres of work. 
What has been done? 2\1/2\ million.
  Is it because of litigation, lawsuits, or, you know, obstruction? No. 
It is because of this body, the United States Congress, which is 
refusing to put up the money to do the work.
  In my State alone, there are 1.8 million acres waiting for treatment. 
They have gone through all environmental reviews. There is no potential 
for litigation or any other blocking, but they don't have the money.
  Does this bill fix that? No. We are addressing problems that don't 
exist in terms of addressing the wildfire problem.
  This is really, you know, kind of a lost opportunity, a missed 
opportunity. Yes, it does a partial fix of the wildfire borrowing, 
which devastates the Forest Service every year. I appreciate that. But 
the fact is, we have got 44 million homes that are now at risk in terms 
of wildland-urban interface, and we have only treated 2\1/2\ million 
acres because this Congress isn't putting up the money.


  And this year, yet again, they are proposing like one-half of what we 
authorized. What does one-half get you? It gets you half the acreage.
  So if we had appropriated at the levels we authorized over the last 
13 years, they would have treated 5 or 6 million acres. Again, they 
weren't blocked by litigation. They weren't blocked by appeals. The 
HFRA Act became virtually noncontroversial because it didn't do away 
with judicial review, which this bill will do on a certain number of 
projects in each region every year.
  I wish that this was a bipartisan approach, it isn't, and I cannot 
support the legislation."|49

  Mr. Chairman, the goal of forest management should be to make our 
forests more resilient--more resilient to the impacts of climate 
change, drought, and wildlife--but contrary to its title, H.R. 2936, 
the so-called Resilient Federal Forests Act of 2017, does not achieve 
these goals.
  This bill includes exemptions from analyses required under the 
National Environmental Policy Act, restricts judicial review of certain 
forest management activities, amends the Equal Access to Justice Act to 
limit payment of attorneys' fees, and scales back the wildlife 
conservation efforts of the Endangered Species Act.
  Mr. Chairman, this bill desperately needs improvement, and I am 
disappointed that my commonsense amendment--offered both in committee 
and again to Rules, this time with my colleague, Mr. Beyer from 
Virginia--is not being considered by the House.
  My amendment would have struck two sections of this bill that are 
designed to allow approval of timber projects without adequate 
consideration of the impacts to some of the most vulnerable living 
creatures on Earth: those listed as threatened or endangered under the 
Endangered Species Act.
  The first offending section would put the U.S. Fish and Wildlife 
Service on a 90-day shot clock to complete consultations required under 
section 7 of the ESA. Such a provision is both unnecessary and deeply 
harmful.
  The second section my amendment would have struck is designed to 
prevent ESA consultation from happening altogether when FWS lists a new 
species or designates critical habitat for a listed species. This 
simply defies logic.
  Getting ESA consultation right--and ensuring that it happens in the 
first place--is a small price to pay for preserving irreplaceable parts 
of our natural heritage.
  Mr. Chairman, H.R. 2936 attacks responsible forest management policy 
and promotes commercial logging at the expense of sound environmental 
review.
  Instead of giving gifts to special interests, Congress should be 
addressing the effects of climate change, working to reduce the risk of 
wildfire, and fixing the wildfire budget.
  Mr. Chairman, this bill takes us many steps in the wrong direction, 
and I urge my colleagues to vote ``no.''"|52

such as the National Environmental Policy Act, that promised to improve 
the health of our forests. They imposed what have become endlessly 
time-consuming and, ultimately, cost-prohibitive restrictions on our 
ability to properly manage our national forests so that we can match 
the tree density with the ability of the land to support it.
  I think after 45 years of experience with these laws, we are entitled 
to ask: How are our forests doing? The answer is damning. Our forests 
are now catastrophically overgrown, often carrying four times the 
number of trees that the land can support. In this stressed and 
weakened condition, our forests are easy prey for drought, disease, 
pestilence, and fire.
  There is an old adage that excess timber comes out of the forest one 
way or the other--it is either carried out or it burns out. When we 
carried it out, we had resilient, healthy forests and a thriving 
economy, as excess timber was sold and harvested before it could choke 
our forests to death. In the years since then, we have seen an 80 
percent decline in timber sales from our Federal lands and a 
concomitant increase in acreage destroyed by forest fire. I would 
remind my friend from Oregon that timber sales used to generate us 
money, not cost us money.
  The direct revenues and spin-off commerce generated by these sales 
provided a stream of revenues that we could then use to improve our 
national forests and share with the local communities affected.
  The Resilient Federal Forests Act begins to move us back towards 
sound and scientific forest management practices. It requires forest 
managers to consider the cost of no action alternatives; it streamlines 
fire and disease prevention programs and ensures that fire-killed 
timber can be quickly removed to create both revenues and room to 
restore fire-damaged lands; it ends the practice of raiding prevention 
funds to fight fires; it streamlines onerous environmental review 
processes without sacrificing environmental protection; and it provides 
our forest managers with alternatives to resolve frivolous lawsuits.
  Provisions that streamline the environmental reviews were already 
signed into law last year for the Tahoe Basin, and the Forest Service 
regional manager told me that is going to take their revenue processes 
from 800 pages down to 40 pages and allow them to get their forest 
there back to a sustainable level.
  We made some very big mistakes 45 years ago, and our forests have 
paid the price. This bill starts the long process of correcting those 
mistakes and recovering our national forests, and I urge its adoption.
  Mr. Chairman, I include in the Record two letters, one from the South 
Tahoe Public Utility District, and the second from the Public Lands 
Council and the National Cattlemen's Beef Association, in support of 
H.R. 2936.

yielding.
  Mr. Chairman, this bill that we are debating today has been touted as 
Congress' solution to the longstanding issue of fire borrowing that has 
plagued the Forest Service.
  I represent a district that has experienced a lot of wildfire. 
Thankfully, the recent devastating fires in the North Bay were not 
caused by this fire-borrowing issue. They did not involve Federal 
public lands. However, I have had a lot of wildfire in my district over 
the years, and fire borrowing is a top priority for me. Unfortunately, 
as it is currently written, this bill introduces more problems than 
solutions on this issue. Let me explain.
  The title in the bill pertaining to fire borrowing repurposes the 
Stafford Act, which Congress enacted to provide assistance to State and 
local governments in case of emergencies. This requires Congress to 
appropriate the 10-year average for wildfire suppression before the 
Forest Service can access emergency funds. That is not the way to solve 
this problem. In fact, I saw that just yesterday the administration 
issued a SAP because of this problematic provision.
  If Congress is serious about fixing the budget issue, we should be 
making funds available ahead of an emergency situation, and we should 
remove the cost of fighting catastrophic fires from the agency's base 
budget. That will enable them to invest in proactive measures to make 
our forests more resilient and healthy.
  Although the Rules Committee added title XI to this bill, which 
increased the overall cap for disaster spending, the problems with 
using the Stafford Act approach still remain.
  The second point. This bill, essentially, is a gutting of 
environmental protections and an attack on sustainable forest 
management that threatens equal access to justice. We should just call 
it what it is.
  Title I of this bill allows intensive logging projects of 10,000 to 
30,000 acres each. That is as big as the entire city of San Francisco. 
Projects of that size can proceed on Federal public lands without any 
environmental review under NEPA, without any compliance with the 
Endangered Species Act.
  Title II of the bill eliminates the requirement that the Forest 
Service consult with the Fish and Wildlife Service and, essentially, 
let's the Forest Service decide for itself if it wants to follow the 
Endangered Species Act consultation requirements regarding any of its 
projects on public lands.
  Title III further chokes judicial review by prohibiting the recovery 
of attorneys' fees for any challenges to forest management activity 
under the Equal Access to Justice Act, including meritorious successful 
challenges. This severely limits public review of logging projects on 
Federal public lands.
  How would any of these measures promote forest health? It wouldn't. 
So let's call this bill what it is. It is an environmental wrecking 
ball that weakens standards and protections, limits public 
participation in the review of Federal agency actions, and won't make 
our forests any healthier or safer."|56

colloquy with the chairman to seek a clarification on the applicability 
of the provisions in title I and title II of this bill to national 
forest lands.
  As my colleagues know, the State of California has been on fire. We 
have all seen the devastation across the State, ranging from the Sierra 
Nevada to the Bay area, and even the wine country. Even today, CalFire 
and Forest Service personnel remain deployed on fires across the State.
  Ensuring that the Forest Service returns to active management of our 
forests is critical to promoting forest health and helping reduce the 
risks and likeliness of catastrophic wildfires that we have seen 
already this year.
  The Resilient Federal Forests Act includes what I believe to be 
critically important reforms to forest management, such as expedited 
environmental reviews and availability of categorical exclusion for 
forest management activities, to help achieve these needed goals.
  In California, there are six national monuments managed by the Forest 
Service or jointly between the Forest Service and BLM. Oftentimes, 
management activities in these areas are highly restricted, which only 
leads to hazardous fuels buildup and increased risk


of catastrophic fires. We see the results every year in the West.
  H.R. 2936 clearly identifies certain national forest lands that these 
provisions do not apply to. This includes wilderness areas, national or 
State inventoried roadless areas, or areas where timber harvesting is 
prohibited by statute.
  However, it is my belief that provisions of this bill, Mr. Chairman--
based on the definition of National Forest System lands in the bill--
apply to all other Forest Service lands not explicitly prohibited in 
the bill.
  Respectfully, I would like to clarify with the chairman that it is 
his intent that provisions in title I and title II of H.R. 2936 apply 
to all other Federal lands managed by the United States Forest Service. 
This includes national monuments managed by the Forest Service.
  Mr. Chairman, I thank the chairman for his work on this critical 
bill."|58

provisions of H.R. 2936, including title I and title II, unless 
explicitly excluded, apply to national monuments and all other lands 
managed by the United States Forest Service.

Westerman, for his hard work on the Resilient Federal Forests Act.
  I would like to be able to submit that if you actually care about 
helping our forests, if you care about our watersheds, if you care 
about wildlife habitat, if you care about outdoor recreation, if you 
care about responsible job development, if you care about being able to 
provide funding for our schools, this is a piece of legislation to be 
able to try and achieve a win-win-win, literally, for our communities.
  We have seen 7 million acres, Mr. Chairman, burn in the West in 2017 
alone. We have seen our forests devastated. We have seen over half of 
the budget of the Forest Service being used to fight forest fires.
  Is there a better way?
  The better way can be found in this piece of legislation, to be able 
to not only address what we must address, in terms of fighting forest 
fires when they break out, but also to be able to have a responsible, 
proactive management forest to be able to make sure that we are 
creating healthy forests.
  Mr. Chairman, as I travel throughout my district, I am now looking at 
forests that my great-grandchildren will not see as I saw them as a 
young boy growing up. It is time that we actually have legislation that 
doesn't just be reactive to the problem that we face when it comes to 
forest management but be proactive. This legislation will achieve that 
goal.
  And, again, I applaud Mr. Westerman and the Committee on Natural 
Resources for their hard work on this.

  As we have talked about H.R. 2936, this is something that has been 
before two previous Congresses and went nowhere; and as a consequence, 
we continue to not confront the issue of appropriate and necessary 
funding for the Forest Service to conduct wildfire suppression. That is 
the gap in this. This flawed attempt to try to fix the funding issue 
does not.
  In fact, Congress has provided appropriate tools to conduct 
restoration, reduce hazardous fuels, and restore ecological balance on 
national forest and public lands.
  Congress should fix the wildfire budget--that is the issue--not use 
this as leverage to subsidize the timber industry and also overturn 
essential environmental laws.
  This legislation has an attack on NEPA, has an attack on the 
Endangered Species Act, has an attack on judicial review and access to 
justice, has an attack on the Antiquities Act, and continues the 
process of fire borrowing.
  H.R. 2936 is not about forest health or reducing wildfire risk. It is 
intended to make it easier to advance commercial logging and sales on 
our national forests and public lands.
  A flawed attempt to fix the wildfire funding problem, it does nothing 
to change the anti-environmental provisions in the underlying bill.
  We have a serious issue, validated because of all the studies that 
have been done, including GAO, which found that climate change is a 
contributor, scientists have found that climate change is a 
contributor. That is not discussed because that is a hoax, my 
Republican colleagues say, created by the Chinese. So we will not talk 
about climate change as a major factor, which it is, to the increasing 
intensity and length of wildfires across our public lands and across 
private and State lands as well.
  This legislation is about undermining environmental law. It does 
nothing about the funding necessary to fight wildfires in this country. 
It does nothing about involving the stakeholders in proactive 
restoration and reducing the threat of wildfire in this country.
  Mr. Chair, I urge a ``no'' vote on H.R. 2936, and I yield back the 
balance of my time."|65

efforts to see our government do better on our Federal lands.
  Mr. Chairman, I recently made a trip out to Montana to visit some of 
our National Forests and the rural communities they border. These 
forests, much like many areas across our country, have been mismanaged 
for decades, and the ones that have not already been destroyed are ripe 
to be devastated by insects, disease, or catastrophic wildfire, not 
because of some action taken by the Forest Service, but just the 
opposite. Because of no actions, our forests are overstocked, 
underutilized, and unhealthy.
  We have seen nearly 9 million acres of forest, an area larger than 
the State of Maryland, go up in flames just this year, spewing tens of 
millions of tons of carbon and thick smoke into the atmosphere.
  Don't get me wrong. 32,000 full-time Forest Service personnel are 
busy and working hard trying to manage the 193 million acres of 
timberland across our great country, but they are spinning their wheels 
and making very little progress.
  Mr. Chairman, that is a forest the size of Texas and South Carolina 
combined. According to scientists at the Forest Service, 80 million 
acres of that, an area the size of the State of New Mexico, is in a 
condition that is subject to catastrophic wildfire.
  These fires are not only creating a forest health crisis, they are a 
public health crisis. They kill trees, they kill wildlife and 
livestock. These fires not only kill livelihoods, they create 
unbearable health concerns and living conditions with their thick smoke 
and ash. On top of all that, they are killing people.
  It shouldn't be this way and it doesn't have to be this way.
  This bill simply allows sound, scientifically-based forestry 
practices, like the ones I learned at Yale's Forestry School, to be 
implemented on our Federal forests. It will result in cleaner air, 
cleaner water, better wildlife habitat, better recreational 
opportunities, more plant and animal biodiversity, stronger economies, 
and fewer fires, resulting in lower fire costs.


  As we traveled through the beautiful countryside of Montana, I saw 
the symbol of our Nation perched majestically atop a tree by the bank 
of a clear and flowing stream. This bald eagle reminded me of a fable 
by Aesop that described our situation today. It goes like this:
  An eagle was soaring through the sky, when suddenly it heard the whiz 
of an arrow and it felt itself wounded to death. Slowly it fluttered 
down to the Earth, with its lifeblood pouring out of it. Looking down 
upon the arrow with which it had been pierced, it found that the haft 
of the arrow had been feathered with one of its own plumes.

       ``Alas!'' it cried, as it died, ``We often give our enemies 
     the means for our own destruction.''

  Mr. Chairman, our enemies aren't our colleagues across the aisle. 
Many support this bill and some are cosponsors. Our enemies are not 
environmental extremists that are impeding science and causing some 
people to love our trees to death. Our enemy is not even the United 
States Senate.

  Mr. Chairman, our enemy is catastrophic wildfire that destroys our 
forests. Our enemies are insects and diseases that kill our trees, and 
we are feathering their arrows with inaction. We are feathering their 
arrows with bureaucratic red tape. We are feathering their arrows with 
poor policy that are killing our forests, killing our communities, and 
killing us every day.
  How much longer will we stand by and do nothing?
  I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to get behind this 
bill, pass it out of the House, and join me in relentlessly encouraging 
the Senate to take action.
  Our forests, our rural communities, our environment, and all those 
areas, urban and rural alike, that are breathing the smoke and ash of 
our once magnificent forests need us to act.
  Every day that we delay, the problem gets worse and the enemies of 
the forest are gaining ground. Please join me in this fight and pass 
this bill.
  Mr. Chair, I include in the Record two letters. The first is from 
eight groups, including the Archery Trade Association; the second is 
from the National Association of State Foresters, both in support of 
H.R. 2936.

                                                    June 26, 2017.
     Hon. Rob Bishop,
     Chairman, House Natural Resources Committee,
     Washington, DC.
     Hon. Raul Grijalva,
     Ranking Democrat, House Natural Resources Committee, 
         Washington, DC.
       Dear Chairman Bishop and Cong. Grijalva: Our organizations 
     which represent millions of hunters, anglers, recreational 
     shooters and other conservationists express our strong 
     support for H.R. 2936, the Resilient Federal Forests Act of 
     2017. We respectfully urge you to take expeditious Committee 
     action on H.R. 2936, which if enacted, will improve the 
     health of our federal forests and reduce costly wildfires. 
     Our nation's federal lands play a vital role in maintaining 
     healthy forests that are resilient to threats at a landscape 
     level from fire, pests, disease and insects. Through 
     incentives and expedited process, consistent with informed 
     science, the bill will help ensure that timber harvest and 
     the creation of young forest habitat for wildlife remains 
     viable on US Forest Service (USFS) and Bureau of Land 
     Management (BLM) lands. Additionally, it remedies the budget 
     fire-funding problem (borrowing from other line items) that 
     our country faces when fighting catastrophic wildfires.
       Our organizations much appreciate that the fire-funding 
     problem is addressed in HR 2936. While most catastrophic 
     fires occur in the western United States, this is a national 
     problem because the funds for every national forest and 
     public land unit are affected. This remedy will prevent the 
     USFS and BLM from having to borrow from other appropriated 
     budget line-items (for example, wildfire prevention, 
     wildlife, recreation and water quality) to pay for the cost 
     of catastrophic fire suppression, which cost now consumes 
     over 50% of the USFS budget. We respectfully urge the 
     Committee to further protect the USFS budget by capping the 
     10-year average of catastrophic fire costs at its current 
     level. The USFS uses this 10-year average to build their 
     budget request for the President. The 10-year average 
     continues to rise and unless it is capped it will continue to 
     erode other important budget line items such as wildlife, 
     water quality, fire prevention and recreation as the USFS 
     constructs its budget request.
       All forest management plans are conducted with public 
     input, and all projects undergo National Environmental Policy 
     Act (NEPA) analysis. The bill's use of the Categorical 
     Exclusion (CE) under the NEPA rules from the Council on 
     Environmental Quality, will allow routine projects with known 
     effects to be implemented more efficiently and cost-
     effectively to achieve the forest's desired future condition, 
     as outlined in the forest management plan. Certain forest 
     management treatments previously analyzed under NEPA in order 
     to deal with issues such as pests and disease, hazardous 
     fuels, critical habitats for threatened or endangered 
     species, salvage facilitation, and water quality, do not need 
     re-analysis on each similar project. These projects are 
     routine, reoccurring activities with known effects, already 
     fully analyzed and therefore qualify for CEs from repeated 
     analysis.
       We also appreciate the increase in acreage ceilings for the 
     statutorily endorsed CEs. Early successional stage forest 
     habitat, for instance, cannot be just incidental to be 
     effective in providing habitat for deer, ruffed grouse, elk, 
     wild turkey, neo-tropical migratory songbirds and other 
     species which are dependent on this habitat type. While an 
     acreage ceiling is an easy metric to measure success, the 
     desired forest future condition should really determine the 
     size of the management activity. Additionally, as stated in 
     the bill, all CEs must avoid sensitive areas and must be 
     consistent with standards and guidelines in approved Forest 
     Plans.
       Our organizations appreciate changes made to make more 
     prominent in federal statute the states' authority to manage 
     fish and wildlife on USFS and BLM lands. Nothing in the bill 
     language is intended to change any existing federal, state or 
     tribal authority. It simply makes more evident the state-
     federal jurisdictional relationship which Congress has 
     affirmed. Federal-state cooperation in this arena is 
     compelled because the USFS and BLM own the land and thus the 
     habitat, and the state fish and wildlife agencies manage the 
     fish and wildlife. Robust cooperation will provide that both 
     land/habitat objectives and fish and wildlife population 
     objectives are met.
       Additionally, our groups support the proposed common-sense 
     amendments to the Endangered Species Act (ESA). First, the 
     bill overturns the Cottonwood decision, which directs that if 
     additional critical habitat is designated under an approved 
     forest plan or resource management plan, a section 7 
     programmatic re-consultation of the entire forest plan needs 
     to be done. The US Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) and the 
     Obama Administration argued that the section 7 consultation 
     needs only to be done on the portion of the project covering 
     the additionally designated acreage of critical habitat. This 
     remedy will greatly reduce the debilitating process that the 
     federal court decision directs. Second, the bill affirms that 
     no ESA section 7 consultation is required if the USFS or BLM 
     determine during informal consultation that the proposed 
     action is ``not likely to adversely affect a species or 
     designated critical habitat'', which is already USFWS policy. 
     And third, if any consultation on a categorical exclusion 
     established by the bill is not concluded after 90 days, the 
     action shall be considered to have not violated section 
     7(a)(2) of the ESA.
       We also support the bill's provisions expediting large 
     scale restoration after catastrophic wildfires. We likewise 
     support the prohibition on restraining orders and preliminary 
     injunctions. It is imperative that we work to restore 
     wildfire-impacted lands for the ecological health of the 
     immediate area and surrounding landscape, protection of the 
     watershed, and economic vitality of the local communities.
       Our organizations further appreciate the process relief 
     provided to National Forest Plans and potentially Resources 
     Management Plans developed by collaborative deliberation. It 
     is appropriate that a collaborative-developed plan, which 
     often takes years to deliberate and conclude, be subject to 
     only two options under NEPA, proceed or not proceed. It is 
     very reasonable to assume that the collaboratively 
     deliberated process has examined and rejected the other 
     options, and only the action or no action alternatives need 
     be analyzed.
       The bill's establishment of a pilot binding arbitration 
     process as an alternative to litigation in each Forest 
     Service Region is certainly welcomed. Not only is the cost of 
     defending the land management plan a burden on the agencies, 
     but the planned for management work on the ground is lost, 
     perhaps never to be resurrected on that site. We find much 
     merit in this improved approach as an alternative to the 
     proposal in H.R. 2647 from the last Congress, and commend 
     Cong. Westerman and the Committee for settling on this. 
     Uninformed litigation has led to federal forest management by 
     the federal courts; we need to return forest management to 
     the federal and state professionals with public input as 
     provided for by the established processes.
       H.R. 2936 makes significant improvements to and would 
     expedite the process that governs approval of the USFS and 
     BLM management plans. We urge that your Committee 
     expeditiously report this bill from the Committee to the 
     House floor. We look forward to continuing to work with you 
     to move this bill quickly through the legislative process.
       Thank you for your consideration of our community's 
     perspectives.

CREC-2017-11-01-pt1-PgH8326-68|Mr. BISHOP of Utah|B001250|CREC-2017-11-01-pt1-PgH8326|"  Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
  Mr. DeFazio. Mr. Chair, I voted for last Congress' version of this 
bill, one of 19 Democrats to do so. It wasn't perfect, but the bill was 
step in the right direction. I hoped the Senate would improve it and we 
would finally make needed changes forest management and fix ``fire 
borrowing.'' But the Senate never acted on it, or on any other forest 
management bill.
  In the 113th Congress, I worked with Reps. Schrader and Walden and 
crafted a bipartisan bill to create a long-term solution to properly 
manage statutorily unique forestlands in Western Oregon. It would have 
devoted nearly 1.3 million acres for sustainable timber production for 
local mills, created thousands of private sector jobs, and provided 
much-needed revenue for our rural counties. The legislation was 
included in a larger bill which passed the House in September 2014. 
Again, the Senate failed to act.
  Like last Congress, there are provisions in this bill I support. 
However, there are provisions that I cannot support. For example, the 
bill doubles the amount of acres exempt from nearly all environmental 
analysis for projects up to 10,000 acres, and in some cases 30,000 
acres, nearly 47 square miles.
  I agree there is a need to need to increase the pace and size of 
forest restoration projects. But the Forest Service and BLM already 
have many tools to accomplish more management objectives. What they 
need is funding to complete projects. In fact, Forest Service NEPA 
experts have initiated a comprehensive review to determine 
opportunities, already allowed under law, to increase efficiencies and 
management tools to expedite environmental review, including proposing 
new categorical exclusions.
  It's true that in some cases the Forest Service and BLM don't use 
authority they have because of legitimate concerns about the threat of 
litigation and the accompanying expenses it incurs. But it is 
disingenuous for us to claim that this bill, or any forest management 
bill, is a miraculous fix to harvest more timber, improve forest 
restoration, or reduce fuels to reduce the threat of catastrophic 
wildfires, without Congress providing funding to do so. In fact, 
according to the Forest Service, in Oregon there are over 1.8 million 
acres of treatment projects that are ``shovel ready,'' meaning all 
environmental analysis has been completed. But they stay on the shelf, 
because the Forest Service doesn't have the funds to complete them.
  We've all seen the destruction from this year's severe fire season. 
Homes and businesses were destroyed, and dozens of lives were lost in 
Northern California. In my district, over 300,000 acres burned. The 
Forest Service says that nationally there are now more than 44 million 
homes are within the Wildland Urban Interface, at high risk of burning 
in a wildfire.
  In 2004, Congress passed, on a bipartisan basis, the Healthy Forests 
Restoration Act, which if properly implemented would go a long way to 
reduce the threat of wildfires in our communities. It authorized up to 
20 million acres to be treated to remove hazard fuels in the Wildland 
and Urban Interface, as well as protect municipal water supplies from 
catastrophic wildfires. We authorized $760 million annually to perform 
the work. So far, thirteen years later, only 2.5 million acres have 
been treated.
  Why is that? We have never come close to appropriating enough funding 
to get the job done. In Fiscal Year 2017, Congress appropriated $390 
million for hazardous fuels reduction.
  As always, I stand ready to work with my colleagues on both sides of 
the aisle to improve forest management and help our rural communities 
get back on their feet. But it must be balanced approach. 
Unfortunately, this bill is not a balanced approach."|68

consume.
  Mr. Chair, I would like to thank my colleagues, Representatives 
DeFazio and Panetta, for offering this amendment with me today. I think 
it is one of the important changes we can make that will help improve 
the Resilient Federal Forests Act.
  Collaborative forest management activities and categorical exclusions 
are an important tool in forest management and are designed to help the 
Forest Service and BLM speed the ability of those agencies to get into 
areas more quickly to improve forest health.
  I believe the use of categorical exclusion should be reserved for 
reducing hazardous fuel loads, addressing disease and insect 
infestation, protecting water resources or increasing water yield, and 
maintaining or enhancing critical habitat. That makes sense. All these 
activities are very appropriate as designated activities for 
categorical exclusions.
  Listing timber production as a designated activity, I believe, does 
not work in this context. Timber is a byproduct of all those 
activities. Therefore, it is unnecessary to actually include it as a 
specific designated activity.
  Our amendment simply strikes timber production from the list of 
designated activities for categorical exclusion under section 111. It 
is a pretty clear-cut issue, in my book.
  Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to support this commonsense 
amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time."|75

thought-out amendment.
  I also appreciate the comments he made, as he is trying to get us 
past the rhetoric and the dogma, and to try and come up with a truly 
bipartisan effort to solve the problems that the Forest Service has 
clearly delineated, giving them the tools that they want to try and 
solve these problems in the future.
  I think the gentleman is also correct when he said that if you go 
through the list of those that are going to use categorical exclusion, 
you can't actually do those functions without producing timber. So, at 
worst, the language that was put in here is redundant. We are still 
after the same goal. We are still after the same game. That is why I 
actually will accept the amendment offered by the gentleman from Oregon

bill. This section would create a forced arbitration program for 
forestry management. This section of the bill, in my view, usurps 
judicial oversight. While many agencies conduct quasi-judicial 
proceedings, there are still agency actions that are appealable to the 
courts.
  Judicial oversight and separation of powers is a core principle of 
our democracy. The arbitration would be binding, effectively making the 
Secretary of Agriculture the final judge and depriving the courts of 
their oversight role.
  While the bill terms this as discretionary arbitration, the 
discretion ultimately lies only with the Secretary of Agriculture. The 
public has no discretion over whether to submit to binding arbitration 
or not.
  The public's right to challenge an action or inaction in court is an 
important check on the executive branch. Shielding an agency from 
review by independent Federal courts could harm access to justice.
  The Secretary of Agriculture can designate any objection for binding 
arbitration up to ten times per year in each of the nine Forest Service 
regions and each of the 14 State regions.


  This allows the Secretary of Agriculture to effectively dismiss about 
230 cases every year. According to the Department of Justice, in 2016, 
the total amount of civil matters and cases brought against the United 
States with an environmental or land cause of action was only 350. This 
overly broad power would allow the agency to dismiss some of the most 
problematic cases every year.
  The process also likely violates the nondelegation doctrine. That 
doctrine prohibits the exercise of constitutional authority given to 
any branch of government by another branch or nongovernmental private 
party.
  Under the arbitration program set up by this bill, a private party 
objecting to a management proposal and forced into arbitration would be 
required to write their own proposal. The appointed arbitrator could 
then select that private party proposal as the final plan to be carried 
out by the agency. The arbitrator is not permitted to modify the 
proposal, and the decision would be binding.
  I understand the need to streamline the process, but I think the 
forced arbitration really deprives people of their access to the 
courts, and that is why, Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support 
the amendment.
  I reserve the balance of my time."|86

particular amendment because it strikes one of the core provisions of 
this bill.
  From 1989 to 2008, there were 1,125 lawsuits filed against the Forest 
Service, and hundreds have been filed since that time. Half of the 
active management lawsuits of the Federal Forest Service account are 
spent, and 40 percent of all Forest Service lawsuits are brought on 
this specific point.
  In addition to that, the Forest Service, in an effort to try and 
mitigate against that, simply tries to delay the processes, which 
creates a culture of analysis paralysis going through there, and at the 
end they get sued anyway.
  This provision is one of few creative efforts we have had that does 
not impact people's access to justice, but having a binding arbitration 
pilot program allows us to try and give you the merits of a lawsuit and 
move forward quickly. This is creative. This is what they need.
  If we need to end endless litigation, frivolous lawsuits that impede 
the


work of our land managers and cost taxpayers millions of dollars, this 
is the kind of thing that we need to start doing. The Forest Service 
recognizes they need this. It is about time we recognize they need 
this, too.
  Mr. Chairman, keep this creative approach in the bill.

streamline decisions, or if we have to streamline courts to get rid of 
frivolous lawsuits, that would be fine, but the problem is the power 
that is being vested in the Secretary of Agriculture where, if the 
Secretary of Agriculture shares a view that is not sympathetic to 
environmental concerns, they can basically dismiss the lawsuits of 
numerous environmental plaintiffs.
  I think this is really about the separation of powers. If there is 
reform needed in the judiciary, those reforms should be in our courts, 
but they shouldn't appropriate the power to the Secretary of 
Agriculture who may have his own or her own views and not give a fair 
hearing to the environmental groups.

what is happening now is not working. Forest management plans are not 
being implemented. Region 1, alone, of the Forest Service spent $1.23 
million on the Equal Access to Justice Act, paying plaintiffs to sue 
the Forest Service. That is just since January of 2016.
  This is an attempt for the pilot program to do arbitration modeled

stake when it comes to the forest in their backyards deserve their 
voices to be heard. As someone who lives in a national forest and has 
worked to review and provide feedback on proposed forest plans, I can 
assure you that these documents that guide the direction of individual 
national forests for years are, in fact, a major Federal action.
  My firsthand experience is why I propose that we strike the language 
of section 801 of the bill before us. Section 801 proposes that forest 
plans not be considered major Federal actions under the National 
Environmental Policy Act of 1969. If this were to become law, local 
input would be reduced. We should be looking for ways to increase local 
buy-in, not undermine it.
  In addition, section 903 proposes to modify the determination of 
extraordinary circumstances so wilderness protections and the 
protections of the Endangered Species Act do not have to be considered. 
This is a dangerous provision and allows our bedrock environmental laws 
to be ignored.
  My commonsense amendment would simply remove these concerning 
sections that allow bureaucrats to make major decisions without 
considering all the facts. Mr. Chairman, I encourage all my colleagues 
to support my amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time."|101

amendments that basically guts the whole purpose of this entire bill.
  There is nobody who is cut out of the process. None of the public is 
cut out of the process. What is cut out is redundant, duplicative NEPA 
analysis, all of which can result in litigation. It simply says you do 
the process the first time. You don't have to redo it again and again 
and again and admit the Forest Service to litigation again and again. 
In fact, they admit 71 percent of all their lawsuits mention these 
types of provisions in there.
  As we said before, these provisions were not coming out of thin air. 
They are coming from what the Forest Service tells us they need to do 
their job, the tools they need so they can take the resources they have 
and do it once the first time and get it over with and do it right and 
not have to spend it on frivolous litigation.
  NEPA is not taken away. The analysis is not taken away. The public is 
not taken out of the system. All you are simply doing is saying you 
don't have to do it repetitively, in other words, don't have to do it 
redundantly. This is one to streamline it. This is what they need 
desperately.

when our national forest plans are put forward, we are part of it--I 
live in the national forest. I have watched three fires outside my

ramifications of not addressing these issues appropriately.
  I was co-chair of the Arizona Forest Health Oversight Committee for

the Forest Service needs to do their job are harmed if these sections 
do not remain in the bill. It is not talking about public input. It is 
talking about redundant, unnecessary public review that goes through 
there that creates unnecessary and redundant litigation. There is a 
NEPA process that needs to go forward. You just don't have to do it 
four and five and six times just because. We have an analysis 
paralysis.
  I remind you once again, we have 50 to 70 million acres that are in a 
desperate, dire situation, ready to explode in catastrophic wildfire. 
The Forest Service can only get to 3 million acres a year, and part of 
it is the problems they have that we are trying to remove with these 
specific provisions. They need these tools. If we don't give them these 
tools, we exacerbate our wildfire problems. We don't need to do that.

American West. It has been particularly tragic in my home State of 
California. Entire neighborhoods are gone, and families have been left 
with nothing.
  While we know that proper forest management requires burning, we need 
to be able to contain wildfires that threaten communities.
  This month, wildfires killed 42 people, burned over 245,000 acres, 
and destroyed an estimated 8,900 structures, most of them people's 
family homes, according to Cal Fire.
  The fires aren't just dangerous themselves, they produce thick smoke, 
toxic ash, and debris that pose long-lasting risks to our health and to 
the environment.
  These wildfires continue to grow in frequency and ferocity. We must 
ensure that we are using all of the available tools to prevent and 
contain these fires. That is why I ask that this amendment, which 
promotes innovation in wildfire management, be adopted.
  The amendment would require the Secretary of Agriculture to conduct a 
study evaluating the feasibility, safety, and cost effectiveness of 
using unmanned aerial vehicles, otherwise known as drones, for the 
purposes of fighting wildfires. It will also study the use of drones 
for forest restoration and management, which could be effective for 
replanting remote areas of forest.
  The Secretary of Agriculture would have to work with several other 
agencies that also deal with wildfire suppression and aviation. This 
amendment would require consultation with the Department of 
Transportation and the Federal Aviation Administration to ensure safety 
for our aircraft and the pilots flying in the same airspace.
  It would also assess the impact of using drones on employment in the 
U.S. Innovation will take us into the future.


  But we need to know, eyes wide open, how this affects the employment 
landscape of our communities. And that is why these studies are also 
important.
  The Department is required to report to Congress within 2 years of 
enactment. If implemented, I look forward to seeing the results of this 
study. I believe it will help add another tool to the toolkit in 
protecting American lives, homes, property, businesses, wildlife, and 
forests from devastating fires.

the gentleman explained, this amendment does direct the Secretary of 
Agriculture to study the use of unmanned vehicles, or drones, in the 
responsible forest management wildland firefighting and fire 
suppression.
  Unmanned aerial vehicles are an emerging technology that should be 
harnessed to benefit our Nation's forests. As a matter of fact, these 
unmanned vehicles are being used extensively by the private sector to 
look at their forests, to manage them, to equip them with remote-
sensing equipment so that they can cover large areas at a large time 
and gather much more accurate data than you could actually do on the 
ground.
  By ensuring that our land management practices utilize the cutting 
edge of available technology, we can ensure the prolonged health of our 
managed forests, and we can actually use this as a tool to cut down on 
the number of forest fires, and a better way to respond to those fires.
  I hope the gentleman will support the full bill after we add this 
amendment to it so that he can actually see the implementation of his 
amendment in practice.

by myself, Greg Walden, and Kurt Schrader.
  Section 913 of the bill requires all public lands managed by the BLM 
and


five western Oregon districts to be managed under the O&C California 
Lands Act of 1937. These are statutorily unique lands. They are all 
contained in the State of Oregon. There are 2.6 million acres in 18 
Oregon western counties.
  The O&C Act directs the BLM to manage those lands for multiple uses, 
including sustainable timber harvest, reforestation, protection of 
watersheds. As Federal lands, counties with O&C acres are unable to 
collect taxes. The Federal Government realized that put a tremendous 
burden on the counties, and the revenues are shared 50 percent with the 
counties and 50 percent with the Federal Government. These are critical 
revenues for my counties, and we have been trying to enhance management 
on those lands to help both with employment and with those revenues.
  Without this provision, the bill would seem to open up wilderness, 
wild and scenic rivers, the national trail system, and other 
statutorily protected areas. It will also protect the Yaquina Head 
Outstanding Natural Area on Oregon's coast.
  So I would ask--I believe that was an oversight in the drafting of 
the bill since similar protections are provided on Forest Service lands 
for statutorily reserved areas, and I would urge Members to support 
this amendment.

on. But this is definitely one that we agree on needs to be in there.
  Although H.R. 2936 includes the important sideboards that ensure 
appropriate land management practices are implemented on federally 
protected and sensitive lands, this is just putting some suspenders on 
with the belt.

agencies, the wildland firefighter does not exist. That is correct. 
There are men and women around this Nation who work daily to protect 
our communities from the fires that devastate especially the Western 
United States, but they are not allowed to call themselves 
firefighters.
  Instead of ``firefighter,'' the Forest Service, BLM, and other 
agencies use bureaucratic terms like ``forestry technician,'' which 
fails to recognize the dangers they face and the sacrifices they make 
to protect others.
  My amendment, which I am pleased to offer with my colleague, 
Representative Mark DeSaulnier from California, represents a bill we 
have both sponsored, H.R. 3907, as well; which seeks simply to 
designate these brave men and women the title they have earned by 
directing the Office of Personnel Management to create employee classes 
designated as ``wildland firefighters.''
  Mr. Chairman, 15 ``technicians'' have passed away this last year 
fighting wildfires. Several of them are from California. It is 
unconscionable that, while they perished fighting fires, the agencies 
that employ them refuse to call them firefighters. We should take 
action to rectify that failure, and I urge Members to consider our 
bill, H.R. 3907, to do so.
  However, Mr. Chairman, I know that there is additional work to be 
done with the very bureaucracies which refuse to use the term 
``firefighter'' with last-minute concerns and clarifications needed so 
that the firefighters indeed don't lose benefits, and I note that we 
will be back.

thinning projects which would restore them to health are delayed by 
lengthy and costly regulations and litigations. In New Mexico, it takes 
a look like this: the top picture is a picture of one of our national 
forests, and the bottom picture is a picture from an area that has been 
thinned.
  Now, take, for example, the Lincoln National Forest near Ruidoso, the 
Mescalero Forest is butted right up against it, so we are able to get a 
good comparison.
  Now, typically, the forests in the West look like this: widely spaced 
trees and mostly grass in between, so when the fires came, they were 
grass fires. The tree rings show us that every 8 years a fire occurred, 
and it would keep the small underbrush and the small diameter trees, 
the small, unhealthy ones, it would keep those burned out and our 
forests, again, looked like this.
  But because all of the thinning projects and all of the timber 
projects have been canceled for decades now, our forests, instead, look 
like this. When wildfires happen, they burn catastrophically and burn 
everything in their sight.
  So my amendment today simply allows the Forest Service to move 
forward on balanced thinning programs in large scale. Typically, they 
do all of the paperwork, all of the studies for small acreage, maybe 30 
acres or 50 acres. Since the forests are about a million acres, you 
would never get through and never get the forest restored to its 
health, and that is the problem.
  The Forest Service has been working with me on the language for this 
amendment and submitted almost exact language that we have put here on 
the floor today. They agree with us that they should restore the forest 
to its health, but the environmental groups and the outside litigation 
have stopped the programs completely.
  Now, in New Mexico, this means jobs, but it also means the health of 
our environment, and it means the destruction of endangered species, 
because when the fires burn through, we get the effect on the next 
page; again, this is that same Lincoln National Forest that we were 
looking at just a second ago. This is after the Little Bear fire, which 
burned 255 homes and almost 40,000 acres.
  We almost lost the entire town of Ruidoso. If the fire had just 
capped over the mountain, it would have burned straight down the side. 
The winds were exactly the direction which would have caused that.
  So the Forest Service is agreeing with us that we need to do some 
thinning, and we are not going to be able to do it without legislative 
language, so this amendment is being offered here today.


  We used to have 123 mills working in New Mexico clearing timber, 
processing it. We have got vast national


forests, and all of those have been shut down. The spotted owl came 
along in 1993, and the findings from the Fish and Wildlife Service was 
that logging was the reason that the spotted owl was going extinct.
  Over 20 years later, Dan Ashe, the head of Fish and Wildlife Service, 
said: Oops, we made a mistake and we burned down the West, and we have 
ruined our forests over a mistake. There was actually another predator 
out there. We still have the problem to go in and clean up these 
forests before they burn and before they look like this.
  Another real problem that exists is when we burn our national 
forests, then the watersheds are going to be choked up with mud, with 
ash, and with everything else.
  This is Bonita Lake there in that same Lincoln National Forest near 
Ruidoso. It provides the drinking water for several major communities 
in the southern part of the State. That lake was about 75 feet deep, 
pristine water, had fish in there. It was a recreational area right in 
the middle of the national forest.
  The Forest Service was alarmed at how much damage was going to occur 
to this lake if they didn't log above it, so they put in a project. 
They were sued and work grounded to a halt. They did not get to thin 
that area above the lake. A fire occurred, this fire that you just saw 
in the previous slide. Now, that 75-feet-deep lake is filled with 50-
feet of mud and ash. It killed all of the fish. It is not suitable for 
drinking. The community does not have the money in order to drain that 
lake and to refill it.
  So that is what we find in the West because of these forest 
management processes. My amendment would simply allow the Forest 
Service to move forward on large-scale projects. They would still have 
to do all of the studies, everything. They would just be expedited.
  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time."|145

ideas that are in the underlying bill. The 150,000 acre categorical 
exclusion to remove timber from Gila, Lincoln, and Cibola National 
Forests has the potential to do more harm than good, and cuts the 
American public out of the decisionmaking process.
  The Forest Service doesn't need this waiver to harvest trees in New 
Mexico. Last year, the Cibola produced 12,000 metric board feet, and 
Lincoln and Gila each between 5,000 and 6,000 metric board feet. These 
are average production numbers across the region.
  So I am not sure what problem this amendment is trying to address or 
how exempting 150,000-acre projects from the environmental review helps 
the Forest Service meet their mandate of protecting habitat, 
watersheds, and providing recreational opportunities.
  This amendment also exempts the Forest Service from the consultation 
requirements and the Endangered Species Act. Logging projects 
untethered from the bedrock environmental protections could potentially 
impact several species which depend on these forests for habitat, 
including the Mexican spotted owl and the Gila trout.
  Active forest management is not a bad thing if it is done 
responsibly. If NEPA and the Endangered Species Act are followed, we 
get good projects, safe habitat restoration--not clear-cutting and loss 
of critical habitat. Unfortunately, this amendment undermines both of 
these fundamental laws and should be rejected.
  Mr. Chair, I urge a ``no'' vote on the amendment, and I reserve the 
balance of my time."|148

We are burning up the habitat. We are burning up the endangered

District of New Mexico that was over 300,000 acres and they burned 
without regard. They burned human life. They burned animal life. They 
burned habitat and they contaminate our waterways.
  Those are the problems that we are trying to solve. The Forest 
Service agrees with us that the restrictions are too great, and they 
have worked with us on the language, understanding that they must go 
through the studies, they must do the work that is required, but we can 
expedite those in order to do larger-scale thinning projects. 
Otherwise, we will never get the forests in the West cleared up.

that my friend from New Mexico has just brought up. The Statement of 
Administrative Policy from the executive branch raises the concerns of 
H.R. 2936 and of the land management reforms, which are in the 
legislation.
  It says: ``The administration, however, has concerns about the 
legislation's revision to the Stafford Act, which would force 
competition for funding between wildfires on Federal land and other 
disasters already covered by the Stafford Act, including hurricanes.''
  It also says that the legislation doesn't really address the issue of 
fire borrowing, which is central to dealing effectively and proactively 
with wildfires, both prevention, and suppression, as the resource is 
needed.
  Mr. Chairman, I include in the Record the Statement of Administrative 
Policy by the Trump administration. I also include another Statement of 
Administrative Policy dated July 8, 2015, which is on the same 
legislation, but by then-President Obama, which mirrors and reflects 
the same concerns brought up by the executive branch of President 
Trump.

                   Statement of Administration Policy


h.r. 293--resilient federal forests act of 2017--rep. westerman, r-ar, 
                           and 18 cosponsors

       The Administration strongly believes that funding for 
     wildland fire management must be addressed in order to enable 
     the Forest Service and the Department of the Interior to 
     better manage the Nation's forests and other public lands. 
     The Administration's second disaster funding request, 
     submitted to Congress on October 4, 2017, underscored this 
     belief. The request also noted the Administration's belief 
     that land management reforms are critical to solving the 
     problem of ``fire borrowing''--taking funds from forest 
     management programs to cover fire costs that exceed 
     appropriations--in a comprehensive manner, rather than 
     through a funding-only approach.
       The Administration appreciates the intent of H.R. 2936, the 
     Resilient Federal Forests Act of 2017, and is supportive of 
     land management reforms like those outlined in the 
     legislation. The Administration, however, has concerns about 
     the legislation's revisions to the Stafford Act, which would 
     force competition for funding between wildfires on Federal 
     land and other disasters already covered by the Stafford Act, 
     including hurricanes.
     Wildland Fire Management Funding
       Last year, Federal wildfire suppression spending reached 
     $2.9 billion, an amount that signals clearly the need for 
     Congress to address the rising cost of fire suppression 
     operations. The dependence on ``fire borrowing'' to cover 
     funding shortfalls in times of severe wildfire impedes the 
     missions of our land management agencies, including by taking 
     critical funding from programs that help reduce the risk of 
     catastrophic fire, restore and maintain healthy functioning 
     ecosystems, and yield timber production.
       The Administration, however, has concerns with re-purposing 
     the Stafford Act to address wildfires. The purpose of the 
     Stafford Act is to assist State, local, tribal, and 
     territorial (SLTT) governments that become overwhelmed when 
     responding to and recovering from natural disasters affecting 
     their jurisdictions. H.R. 2936 would modify the Stafford Act 
     by creating a new type of disaster declaration to address the 
     cost of wildfire suppression on Federal land, thereby 
     changing long-standing principles governing Federal support 
     to SLTT governments. As we have seen in this year's historic 
     Atlantic hurricane season, the Federal Emergency Management 
     Agency (FEMA) must continue to be focused on its existing 
     mission, and the Stafford Act's Disaster Relief Fund must 
     remain dedicated solely to that mission.
       Instead of the approach outlined in H.R. 2936, the 
     Administration supports a separate, annual cap adjustment for 
     wildfire suppression operations, which will resolve concerns 
     about the sufficiency of funds for wildfire suppression and 
     avoid unnecessary competition for Stafford Act funds.
     Improving Forest Management
       The Administration appreciates H.R. 2936's recognition that 
     fixing the funding component of fire borrowing will not, on 
     its own, stop the worsening trend of catastrophic wildfires. 
     Meaningful forest management reforms to strengthen our 
     ability to restore the Nation's forests and improve their 
     resilience to destructive wildfires must be a part


     of any permanent solution. H.R. 2936's provisions that 
     expedite environmental approval for proactive forest 
     management, including hazardous fuel reduction and post-fire 
     timber salvage and reforestation actions, are important steps 
     forward. The Administration supports and will continue to 
     work with Congress on the details of the forest management 
     reform proposals.
       Although the Administration has concerns with H.R. 2936's 
     modifications to the Stafford Act, the Administration will 
     continue working with Congress to enact a sustainable 
     solution to ``fire borrowing'' that does not adversely affect 
     FEMA's critical disaster relief funding and that recognizes 
     the need for a comprehensive solution to the problem of 
     wildfires."|150

who has had a tremendous impact on Northern Virginia. Eileen Curtis, 
President and CEO of the Dulles Regional Chamber of Commerce, is 
retiring after leading the Chamber since 1994.
   During her tenure, the Dulles Chamber has established itself as one 
of the leading business advocacy groups in the region, adding to the 
quality of life for our residents in the Dulles Corridor and beyond. I 
have been proud to work with the Chamber on a host of issues, perhaps 
most significant being Rail to Dulles. The Chamber was instrumental in 
the foundation of the Dulles Corridor Rail Association, which helped 
lobby for federal funding which was eventually secured to help 
construct the Silver Line. The 23-mile long Silver Line has spurred 
major economic development along the Dulles Corridor and has been 
singled out by Fairfax County executives as one of the main reasons 
behind Fairfax County's continued economic success.
   In addition to Rail to Dulles, Eileen has worked with the Chamber to 
enhance the region in other ways including advocating for STEM 
education in our schools, forging partnerships with the business and 
education communities, creating greater opportunities for our immigrant 
community, and establishing new local festivals and events to bring the 
community together. These efforts are among the many reasons why 
Northern Virginia is routinely recognized as one of the best places in 
the United States in which to live, work, raise a family, and start a 
business.
   Eileen's efforts have been drawn recognition from across the region. 
The Chamber's efforts in education have been honored by Fairfax County 
Public Schools on multiple occasions and the Washington Business 
Journal routinely lists the Dulles Chamber as being one of the largest 
in membership. Eileen herself has been recognized as Woman of the Year 
by the Herndon Business & Professional Women and as Executive of the 
Year by the Virginia Association of Chambers of Commerce Executives. 
These accolades speak to the strength of Eileen as a leader and the 
dedication that she has shown to our community. There can be no doubt 
of the positive impact that she has had on our community and our region 
is better for her efforts.
   Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating Eileen 
Curtis on her retirement and in thanking her for her outstanding 
service to Fairfax County and Northern Virginia. While she may be 
retiring, I am confident that she will remain engaged on the issues 
that are close to her heart. I wish her great success in all her future 
endeavors.

  I rise today in support of H.R. 2600, sponsored by my colleague, 
Representative David Young of Iowa.
  H.R. 2600 directs the Department of the Interior to convey to the 
State of Iowa the reversionary interest held by the United States in 
certain land in Pottawattamie County.
  By the way, there is going to be a test afterwards on this 
pronunciation.
  In 1989, Congress authorized the Secretary of the Interior to provide 
for the development of a trails interpretive center in Council Bluffs, 
Iowa. Six years later, in 1995, the National Western Trails Center 
donated property to the Federal Government, and the National Park 
Service later constructed a trails center on the property to interpret 
the history of the Lewis and Clark


National Historic Trail, the Mormon Pioneer National Historic Trail, 
and the Oregon National Historic Trail.
  In 1998, the Federal Government donated the trails center and 
surrounding property to the State Historical Society of Iowa. Federal 
ownership was transferred to the State subject to a condition that if 
the trails center is not being used for the purposes specified in the 
1989 Act, the land and the center would revert to the United States.
  Since 1998, the State has owned and operated the trails center. 
Presently, visitation at the center is very low, the hours of operation 
are limited, and maintenance is falling behind. The State of Iowa would 
like to remove the trails center from its responsibility and possibly 
transfer the property to the city of Council Bluffs.
  The National Park Service currently does not own or directly manage 
any of the land associated with the 1989 Act. Moreover, it is the 
Committee's understanding that the National Park Service does not have 
any interest in taking over operation of the trails center or ownership 
of the property.
  I commend Representative Young for his outstanding work on behalf of 
his constituents. I would also like to thank the minority for their 
help and cooperation moving this legislation forward.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the measure, and I reserve the 
balance of my time."|4

  H.R. 2600 authorizes the conveyance to the State of Iowa the 
reversionary interest on the Western Historic Trails Center in Council 
Bluffs, Iowa.
  In 1989, Congress authorized the Department of the Interior to 
partner with the State of Iowa to create a trails interpretative center 
to support three National Historic Trails that cross through the 
region.
  In 1988, the Secretary of the Interior transferred approximately 400 
acres to the State of Iowa for use as a visitor center. Ownership was 
then transferred to the State with a reversionary clause that limits 
the use of the property to a visitor center.
  The National Park Service does not operate or maintain the current 
visitor center. However, under current law, if the State stops using 
the site for its intended purpose, ownership will revert back to the 
Federal Government.
  Since its establishment, the trails interpretative center has not 
lived up to its expectations. Visitation is low and the facility is in 
need of significant maintenance.
  The National Park Service and the State of Iowa have determined that 
termination of the reversionary interest makes both fiscal and 
operational sense. This will allow the State to sell the property to 
the city of Council Bluffs, allowing the city to maintain the facility.
  As long as the State continues to provide National Historic Trail 
interpretive services following the terms of the original agreement, 
Congress should be allowed to release the reversionary interest to this 
particular property.
  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

committee for their leadership and working together with me, the 
National Park Service, the State of Iowa, Pottawattamie County, and the 
city of Council Bluffs on this bill.
  The National Park Service holds reversionary rights to a small parcel 
of land in Council Bluffs in Pottawattamie County which highlights 
Lewis and Clark's travels with an interpretation center, as well as 
highlighting the California National Historic Trail and the Mormon 
Pioneer National Historic Trail. However, the National Park Service has 
limited resources and a limited desire to effectively operate this 
property with the hundreds of properties it already maintains across 
the country.
  So by listening to the Park Service, the State of Iowa, Pottawattamie 
County, the city of Council Bluffs, and local leaders and residents, a 
consensus and commonsense solution evolved to allow the city of Council 
Bluffs to accept responsibility for the property in determining its 
best use while still recognizing and highlighting the spirit and 
history of these historic trails.
  I thank my colleagues from California, the ranking member, and the

  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 3279, the Helium 
Extraction Act of 2017. This straightforward piece of legislation will 
incentivize helium production on Federal lands, help ensure the future 
of America's helium supply, and provide a fair return to the taxpayer.
  Under existing law, the Mineral Leasing Act only permits helium 
extraction as a by-product of an existing oil or natural gas lease. As 
a result, if oil and gas production on a Federal site is not 
economically viable, the lease will expire, regardless of the revenue 
brought in by helium sales. The Helium Extraction Act of 2017 would 
correct this error and authorize helium production activities where 
economically viable.
  Helium is used for much more than balloons. It is a rare and unique 
element which has become an indispensable part of our medical, space, 
and defense industries, such as its use in MRI machines, 
semiconductors, and air-to-air missile guidance systems.
  Unfortunately, the future of our domestic helium supply is uncertain. 
The Helium Stewardship Act of 2013, which details a commonsense 
privatization process of the Federal helium reserve, also specifies 
that all helium in the Federal reserve must be auctioned off by 
September 30, 2021, and the facility closed.
  This crucial source of helium has been relied upon for almost half a 
century, but in a few short years, it will no longer be available. Our 
country needs another way to access this critical natural resource; 
otherwise, we will be relying on hostile interests such as Qatar, 
Algeria, and Russia. Each of these countries presents security and 
geopolitical challenges made even more apparent by recent unrest among 
Qatar and its regional neighbors.
  Unless something changes, foreign facilities are predicted to become 
our chief source of helium by the end of the decade. This is why H.R. 
3279 is such a necessary piece of legislation.
  By authorizing the Bureau of Land Management to lease land for this 
valuable nonrenewable resource, this legislation will raise $9 million 
for the American taxpayer and help secure our supply of helium for 
years to come.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of this measure, and I reserve the 
balance of my time."|4
CREC-2017-11-01-pt1-PgH8323-5|Mrs. TORRES|T000474|CREC-2017-11-01-pt1-PgH8323|"  Mrs. TORRES. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  H.R. 3279 would correct a problem in our Federal oil and gas leasing 
laws that makes it more difficult for companies to commercially produce 
helium from Federal lands. Helium is a critical element for high-tech 
research and modern medicine, and because of its unique properties, 
there are simply no substitutes.
  On the Natural Resources Committee, we have spent many years 
overseeing the Federal Helium Program, culminating in the bipartisan 
Helium Stewardship Act signed into law 4 years ago.
  While the Helium Stewardship Act improved the management and sale of 
Federal helium, it didn't do much to promote the development of new 
sources of helium, which are in high demand. By allowing companies to 
hold onto Federal oil and gas leases if they are producing commercial 
quantities of helium and only helium, then the problem that kept 
potentially valuable helium resources under lock and key is resolved. 
This is only one small step, but it is a very useful one.
  Mr. Speaker, I thank the sponsor of this legislation for introducing 
it.
  I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 3279, and I yield back the 
balance of my time."|5

mark that Ioannis Ioannopoulos had on American society, as the original 
founder of one of the oldest known wooden school houses in the country. 
In order to fully understand the cultural motivation to establish this 
historic treasure, one must examine Ioannopoulos's early life. A 
carpenter by trade, Ioannis Ioannopoulos was the son of George and 
Maria-Canelas and hailed from the Petalidi area in Messinia that was 
then known as ``Koroni'' (the village of Skoutari, Mani). He was known 
by the Spanish as Juan Genopoly. Ioannopoulos--at the age of 13--was 
one of a group of indentured laborers brought to the New World by 
Andrew Turnbull to work an indigo plantation at New Smyrna. This group 
of 1,403 Minorcans, Greeks and Italians suffered mistreatment, 
starvation and overextended servitudes at Turnbull's plantation. The 
people were reduced to slavery, and treated with great cruelty by 
Trumbull, whose partner in the enterprise was the English Governor of 
the territory, who kept the colonists in subjection with English 
troops. This slavery lasted nine years, during which time nearly two-
thirds of these colonists perished; but large crops of indigo were 
raised for the company--one year 30,000 lbs. it is stated.
  In 1776, a new Governor having arrived, the petitions of these people 
for relief were listened to, and they were released from the tyranny of 
their master. One year later six hundred refugees, led by Ioannis 
Ioannopoulos, Francisco Pellicer and Antonio Llambias, walked to St 
Augustine and were granted asylum by Governor Tonyn. They became the 
largest group of immigrants to settle in America in one group at one 
time. Collectively called ``Minorcans'', they were an important part of 
the fabric of St. Augustine history. It was on Saint George Street 
where the survivors of the New Smyrna Colony first settled after their 
escape. Since that time, this area of Old St. Augustine has been called 
``the Greek Quarter'' and alternately ``the Minorcan Quarter.''
  Ioannis Giannopoulos built a little house out of red cedar and 
cypress and put it together with wooden pegs and handmade nails, 
sometime around 1800. This building was a home first but, as early as 
1811, members of the Genopoly family taught the children of other 
Minorcan families in the first floor ``schoolroom'' of this building. 
As the story goes, Genopoly, in typical Greek fashion, was worried his 
children would grow up without an education. Genopoly and his daughter 
Maria Manuela Barbara ``Mary'' Genopoly Darling were the first 
teachers. Then Genopoly hired a school teacher, and generations of 
children from St. Augustine went to school in this building. Juan 
Genopoly died in 1820.
  Today, this preserved building is recognized as one of the oldest 
schoolhouses in North America. It has become the symbol of their hard 
work and perseverance. It's now the main attraction of the historical 
precinct in St. George Street, Saint Augustine, Florida. John 
Giannopoulos left a deep imprint in the educational history of St. 
Augustine by establishing a school in his house. Now restored, it 
stands as one of the oldest school buildings in the United States.

strong support for the confirmation of Colorado Supreme Court Justice 
Allison Eid as the next U.S. court of appeals judge for the Tenth 
Circuit Court, which, of course, is housed in Denver, CO.
  There is no doubt that Justice Eid is superbly qualified for this 
position. For the past decade, she has served Colorado as a justice on 
the supreme court. In 2008, Justice Eid was overwhelmingly retained by 
the people of Colorado. We have a system where every decade the voters 
of Colorado vote to retain or dismiss a judge, and every time that has 
come before the people of Colorado, she has been overwhelmingly 
retained by the people of Colorado.
  Prior to her appointment, Justice Eid represented the State of 
Colorado before the State federal courts as our State solicitor 
general. She served as a tenured member of the faculty at the 
University of Colorado Law School, where she taught courses in 
constitutional law, legislation, torts, and she has published scholarly 
articles on topics such as constitutional federalism and tort law, in 
addition to being a clerk on the Supreme Court. She also practiced 
commercial and appellate litigation at the Denver office of the 
national law firm Arnold and Porter.
  She began her legal career as a clerk to Judge Jerry E. Smith on the 
U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. Her law experience took 
her to the U.S. Supreme Court under Clarence Thomas. Prior to attending 
law school, Justice Eid was a special assistant and speechwriter for 
the U.S. Secretary of Education, Bill Bennett. She received her law 
degree from the University of Chicago Law School, where she was the 
articles editor of the Law Review. She graduated with high honors and 
as a member of the Order of the Coif. She received her degree in 
American studies from Stanford University, graduating with distinction 
as a member of Phi Beta Kappa.
  What her resume clearly shows is that whatever Justice Eid does, she 
does it at the highest level, with the best results. She has 
specialized knowledge of federalism, water law, and Indian law, among 
other important areas of the law. Indeed, the National Native American 
Bar Association has even noted that she has ``significantly more 
experience with Indian law cases than any other recent Circuit Court 
nominee.''
  We have had some pretty doggone good circuit court nominees in the 
past, including Justice Neil Gorsuch, whose seat she will be filling on 
the Tenth Circuit Court. These are concepts that are critical to my 
home State of Colorado, and her expertise will prove to be invaluable 
to the Tenth Circuit Court, as well as to the Nation and the people of 
this country.
  But as impressive as her credentials are, it is her demeanor and her 
approach to the law that make her ideally suited for the court. Justice 
Eid has been called a ``mainstream, commonsense Westerner.'' She is 
also, as her former law clerks have noted, ``fiercely independent,'' 
and she will decide cases ``as she believes the law requires.'' At the 
same time, she seeks out different viewpoints and wants to understand 
all sides of the issue she addresses.
  That is the law professor I know from my days at the University of 
Colorado School of Law. I can say from that experience that while 
Justice Eid has her perspectives on the law, she cares very deeply 
about robust debate and hearing the views of others. And I know from my 
classmates who had Justice Eid as their professor--those classmates 
didn't always agree with her perspectives, but Justice Eid was open to 
their debate and hearing their views. She engaged them, and she was 
never biased against differing perspectives but always applying the law 
as the law required, not as opinions suited.
  I also know that ``fiercely independent'' jurist whom her former 
clerks spoke so highly of. Justice Eid will follow the law regardless 
of the popular wind, regardless of personal opinion. Whether 
considering the plain meaning of a statute, discerning the proper role 
of the courts, the legislative branch, or the executive and its 
agencies, or evaluating the relationships between the Federal 
Government and the States, Justice Eid will side with what the law 
says, and she will do it in that commonsense, western way that clearly 
and articulately tells the American people what the law is.
  I am privileged to know Justice Eid. I have known her for a number of 
years now from my days as a student at the University of Colorado 
School of Law and through her work in the State of Colorado at the time 
that I served in the State legislature. She is an incredible human 
being with a delightful demeanor that will suit the court well.
  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record 
several letters in support of Justice Eid's nomination: a letter to 
Chairman Grassley and Ranking Member Feinstein from former law clerks 
of Justice Eid's, as well as a letter from various supporters in 
Colorado and one letter from the Southern Ute Indian Tribe."|2
CREC-2017-11-01-pt1-PgS6945-3|Mr. GARDNER|G000562|CREC-2017-11-01-pt1-PgS6945|"  Mr. GARDNER. Mr. President, I wish to spend some time talking about a 
letter dated July 27, 2017. This letter was sent to me and my 
colleague, Senator Bennet from Colorado. This letter was titled 
``Support for the Confirmation of Justice Allison Eid to the Tenth 
Circuit Court of Appeals,'' which I have


submitted for the Record, but I want to highlight some of the people 
who have signed this letter because when it comes to the courts and 
nominations, I think it is very important that we listen to the voices 
of those people who are closest to the court over which the nominee may 
be presiding. It is also important that those who are closest to a 
practicing lawyer provide their opinions of a lawyer who has been 
nominated for the bench who is not already on the bench.
  In the case of Justice Eid's supporters, there is an incredible list 
of people from across the political spectrum--both sides of the aisle--
supporting Justice Eid. Let me talk about a few of Justice Eid's 
supporters, because we will hear a lot of debate about groups who 
support or oppose Justice Eid, but the people who know her the best, 
the people who have practiced before her court, the people who have 
worked with her over the many years of public service that she has 
provided don't just fall on the Republican side of the aisle or the 
Democratic side of the aisle, the support she has gathered is from 
across the political spectrum.
  There is Michael Bender, former Colorado Supreme Court justice; 
Justice Rebecca Love Kourlis, one of the most respected jurists in 
Colorado, who served on the State supreme court and is one of the most 
highly regarded justices not only in Colorado but across the country, 
quite frankly; Justice Mary Mullarkey. Justice Mullarkey is no longer 
on the Colorado Supreme Court, but she served as the chief justice of 
the Colorado Supreme Court. She was appointed by a Democratic Governor. 
She is someone who believes Justice Eid would be an incredible addition 
to the court. There is Neal Katyal, a former Department of Justice 
civil servant for the Obama administration--a U.S. Solicitor General, 
in fact. If we look at the other supporters she has, we see that 
Melissa Hart, who has run for office as a Democratic candidate, 
supports the nomination and confirmation of Justice Allison Eid.
  As you can see, the Tenth Circuit has an incredible nominee before it 
whom I hope this body will soon confirm. I urge my colleagues to move 
quickly during this cloture time so that we can actually approve 
somebody who I know will do an outstanding job. I urge their support. I 
hope we will do our duty under our Constitution to select those people 
who will be guarding the Constitution and do it in a way that we can 
all be proud of. That is why I support Allison Eid.
  I yield the floor."|3

CREC-2017-11-01-pt1-PgS6945-5|Mr. WHITEHOUSE|W000802|CREC-2017-11-01-pt1-PgS6945|"  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I come to the floor today for the 
184th time to ask us to at least wake up to our duty as a Congress to 
enact prudent policies to address the effects of climate change. The 
Presiding Officer is well aware of what Alaska faces from ocean 
acidification and ocean melting and sea level rise and all of that.
  For the generations who will look back at this, I have tried in these 
speeches to chronicle the political tricks and bullying that have put 
Congress--the Congress of the United States--in tow to a massively 
conflicted special interest, such that we are incapacitated on this 
vital subject. The shamelessness of the fossil fuel industry and the 
spinelessness of Congress under its sway will provide a long lesson in 
modern-day corruption and political failure.
  The Trump administration has been particularly loathsome, threatening 
the emissions standards for cars and trucks, pressing for the Keystone 
XL tar sands pipeline, disbanding science advisory committees, lifting 
the moratorium on Federal coal leasing, trying to expand offshore 
drilling, and open national marine monuments and sanctuaries to energy 
companies. The Environmental Protection Agency is working to eliminate 
rules on the leaking and flaring of methane and has rescinded 
requirements for reporting methane emissions. The President has 
announced his intention to withdraw the U.S. from the Paris climate 
agreement.
  One particular target of this corrupted administration is the Clean 
Power Plan, the 2015 EPA rule to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from 
American powerplants--a rule that many utilities and States supported. 
But it is the industry's bottom-dwellers who have the President's ear, 
and they want to undo even this flexible framework for meeting 
emissions-reduction targets.
  When EPA balanced the costs and benefits of the Clean Power Plan 
originally, it offset things, like between $14 billion and $34 billion 
in health benefits in the form of preventive illnesses and deaths, 
against the costs of industry compliance.
  The net benefits of the Clean Power Plan came out to between $26 
billion and $45 billion every year.
  So with its official proposal to rescind the Clean Power Plan, EPA 
administrator and fossil fuel operative Scott Pruitt had to cook the 
books to wipe out this public benefit. Here is how he did it. There 
were two tricks. One derives from the fact that harms, injuries, and 
losses caused by carbon pollution can take place many years after the 
pollution is emitted. In financial matters, future costs and benefits 
are balanced against present costs and benefits, using what is called a 
discount rate. It is more valuable to receive $1 million now than $1 
million 20 years from now. That is the theory.
  But even the George W. Bush administration recognized for healthcare 
rulemaking that ``[s]pecial ethical considerations arise when comparing 
benefits and costs across generations,'' and they urged care about 
using a discount rate when a rule is expected to harm future 
generations.
  In 2015, the United States settled on a 3-percent discount rate to 
estimate the out-year costs of carbon pollution to society. Scott 
Pruitt jacked that up to a 7-percent discount rate so out-year harms, 
injuries, and losses would count for less. Mind you, our children and 
grandchildren will still suffer the exact same costs at 3 percent or at 
7 percent. It is just that present-day polluters--Scott Pruitt's 
masters--get a way-big discount.
  Pruitt's second trick is only to count the carbon pollution harm 
within our borders. You might say: That is OK; we are Americans, after 
all. But it is worth taking a look at what this rule does if all 
countries were to use it because there is a trick hidden in the middle 
of it. The fact is that we are harmed by other countries' carbon 
emissions, and they in turn are harmed by our carbon emissions. On the 
flip side, we harm other countries with our emissions, and they harm us 
with theirs.
  There is a total amount of global emissions, and there is a total 
amount of global harm. If you call the total global emissions X and the 
total global harm Y, what happens when every country follows the Pruitt 
method of only pricing local emissions and local harms?
  For purposes of illustration, let's say there are three countries in 
the world, and each emits one-third of the total carbon pollution and 
suffers one-third of the global harm from the collective global 
emissions. If each country only counts its own emissions and the harms 
only to its own country, guess what happens. All that cross-border harm 
never gets counted. It never gets counted. It disappears off the 
balance sheet. It vanishes into this trick of calculation. If you are 
the tool of the fossil fuel industry, how rewarding it must be to 
implement a trick that just vanishes so much of the fossil fuel 
industry's harm to the world.
  In this hypothetical, how much harm simply vanishes? Two-thirds of it 
does. Two thirds of the harm simply vanishes, never to be accounted 
for--not in the real world. Nothing has changed in the real world. In 
this three-country hypothetical, the total emissions is still X and the 
total harm is still Y. None of that has changed. This Pruitt trick of 
accounting just wiped two-thirds of the harm off the books. A happy day 
for polluters, and a happy, happy day for the polluters' tool, for 
there will no doubt be rewards for implementing this trick.
  Those fossil fuel industry bottom-dwellers no doubt think that this 
is pretty cute and that this is pretty clever stuff, indeed. There are 
high-fives in the corporate boardrooms that they have a tool in office 
who will pull such a trick of magical, vanishing carbon pollution 
harms. But the problem with these crooked little schemes is that the 
whole world is actually watching. Anybody can do the analysis that I 
just did and show that this is nothing more


than a trick, and sooner or later, consequences do come home to roost.
  Out in the real world, the Pacific Island nation of Kiribati is 
buying up land in Fiji so it can evacuate its people there when rising 
seas engulf its islands and eliminate the nation. It is on its way to 
becoming a modern-day Atlantis, lost forever to the waves. You can 
replicate that risk along the shores of Bangladesh, Burma, Malaysia and 
the Maldives.
  You can add in the risk of lost fisheries that left a country's EEZ 
for cooler waters. If you think that is just a hypothetical, ask 
Connecticut and Rhode Island lobstermen about their catch. Add in the 
expansion of the world's desert areas in the Sahel and elsewhere that 
forces farmers' crops and shepherds' flocks away from their historic 
homes.
  Add unprecedented storms powered up over warming seas. As bad as 
things have been in Houston, Florida, and Puerto Rico, we are rich 
enough to rebuild, to throw billions of dollars at the problem, and we 
are. Other places do not have those resources. Without the help, 
imagine that suffering.
  To those who will suffer in the future, what do we say? On that day 
of reckoning, on that judgment day, what do we tell all those people 
who suffered? Ha-ha-ha, do we say? We came up with this little trick 
that wiped most of your suffering off our books. We used a discount 
rate that discounted your suffering to virtually zero. Is that the kind 
of America we want to be? Remember the saying: The power of America's 
example is more important than any example of our power. Some example 
we would be, some city on a hill, if that was the way we behaved.
  The natural world does not care about self-serving or ideological 
arguments. The natural world is governed by immutable laws of physics, 
chemistry, biology, and mathematics. Scott Pruitt's polluter-friendly 
mathematics just doesn't add up. As Michael Greenstone, an economist at 
the University of Chicago who helped develop the social cost of carbon, 
put it, Pruitt's plan was not evidence-based policymaking. This was 
policy-based evidence making.
  There is enormous pressure in the Trump administration to get rid of 
the social cost of carbon. What is bizarre about the Trump 
administration is that they don't try to get rid of the social cost of 
carbon by getting rid of its social costs, by lowering carbon 
emissions, by addressing the harms that it causes. They try to get rid 
of the social cost of carbon by getting rid of the scoring mechanism 
that counts all of that. It is like saying: My team is winning because 
I tore down the scoreboard.
  Well, no, the world is getting clobbered out there by carbon 
pollution and the climate change that causes it, and tearing down the 
scoreboard doesn't help change the game on the field. You cannot just 
cook the books and reduce the social cost of carbon.
  For one thing, the social cost of carbon analysis is too well 
established in the honest world. Courts have instructed Federal 
agencies to factor the social cost of carbon into their regulations. 
States are using the social cost of carbon in their policymaking. Most 
major corporations, even ExxonMobil, factor a social cost of carbon 
into their own planning and accounting.
  The social cost of carbon pollution is at the heart of the 
International Monetary Fund calculation, for which the fossil fuel 
industry gets an annual subsidy in the United States of $700 billion a 
year. Even to protect a multihundred-billion-dollar annual subsidy, 
Scott Pruitt can't just wish the social cost of carbon away and just 
can't stop counting it. Courts will take notice.
  They may take notice that these stunts are arbitrary and capricious 
under the Administrative Procedure Act. They may take note that Pruitt 
has massive conflicts of interest with his fossil fuel funders. They 
will surely note that the Supreme Court has said greenhouse gases are 
pollutants under the Clean Air Act, and that EPA is legally obligated 
to regulate them. They will surely note that the EPA itself has 
determined that greenhouse gas emissions endanger the public health and 
welfare of current and future generations, a determination that the DC 
Circuit resoundingly upheld.
  But we are not in an ordinary situation. Pruitt has a long history of 
doing the bidding of the fossil fuel industry. In the recent Frontline 
documentary, ``War on the EPA,'' Bob Murray of Murray Energy, a strong 
Pruitt supporter, bragged about giving this administration a three-page 
action plan on environmental regulations and bragged that the first 
page was already done. That is the world we live in now, where the 
regulated industry brags that it controls its regulator, gives it 
direction, and that its work is already being done.
  Courts that look at any rule proposed by Scott Pruitt must recognize 
that there is a near zero chance that he is operating in good faith. 
Our Nation's environmental regulator went in captured and has stayed 
captured by our Nation's biggest polluters. Scott Pruitt is not their 
regulator; he is their instrument. That is a conflict of interest.
  I recently hosted my eighth annual Rhode Island Energy Environment 
and Oceans Day, bringing together members of our business community 
from the public sector, from government, and academia, to hear directly 
from experts about the latest environmental news and initiatives. I was 
very excited to be joined by excellent keynote speakers, including 
former Secretary of State John Kerry, who has done such magnificent 
work on oceans particularly but on climate change generally, leading us 
into the Paris climate agreement. Also, there was former U.S. Special 
Envoy for Climate Change Todd Stern, who has labored in these vineyards 
so many years, and ocean advocate and Oceana board member Sam 
Waterston. They were all great, but one phrase stood out.
  Sam Waterston called on us to tackle today's ocean and environmental 
problems with what he called a ``battle-ready kind of optimism''--a 
``battle-ready kind of optimism.''
  So let us go forward with a ``battle-ready kind of optimism'' to 
clean the polluter swamp at EPA, to clean our Earth's atmosphere and 
oceans of unbridled carbon emissions, and to clear the reputation of 
our beloved country of the obloquy it is rapidly earning at the hands 
of a corrupting industry.
  I yield the floor."|5

CREC-2017-11-01-pt1-PgS6945-7|Mr. KAINE|K000384|CREC-2017-11-01-pt1-PgS6945|"  Mr. KAINE. Mr. President, I rise to talk about the Children's Health 
Insurance Program. We all know that healthcare is the most important 
thing in any person's life and in their family's life, and there is 
probably no healthcare issue that is more intense than a parents' 
concern about the health of their children. I think all of the offices 
in this building have heard from parents about the health of their kids 
over the course of the number of months we have been debating what to 
do about the Affordable Care Act.
  I rise today to talk about another critical program, which I hope we 
will act in a bipartisan way to reauthorize: the Children's Health 
Program, or CHIP. CHIP builds on Medicaid, and it gives families who 
earn too much to be eligible for Medicaid an insurance option for their 
kids. In talking to families who avail themselves of this option--in 
Virginia, years ago we didn't do a very good job of enrolling kids in 
CHIP, and we have become an awful lot better at it. It is interesting 
to hear the way parents talk about it. They will often talk about how 
important CHIP is to them when their child is sick or when their child 
is injured, but what is interesting to me is how important it is to 
them when their child is perfectly fine--not sick, not injured. But if 
you are a parent, you are going to have anxiety when you go to bed 
every night if your child doesn't have insurance or coverage: What if 
something happens tomorrow? This is a program that provides not just 
healthcare but peace of mind for parents and their kids.
  Between Virginia's separate CHIP program and the Family Access to 
Medical Insurance Security and CHIP-funded Medicaid, the State provides 
coverage to nearly 193,000 children. CHIP alone--the specific CHIP 
program--covers 66,000 kids in Virginia and also pregnant moms; 1,100 
pregnant moms are covered right now. The coverage is important. It 
includes doctor visits, hospital care, prescription medicines, 
eyeglasses--which are critical to being successful in school--
immunizations, and checkups for kids up to age


19, with minimal cost sharing and without premiums.
  In Virginia, since 2009, when I was Governor, we extended CHIP to 
also allow dental coverage. That has been really important to children 
and their families. The program is one of the success stories in this 
body because it has been strongly bipartisan in support since its 
creation in 1997. But as the President knows, this program expired on 
September 30. Despite bipartisan work on the Finance Committee, we 
still have not seen a reauthorization bill come to the Senate floor.
  The uncertainty surrounding CHIP has already started to have an 
influence on my constituents and the constituents of every Member of 
this body. According to our Virginia Department of Medical Assistance 
Services, the State will be forced to send letters on December 1, 2017, 
notifying families that there is an impending loss of coverage. If 
there is not a reauthorization bill done by that time, imagine the 
anxiety of all these families in the weeks before Christmas getting a 
letter in the mailbox saying that this CHIP program, which covers 
66,000 kids and 1,100 pregnant women, is about to expire. This will, at 
a minimum, cause a great deal of anxiety and confusion, even if we then 
come back and fix it. But if we don't fix it, obviously, the anxiety 
and confusion becomes much more catastrophic for the families.
  After we send out letters on December 1 telling families that they 
have to prepare for the elimination of this program, enrollment will 
freeze on January 1. No new children can come into the program. By the 
end of January--and this differs in different States--Virginia will 
have insufficient funds to continue the program. There are some States 
that are already experiencing running out of the funds they have for 
the program. Virginia has a little cushion, but that will take us only 
through the end of January if we don't reauthorize.
  Here is something that makes matters worse in Virginia, and I think 
it is the case in most States. Our legislature is a part-time 
legislature. The legislature is not in session. The legislature does 
not come back in until January, and that will make it really difficult. 
We can't find time for solutions before then because the legislature is 
not in session. When the legislature comes back, that would be a lot to 
face in 2 weeks, which is when this program is going to expire.
  Needless to say, the kids who use CHIP in Virginia are in all parts 
of the State. Just to give you some examples, the Hampton Roads area, 
the second largest metropolitan area in the State--Virginia Beach, 
Norfolk, and the Northern Neck--has over 5,000 kids who rely on CHIP. 
In far southwest Virginia, where my wife's family is from--Appalachia--
nearly 6,000 kids rely on CHIP. It is a high poverty area, and in those 
parts of the State where poverty is high, CHIP is used in a very 
important way by families. The Shenandoah Valley, an agricultural area 
in western Virginia, has about 6,400 kids who rely on CHIP. There is 
not a county, there is not a city in Virginia where there isn't a child 
and a pregnant woman who rely on this program.
  On September 18--now to the good part of my talk, the positive words 
from my colleagues--Senators Hatch and Wyden introduced the bipartisan 
Keeping Kids' Insurance Dependable and Secure Act, which is a 
bipartisan compromise in the best traditions of this body, to extend 
the CHIP program for 5 years to give States sufficient time to plan 
their budgets and make sure that families don't face the uncertainty 
related to getting notice letters saying that the program may 
terminate.
  I rise today to urge my colleagues to strongly support bringing this 
bill to the floor and providing certainty to the families and children 
who rely on CHIP. The possibility of all these families getting letters 
on December 1 saying that the program is possibly going to expire is 
just a needless uncertainty, and we should try to avoid that if we can, 
not just in Virginia but in every State.
  My senior Senator, Mr. Warner, is also a strong supporter of the 
program. I will give him some props. When he was Governor of Virginia--
he preceded me as Governor--he was the one who focused on doing a 
better job of enrolling kids in the program. I give him credit for 
that, and I will take credit for my teamwork and for adding dental 
coverage to CHIP. But he was a great leader. He and I have together 
sent a letter to the Senate leader, Mr. McConnell, asking if he would 
bring a bipartisan bill to the floor quickly on behalf of Virginia's 
children.
  This bill was bipartisan in its introduction, and with the number of 
cosponsors and the historic, bipartisan nature of support for this 
program, if we can get a floor vote on this bill, I think we can pass 
it today and send it to the House and do so in a way that we would 
avoid the need to start sending out termination letters to families, 
needlessly increasing their anxiety.
  I will conclude by saying that if we can bring this to the floor, I 
think we can get it passed. It is an urgent issue for children across 
the country--and even more than children in some ways. The children 
aren't wandering around every day thinking about their healthcare, but 
their parents are wondering every day, worrying desperately about their 
healthcare. This would be a bill that would help both children and 
parents.
  I yield the floor.
  I suggest the absence of a quorum."|7

Federal circuit judges. Because of that, it is a good week to talk 
about the critical role the judiciary plays and actually about the 
unique power our Constitution gave the courts to do the job they are 
supposed to do.
  They are to provide a check and balance on the other two coequal 
branches of government--the executive branch and the legislative 
branch. Most importantly, the Federal judiciary provides Americans with 
an avenue with which to seek the rule of law, an avenue to know that 
one is going to be impacted by what the law says and what the 
Constitution says. It is a fundamental right of how we conduct 
ourselves, how we seek justice, how people should be able to make 
decisions about their families and about their businesses and about 
their financial futures as well as their personal futures.
  That is why judges who believe in the rule of law and what the law 
says and what the Constitution says are so important and why it is 
important to have qualified and well-grounded judges--not just people 
who are really good lawyers but people who have an appreciation for how 
important it is that others can absolutely rely on the law and the 
Constitution. Those can be changed. There is a way to change them, but 
the way to change them is seldom on the Federal bench.
  According to the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts, as of this 
morning, there are 148 vacancies on the Federal judiciary. That 
includes two vacancies on the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals. It 
includes the circuit judges of whose nominations we have not yet fully 
complied and approved this week, but there are 148 vacancies--jobs that 
are to be filled for as long as the people are able to serve. That is 
why healthy judges, younger judges, and judges who are well grounded 
can have such an impact for so long. The first major judicial 
accomplishment this year, in terms of the nominating process, was Judge 
Gorsuch, who 29 years from now will be younger than three of the judges 
with whom he is currently serving. These are decisions that will last 
well beyond a Presidency and well beyond the tenure of the Senators who 
will vote to confirm, and we have a chance to do that.
  Of these judicial circuits, the Eighth Circuit is one my State of 
Missouri is in. As a matter of fact, the most recent data shows that 
while there are a handful of States in that circuit, one-third of all 
the cases that had been filed in the Eighth Circuit from September 2015 
to September 2016 had come from our State, and I imagine that number 
will be about the same again this year. Reshaping the judiciary, 
generally, as well as what happens in the Eighth Circuit are important.
  At the start of President Trump's term, 12 percent of all of the 
positions


in the Federal judiciary were vacant. The Congressional Research 
Service found that not since President Clinton took office has a 
President had the constitutional obligation to fill more judicial 
vacancies at the start of his term than President Trump. I, certainly, 
believe he made the right choice when he selected Judge Gorsuch to 
serve on the Court, and I have been enthusiastic about the other judges 
whom he has nominated, including the four we have had a chance to talk 
about and will continue to have a chance to talk about this week.
  I think President Trump will continue to nominate judges who will, 
first of all, pay attention to the Constitution and what it says, who 
will apply the rule of law, and will not legislate from the bench. 
Those three hallmarks of how this Senate should define, and how this 
President has so far defined, what a judge is supposed to do not only 
can happen but can happen at this moment for--or at least as of January 
20--12 percent of the judicial positions, and that number will continue 
to grow as judges, for whatever reason, leave the bench as judges 
decide to take early retirement. If at the end of the 4 years of this 
administration we have filled all of the vacancies that will have 
occurred, we will have filled more than 12 percent of those lifetime 
appointments. So it is really important that the Senate act to confirm 
these nominees and fill as many vacancies as are there to be filled.
  Last month, the Federalist reported: ``Democrats are forcing more 
cloture votes than any early Presidency and demanding the full 30 hours 
of floor time per nominee that the Senate rules allow.''
  Yesterday, at the press stakeout that we had outside of this room, I 
said that the Senate was designed to protect the rights of the 
minority, and that is a good thing. Just the fact that it would take 6 
years to replace the entire Senate means that the country has to stay 
focused on one set of ideas if all of the Senators are going to reflect 
that one set of ideas much longer than the 2-year opportunity to change 
everybody in the House. Also, the understanding that the Senate 
provides that protection for minorities to be heard in a big and 
diverse democracy like we have is a good thing. In the points that we 
were making yesterday, I also said that the protections for the 
minority are always held onto, appreciated, and protected until the 
minority decides to abuse those protections. When that happens, the 
minority always loses the protection.
  What we have had over and over again--47 times this year as compared 
to 1 time with President Obama for nonjudicial appointments, 5 times in 
the entire first Obama year up until this time in October, I believe, 
no times for either President Bush, and 1 time for President Clinton--
is that the minority has taken a judicial nomination or another 
nomination and said we are going to insist on 30 hours of debate 
because the rules allow for 30 hours of debate. Well, the rules allow 
for 30 hours of debate for contentious nominees. The rules allow for 30 
hours of debate when there is really going to be a debate. Last week, 
we had 30 hours of debate on a judge, but 20 minutes were spent talking 
in support of him while zero minutes were spent in opposing him. The 30 
hours that could have been used for other purposes was gone.
  Frankly, I think that was the reason the 30 hours was demanded--so 
the other work of the Senate had to be set aside so we could do the 
equally important work of letting the President put people in vacant 
positions that needed to be filled. That 30 hours will be changed if 
the minority continues to abuse it. It has happened in the entire 
history of the Senate, but that is what happens when you abuse these 
rules that protect you and give you rights. It will happen again here 
if this does not change.
  We see the same thing happening this week. We have had lots of time 
this week--30 hours of debate, a final vote, and Democrats and 
Republicans vote. In fact, regarding the judge I mentioned a minute 
ago, 28 Democrats voted for that judge. There were 30 hours of debate, 
and not a single critical word was spoken in debate about the judge. A 
majority of the Democrats and virtually all of the Republicans voted 
for that judge. That is not an acceptable way to stop the Senate from 
getting to the other work the Senate needs to do. This is not 
basketball without a clock, where they used to effectively play the 
delay game. The delay game got abused, and the clock became part of the 
system. The clock will run faster here, too, if our colleagues do not 
begin to see the importance of what we do here.


                       Nomination of David Stras

  Mr. President, while these nominees have had cloture votes--again, 
President Obama, I think, only had one on a judge in his first year--
there is one nominee, Minnesota Supreme Court Justice David Stras, in 
the Eighth District, which is the district again that Missouri is in, 
who has had his nomination held up. There is a rule sometimes that has 
been used in the Senate--almost always if a judge is being replaced 
that only affects your State--whereby a Senator can say: I am really 
opposed to that. In most of the history of the Senate, that kind of 
hold has been honored. It has not been honored on judges who represent 
another State, many States, or will be a judge in the circuit for many 
States just because they happen to come from your State.
  The American Bar Association has said that Justice Stras is ``well 
qualified.'' It is its very highest rating. He received his bachelor's 
degree, with the highest distinction, from the University of Kansas, 
which is another State in this circuit. He received his MBA from the 
University of Kansas and his law degree from the University of Kansas. 
He clerked on the U.S. Supreme Court before practicing law and teaching 
at the University of Minnesota. Not only was he appointed to fill a 
vacancy on the Supreme Court in Minnesota, but he was elected. In fact, 
he was elected and received more votes than the person who is holding 
his nomination received when he was elected to that job.
  I urge my colleagues to not only support his nomination but to do 
what we need to do to get these nominees to the floor and let everybody 
express their opinion and be given the time needed to do that, not to 
continue to abuse the rules, not to continue to hold these important 
vacancies hostage to getting anything else done because we have 30 
hours of debate in which nobody decides to come and debate.
  By the way, if we want to continue to allow Senators to hold 
nominations in circuits that their States happen to be a part of, in 
the Eighth Circuit, most of the work before that court comes from 
Missouri more than any other State. We would be glad to have an 
additional judge, and there is nothing that would prevent that.
  The right thing to do here is to let the nomination of a well-
qualified person come to the Senate floor and be debated, if there is 
debate to be had, and be voted on and to take one of those significant 
140-plus vacancies on the Federal judiciary and fill it with a person 
who is well qualified, just like this week. In four other circuits, we 
intend to put three women and one man on those courts who will 
hopefully be able to serve long and well and will take their important 
philosophies to the courts with them when they go.
  I yield the floor."|11

  As we heard my colleague from Missouri saying, we have a great 
opportunity this week to confirm four outstanding individuals to the 
Federal circuit courts. These nominees are well-qualified individuals 
who have demonstrated a strong understanding of the proper role that a 
judge plays in our constitutional system.

  I am especially pleased that we are considering three exceptionally 
talented women for the Federal bench. Federal circuit court nominations 
are extremely important. Circuit courts sit directly below the Supreme 
Court in our judicial system. Because the Supreme Court reviews 
relatively few or a smaller number of cases, many times the circuit 
courts have the last word in the majority of those cases, so it is 
essential that we have judges on the circuit court who will treat all 
litigants fairly.
  When I think about what I want in a judge, I think fairness is the 
first thing that comes to mind. We want someone who treats litigants 
fairly, who shows respect for our Constitution, our statutes, and the 
controlling precedents.


We need somebody knowledgeable in the law. That sort of goes without 
saying but certainly is a top attribute of a judge. Every party before 
our Federal courts has the right to expect evenhanded, fair judges and 
fair justice from those judges who are handling their case.
  Each of the four nominees being confirmed this week have a strong 
record and impeccable qualifications. They respect the rule of law. All 
were given a high rating by the nonpartisan American Bar Association.
  Yesterday I was very pleased to support Amy Barrett's confirmation to 
the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit. Despite obstruction by my 
colleagues on the other side, I am pleased that yesterday we confirmed 
Ms. Barrett, but I still have deep concerns about some of the debate 
and some of the questions that were raised about her religious beliefs 
throughout the confirmation process.
  The Constitution clearly states that there can be no religious test 
for any Federal office. The Senate has a responsibility to consider 
qualifications and fitness for office of individuals nominated by the 
President, but that does not include an evaluation of a nominee's 
religious beliefs. Our Constitution fundamentally protects religious 
liberty for all Americans. That principle is deeply rooted in our 
Nation's history and allows individuals of all faiths the freedom to 
exercise their religious beliefs.
  Ms. Barrett's credentials clearly demonstrate her ability to serve on 
the Federal bench, which she will be doing, and I hope future nominees 
are questioned by this body on their record, their qualifications, and 
their jurisprudence, not on their faith.
  Today we confirmed the nomination of Michigan Supreme Court Justice 
Joan Larsen for the Sixth Circuit, a supremely qualified individual. A 
former clerk for Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, she served as a 
Deputy Assistant Attorney General and as a law professor at the 
University of Michigan before joining her State's highest court, the 
supreme court.
  We are now considering the nomination of Colorado Supreme Court 
Justice Allison Eid for the Tenth Circuit. Justice Eid served as 
Colorado's solicitor general and is a law professor at the University 
of Colorado. She clerked for Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas and 
was appointed by Chief Justice John Roberts to serve as a member of the 
advisory committee on Federal appellate rules.
  Finally, we will consider the nomination of Stephanos Bibas to the 
Third Circuit. Mr. Bibas is a law professor at the University of 
Pennsylvania and clerked for Justice Anthony Kennedy after earning 
degrees from Columbia, Oxford, and Yale.
  This is a supremely qualified slate of nominees, as their impressive 
credentials make clear. My colleagues who are familiar with these 
nominees have given praise to these nominees in earnest and honest 
discussion, which very much lends itself to my support. Without 
question, their fitness for the Federal bench is evident.
  The fact that Democrats have been holding up these qualified 
individuals is totally misguided. We heard from Senator Blunt in his 
remarks about the numbers. There are currently 21 circuit court 
vacancies and 120 district court vacancies in the Federal judiciary. 
While the Senate has an important role in examining nominees to fill 
these vacancies, Democrats have required virtually every potential 
judge to go through a time-consuming floor process that is simply not 
sustainable, even when there are no objections raised against the 
individuals. In fact, Democrats have used political tactics to delay 
virtually every one of President Trump's judicial nominees, 
controversial or not.
  Every Senator has the right to vote against a judicial nominee if 
they believe that person to be unfit or unqualified--we all have that 
right--but engaging in a de facto filibuster against virtually every 
judicial nominee is an abuse of the rules, I believe, especially when 
the nominee has overwhelming bipartisan support.
  The American people expect the Senate to confirm well-qualified 
nominees. They also expect us to advance a legislative agenda that will 
improve our economy and our security. By filibustering against 
qualified nominees, Democrats are keeping the Senate from tackling our 
important legislative work.
  Starting with Justice Neil Gorsuch to the nominees being considered 
this week, President Trump has nominated mainstream judges who will 
serve our country for years in the judiciary. I commend the President, 
the chairman, Senator Grassley, and the members of the Judiciary 
Committee for their work in advancing these talented individuals. We 
should confirm these judges and act promptly to fill other judicial 
vacancies.
  I thank the Presiding Officer.
  I yield the floor."|13

the nomination of Colorado Supreme Court Justice Allison Eid. She is 
going to be voted on to serve on the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals. 
She is an eminently qualified and exceptional nominee who has received 
widespread, bipartisan praise and support.
  Justice Eid has spent over a decade on the Colorado Supreme Court. 
Before her appointment, she served as the Colorado State solicitor 
general. In that role, she represented the State before both Federal 
and State courts. She also served as a tenured faculty member at the 
University of Colorado School of Law, where she taught courses in 
constitutional law, legislation, and torts. Justice Eid practiced 
commercial and appellate litigation at Arnold and Porter. At the 
beginning of her legal career, Justice Eid served as a clerk for Judge 
Jerry Smith on the Fifth Circuit and as a law clerk for Supreme Court 
Justice Clarence Thomas.
  Justice Eid was raised by a single mother, whom Eid credits for her 
significant personal and professional achievements. She earned a 
scholarship to Stanford and graduated with distinction and is a member 
of Phi Beta Kappa. Justice Eid received her law degree from the 
University of Chicago, where she graduated with high honors and Order 
of the Coif. She has had an impressive legal career, and she has an 
impressive life story.
  In her long and celebrated tenure on the Colorado Supreme Court, 
Justice Eid has heard roughly 900 cases and written approximately 100 
opinions. In 2008, 75 percent of Colorado voters retained Justice Eid 
to the Colorado Supreme Court.
  Her nomination has also received wide, bipartisan support. As an 
example, Justice Eid's former clerks, who noted that they ``come from a 
diverse set of geographic, economic, cultural and political 
backgrounds,'' wrote a letter to the Judiciary Committee supporting her 
nomination. Judges work closely with their law clerks every day. Law 
clerks understand a judge's deliberative process and approach to the 
law better than anyone. How did these clerks describe Justice Eid? They 
said: ``She never fails to provide her full attention and dedication to 
each individual case, mastering the relevant facts and carefully 
analyzing the law, whether the text of a statute or the word of a 
contract.'' Her law clerks also wrote that she goes ``where the law 
takes her'' and that in their decade of collective experience in over 
900 cases, Justice Eid ``treats each case individually without any 
preconceived notion of desired outcome.''
  The National Native American Bar Association also endorsed Justice 
Eid. In their letter to the committee, they noted that she ``has 
demonstrated deep understanding of Federal Indian law and policy 
matters, as well as significant respect for the tribes as governments. 
Such qualities and experiences are rare among nominees to the federal 
bench.'' They went on to note that ``while we do not expect that 
Justice Eid will agree with tribal interests on every issue, we also 
believe that she is immensely well qualified and we are confident that 
Justice Eid is a mainstream, commonsense Westerner who will rule fairly 
on Indian Country matters.'' That is from the National Native American 
Bar Association. I think ``mainstream, commonsense Westerner'' is the 
perfect way to describe Justice Eid.
  Despite this bipartisan support and her professional achievements, 
all the Democratic members of the Judiciary Committee voted against her 
nomination in committee, and I suspect most of the minority will vote 
against her


confirmation when it comes up. That surprised me. Justice Eid received 
a majority ``well qualified'' rating from the American Bar Association, 
an outside group who evaluates judicial nominees. My colleagues on the 
other side claim that this group's ratings weigh very heavily in their 
decision to support or oppose a judicial nominee. In fact, my 
Democratic colleagues claim that these ratings should carry a great 
deal of weight with Senators, and they argue that the Judiciary 
Committee shouldn't hold hearings on nominees who have not yet received 
ABA ratings.
  This week, we are voting on four circuit court nominees--including 
three women--who received ``well qualified'' ratings from the ABA. The 
American Bar Association rated two of these individuals unanimously 
``well qualified.'' Yet the vast majority of my Democratic colleagues 
voted against the two nominees on whom we have already voted, and I am 
willing to bet that the other two nominees will see similar opposition 
from my Democratic colleagues.
  Why do my Democratic friends profess such admiration for the American 
Bar Association's evaluation process and then vote against nominees who 
received the American Bar Association's ``well qualified'' rating? I 
would like to see them put their money where their mouth is or maybe, 
better yet, their vote where their mouth is. If my colleagues believe 
so strongly in the ABA evaluations, they should start voting for 
nominees who receive ``well qualified'' ratings, but I suspect they 
will not.
  When the Judiciary Committee voted on Justice Eid's nomination, my 
Democratic colleagues really stretched to find reasons to oppose that 
nomination. One of the chief reasons given for opposition to her 
nomination centered on a quote in a Denver Post article that said 
Justice Eid has ``earned a reputation of one of [the Colorado Supreme 
Court's] most conservative members.'' I find that statement to be 
misleading. Of the seven justices on the Colorado Supreme Court, 
Justice Eid is one of only two justices appointed by a Republican 
Governor. To argue that she is somehow extreme just because she was not 
appointed by a Democratic Governor is very unfair.
  Furthermore, the Denver Post published a subsequent article that 
disagreed with this characterization. By contrast, the more recent 
article stated that ``appointment by a Republican or Democrat does not 
always dictate the ideology of the justice. . . . Even categorizing 
justices as either conservative or liberal is generally an error.'' I 
would agree with the Denver Post on this point.
  Justice Eid should not be evaluated by her ideological reputation 
but, rather, by how she approaches issues before her judiciary. That is 
how I have evaluated Justice Eid and other judicial nominees, and that 
is why I strongly support her confirmation today.
  I am very proud to support the nomination of Justice Allison Eid. She 
is the third in a series of distinguished female circuit court nominees 
we have had the opportunity to vote on this week. Her impressive 
experience and numerous accomplishments speak to her qualifications for 
this role. I commend the President for nominating these outstanding and 
accomplished women to our circuit courts. Justice Eid is an exceptional 
nominee, and her record overwhelmingly supports her nomination. As a 
result, I will support her confirmation tomorrow, and I urge all of my 
colleagues to do the same.
  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum."|15

sterling nominees for our Nation's circuit courts of appeals. These are 
our intermediate appellate courts in the country, one step above the 
trial courts where cases are tried and one step below the Supreme Court 
of the United States.
  What most people don't realize is that the Supreme Court only decides 
roughly 80 cases a year. In other words, there is no guarantee that if 
your case is tried in the trial court, it will go beyond the circuit 
court of appeals. So in many instances, our circuit courts are the 
``supreme court,'' or the court of last resort. These sterling nominees 
that the President has nominated include Professor Amy Barrett, who 
yesterday was confirmed to the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals by a 
bipartisan vote of 55 to 43. For some reason, our friends across the 
aisle have decided it is to their advantage to inexplicably drag out 
the clock against a really accomplished scholar--and to boot, a mother 
of seven--but, of course, to no avail.
  What is worse is our colleagues across the aisle have seemed to have 
forgotten some of their own priorities when it comes to judges. For 
example, the senior Senator from Minnesota has said in the past: ``It 
is time to get women on the bench.'' Well, we just did that yesterday, 
and we are going to do it again. ``They should get an up-or-down vote . 
. . that is what women deserve.'' I would say that is what the 
President's nominees--whether they be women or men--deserve, but, 
unfortunately, that hasn't always been the case.
  There is still time, however, for our Democratic colleagues to honor 
their previous statements and to put more women on the circuit courts 
without needlessly stringing them along with unnecessary delays.
  Joan Larsen was the first. She was confirmed earlier today. She 
fulfills the desire of the senior Senator from Vermont to ``confirm 
women practicing at the pinnacle of the legal profession.''
  That is certainly where Joan Larsen works. She has been a justice on 
the Michigan Supreme Court and was nominated to the Sixth Circuit, 
which handles Federal appeals from Michigan, Kentucky, Ohio, and 
Tennessee. Justice Larsen graduated first in her class from 
Northwestern University's law school. She then clerked for the 
prestigious DC Circuit Court of Appeals, right here in Washington, DC. 
She then went on to serve as a law clerk to Justice Antonin Scalia of 
the U.S. Supreme Court.
  Since then, she has worked in public service at the Office of Legal 
Counsel at the Department of Justice during the George W. Bush 
administration and has taught at the University of Michigan Law School.
  Both of our Democratic colleagues from Michigan have returned their 
blue slips, which is the piece of paper which says they are OK with the 
nomination going forward, signaling their approval. Given her 
credentials, my question would be, How could they not?
  Ms. Larsen will make an excellent judge. She already has been, but 
she will make an excellent addition to the circuit court of appeals, 
and I am glad we have now confirmed her.
  Another nominee is on the way. Justice Allison Eid of the Colorado 
Supreme Court has been nominated to the Tenth Circuit post formerly 
held by Justice Neil Gorsuch, who was recently confirmed to the U.S. 
Supreme Court. The Tenth Circuit sits in Denver and includes Colorado, 
New Mexico, Kansas, Oklahoma, Utah, and Wyoming.
  As in the case of Professor Barrett and Justice Larsen, Allison Eid 
is exceptional in every respect. She attended Stanford University and 
the University of Chicago Law School, where she was elected to the 
Order of the Coif and graduated with high honors. She clerked for the 
Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans and then went on to clerk 
for Justice Clarence Thomas on the U.S. Supreme Court.
  As with Justice Larsen, Justice Eid has received the blue slips from 
both of her home State Senators, which means they are willing to let 
this confirmation go forward. So I look forward to her quick 
confirmation.
  Finally, the fourth judge who will be confirmed this week is 
professor Stephanos Bibas, who teaches at the University of 
Pennsylvania Law School. He has been nominated for the Third Circuit 
Court of Appeals, which covers Delaware, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania. 
Stephanos Bibas was educated at Columbia, Oxford, and Yale Law School. 
He, likewise, clerked for the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals and then 
went on to clerk for Justice Anthony Kennedy on the U.S. Supreme Court. 
He has worked both in private practice and as a prosecutor. Now he


has distinguished himself as an academic, teaching and publishing in 
the realm of criminal law and procedure.
  In their ringing endorsement of his nomination, a diverse group of 
more than 100 law professors noted Professor Bibas's ``fair-mindedness, 
conscientiousness, and personal integrity.'' Those are the sort of 
qualities we should all want in a circuit court judge.
  We are going to confirm Stephanos Bibas and the other nominees I 
mentioned, no matter how long it takes, this week. The majority leader 
has put our friends across the aisle on notice, and there is nothing 
they can do to stop those confirmation votes before we call it a week.
  Once again, the administration has demonstrated its skill at picking 
bright nominees for the right reasons. This week's nominees will read 
the law faithfully. They will honestly interpret its text, and they 
will apply it to cases with a sense of humility no matter what their 
preferred outcome might be.
  I appreciate President Trump, Leader McConnell, and the chairman of 
the Senate Judiciary Committee, Senator Chuck Grassley, for the hard 
work in bringing these nominees to the floor. Now let's get them on the 
Federal bench.


                               Tax Reform

  Mr. President, the other issue I wish to bring up in my remarks today 
is tax reform, because we all know that the House of Representatives 
will release the Ways and Means Committee's beginning bill for tax 
reform--something we have promised for a long time and that the country 
is anxiously awaiting.
  This will be the culmination of months--if not years--of hard work, 
of meetings, white papers, listening sessions, and the like so that we 
can deliver on our shared goal of a simpler, fairer tax system that 
boosts jobs and puts more money in the pockets of every American. Those 
are our goals.
  We know that many hard-working Americans have had a rough time in 
recent years. Sending their kids to college and securing retirement 
seems to be harder and increasingly out of reach for some of my 
constituents back in Texas and people around the country. I hear about 
their concerns and their anxieties--economic anxieties--every time I go 
home. It is not acceptable that 50 percent of Americans are finding 
themselves living from paycheck to paycheck and that a third of voters 
are one trip to the mechanic shop away from a household financial 
crisis.
  Last week, several of my colleagues and I sat down with the 
President--we were members of a bipartisan group of the Senate Finance 
Committee--and discussed our objectives in achieving meaningful and 
lasting changes to our Tax Code. The President agreed that we should 
cut taxes for hard-working Americans and that we should nearly double 
the standard deduction, which reduces the number of people who will 
have to itemize deductions on their tax return, thus, making compliance 
with the Tax Code much simpler and cheaper. We agreed that we would 
significantly increase the child tax credit and reduce taxes on 
businesses and job creators.
  This last objective--reducing taxes on businesses and job creators--
deserves a little bit more discussion.
  Ireland represents an interesting point of comparison for the United 
States. We have the highest tax rate in the world--35 percent for 
businesses that do business all around the globe. Ireland has a 
corporate rate of 12.5 percent. That is 35 percent to 12.5 percent. 
Because of that, it has become a haven for large American companies, 
especially in the high-tech sector.
  Ireland has since ended its so-called ``double Irish'' tax scheme, 
which allowed it to benefit from taxes on income that should have been 
taxed in the United States. In other words, there is some rivalry and 
competition when businesses do business worldwide as to where their 
profits will be taxed. We want to make sure that those profits are 
taxed in the United States and not in countries abroad, where we would 
enjoy no benefit from.
  This example illustrates what happens when we keep our tax rate so 
high. Sadly, companies leave. They go elsewhere, because they know that 
the difference between a 35-percent tax rate and a 12.5-percent tax 
rate in Ireland may be the difference between making a profit for your 
shareholders--whether it is the teachers retirement system or the 
firefighters pension fund--or ending up in the red and not making a 
profit at all. Savvy companies will leave, and they will go elsewhere. 
They know to create new entities and search the globe for better rates. 
It is really a matter of their competitiveness in a global economy.
  Of course, when they do this, it is legal. It is rational because 
they want the best deal they can get for their shareholders. They also 
want to make sure they can achieve a profit for their shareholders and 
not a loss, frankly, due to the differential in tax rates.
  When companies dodge U.S. taxes, it means we here in the United 
States miss out on revenue that we would otherwise reap. One thing is 
for sure. With $20 trillion in debt, we want to make sure that our Tax 
Code is fair and simple and is competitive and will help us grow our 
economy in a way that will help us pay down those deficits and that 
debt.
  Now, our Democratic friends have been known to demagogue this issue a 
little bit, saying: Who wants to cut these corporate tax rates 
overseas? Corporations shouldn't get a tax cut, even though they know 
what the facts are.
  Well, they should simply listen to people like Barack Obama. In 2011 
he was speaking to a joint session of Congress and called on 
Republicans and Democrats alike to lower the U.S. corporate tax rate 
because he knew--and he was right--that this was hurting our global 
competitiveness in a global economy and that companies, out of sheer 
self-interest, were keeping the profits they had earned overseas rather 
than bringing them back and suffering from double taxation, meaning 
that workers here in the United States didn't get the benefit of that 
infusion of extra cash in their paycheck, and the investment that 
should occur here in the United States was occurring overseas strictly 
because of our Tax Code.
  My colleague, the senior Senator from Oregon, described corporate 
inversions. That is what happens when an American company shifts its 
legal address to a foreign country, such as Ireland, for tax purposes. 
He called it a ``contagion'' that has affected the Tax Code with ``the 
chronic diseases of loopholes and inefficiency.'' He went on to call 
the Tax Code an ``anti-competitive mess.'' He is right.
  The senior Senators from Maryland and Ohio have also made similar 
statements in past years.
  We all realize that simplifying our Tax Code will reduce tax 
compliance costs, which currently run for small business owners at 
around $19 billion a year. Our Tax Code has simply gotten to be too 
complex and too convoluted for honest, law-abiding small business 
owners to do it on their own. So they have to hire somebody else to 
help them sort it out.
  The less money that a small business pays in tax compliance is the 
more they can spend on their employees or on expanding their business 
or on investing in new equipment or simply giving their workers a pay 
raise. Let's give them the relief that they need. Let's reduce the 
corporate rate, as President Obama and our colleagues on the other side 
used to argue for. With our proposals, we can also get moving on fixing 
the rest of the Tax Code to let the hard-working people of Texas and 
American families keep more of what they earn, improve their standard 
of living in the process, and to make our Tax Code more competitive in 
a global economy so that businesses that operate internationally will 
be incentivized to bring that money back here to the United States to 
make and manufacture products that are stamped ``Made in America'' and 
to improve the wages and quality of life and income of American 
workers. It just strikes me as a no-brainer, and that is exactly what 
we are going to set out to accomplish to.
  I suggest the absence of a quorum."|19

                          Freedom to Negotiate

  Labor unions and strong labor laws have helped build the middle class 
in America and protect the rights of workers for generations.
  In the 1970s, union participation was around 30 percent, and it was a 
golden era for the American middle class. Wages went up. Families had 
benefits and vacations. Parents could pay for college. They could put 
food on the table and have money left over. The vast, thriving middle 
class was built on the blood and sweat of labor unions and those who 
organized the labor unions, often at their physical peril, back in the 
thirties.
  Unfortunately, over the last few decades, union membership has 
declined and, along with it, middle-class wages and opportunities. In 
the seventies, union membership was near 30 percent, but it had fallen 
to just 11 percent of all workers by 2014. That decline is mostly 
because the union movement and, concurrently, the middle class, with 
which it is allied, have been under attack from big corporate special 
interests and the conservative movement for the better part of the last 
three decades. It is well funded by a small group of very rich and, I 
might say, greedy people, and it is patient.
  Their goal is to, by any means necessary--Congress, the courts, 
whatever--break up existing unions and prevent new unions from forming. 
They will pursue any avenue in order to disrupt the ability of workers 
to organize and collectively bargain for a fair share of the profits 
they create so that they can make an extra buck.
  These forces will do whatever it takes to keep rigging the system in 
their favor, like asking the Supreme Court to rule on Janus v. AFSCME, 
a case backed by the Koch brothers--$40 billion each, maybe more; 
plenty of money--but they hate giving any money to workers. And there 
is no record evidence of a single lower court ruling in its favor.
  If anyone doubts the politicization of the Supreme Court, just look 
at their being willing to hear this case twice, which comes with a 
crazy legal theory that a First Amendment basis should be used to 
destroy collective bargaining. It is merely designed to eliminate the 
freedom of people to come together in unions. If the Supreme Court 
endorses the arguments of Janus, it will be a dark day for the American 
worker.
  Chief Justice Roberts, who said he would be fair and call balls and 
strikes, in my view, has lost all pretence of fairness. He wants to 
keep the Court nonpolitical, but he keeps pushing cases like this. 
Since his confirmation, under Chief Justice Roberts, the Court has 
methodically moved in a pro-corporate direction in its constantly and 
consistently siding with the big corporate interests over the interests 
of workers. Already, it has been the most pro-corporate Court since 
World War II. A decision in favor of Janus will be a shameful capstone 
on that already disgraceful record.
  I would say to all of those wealthy people who have plenty of money 
and to all of those corporate executives who get paid in the tens of 
millions, who are desperate to take money away from middle-class people 
whose incomes are declining, that you are creating an anger and a 
sourness in America that is hurting our country in so many different 
ways.
  American workers deserve a better deal, and Democrats are going to 
offer it. We are calling it freedom to negotiate. We are offering the 
middle class, and those who are struggling to get there, a better deal 
by taking on companies that undermine unions and underpay their 
workers, and beginning to unwind a rigged system that threatens every 
worker's freedom to negotiate with their employer.
  Our plan would, among other things, strengthen penalties on predatory 
corporations that violate workers' rights; ban State right-to-work laws 
that undermine worker freedoms to join together and negotiate; 
strengthen a worker's right to strike for essential workplace 
improvements; and provide millions of public employees--State, local, 
and Federal--with the freedom to join a union and collectively bargain 
with their employers.
  Over the past century, labor unions have fought to stitch into the 
fabric of our economy a basic sense of fairness for workers. Each 
worker left on his or her own has no power against the big corporate 
interests that employ them, but together unions and workers who unite 
in unions can have some say.
  No one taught me better about the lack of fairness than a 32BJ worker 
I met several years ago at the JFK International Airport, who was named 
Shareeka Elliot. When I first met Shareeka, she was a mother of two 
children who was struggling to make ends meet. She was working the 
graveyard shift cleaning the terminals at JFK and serving hamburgers at 
McDonald's during the day. She was forced to rely on public assistance 
since she had gotten so little in wages from those jobs. She lived in a 
house with six other family members to be able to pay the rent. She was 
not a freeloader. She was working two jobs, but she got minimum wage 
and could hardly support herself. She barely saw her children and spent 
most of her free time in getting to this job--this poorly paid, minimum 
wage job. She had to take a bus for 2 hours from East New York to the 
JFK International Airport.
  She was not angry, by the way, as she was a churchgoing lady. She had 
faith in God to provide, but she suffered so.
  By the way, 30 years ago, if you had cleaned bathrooms at an airport, 
you would have been employed by the airlines or by the terminal. But 
because these companies have learned to farm out the labor to 
subsidiaries, to franchises, and to other corporations that have no 
accountability, now cleaning those toilets is a minimum wage job.
  Over the last 4 years, though, I have seen Shareeka and her coworkers 
start to rebuild their dreams. She said to me: Senator, if I only could 
get minimum wage, I might be able to take my kids out to a restaurant--
I never could--or buy them toys for Christmas. I never could do that.
  Shareeka joined the union, and they fought for a $15 minimum wage. In 
some parts of the country, that may seem like a lot of money. In New 
York City, I can tell you that it does not go that far. Costs are 
higher. Shareeka was able to quit her second job and spend time with 
her daughters, like all parents want to do. Shareeka and her coworkers 
won a union contract, and now they are able to gain the tools they 
needed to protect themselves and do their work in a safer environment.
  Shareeka is a metaphor for ``American workers,'' so many of whom have 
lost good-paying jobs that have gone overseas or that have been closed 
due to automation. When they organize in these new types of jobs, they 
can get the kinds of wages people used to get in the jobs that have 
gone away.
  It is pretty simple: When workers have the freedom to negotiate with 
their employers, they have safer working conditions, better wages, and 
fairer overtime and leave policies. Shareeka's story is a testament to 
that fact.
  Our better deal, the freedom to negotiate, will do for so many 
Americans what Shareeka's union did for her in New York. It will turn 
things around for our country. Maybe middle-class wages will start 
going up, and maybe people will start having faith in the future again. 
We Democrats--hopefully, maybe, joined by a few courageous 
Republicans--are going to fight to get it done.
  I yield the floor.

Brown for leading the effort on the floor to speak out against the 
latest attacks on union rights that are in front of the Supreme Court 
right now. I am very proud to join him to highlight the contributions 
unions have made to our middle class, to the economy, and to our 
country. I want to express my commitment to stand up against any 
attempts to undermine workers' rights to join a union and bargain 
collectively.


  Since day one, President Trump has broken his campaign promise, which 
was to put our workers first, by rolling back worker protections and 
putting corporations and billionaires ahead of our working families, 
and now we are seeing corporate special interests doubling down on 
their attempts to undermine the rights of workers to band together. So 
it is critical now more than ever that we are committed to protecting 
our workers and their ability to advocate for safe working conditions, 
better wages, and a secure retirement.
  Unions helped create the middle class in this country and helped a 
lot of our families in the last century become financially secure. But 
over the last few decades, as workers' bargaining power and union 
density have declined, we as a country have seen a decline in the 
middle class and a rise in income inequality in this country. As we all 
know, too many families today are struggling to make ends meet. 
Meanwhile, corporations' profits are at an alltime high.
  I will continue to fight back against any attempts by this 
administration and by special interests to rig the rules against the 
people who go to work every day. I will keep fighting for policies that 
will help families save just a little more in their bank account, 
whether it includes raising the minimum wage or fighting for equal pay 
for equal work or strengthening our workers' rights to seek out and 
join a union and bargain collectively. I urge all of our colleagues who 
want to help working families to get ahead to join me in that effort.
  Thank you, Mr. President.
  I yield the floor.

working families and how we can empower American workers to obtain good 
jobs, to secure a safe retirement after a lifetime of hard work, and to 
give them the freedom to join together to negotiate for better pay and 
safer working conditions.
  Unions in the United States are important for our families and for 
our Nation's economy. Organized labor is one of the greatest forces 
driving the middle class, which is especially important for our 
veterans and members of the military. Union jobs help provide our 
servicemembers and veterans with the economic opportunities that they 
have earned. Union jobs help working moms and dads put food on the 
table, and union jobs help power the engine of our economy--our middle 
class. That is why I am working every day to protect the rights of 
working people and why I stand shoulder to shoulder with organized 
labor.
  We must work together to combat the assault on the protections that 
workers have fought so hard to secure. It is more important than ever 
that we here in Washington work to expand economic opportunity for 
hard-working Americans, many of whom come from a union home. That means 
passing labor law reform to make it easier, not harder to join a union. 
That also means expanding the use of project labor agreements for major 
construction projects and opposing efforts to repeal prevailing wage 
laws. It also means defending the Davis-Bacon Act. The Federal 
Government can and should be a model employer that encourages companies 
to pay fair wages.
  It is important to note the great progress that collective bargaining 
is making for all people. More families today have two working parents 
than ever before, and women's growing role in our unions have increased 
to nearly half of the labor workforce. In Illinois alone, 44 percent of 
union workers are women. The labor movement, which had a pivotal role 
in creating national minimum wage, the 40-hour workweek, overtime pay, 
and standards for workplace health and safety, is now also impacting 
women workers and their families in a significant way.
  The collective voice that working Americans have is responsible for 
improving sick leave and paid family leave policies at the State and 
local levels. These efforts can also lead to reducing our Nation's 
long-lasting wage gaps between gender and race. Labor unions tend to 
raise wages and improve benefits for all represented workers, 
especially for women, and women of all major racial and ethnic groups 
experience a wage advantage when they are in a union. There is still a 
long way to go in the wage gap fight, but unions are leading the way to 
make those gaps smaller.
  Unfortunately, organized labor is under attack. In Illinois, the 
anti-union surge is on the rise. Nationwide, so-called right-to-work 
efforts are growing. We need to be clear on one thing: These laws do 
absolutely nothing to strengthen workers' rights, despite their 
misleading names and rhetoric.
  Make no mistake, opponents of organized labor are well funded and 
relentless in advancing union-busting campaigns. We must work together 
and challenge these growing dangers to America's middle class.
  The U.S. Supreme Court will soon decide a case that could determine 
the future of American unions. A slim majority of conservative Justices 
may hand down an anti-worker decision that would dramatically undo 
existing precedent and sabotage the ability of unions to effectively 
represent hard-working, everyday Americans. Workers should not be able 
to reap all the benefits of union negotiations while refusing to pay 
dues that made those efforts possible. Make no mistake, a decision 
sanctioning this practice would strip away freedom from millions of 
Americans. It would steal their freedom to join together to bargain for 
better wages, it would steal their freedom to join together to insist 
on worker protections, and, ultimately, it would betray middle-class 
America, which relies on organizing to effectively negotiate with 
powerful corporations.
  Another way we can support our union workers is by making a serious 
investment in our Nation's infrastructure, which leads to more good-
paying jobs and greater economic opportunity for working families. 
Improving our Nation's infrastructure is really just common sense. That 
is why I introduced a bill, which was passed into law, to cut redtape 
and reduce delays on construction projects in Illinois and our 
surrounding States. Upgrading our transportation systems will help 
Illinoisans and all Americans who depend on our roads and transit 
systems to get to work every day, as well as businesses that need our 
airports, highways, and our freight network to ship their products.
  I am working each day to support our hard-working, middle-class 
families. Through organizing, unions have become champions for working 
families both in and out of the Federal Government.
  I thank our union representatives for all the work they do for our 
families, our communities, and our Nation.
  Thank you."|33

groups actually stole a Supreme Court seat and handed it over to their 
handpicked choice, Neil Gorsuch. Now those powerful corporate groups 
are about to use that seat to deal a devastating blow to hard-working 
teachers, firefighters, nurses, and police all across this country.
  On September 28, the Supreme Court announced that it would hear a 
case called Janus v. AFSCME Council 31. AFSCME 31 is a union 
representing public sector workers in Illinois. This case will 
determine whether the public sector unions that represent teachers, 
nurses, firefighters, and police officers in States and cities across 
the country can collect fees from all the employees in the workplaces 
they represent.
  Many expect that Justice Gorsuch will deliver the deciding vote in 
that case, that he will force unions to represent employees who do not 
pay dues and, in doing so, cut off sustainable funding for public union 
organizing.
  Judges are supposed to be impartial, but there is no reason to expect 
that Justice Gorsuch will be impartial in this case. On the afternoon 
of September 28--the very same day that the Supreme Court announced 
that it would hear the Janus case--Justice Gorsuch attended a luncheon 
at the


Trump International Hotel. And he didn't just attend an event at a 
hotel that makes money for the President. Nope. He gave the keynote 
speech for a rightwing group funded by one of the Koch brothers and by 
the Bradley Foundation--billionaires and wealthy donors who are pumping 
money into the people behind the Janus case.
  It is no surprise that these rich guys want to break the backs of 
unions. After all, unions speak up, unions fight back, and unions call 
out billionaires who rig the system to favor themselves and to leave 
everyone else in the dirt.
  What is at stake in the Janus case is basic freedom--the freedom to 
build something strong and valuable, the freedom to have a real voice 
to speak out, the freedom to build a future that doesn't hang by a 
thread at the whim of a billionaire. And just as the Supreme Court 
decides to take up a decision that puts the freedom of millions of 
working people in jeopardy, Justice Gorsuch shows up as the star 
attraction for a billionaire-sponsored outing to celebrate an 
organization that is sponsoring an operation to put workers' freedom on 
the chopping block.
  With this kind of brazen disregard for fairness and impartiality, it 
is no wonder that Gallup Polls have found that fewer than half of all 
Americans approve of the way the Supreme Court is now handling its job. 
In a shameless decision to abandon even the appearance of neutrality, 
Justice Gorsuch makes it clear that he is on the attack against 
American unions and American workers.
  In the Trump administration, workers have been under repeated attack. 
Since taking office, President Trump has signed several laws sent to 
him by the Republican Congress, laws that directly undermine the wages, 
benefits, health and safety of American workers. In just 10 months, 
they have rolled back rules designed to make sure that Federal 
contractors don't cheat their workers out of hard-earned wages. They 
have delayed safety standards that keep workers from being exposed to 
lethal, carcinogenic materials. They have given shady financial 
advisers more time to cheat hard-working Americans out of billions of 
dollars in retirement savings, and the list goes on.
  This is a democracy, and in a democracy, the government in Washington 
is supposed to work for the people who sent us here. So why is it that 
the Federal Government seems to be working against the interests of 150 
million Americans who work for a living? Well, there is one reason--
money.
  Money slithers through Washington like a snake. Its influence is 
everywhere. There are obvious ways that we know about--the campaign 
contributions from giant corporations and their armies of lawyers and 
lobbyists--but it is also the think tanks and the bought-and-paid-for 
experts who are funded by shadowy money, whose point of view seems 
always to help the rich and powerful get richer and more powerful.
  Powerful interests invested vast sums of money in electing President 
Trump, and with each of his anti-worker actions, their investments are 
paying off. Powerful interests also spent vast sums of money to push 
Federal judges who will tilt our courts even further in favor of 
billionaires and big businesses.
  They did it when they spent millions of dollars to hold open a 
Supreme Court seat for over a year. They did it when they spent 
millions more to promote Neil Gorsuch to fill that seat. Now that the 
Court is poised to deliver a massive blow to public sector unions and 
workers, their investment is paying off big time.
  The stakes here couldn't be higher. Millions of teachers, nurses, 
firefighters, and police officers are looking to the Court for a fair 
hearing of the case. They are holding out hope that their freedom to 
come together and to stand up for themselves in the workplace, their 
freedom to fight for higher wages, their freedom to fight for more 
generous benefits, and their freedom to fight for a better future for 
themselves and their children will be preserved.
  Unless we make real change, working people are just going to get 
kicked again and again, and we can make change. We can make the change 
right here in Washington. We can stand up and fight for our democracy, 
and we can start by demanding that everyone in our government is 
accountable, including the President of the United States and the 
Supreme Court of the United States.
  Thank you, Mr. President.

that nonunion public workers who benefit from the work conducted by a 
union to negotiate contracts that they benefit from should have to pay 
a fee to cover costs associated with this work. If all workers benefit, 
it is only right that everyone contributes a fair-share fee.
  However, in recent years, there has been a well-funded effort by 
special interest groups backed by corporate billionaires to dismantle 
unions and silence the voice of workers. There have been a number of 
attempts to overturn the 1977 decision in Abood v. Detroit Board of 
Education. Other efforts have targeted State legislatures where they 
have had success in many States. In other States like Pennsylvania, 
these efforts were blocked.
  Workers already have the right to decide whether to join a union. 
They have the right to decide. It is common sense that if these workers 
benefit from the higher wages and better working conditions that result 
from contract negotiations undertaken by the union, that those workers 
should have to chip in for the cost of these negotiations. That is just 
fair. These negotiations get results and they benefit workers. They 
benefit workers who are in the union and benefit workers who are not in 
the union.
  The right to bargain collectively has been an integral part of 
raising income and growing the middle class over the course of the last 
century. Being able to organize and bargain collectively allows workers 
to demand higher wages and salaries and of course boost their incomes. 
These workers have more money to provide for their families, to 
increase consumption, which in turn increases both production and 
employment. Putting more money in the hands of workers is good for 
workers and for the country.
  Over the last several decades, we have seen the balance of power 
across our Nation tilt more and more in favor of the wealthy and the 
largest corporate interests at the expense of working Americans.
  The Supreme Court has not been immune from this trend. Under Chief 
Justice Roberts, the Court has become an ever more reliable ally for 
big corporations. A major study published in the Minnesota Law Review 
in 2013 found that the four conservative Justices currently sitting on 
the Court--Justices Alito, Roberts, Thomas, and Kennedy--are among the 
six most business-friendly Supreme Court Justices since 1946. So four 
of the six most business-friendly are serving on the Court at the same 
time.
  A review by the Constitutional Accountability Center--which is an 
ongoing review and is updated with every case the Supreme Court 
decides--shows the consequences of the Court's corporate tilt, finding 
that the chamber of commerce has had a success rate of 70 percent in 
cases before the Roberts' Court--a significant increase over previous 
courts.
  These are all critical cases. These are cases of critical importance 
to everyday Americans. These are cases involving, for example, rules 
for consumer contracts, challenges to regulations ensuring fair pay and 
labor standards, attempts by consumers to hold companies accountable 
for product safety, and much more.
  Well-funded corporate special interests do not have the best 
interests of working families at heart. They are pushing these efforts 
to reduce their bottom line by reducing the incomes of working 
families.
  That is why we are standing today to make sure that the voice of 
working Pennsylvanians and Americans are heard. To increase incomes and 
strengthen the middle class, we need to


stop the assault on workers and labor unions, whether it happens in 
Congress or in State legislatures or, indeed, in the U.S. Supreme 
Court.

America's workers--the men and women who build our cars and our homes, 
who move American-made products across oceans, lakes, and highways, who 
teach our children every school day, who take care of our families when 
they get sick, and who keep us safe in our communities. I have seen 
firsthand the importance of unions, both in my home State, where I grew 
up, and across the country.
  This is deeply personal for me. My father Herb was a public school 
teacher and an active member of the Michigan Education Association. My 
father-in-law Raul was a proud member--and continues to be a proud 
member--of the United Auto Workers.
  My mother Madeleine found economic opportunity as a nurse's aide. As 
part of providing the best care possible to patients, she fought for a 
better workplace for her colleagues, and then she went on to help 
organize her workplace. She later served as a union steward with the 
SEIU.
  My parents raised me in a middle-class, union household. They 
instilled in me the need, both, to stand up for rights and to never 
take those rights for granted.
  Standing together for fair wages, safer workplaces, and better hours, 
Michigan's strong labor movement built the American manufacturing 
sector and a middle class that made the United States a global economic 
powerhouse.
  My parents and their fellow union members embraced the union values 
that built Michigan: the ability to earn a good life where you grow up, 
hard work, fairness, and looking out for your neighbor--whether it is 
your neighbor on the assembly line or in your neighborhood. These are 
not just union values. These are American values, and I learned to 
cherish them at a very young age. Now, I am sorry to say, these values 
are under attack, and I can't help but to take it personally.
  This year we have seen new and unprecedented attempts to undermine 
our Nation's workers and their ability to collectively bargain. Earlier 
this year, my Republican colleagues passed legislation to repeal 
Federal rules that simply required businesses to disclose previous 
workplace safety and fair pay violations before they could contract 
with the Federal Government. The reason for this rule was fairly 
straightforward: We should not be sending taxpayer dollars to employers 
that can't keep their employees safe or that cheat them out of their 
hard-earned dollars. Yet Republicans repealed the rule.
  Now, across the country, we are seeing a wave of so-called right-to-
work legislation, which in practice means you can work more hours for 
less pay. In Michigan we are seeing the impact of this misguided 
legislation.
  Supporters of these policies told us that wages and job growth would 
increase if Michigan just passed laws to crack down on union 
membership. Well, Michigan has the law, but workers and their families 
aren't seeing any of the promised benefits.
  In the years since passage of the law, the economic data clearly 
shows that, yes, corporate profits are up but not wages. In fact, when 
comparing Michigan to States that haven't attacked union membership, 
studies suggest that we have fallen behind pro-union States when it 
comes to worker pay.
  I am deeply concerned by the ongoing efforts to implement national 
anti-union laws, including the Janus v. AFSCME case that the U.S. 
Supreme Court will rule on in the very near future. A negative ruling 
in this case would be a huge loss for American workers and would 
undermine the right to collectively bargain.
  We should be doing everything we can to support American workers and 
their right to fight for better working conditions, fair pay, and the 
ability to care for their families. Instead of attacking our Nation's 
labor unions, we should be celebrating them.
  For generations, unions have helped America build the world's most 
robust middle class and a powerful economy, second to no other nation. 
Unions have not only helped workers to take home more pay and have a 
safe place to work, but they have also built communities. Unions teach 
their members valuable skills and help them earn a secure retirement 
and have quality healthcare.
  Big corporations are not trying to undermine unions because they are 
looking out for newly hired employees. They are fighting against unions 
because of what unions stand for--the right to collectively bargain for 
better pay, increased workplace safety, hard-earned retirement 
benefits, and quality healthcare.
  I ask my colleagues to take a moment to consider our history and the 
hard-working men and women who built this great Nation of ours. Union 
members are our neighbors, our firefighters, our police officers, our 
teachers, our nurses, our brothers and sisters, our moms, and our dads. 
They build our cars, our homes, and our infrastructure.
  I urge all of my colleagues to honor these men and women by opposing 
any and all efforts to expand harmful policies designed to undermine 
American workers.

me on the floor today to stand with American workers. We organized a 
group of close to a dozen Senators who have heartfelt and strong views 
about the dignity of work, who understand so well that workers are 
working harder and smarter but earn less and less money, in spite of 
their hard work, in spite of their commitment.
  I have been joined on the floor already by Senator Schumer from New 
York, Senator Murray from Washington State, Senator Duckworth from 
Illinois, Senator Warren of Massachusetts, Senator Casey from 
Pennsylvania, and Senator Peters from Michigan, and speaking after I 
speak will be Senator Whitehouse of Rhode Island and Senator Merkley of 
Oregon and Senator Durbin of Illinois. I thank them for standing up for 
American workers.
  People in Ohio and around the country, as I said, work harder, and 
they work longer than ever, but they have less and less to show for it. 
Over the last 40 years, GDP has gone up, corporate profits have gone 
up, executives' salaries have gone up all because of the productivity 
of American workers. Again, GDP goes up, corporate profits go up, 
executive salaries explode upward. Workers are more productive, but 
workers have not shared in the economic growth they have created. Hard 
work just doesn't pay off like it did a generation ago.
  It is no coincidence that over that same timeframe, we have seen 
attack after attack after attack on the labor movement. Corporate 
special interests have spent decades stripping workers of their freedom 
to organize for fair wages and for benefits. The case the Supreme Court 
just agreed to take up, Janus v. AFSCME, is yet another attempt to chip 
away at workers' power in the workplace.
  These are public service workers. These are public schoolteachers, 
librarians, police officers, school nurses, firefighters, and postal 
workers. They are not looking to get rich in these jobs. They are just 
looking to be paid what they earn, the same as any other worker in this 
country.
  Make no mistake, an attack on public sector unions is an attack on 
all unions. An attack on unions is an attack on all workers, whether 
they belong to a union or not, and I mean all workers, whether you 
punch a timeclock or whether you fill out a timesheet or swipe a badge, 
whether you make a salary or earn tips, whether you are on payroll, a 
contract worker,


a temp, working behind a desk, cutting hair, working on a factory 
floor, or working behind a restaurant counter. I mean all workers.
  The fact is, all workers across this country--as profits go up, as 
GDP goes up, as executive compensation goes up, as workers get more 
productive, all workers across this country are feeling squeezed. Work 
doesn't pay off the way it used to.
  We have seen what happens when workers have no power in the 
workplace. Increasingly, corporations view American workers as a cost 
to be minimized instead of a valuable asset in which to invest.
  Look at the news we got last month. This piece of news, when I 
mention this to some of my colleagues, when I mention it around the 
State of Ohio, peoples' mouths drop. The Bank of America, Merrill Lynch 
downgraded the fast food restaurant Chipotle because the company pays 
its workers too much.
  Remember what happened with American Airlines a few months ago. 
American Airlines announced it was doing a companywide pay increase, 
and the stock market punished them by knocking their stock down. 
Imagine that. So when a company wants to do the right thing, Wall 
Street says: No, you are not going to do the right thing. Wall Street 
is saying: We want all the money. Don't give any of this money to 
workers--workers making $10 or $12 or $15 an hour. Think about that. 
Wall Street and Merrill Lynch didn't say they paid their workers too 
little, they paid their workers too much. That is why the labor 
movement matters.
  Pope Francis spoke about how unions perform ``an essential role for 
the common good.'' He said that the labor movement ``gives voice to 
those who have none . . . unmasks the powerful who trample on the 
rights of the most vulnerable workers, defends the cause of the 
foreigner, the least, the discarded.''
  I just had the pleasure, for the last few minutes in my office, to 
speak with Bishop Murry of Youngstown, OH, and we were talking about 
the Pope and about steelworkers in Youngstown and about the struggles 
of workers and wages and layoffs and all the things that have happened 
to--where the winds of globalization have buffeted the workers in that 
community. Bishop Murry, as does Pope Francis, understands what too 
many in this town don't; that workers feel invisible, entire 
communities feel invisible. They feel like they are getting used and 
abused and some other words I can't say on the Senate floor.
  What, exactly, is the point of creating economic growth if workers 
don't share in it, if ordinary families still can't get ahead?
  Everybody here loves to talk about tax reform and bring the corporate 
rate down, but nobody is talking about paying workers more or giving 
workers more job security or what we should be doing--in working with 
companies and creating good jobs.
  My legislation, the Patriot Corporation Act, says if corporations do 
the right thing--if they pay their workers well, if they pay benefits, 
if they do the kinds of things American corporations should do--then 
they get a lower tax rate because they have earned it.
  We seem to have forgotten that all work has dignity. We have 
forgotten, as the Pope said, that ``the person thrives in work. Labour 
is the most common form of cooperation that humanity has generated in 
its history.'' Think about that. ``Labour is the most common form of 
cooperation that humanity has generated in its history.''
  What Washington and Wall Street don't seem to understand is that 
workers drive our economy, not corporations. You focus on the middle 
class, you grow the economy from the middle out, not cut taxes on the 
richest people and expect the money to trickle down into more money in 
workers' pockets and more people are hired. You grow the economy by 
treating workers well, by investing in workers. That is why we need 
unions to ensure that we spread economic growth to the people creating 
it, to the people working too many hours for too little pay.
  I think about workers like Stephanie in Columbus. She has worked for 
25 years as a childcare attendant for students with special needs. She 
wrote, saying: ``Every day I wake up before the sun rises to prepare 
for three daily shifts aiding students with special needs on their way 
to and from school.''
  That is the person whom--because she belongs to a union, that is the 
person whom corporate America, that the rightwing of the Republican 
Party wants to attack? That is the kind of person--Stephanie in 
Columbus--they want to attack?
  She worries that cases like this that undermine her union ``could 
severely limit our voice on the job and hurt our ability to best serve 
the children we care so much about.'' She said: ``Unions provide a 
pathway to the middle class for all people.''
  Think about a janitor I met in Cincinnati. I was speaking at a 
dinner. There was a table down front with seven middle-age women--a 
pretty diverse group. There was one empty seat at the table. It was 
told to me by some others that this group of women were janitors, 
custodians in downtown Cincinnati, southwest Ohio, and these women had 
signed their first union contract with downtown Cincinnati business 
owners. So there were 1,200 janitors working in these downtown 
businesses--in these big buildings downtown--and they had signed their 
first union contract.
  I asked if I could sit at their table, and they said yes. I said to 
the woman next to me: What is it like to have a union?
  She said: I am 51 years old, and this is the first time I will have a 
1-week paid vacation in my life.
  Think about that. We don't think--I am guessing that most of my 
colleagues think: Well, you know, people have paid vacations and people 
have paid sick leave. Well, much of the country doesn't, No. 1; and No. 
2, those who do often have that because they had a strong union--a 
union that negotiated sick leave pay for them, a union that negotiated 
vacation days for them, a union that negotiated family leave for them, 
and then, when those workers at a company get it, the other 
nonunionized workers and companies get it, and then those companies 
compete with other companies.
  So the fact is--there is a bumper sticker that says: ``If you enjoy 
your weekend, thank a labor union.''
  Labor unions brought to this country things like weekends and more 
leisure time and decent pay and all that. That is why unions matter. 
That is why this decision in the Supreme Court matters.
  If the Supreme Court rules against AFSCME, it will starve the union 
for resources they use to organize and grow and advocate for more 
workers. At the risk of being disrespectful, it would be nice if those 
nine members of the Supreme Court would follow the admonishment of Pope 
Francis, the words of Pope Francis, who admonished his parish priests 
to go out and smell like the flock. Find out where people live and 
work. Find out what people do.
  Find out the living conditions of people.
  Abraham Lincoln in the White House one day was talking to his staff. 
His staff said: You have to stay here in the White House. You have to 
win the war. You have to free the slaves. You have to preserve the 
Union.
  Lincoln said: No, I have to go out and get my public opinion baths.
  It could be important if the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court--who 
has an Ivy league education, went to the best colleges and the best law 
schools, grew up in a wealthy family, has done very well as a 
professional, and is a very smart man--if he would go out and smell 
like the flock, if he would go out and get his public opinion bath, 
maybe he would hear some stories, as I have heard in my time in the 
Senate.
  He would hear stories from people who talk about how important it is 
that Stephanie has union protection. He probably has never really 
thought much about the fact that janitors, who have worked 30 years as 
janitors--35 years for some of those women--but never had a paid day 
off, never had a paid vacation. He might learn something from them and 
think a little differently about this.
  If the Supreme Court rules against AFSCME, it is the opposite of what 
we need. We should be making it easier, not harder, for workers to come 
together and negotiate. That is why, this week, I am introducing 
legislation to strengthen the National Labor Relations Act, to make it 
harder for employers to deny workers the freedom to collectively 
bargain by playing games with their job titles and classifications.


Instead of stacking the deck even further in favor of corporate CEOs, 
we need to make it easier for workers to organize. That is how we make 
hard work pay off.

U.S. Supreme Court, which Senator Brown has just spoken about, is one 
that merits the attention of people who are concerned about the country 
and the Court.
  I wish to make two points in my remarks. The first has to do with the 
very difficult to explain--or at least very difficult to comfortably 
explain--pattern of 5-to-4 decisions of the U.S. Supreme Court, in 
which the five consist entirely of Republican appointees.
  The Supreme Court makes a lot of decisions, of course. But there is 
something that is particularly interesting about the 5-to-4 decisions, 
where the five Republican appointees line up and roll the other 
appointees. When we start looking at those decisions, there are some 
really significant patterns that emerge. The first pattern goes to 
issues in which the court is treading into the world of politics.
  Bear in mind that when Sandra Day O'Connor left the Court, it lost 
its only member who had ever run for office. What Justice O'Connor left 
behind was the first Court in the history of the United States that had 
exactly zero experience with elections and politics. There has never 
been as ignorant and green a Court in the history of the United States 
when it comes to politics; yet there has rarely been a Court so 
flagrantly eager to jump into politics and make very consequential 
decisions.
  When we look at the 5-to-4 decisions--which I think are probably the 
bulk of those--each one aligns with the political interests of the 
Republican Party--each one. It is not one or two or even three. It goes 
on and on and on.
  The oldest one in the series is probably Vieth v. Jubelirer, which 
was the decision in which the five Republicans said: This whole 
gerrymandering thing is just too difficult for us. We are going to 
declare open season. There is going to be no judicial remedy. We can't 
figure out one, so we don't have one.
  It is not just me who is saying that. The ABA section on election law 
said in its volume: Look, basically, it is game over for court review 
of gerrymandering. What immediately happened after that was the 
Republican Party went to work with that green-light signal and did the 
REDMAP project, which created massive, bulk gerrymandering through the 
battleground States. This was not an easy plan because, in some cases, 
they had to spend millions of dollars to win one or two State 
legislative seats, so they could then control the State legislature, so 
they could then change the districts consistent with the bulk 
gerrymandering scheme.
  The result is what happened in States like Senator Brown's, where, 
when he was reelected, he was on the ballot with President Obama, who 
was also reelected, and the majority of the votes cast in his State for 
Members of Congress were cast for Democrats, but against that 
background, many more Republicans than Democrats actually went to 
Congress in that election.
  A similar thing happened in Pennsylvania. My recollection is that on 
the same set of facts, Senator Casey, a Democrat, was reelected; 
President Obama, a Democrat, was reelected; a majority of Pennsylvania 
votes were cast for Democratic Members of Congress; the delegation was 
13 Republicans and 5 Democrats. Somebody is messing around, and it was 
a 5-to-4 Republican Supreme Court that opened that can of worms and 
unleashed REDMAP on the political landscape.
  They have a chance to review that now. Senator McCain has written a 
bipartisan brief asking them to wake up and smell the coffee about what 
has gone wrong here. We will see if they do or not, but, clearly, that 
was a decision that benefited the Republican Party's polls, and, 
clearly, it was 5 to 4.
  Then you go to the Voting Rights Act cases. There were two of them. 
In the first one, Bartlett v. Strickland, the five Republican members 
teed up a new standard, which they mentioned, but they didn't really 
act on it. Then, when it came to the home run pitch, Shelby County v. 
Holder, they created this new theory about which very conservative 
judges, like Posner, said that, basically, it stands on thin air. It 
has no basis whatsoever in any real legal theory. They knocked out the 
part of the Voting Rights Act that requires States with a wretched 
history of abuse of minorities and Democratic voters at the polls to 
get preclearance from the Department of Justice or from a court before 
they can change their State laws to scare people or keep people away 
from the polls.
  With that knocked out, guess what. All these legislatures across the 
South went straight to work. They passed law after law after law to 
deny people access to the polls, and over and over again, the courts 
that reviewed those and the appellate courts that reviewed the district 
court decisions found that the laws had been intentionally 
discriminatory, that the legislature had intended to keep people away 
from the polls, that they had intended to discriminate against Democrat 
and minority voters, and that they had chosen to do that deliberately.
  Of course, you can go back after all that litigation and clean it up 
and try to get the laws stricken and all of that. But in the meantime, 
you have had election after election in which the effect at the polls 
was had.
  They couldn't have been more wrong about the notion that if you 
lifted the preclearance requirement, everybody was going to be fine. 
Those were just the bad old days; it was a whole new America; racism 
didn't exist; efforts by one party to keep the other parties away from 
the polls weren't anything to worry about. Move along, move along; 
nothing to see here, folks. They were just plain dead wrong. They had 
absolutely no clue, and they have been proven dead wrong since. But, 
again, both of those cases were 5 to 4, all Republicans together.
  Then, of course, the big whammy came when the big special interests 
that so often are the core backers of the Republican Party decided that 
they felt really constrained by having to live under campaign finance 
limits. They wanted to be able to spend unlimited money in elections. 
Well, that is fine. It reminds me a little bit of the story of the 
French philosopher who touted the majesty and equality of the French 
law, which forbid both rich and poor alike from sleeping under bridges 
and begging for bread. Well, guess who actually sleeps under bridges 
and begs for bread. It is not rich and poor. And guess who can take 
advantage of a rule that you can spend unlimited money in politics. 
Only those who meet two conditions: One, they have unlimited money to 
spend, and, two, they have a good reason to spend it. In other words, 
really big special interests.
  The Court's decision, presuming that this spending was going to be 
either independent or transparent, has been turned into a mockery by 
events since. They obviously did not know what they were talking about. 
Facts have borne out that they did not know what they were talking 
about. They were completely dead wrong.
  Interestingly, since then, despite the presumption of their decision 
having been cut completely out from underneath it, the Court has shown 
no interest in a correction. They have shown no interest in correcting 
their error. They seem completely happy, the 5 to 4--the five 
Republican appointees--completely happy to have the landscape of 
American politics polluted with this money.
  There again, it wasn't just one decision. It was a bunch of them. 
Citizens United was the big one; Tradition Partnership, Inc. v. Bullock 
another; McCutcheon v. FEC yet another; Davis v. FEC yet another; 
Arizona Free Enterprise Club's FreedomClub PAC v. Bennett yet another--
all 5 to 4, all the Republicans lining up, all throwing out precedent 
or laws that had stood for 100 years.
  So Janus fits right into this pattern of 5-to-4 decisions. Indeed, it 
is actually a little bit worse because something weird happened early 
on when one of those 5 to 4--the Republican five Justices on the 
Supreme Court--signaled to the corporate supporters of


this ideology that he was interested in taking a whack at unions in a 
particular way.
  There is a pet peeve of the union-busting rightwing and the corporate 
sector, which was a decision from 1977 called Abood v. Detroit Board of 
Education. That decision allows unions to collect some dues from 
nonmembers on the grounds that their work for their members has benefit 
to other members. So you break out their wages work, which helps 
everybody, from their political work, which you can disaggregate from, 
and it allows you to collect certain dues--not complete dues, but 
certain dues--from nonunion members. What Abood did was to help unions 
keep revenues from the service that they give to nonmembers who benefit 
from their work. Without that rule, employees would be encouraged to be 
free riders and just get the benefit of what the union is doing without 
making any contribution to support it whatsoever. Of course, if that 
were to happen, the balance of power between corporations and unions 
would shift further toward corporations.

  The story is told quite well in the New York Times by a reporter 
named Adam Liptak, who is a Supreme Court reporter. I will read his 
story.

       In making a minor adjustment to how public unions must 
     issue notifications about their political spending, Justice 
     Alito digressed to raise questions about the 
     constitutionality of requiring workers who are not members of 
     public unions to pay fees for the unions' work on their 
     behalf. . . . Justice Sonia Sotomayor saw what was going on. 
     ``To cast serious doubt on longstanding precedence,'' she 
     wrote in a concurrence, ``is a step we historically take only 
     with the greatest caution and reticence. To do so, as the 
     majority does, on our own invitation and without adversarial 
     presentation is both unfair and unwise.''
       Michael A. Carvin, a leading conservative lawyer, also saw 
     what was going on. He and the Center for Individual Rights, a 
     libertarian group, promptly filed the challenge Justice Alito 
     had sketched out.

  I would say that he had invited.

       Indeed, Mr. Carvin asked the lower courts to rule against 
     his clients, a Christian education group and 10 California 
     teachers, so they could high-tail it to the Supreme Court.

  Let me interrupt my reading of the story for a second and make the 
point that this lawyer wanted to lose his case in the lower courts. It 
is rare for lawyers to go into a court wanting to lose. You have to 
have kind of a weird motive to take a case into court that you want to 
lose. The obvious motive here is that Mr. Carvin had heard the signal 
from Justice Alito that he was willing to rule his way if he would just 
bring the right case. So it didn't matter whether he won or lost. 
Losing is actually quicker. It gets you right up to the Supreme Court. 
He is not interested in litigating the matter truly on the merits; he 
is only interested in getting as quickly as possible to the Supreme 
Court. Why? Because he knew that 5 to 4, he would get the right 
decision.
  When you are a lawyer, the most sickening feeling you can have is to 
go into court with the belief that the judges you are going to argue 
before are prejudged against you. The confidence that Carvin must have 
had to want to lose a case deliberately below so that he could hightail 
it at high speed up to a court that he knew was going to rule his way 
because they told him they would--that is not American justice in the 
way it should be delivered.
  As it turned out, they took up the case. It was called Friedrichs. It 
was going to be 5 to 4, just as expected, and then Justice Scalia 
unexpectedly passed away. If you read about how the press took that, it 
was very clear that the fix had been in on this case.

       ``Corporate America had high hopes,'' the Journal said, 
     because ``the Supreme Court appeared poised to deliver long-
     sought conservative victories.''

  Since when should a court be poised to deliver long-sought 
conservative victories, not fair, dispassionate adjudication? But that 
is the reporting of the friendly Wall Street Journal. And those long-
sought conservative victories were going to take the form of `` `body 
blow[s] that business had sought against consumer and worker 
plaintiffs.' The cases `had been carefully developed by activists to 
capitalize on the court's rightward tilt.' ''
  Come on. This is not adjudication any longer; it is just the exercise 
of political power. And these 5-to-4 partisan decisions by the Supreme 
Court are degrading the reputation of the Supreme Court, they are 
degrading the integrity of the Supreme Court, and they are degrading 
the role of the judiciary in our vaunted scheme of constitutional 
government in the United States of America.
  With that, I yield to my distinguished colleague from Oregon."|53

principle encapsulated by the first three words of our Constitution: 
``We the People.'' We are meant to be a nation, in the words of Abraham 
Lincoln, ``of the people, by the people, and for the people,'' not a 
nation by and for the most powerful, not a nation by and for the most 
privileged. Yet time and time again, we are seeing a complete and total 
corruption of the vision of our Constitution.
  We saw this earlier this year with one TrumpCare bill after another 
designed to rip healthcare away from 20 to 30 million Americans to 
deliver tax giveaways to the richest in America. We have seen it just 
recently in the consideration of a budget that reversed that and said 
that in order to give $4.5 trillion of tax giveaways almost entirely to 
the richest Americans, we will take $1 trillion out of Medicaid and 
half a trillion out of Medicare. We have seen this powerful conversion 
of standing our Constitution on its head, and now we have the Supreme 
Court fully participating in this effort in a case called Janus v. 
AFSCME. It is the very epitome of the principle of a nation so 
corrupted that it honors the opposite of what our Constitution stands 
for.
  The sole purpose of this case, Janus v. AFSCME, is to undercut the 
ability of workers to organize. This is an assault on the freedom of 
working Americans to associate with their coworkers. It is an assault 
on the freedom of working Americans to negotiate a fair wage. It is an 
assault on the freedom of Americans to fight for fairer benefits and a 
safe workplace. Bottom line: It is an assault on the freedom of workers 
to participate in the wealth they work so hard to create.
  In short, this is the right to exploit that our Supreme Court--
majority of five--is so determined to elevate. I have read the 
Constitution, and I have never seen embedded in it a right to exploit, 
a right to cheat, a right to take advantage of. Yet here is the 
majority of the Court prepared to fight for exploitation on behalf of 
the 1 percent of Americans at the very top.
  The key strategy in this case is to attack the finances of workers 
when they organize. Former President Jimmy Carter once said: ``Every 
advance in this half-century--Social Security, civil rights, Medicare, 
aid to education, one after another--came with the support and 
leadership of American labor.'' It has been workers banding together to 
say: We can create a better foundation for families to thrive. And that 
hasn't just created a better foundation for those who belong to unions; 
it has created a better foundation for all workers. We saw them 
successfully band together and fight for a 40-hour workweek, fight for 
minimum wage, fight for sick leave, and fight for healthy and safe 
working conditions--again, benefits that every worker enjoys because 
workers were able to organize and fight to receive and win these 
provisions.
  What is really going in the Janus case? Any organization, in order to 
function, has rights and responsibilities. Rights are the rewards you 
get for participating, and responsibilities are the requirement that 
you be part of the team and you contribute to the effort.
  When I was small, probably just 2 or 3 years old, my mother had a 
book she would read to me that involved the animals in the barnyard. 
Animal after animal was asked to participate in making the bread, and 
animal after animal turned it down, but when the bread was baked, they 
wanted a full share even though they had refused to participate in the 
effort to create it. This is what Janus is all about. It is about the 
right to the rewards, divided from any responsibility to get the work 
done.
  When workers organize, they say: We are going to have to be able to 
have the finances to drive this organization, and to do that, we need 
to have every worker contribute a fair share. Those fair share fees 
mean that all the workers


are in it together, they are all contributing, and they all benefit 
from the rewards.
  Forever, the courts have said: Yes, with the reward goes the 
responsibility. That is true of any organization. It is fundamental in 
how organizations work. If you don't show up here on the floor, you 
don't get to vote. Every organization has its responsibilities that go 
with its rewards. But the 1 percent have chosen a strategy that says: 
We will take one organization in America--and that is workers 
organizations--and we will drive an absolute wedge between the 
responsibility and the reward.
  These fees that we are talking about, these fair share fees, are not 
fees that go to political purposes. They don't go to donations to 
candidates. They don't go to organizing campaigns walking door-to-door 
for candidates. They don't go to advertising on the television or the 
web. They are simply the cost of having a team that works to negotiate 
an agreement with a company.
  I find it absolutely evil that a majority of the Supreme Court is 
excited about embracing this right to exploit other workers by saying 
in this one case in America, you get the rewards without the 
responsibilities. If the Court was applying that to a stockholder in a 
company, the equivalent would be to say that the stockholder doesn't 
have to contribute to the costs of the management of the corporation, 
so they can demand back their share of what the management spends on 
their salaries, on their office spaces, on their private jets, and on 
their trips to do whatever they do, of the time they spend negotiating 
acquisitions to build the size of the company or striking deals to sell 
their products. That would be the equivalent, that a stockholder gets 
the rewards of all of that negotiation without having to participate in 
the cost. But this is not a situation in which five Justices want to 
apply consistent principle because their goal isn't to honor the 
Constitution, and their goal is not fairness; their single goal is to 
demolish the ability of workers to organize, to get a fair share of the 
wealth they work to create.
  We can see that already our Nation is in trouble on this principle. 
For the three decades after World War II, we had workers who had the 
strong ability to organize and demand a fair share, and we saw a 
revolution in the prosperity of workers in those three decades from 
1945 through 1975. Individuals who had lived in shacks, individuals who 
had been wiped out by the Great Depression suddenly were able to buy, 
on a single worker's income--it didn't even take two incomes--a three-
bedroom ranch house with a basement and a single-car garage and were 
still able to save money for an annual camping trip and perhaps to save 
some to help their children launch themselves into life. That is what 
we had when workers got a fair share.

  Yet, in the midseventies, the multinational companies said: Do you 
know what? Let's undercut the American worker by making our goods 
overseas in China and importing them. That way, we will demolish the 
jobs here in America, and we, the company, will have made things at the 
lowest price in the world, have sold them at the world market price, 
and have made a lot more money. This strategy worked for the 
multinational companies. They made vast sums of money for their 
stockholders and for their executives.
  This application of different rules for foreign workers and domestic 
workers really gave a huge advantage to our competitor overseas and to 
a company that spanned both shores and could move its production 
overseas. So we saw the loss of 50,000 factories; we saw the loss of 5 
million factory jobs; we saw the loss of an enormous number of supply 
chain jobs; and we saw, without those payrolls being spent in the 
community, an enormous loss of retail jobs in the community, but it 
made the wealthy wealthier, and that was the goal of the strategy.
  So here we are, facing this case that will come before the Court 
later this year, but the members of the Court have, essentially, 
already declared their positions. Four members of the Court were on the 
previous version of this when the Court tied 4 to 4, and Neil Gorsuch, 
who was added to the Court, has been very clear on which side of this 
he stands.
  Should we put an asterisk by Neil Gorsuch's name? Should a 5-to-4 
decision, with Gorsuch being in the majority, even carry weight here in 
our society? This is the seat that for the first time in U.S. history 
was stolen from one President and delivered to another. The majority of 
this body right here stole the seat, undermining the integrity, 
dishonoring the oath, the responsibility for advice and consent, and 
damaging the legitimacy of the Supreme Court. It was done because it 
was a strategy to enable the 1 percent to rip off ordinary working 
Americans. The prize for that was a position on Citizens United that 
now allows the wealthiest Americans to continue to fund campaigns 
across this country to drown out the voices of ordinary people and a 
position on this case, the Janus case, that says that we will take one 
organization in America, that of the workers, and divide the rewards 
from the rights.
  We know who is behind this strategy. It is the Koch brothers through 
their organizations, the National Right to Work Foundation and the 
Liberty Justice Center. They were behind the strategy for the theft of 
the Supreme Court seat. They were behind the massive increase in third-
party spending that polluted the campaigns across this country. They 
are behind this strategy to destroy the vision that is embedded in our 
Constitution.
  Eleanor Roosevelt once said: I am opposed to this legislation because 
it gives employers the right to exploit. Eleanor Roosevelt was a real 
champion for workers, and she called a spade a spade. The right to 
exploit is not a right that any Member of this body should pursue, and 
it certainly should not be pursued by the Supreme Court.
  We know that there is a chapter 2 to this strategy. The first is to 
get the Supreme Court so that you can divide the rights from the 
responsibilities; therefore, you as a worker do not have to contribute 
to the cost, but you will benefit from the rewards. Pretty soon, very 
few people will be contributing; therefore, it will undermine the 
financial ability of the union to negotiate.
  Then they have a second strategy. This fundraising letter was sent 
out last year by the State Policy Network. By the way, the State Policy 
Network is an alliance of 66 State-based think tanks that are designed 
and funded by the Koch brothers and their friends to undercut the 
ability of workers to get a fair share of the wealth that they create. 
They said: Here is our plan to defund and defang our opponent, the 
unions--to deal a blow to the left's ability to control government.
  Ah, they are fancy words, but what they really meant was our goal is 
to take and undo the ability of workers to organize so as to get a fair 
share of the wealth they create. It is one evil act after another that 
is funded by the Koch cartel.
  In our Nation, we have stood up to this type of abuse time and again. 
The American historian who created the phrase the ``American dream'' 
said, in each generation, there is a group of Americans who rises up to 
take on the forces that appear to be overwhelming us. We need to call 
on the people of the United States who believe in the vision of our 
Constitution, to be that group to rise up and take on this effort to 
turn our Constitution on its head--to strip ``we the people'' out of 
our Constitution and replace it with ``we the powerful''--and to stand 
up against this type of right to exploit, whether it is a bill here on 
the floor of the U.S. Senate or it is a begotten majority of the 
Supreme Court."|55

and make this observation, but I have serious concerns with how the 
nominee confirmation process has been going in this Congress.
  There is a blatant lack of respect for the Senate nomination process 
and an unprecedented level of obstructionism. I have been here for a 
number of years, so I know what to compare it with. I have never seen 
so many people being delayed in their confirmations, knowing that they 
are, ultimately, going to be confirmed and that they are well-qualified 
civil servants.
  The Democrats are forcing cloture votes on nominees who have well 
over 60 votes in support. Last week, we held a cloture vote on Scott 
Palk. Scott Palk is from Oklahoma. He is a guy who everybody likes. He 
doesn't have


any enemies out there. In fact, he was actually nominated by President 
Obama. He was not even nominated by this President. He ended up getting 
79 votes. Still, the stall was there, and we had to wait and wait and 
wait. Meanwhile, things are not getting done that should be getting 
done. Furthermore, the agency positions that we have hardly ever held 
rollcall votes on are being forced to occupy floor time. There is no 
reason for these votes except to delay the work of the courts and our 
agencies.
  I am very supportive of the leader's commitment to our courts and how 
he has prioritized judicial nominees. These nominations are extremely 
important and will ensure that the rule of law is upheld for, possibly, 
decades to come, benefiting all Americans.


                    Environmental Protection Agency

  However, there is an Agency that is doing work that is also important 
to all Americans and needs appointments, and that Agency is the 
Environmental Protection Agency. If there has been one Agency over the 
last 8 years that has run around and expanded its authority beyond 
congressional intent, it is the EPA. Putting confirmed appointees in 
place at the EPA will allow the President and Scott Pruitt to be 
successful in their efforts to rightsize that Agency. He has talked 
about that quite a bit. It is a bloated Agency that needs to be 
rightsized, and he needs help to do that.
  Last week, I highlighted the great things that Scott Pruitt is doing 
as Administrator. I was able to visit with him yesterday at the EPA and 
witness firsthand the implementation of new policies that will bring 
about positive changes in an Agency that has run roughshod over the 
American people. With the repeal of WOTUS and the Clean Power Plan, 
with the implementation of TSCA, in reforming the Agency by ending sue-
and-settle processes, and by creating greater transparency on the EPA's 
Science Advisory Committee, he is really doing a great job.
  By the way, yesterday, we had this event over there which had to do 
with the scientists. There are three Scientific Advisory Boards in the 
EPA. These are supposed to be made up of scientists who advise the 
policymakers as to what they are supposed to be doing. During the last 
administration, we discovered in just one of these that six out of 
seven of the appointees were actually recipients of grants from the 
EPA. In fact, I was over there, and I gave a little talk about those 
six. They actually received $119 million, and they are supposed to be 
unbiased in making policy. Obviously, this is one of the many things 
that he is going to make sure will no longer exist.
  He is making it impossible for anyone who serves on a scientific 
advisory board to receive any grants from the EPA. How reasonable is 
that? Yet that is still a practice they use and one of the many things 
he is cleaning up there.
  There is a lot of work still to do. The Agency needs its Assistant 
Administrators, who will work to implement many of the initiatives I 
have worked toward for years. The Environment and Public Works 
Committee has now voted out five Assistant Administrators and General 
Counsel nominees, and I hope we can move swiftly to get these well 
qualified nominees over to the EPA to bring their expertise to an 
Agency that desperately needs them. Unfortunately, Democrats have 
targeted two of these nominees and have disparaged them, their work, 
and their backgrounds.


                   Nomination of Dr. Michael Dourson

  Dr. Michael Dourson will be an excellent Assistant Administrator for 
the Office of Chemical Safety and Pollution Prevention and will bring 
much needed expertise and experience to the office in charge of the 
TSCA reauthorization law. The TSCA bill was a huge success last year. 
It was done on a bipartisan basis. It is the first major reform bill in 
40 years, and we were able to get that through. Yet we need to have a 
person as the Assistant Administrator to make sure it is done right.
  Dr. Dourson has endured a coordinated campaign against him that 
misrepresents who he is and his record. There are groups working to 
paint Dr. Dourson as an ``industry scientist.''
  What you will not hear from these groups is that much of his career 
experience comes from the EPA itself, where he worked for 15 years. 
During his years at the EPA, Dr. Dourson helped establish the 
Integrated Risk Information System, which helps identify and document 
the potential dangers of chemicals found in the environment. He also 
has the honor of having received four bronze medals from the EPA for 
this commendable work. Dr. Dourson also served on EPA's Scientific 
Advisory Board for 6 years and has held leadership roles with a number 
of relevant toxicology organizations, receiving several awards from his 
peers.
  Since his time at EPA, Dr. Dourson has devoted his career to 
protecting public health by founding his own nonprofit that works to 
develop, review, and share risk assessments on various chemicals. His 
nonprofit work is mostly on behalf of government, with a minority of 
the work done at the request of various industries--many of these 
industries are very pro-environmental industries--as well as providing 
pro bono assistance to those in need of help. In other words, he used 
his expertise to help people who needed help and were not able to get 
it in any other way.
  Naturally, the industry work is the part that environmental activists 
have focused on to prove their claims that his research is a 
rubberstamp for dangerous chemicals. They hold the perspective--which 
is a myth--that working at the request of industry must mean that you 
are evil.
  As always, the reality is much different. On many occasions the 
nonprofit has developed risk assessments that did not support the 
industry sponsor and were the same or lower than the safe levels set by 
government. Furthermore, he has provided expert testimony against 
industry on several occasions. Unfortunately, the coordinated attack on 
Dr. Dourson will persist and a good man's reputation will continue to 
be put at risk.
  I ask that the leader find floor time for Dr. Dourson as soon as 
possible so he can get back to work at an agency that he served 
commendably for many years and ensure that those who seek to tear him 
down do not win.


                       Nomination of Bill Wehrum

  I also ask that the leader prioritize another nominee that has also 
faced unfair and false attacks. I have known Bill Wehrum for years, and 
I have no doubt that he is the best choice to head the Office of Air 
and Radiation. I regret that his first nomination to the EPA back 
during the George W. Bush administration was blocked by Senate 
Democrats. It is my hope that we can correct that wrong and confirm him 
as one of the Assistant Administrators. He has served the public and is 
widely recognized for his knowledge of the Clean Air Act.
  The Clean Air Act has been very successful. In fact, I was one of the 
original cosponsors of the Clean Air Act Amendments. It has performed 
very well. He was very much involved in that also. So there is no one 
more qualified to head that Office of Air and Radiation than Mr. 
Wehrum, and I am sure of that. He has been consistently recognized as a 
leader and top lawyer in environmental law by such groups and 
publications as Chambers USA, the Legal 500 United States, and 
Washingtonian magazine.
  He, too, has worked at the EPA in the past and will once again serve 
the Agency and the American people with integrity. Mr. Wehrum is also 
under attack for working on behalf of industry. The environmental 
industry--and it is an industry, as they, too, are working to secure 
money for themselves by pursuing an agenda of their sponsors--is 
lobbying against Mr. Wehrum because he wants to make regulations 
workable within the scope of the statute for the regulated community.
  This is very curious to me because we want environmental regulations 
to improve our air quality without putting entire industries out of 
business--a balance that is a part of the Clean Air Act. Those words 
are used in the Clean Air Act: The rules need to be workable and 
implementable without undue harm to our economy.
  It is time that we returned some common sense and rule of law to the 
Environmental Protection Agency. We have taken the first and only step 
with the confirmation of Scott Pruitt, and Bill Wehrum is the next step 
toward that goal. Right now there has only been one confirmation, and 
that is for Scott Pruitt.
  With the repeal of the Clean Power Plan sitting before the EPA, I ask 
that


the leader prioritize Mr. Wehrum's confirmation vote so that we can 
give the Office of Air and Radiation the leadership it needs to make 
the important policy objectives of the President and a majority of our 
colleagues and States a reality.
  Again, we have five EPA nominees that have been voted out of 
committee, and we are now into November and only have one EPA appointee 
confirmed. We need to do better than that, and I think this is going to 
happen.
  Let me just repeat some of the things that are going on in the 
Environmental Protection Agency. Scott Pruitt in his meeting yesterday 
called this to the attention of the American people. We knew it all the 
time, but people on the outside didn't know it and they were shocked. 
They found out that in the Scientific Advisory Board of the Obama 
administration, six of the seven on the board were direct recipients of 
grants from the EPA and they were making policy decisions for the EPA. 
Now, how bad is that? In fact, we added it up. I would state to the 
Chair that it came to $119 million going to six people who are on the 
board making decisions that affected the grants to go out. That is the 
type of thing that he is cleaning up. He has the guts to do it, and he 
is doing it.
  I am anxious to get these two confirmed, and I am hopeful that will 
take place.
  With that, I yield the floor.
  I suggest the absence of a quorum."|57

violence epidemic in this country, and the time to act is now.
  Exactly 1 month ago today, we witnessed one of the most horrific mass 
shootings in our country's history, and Congress has done nothing. One 
month later, legislation on bump stocks has stalled. There is a 
deafening silence from the majority on any responsible actions on this 
public health crisis, even though, Mr. Speaker, a majority of 
Americans, including responsible gun owners, support responsible gun 
safety legislation.
  Today, Mr. Speaker, I rise to share a statement written by my 
constituent Zach Elmore, who is here with us this morning. Zach's 
sister, Alicia Johnson, was shot in Las Vegas. Thankfully, she 
survived. This is what he wrote as he sat next to her hospital bed as 
she recovered:
  ``My sister was shot in Las Vegas. I have never been more afraid, 
more angry in my entire life. The problem with shootings around the 
country is that, unless you know someone directly affected, it is easy 
to say `what a tragedy,' and move on with your daily life.
  ``It is not so easy when you are getting ready for bed and one of 
your sisters calls inconsolably crying to tell you that another one of 
your sisters has been shot. It is not so easy when you call your mother 
and she is terrified and crying and all you can do is try to calm her 
down while you figure out how to get to your sister as quickly as 
possible. It is not so easy to see your brother-in-law with blood still 
on his hands from doing whatever he could to keep your sister alive. It 
is not so easy to see your sister in a hospital bed, unable to move due 
to a gunshot wound in her back and staples in her stomach from surgery 
to check for organ damage. We are among the luckiest ones.
  ``I am sick and tired of thoughts and prayers. If thoughts and 
prayers had any affect whatsoever, there would be a lot of people still 
alive today. All these thoughts and prayers would have miraculously 
pulled bullets out of victims and healed wounds, would have stopped 
these massacres before they started.
  ``You know what is better than thoughts and prayers and lines around 
the block at blood banks and enormous relief funds for victims of 
tragedy? Creating a society where we don't have to do these things many 
times a year.
  ``We waited so long to do anything after Columbine that Virginia Tech 
happened. We still couldn't talk about it when the Aurora theater 
shooting happened. That didn't change anything, and then 20 children 
were murdered at Sandy Hook. Even that wasn't enough to promote change. 
When Dylann Roof happened, still couldn't talk about it, and then San 
Bernardino happened. We still couldn't bring ourselves to discuss gun 
control, and then the Pulse nightclub shooting happened.
  ``Lord knows we can't do anything about guns, and then Las Vegas 
happened. And we are still being told that now is not the time, let 
healing begin, don't politicize tragedy, but by all means send thoughts 
and prayers to all affected by `insert massacre here.'
  ``There is no place in society for any weapon which has the singular 
purpose to kill people. The man who killed and injured more than any 
massacre in America's history broke the mold for who commits mass 
shootings. He would have easily passed a background check and psych 
evaluation. He was affluent and had no known ties to terrorist 
organizations, but he is certainly a terrorist. The system we have in 
place allowed him to accumulate dozens of assault weapons and thousands 
of rounds of ammunition because, for all intents and purposes, he was 
not a risk to society.
  ``Let's keep in mind, the Second Amendment of the Constitution was 
written over 200 years ago when a good gunman might get three shots off 
a minute with a musket. It is hard for me to believe the Founding 
Fathers envisioned a world where one man could or would fire 400 rounds 
a minute into a crowd of people.
  ``This should not be difficult. How many people have to die before 
people will apply a little logic to gun laws? Do more children need to 
die? Does a hospital need to be attacked? What is your limit? Does it 
have to happen to you or a loved one before you start to think 
differently about gun laws?
  ``The people of this country have so much power. We have protested, 
pressured our Congressmen and -women, and we have seen that work. Why 
can't we do the same to reduce and hopefully eliminate the insane 
amount of gun violence in America?
  ``Excuse me for not being willing to wait to let healing begin, for 
not accepting that now is not the time to talk about a major problem in 
this country. There is never a wrong time to stand up for what you 
think is right.
  ``My sister was shot in Las Vegas in the latest of a devastatingly 
long line of mass shootings in this country. We are luckier than 58 
people and their families, and likely luckier than many of the over 500 
other people who were injured. If I don't talk about it, if we don't 
truly take steps to effect positive change, everyone reading this will 
forget it happened because they will be sending thoughts and prayers to 
the victims of the next mass shooting in America.''
  Mr. Speaker, that is the end of the excerpt of his letter. Zach's 
family's experience illustrates why it is crucial for us to take a hard 
look at gun violence policies.
  Mr. Speaker, I hope that we will, across the aisle, in a bipartisan 
fashion, do what is right for the American


people and protect families like Zach's across the country.

occasion of the grand opening of its new office space in Reston, 
Virginia. Based in Fairfax County since 1987, the opening of this new

companies in not only Fairfax County, but the Dulles Corridor as a 
whole. We are continually reminded of why this area is rapidly 
developing a reputation as the Silicon Valley of the East.
   Established in 2012 by the merger of Datatel and SunGard Higher

higher education community since 1968. What began as a single office 
has expanded into 20 regional offices employing over 2,900 individuals 
all over the world.
   As a former member and Chairman of the Fairfax County Board of 
Supervisors, I know firsthand that the quality of life we enjoy in 
Fairfax County is directly tied to the strength of our education 
system. This is especially true when it comes to higher education. 
Providing the gateways for students to succeed is essential and I 
commend the staff of Ellucian for working to create and maintain those 
opportunities.
   Mr. Speaker, to prepare the leaders of tomorrow, institutions of 
higher education must have the services, tools, and technologies to 
engage and foster student success. For nearly fifty years, Ellucian has 
provided support to these institutions in order for them to achieve 
their goals. It is critical that our nation focus our sight on 
improving student outcomes to better compete in the world economy and I 
thank Ellucian and its dedicated staff for their efforts in this area. 
I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating Ellucian on the grand 
opening of its new headquarters and in wishing it great success in all

of the Maine Coalition to End Domestic Violence, MCEDV, and its nine 
member organizations and resource centers: Hope and Justice Project, 
Partners for Peace, Next Step, New Hope for Women, Family Violence 
Project, Safe Voices, Family Crisis Services, Caring Unlimited, and 
Immigrant Resource Center of Maine. I am humbled and thankful for their 
tireless service to end the cycle of abuse existing in too many homes 
across Maine, our Nation, and the world.
  Originally formed in 1977 as the Maine Coalition for Family Crisis 
Services, and renamed the Maine Coalition to End Domestic Violence in 
2001, the MCEDV has spent four decades being advocates for victims of 
domestic violence and have never lost their focus. Their efforts have 
helped countless people find their own voices and regain their strength 
to live a violence-free life. The MCEDV has helped ensure there are 
direct service programs, shelters, transitional housing, and court 
advocacy available to everyone throughout our State. Not only do they 
partner with the nine member-projects mentioned above, but they also 
coordinate efforts and give voice to the education of the public, 
lawmakers, law enforcement, friends, and neighbors to make domestic 
violence a community-State-national and global issue that each of us 
has a responsibility to confront.
  It is not possible to put words to the significant impact the MCEDV 
has had, the lives that have been saved, and terrifying existences 
turned into futures of peace. However, it would not be fair to their 
work to not acknowledge the lives that have been lost to domestic 
violence. All genders, all ages, all


races, all socio-economics categories, domestic violence knows no 
boundaries, and fear continues to be a strong silencer. However, with 
the support and services provided by the MCEDV and its membership, many 
victims have found exceptional strength to tell their story, found 
their courage to name the abuse and the abuser and support others to 
shine a light on this pandemic of violence.
  I cannot overstate how awe-inspiring the exceptional staying power 
and determination of this coalition of advocates is and how impactful 
their efforts are. They have not only mobilized a state-wide interest 
in the topic of domestic violence but have also inspired people to work 
with them to even further strengthen the message that there is no 
excuse for domestic abuse. It has been said that peace in the world 
starts with peace in the home. Thank you to the MCEDV for living those 
words and helping to change the world for the better.

and colleague, Representative Brian Fitzpatrick, as we advocate for the 
passage of the Right to Try Act. This bill, which we introduced 
together, has dozens of bipartisan cosponsors, including Members here 
tonight.
  We are both supportive of Senator Ron Johnson's efforts to champion 
Right to Try in the Senate. He has been a tireless advocate of Right to 
Try for years, and his bill has already passed the Senate with 
unanimous consent. If you are watching the Senate very closely, you 
will know that nothing comes out of there, and certainly nothing with 
unanimous consent; so that tells how strong the sentiment is in favor 
of this bill.
  Our legislation allows terminally ill patients who have no further 
options left--I repeat that, no further options left--the opportunity 
to try experimental drugs that could save their own lives.
  Yes, there are also provisions in our bill to protect both the 
patients, as well as the pharmaceutical companies who want to 
participate, but those provisions are secondary to the primary purpose 
of this legislation. The primary purpose of the Right to Try Act is to 
give brave patients across this country some choice over their own 
destinies, when all other avenues are gone.
  We want to give hope to these Americans, and we should all share that 
same goal of doing everything we can for patients fighting to save 
their lives. This policy has significant bipartisan support. The Trump 
administration strongly supports Right to Try, and President Trump has 
indicated he would likely sign this bill into law.
  Time is of the essence, for time is one thing a terminally ill 
patient does not have. And the status quo is not the answer. The FDA 
and other agency officials claim that their own expanded access program 
is working and continues to improve. There may be some truth to that, 
but the program is simply not enough; and I know that because I have 
talked to dozens and dozens of patients, family members, and advocates 
who tell me it is not enough. They come to my office, they call me on 
the phone, they write me impassioned letters.
  These same advocates have ensured that Right to Try has become law in 
38 States. Think about that for a moment. With one more State, you 
could actually ratify a Constitutional amendment. And in half of those 
38 States, Right to Try laws passed with unanimous support. In my home 
State of Arizona, voters approved that initiative by 80 percent of the 
popular vote.
  At a time when pundits are claiming that our politics are broken, and 
Republicans and Democrats can't come together on anything, here is a 
cause that Americans of all political stripes can unite in.
  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. 
Fitzpatrick)."|3

up for terminally ill patients across this country.
  Mr. Speaker, each year, more Americans receive the devastating news 
of a terminal diagnosis. Even with the amazing work done in American 
medical research and development, for too many families, access to 
these potentially lifesaving treatments will come too late or not at 
all.
  Thousands of terminally ill patients, like my constituent, Matt 
Bellina, suffer needlessly while awaiting final approval for drug 
therapies and other medical technologies.
  In April 2014, at age 30, Matt was diagnosed with ALS, otherwise 
known as Lou Gehrig's disease. ALS attacks nerve cells in the brain and 
spinal cord, causing those with ALS to lose control of their muscles.
  Although this disease stopped Matt's career as a U.S. Navy aviator in 
its tracks, he persisted and actively involved himself in the ALS 
community as a strong advocate for Right to Try legislation.
  While the Food and Drug Administration carries out its three-phase 
approval process, which can take years and cost billions of dollars, 
many patients simply want the chance to try treatments that have 
already been demonstrated to be safe.
  A bill that was unanimously passed by the Senate will offer them a 
chance to extend their lives. The Right to Try Act, S. 204, would 
ensure that terminally ill patients, together with their physicians and 
pharmaceutical manufacturers, can administer investigational treatments 
where no alternative exists. In fact, this bipartisan idea is already 
the law in 37 States.
  A Federal Right to Try law would prevent the government from blocking 
access to potentially lifesaving medications. It would require patients 
to first try all other available treatments and be unable to 
participate in clinical trials.
  I want to note that these provisions only apply to terminally ill 
patients. It does not undo the FDA approval process but provides a 
potential lifeline for those who cannot wait. Moreover, it requires a 
physician to certify that other options are either exhausted or 
unavailable.
  This bill requires that a product meet a demonstrated level of safety 
by attaining FDA phase I approval. We have worked with the drug 
companies to ensure adverse outcomes are not used against the ongoing 
application for approval. Additionally, patients, doctors, and 
manufacturers do not assume any additional liability under this act.
  For those patients caught in between the traditional drug approval 
delays, a clinical trial process for which they do not qualify, and 
limited time, the Right to Try simply establishes the freedom for 
patients and their doctors to try therapies where the benefits far 
outweigh the risks. It gives them the option of trying to save their 
life.
  Mr. Speaker, whether it is a father like Matt courageously battling 
ALS, or a brave child living with Duchenne muscular dystrophy, they 
deserve the right to try.

that he has done and continues to do in this cause, this important 
cause. He is a great leader in this, and I am grateful for all of his 
effort here.
  At this point, Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield to the gentleman 
from Florida (Mr. Gaetz)."|5
CREC-2017-11-01-pt1-PgH8381-6|Mr. GAETZ|G000578|CREC-2017-11-01-pt1-PgH8381|"  Mr. GAETZ. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. I thank 
him for


his leadership on this issue on behalf of the terminally ill. I would 
also like to thank Senator Johnson for marshaling together the 
resources of the Senate to bring this legislation to a head.
  I ran for public office because I was tired of the government playing 
too large a role in the decisions people make in their private lives, 
in their homes, and in their businesses. We live in a world today where 
the government wants to tell you where you have got to send your kids 
to school, what kind of healthcare plan you have got to buy, what 
regulations you have to comply with, and how much money they are going 
to take out of your paycheck each and every month.
  I certainly don't think the government ought to play a role in 
deciding how someone deals with treatment at the end of life. That is 
why I am a proud cosponsor of the Right to Try Act with Representative 
Biggs, Representative Fitzpatrick, and so many others. My frustration 
lies with any regime, regulatory or otherwise, that would impair a 
patient's decision to use any medication to be able to alleviate their 
symptoms or improve their quality of life in their final days.
  It is absolutely ludicrous to me that, in today's world, we don't 
allow terminally ill people in every corner of this great country to be 
able to use medical cannabis to alleviate their pain and suffering, 
particularly at the end of life.
  It is so frustrating to me that the Federal Government has lied to 
this country for a generation about medical cannabis, saying that it 
has no medical value. Well, I can tell you, Mr. Speaker, that is 
absolutely not true. I have met with patients in my district who have 
received terminal diagnoses, who have been told by their doctors not to 
buy green bananas, and yet those folks courageously move forward trying 
to be a part of their own treatment and to be a part of their own 
clinical plan moving forward.
  Too often, doctors, whether it is at the VA or in private practice, 
aren't able to counsel their patients and give them advice and comfort 
that there is a substance in medical cannabis which has proven in some 
circumstances to have medical value.
  Stage IV of terminal cancer includes symptoms like loss of appetite, 
which can be helped by cannabis, chronic pain, shortness of breath, 
difficulty breathing, chemotherapy-induced nausea. All of these things 
can be helped by medical cannabis.
  Those who are in stage III of AIDS have sleeplessness and weight loss 
that can be helped by medical cannabis.
  Cannabis has shown great promise in the treatment of Alzheimer's, 
Crohn's Disease, multiple sclerosis, and epilepsy, where there are 
refractory seizures, at times, 30 or 40 seizures a day.
  Mr. Speaker, in this great country, we will have people who will 
receive terminal diagnoses each and every day. I say let's get the 
government out of their way. Let's let the decisions that impact the 
healthcare of patients be made by those patients and their family 
members and their doctors, not a bunch of politicians and bureaucrats 
in Washington.
  As people fall ill, it is my position that this Right to Try Act can 
help them, and certainly the inclusion of medical cannabis into this 
legislation would make it a great deal more useful and a great deal 
better for those in pain.
  I thank the gentleman from Arizona for yielding."|6

Arizona (Mr. Biggs) for hosting tonight's Special Order. I also thank 
Mr. Fitzpatrick, as well, for his leadership in this bill. I am really 
glad to be part of this effort.
  We could stand here tonight and talk about the FDA's process for 
approving drugs. We could talk about the countless patients across the 
country who struggle to get accepted into a clinical trial for a drug 
that could save their life. We could even stand up here tonight and 
share with you one of the uplifting stories of a patient who received a 
lifesaving drug because of a State's right-to-try law. But we have 
heard this, and we know all of this.
  We know the FDA's approval process takes years. We know there are too 
few spots in clinical trials for patients in dire need of help. We know 
that right-to-try laws give families hope and can save lives. What I 
would like to talk about tonight is the moral imperative we face on 
this right-to-try legislation.
  America is home to the world's greatest doctors and medical experts. 
It is home to the world's greatest medical schools and hospitals. We 
have cured diseases that were once a death sentence. We have directed 
our national resources to fight epidemics that have saved lives here at 
home and overseas. We don't give up.
  What we do here in this Chamber, Mr. Speaker, speaks volumes. What we 
do here shows the Nation and the world where our priorities are.
  Is our priority the bureaucracy of this city that too often misses 
opportunities simply because of its inability to act, or is our 
priority the patients and families whom we represent to consult with a 
doctor and decide for themselves how they choose to fight against 
illnesses for which we continue to search for a cure?
  For me, the choice is clear, Mr. Speaker. I choose my constituents. I 
choose life, and I urge every single Member of this body to do the 
same. We cannot afford the cost of inaction.

CREC-2017-11-01-pt1-PgH8381-10|Mr. GOSAR|G000565|CREC-2017-11-01-pt1-PgH8381|"  Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from Arizona for yielding.
  What a great issue. As a conservative, I am an outspoken defender of 
one's right to life. But being pro-life doesn't mean that I am just 
antiabortion. It also means that I support the right to try, because 
life at all stages is worth fighting for.
  Every year, over 1 million Americans die from terminal illnesses, 
many of whom pass away while waiting for the FDA to approve a drug that 
could dramatically change their prognosis, while others die in the 
hopeless cycle of trying and trying again to gain acceptance into a 
medical trial.
  Think about that: we are losing millions of Americans at the hands of 
government red tape.
  Now, as a healthcare provider for 25 years, I know firsthand how 
important innovation is to the medical community. The Right to Try Act, 
if made into law, will give hope to the child with leukemia whose 
doctors have exhausted all other treatment options. It opens previously 
locked doors by allowing healthcare providers to try experimental drugs 
as a last-ditch effort for survival.
  The experiments that the Right to Try Act will allow for have the 
potential to lead to many more birthdays, more piano recitals, and more 
camping trips, and offer hope for our future, hope for years to come.
  But don't take my word for it. Emily Whitehead was merely 5 years old 
when she was diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and her 
doctors quickly realized that she was among a small percentage of 
patients whose disease was seemingly untouchable by chemotherapy. The 
Whiteheads were at the end of their rope. The little girl's body was 
resisting chemotherapy, and the window for many more birthdays, more 
piano recitals, and more camping trips was wearing thin. Their only 
option was to join a clinical trial that experimented with T-cell 
therapy, where Emily could be the first pediatric patient to undergo 
this treatment.
  And do you know what? It worked. Three years later, a groundbreaking 
study was conducted where 63 patients received T-cell therapy for 1 
year, and 52 of them became cancer free, an absolutely unheard-of 
statistic with this deadly strain of leukemia.
  Think about that: 52 lives were saved; 52 families were given another 
birthday, another piano recital, and another camping trip. What a waste 
it would have been had they not had the right to try."|10

CREC-2017-11-01-pt1-PgH8381-13|Mr. BIGGS|B001302|CREC-2017-11-01-pt1-PgH8381|"  Mr. BIGGS. Mr. Speaker, in closing, I want to mention how I came to 
really be converted to the cause of right to try.
  I served in the Arizona State Legislature with Laura Knaperek, who 
was also serving in the legislature when I first met her. By 2014, she 
was no longer serving in the State legislature. She was an advocate. 
That year, Laura was in the fight of her life against ovarian cancer, 
and her mission was to see right-to-try legislation passed into law.
  In the end, her efforts for this cause succeeded beyond everyone's 
wildest expectations when 80 percent of the electorate in Arizona voted 
to enact right to try. But, unfortunately, Laura is not with us because 
she lost her brave battle with cancer last year. Her legacy as a 
tireless patient advocate lives on.
  I will continue to carry on the fight not just for Laura Knaperek, 
but for all those patients across this country who are battling against 
the odds every day.
  I am joined by those who are here tonight, those who have cosponsored 
this bill, and many other advocacy groups, such as the Goldwater 
Institute in Arizona that continues to fight for this.
  I fight for Bertrand Might. Bertrand is a very special little boy. He 
was the first person ever to be diagnosed with a rare, fatal genetic 
disorder called NGLY1 that has left this 7-year-old paralyzed. Because 
the disease was only identified by scientists in 2012 and only a few 
people worldwide have been diagnosed with it, there is no cure and no 
treatment available. Because the disorder is so rare, a drug may never 
be developed to treat it.
  But scientists have found that Bertrand responds to certain 
investigational therapies. So Bertrand's family will have to rely on 
trying those new investigational medications as long as they have 
access to them. That is why we need this right-to-try legislation.
  I fight for Jordan McLinn. Seven-year-old Jordan says he wants to 
grow up to be a firefighter so he can save lives. He has Duchenne 
muscular dystrophy, which could leave him paralyzed within 5 years and 
shortens his life expectancy to only 20 years. There is a drug now 
being used in clinical trials that is helping young people like Jordan, 
but it could take another 7 years for that drug to be available on the 
market. His parents cannot afford to wait for the FDA to give that drug 
its final approval. He could be in a wheelchair by then. This 
investigational drug could add years to Jordan's life, which would give 
him the chance to save others.
  We have already heard, when Representative Fitzpatrick discussed Matt 
Bellina, his needs and his advocacy. We fight for him, and we fight for 
Mikaela Knapp.
  At 24, Mikaela was diagnosed with a deadly form of kidney cancer that 
had already migrated into her bones before she even knew she was sick. 
She went through every known treatment in a matter of months and 
nothing worked. Her high school sweetheart, Keith, heard about a drug 
under development that was successfully treating people with this same 
cancer, but Mikaela was not allowed to enroll in the clinical trial. 
Mikaela and Keith launched a social media campaign to try to get access 
to the drug, but it wasn't enough. The FDA didn't help.

  Mikaela died on April 24, 2014. Five months later, on September 4, 
the FDA gave final approval to the drug that might have saved her.
  I fight for Diego Morris. When he was 10 years old, Diego woke up 
with a sore leg that his mom thought was just another sports injury, 
but the pain didn't go away. They knew something was wrong, but they 
never expected osteosarcoma, a rare form of bone cancer.
  After exhausting all treatments available, Diego's doctors 
recommended he try mifamurtide, which wasn't available in the United 
States but was being safely used and had been given the Prix Galien 
Award, the gold medal for pharmaceutical development in England. The 
Morris family wasted no time and made the move abroad to try to save 
Diego's life. The treatments worked. Now Diego is back home in Phoenix 
and back to playing his favorite sports.
  We fight unitedly for the countless other patients who deserve a 
right to try. We must act without further delay. Again, I thank those 
who have been here to testify tonight.
  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

My city, my dear city of New York, no stranger to terrorism, was once 
again its victim yesterday.
  Yesterday afternoon, a man deliberately drove a rented truck into 
groups of pedestrians and cyclists, killing eight and injuring about a 
dozen more. Some of the injured were schoolchildren. These people were 
biking or walking home, enjoying a brisk and beautiful New York autumn 
day. It is tragic. It leaves a hole in your stomach.
  Our hearts go out to the victims and their families, and we wish all 
of the injured a full and speedy recovery. We are also grateful--deeply 
grateful--to the New York Police Department and the first responders, 
especially Officer Ryan Nash, 28 years old, who was the first on the 
scene. He reacted quickly and decisively to bring down the attacker and 
bring him into custody. Who knows how much worse the tragedy would have 
been without his actions.
  As one of thousands of New Yorkers who regularly ride on the path 
where this attack took place--in the last month, I have ridden on it 
twice--it hits close to home. My daughter went to the school near the 
scene, Stuyvesant High School, and she used the bike path I don't know 
how many times. This is our territory, our home.
  The attacks are meant to confuse and terrorize, but, as the world 
learned after 9/11 and will learn again, New York doesn't scare easily. 
New Yorkers are resilient. We always bounce back. We won't let these 
terrorists get their way or affect our way of life. We will never let 
terror prevail.
  True to form--something that made my heart swell with pride--the New 
York City Halloween parade marched on last night. Thousands of school 
kids went right into Stuyvesant today. The terrorists cannot stop us. 
They cannot change our way of life. We love New York. We love America. 
That bond holds us together.


                         Antiterrorism Funding

  Now, I have seen the tweets from President Trump. After September 11, 
the first thing President Bush did was to invite Senator Clinton and me 
to the White House, where he pledged to do whatever was in his power to 
help our city. President Bush, in a moment of national tragedy, 
understood the meaning of his high office and sought to bring our 
country together.
  President Trump, where is your leadership?
  The contrast between President Bush's actions after 9/11 and 
President Trump's actions this morning could not be starker.
  Again, President Trump, where is your leadership?
  I would say in closing that I have always believed that immigration 
is good for America. I believe it today.
  President Trump, instead of politicizing and dividing America, which 
he always seems to do at times of national tragedy, should be bringing 
us together and focusing on the real solution--antiterrorism funding, 
which he proposed to cut in his most recent budget. So I am calling on 
President Trump to rescind his proposed cuts to this vital 
antiterrorism funding immediately. Our city relies on this funding to 
track potential terrorists and to snuff out attacks. The NYPD, which 
bravely and quickly responded to the scene yesterday and brought the 
mayhem to an end, depends on this antiterrorism funding to keep our 
city safe day in and day out. So, again, I am calling on the President 
to rescind his proposed cuts to this vital antiterrorism funding 
immediately.
  Instead of dividing, instead of politicizing, do something real, Mr. 
President. Restore these funds now.
  I yield the floor."|2

series of votes to fill vacancies in the Federal appeals court. 
President Trump has nominated highly qualified, mainstream judges and 
legal scholars to do these jobs. Now, Democrats have responded once 
again with delay and with obstruction. It is clear to me that we need 
to change the rules in the Senate that govern how we debate nominations 
in this body. All year Democrats have been putting up roadblocks to 
nominations. They have forced the majority leader to file cloture so 
that


then we can confirm nominees like these four judges.
  As of last Friday, Democrats have forced the Senate to file cloture 
47 different times when we have had to have cloture votes on President 
Trump's nominees. There were only six cloture votes at this point for 
the previous four Presidents--five for Obama, none for George W. Bush, 
one for Bill Clinton, and none under the Presidency of George Herbert 
Walker Bush. These are the kind of hoops that the Democrats have been 
making the Senate jump through in an effort to confirm President 
Trump's nominees.
  The procedure has been set in place to allow for debate. Well, debate 
is a good thing in the Senate, as long as debate is actually occurring. 
It is a chance for Senators to stand up, to say what they like or what 
they don't like about a nominee. Now, if no one wants to debate, we 
should just move things along and have the vote. There is one Senate 
rule that allows for as much as 30 hours of debate time on Presidential 
nominations after we have actually had the cloture vote. Now, in 
reality, very little of that time that is spent on the Senate floor is 
actually being used for the debate. In the past, both sides would agree 
to waive the time requirements and to move on to other Senate business, 
which is what we need to do to get the country continuing to move 
forward. But what is happening now is that Democrats are insisting on 
cloture votes, and then they are insisting that we use hour after hour 
after hour, even when there is no one here to debate what is the issue 
or the person in front of us.
  It is time to end this pointless spectacle. The Senate used to be 
called the world's greatest deliberative body. Democrats have turned it 
into the world's most paralyzed deliberative body.
  We have more than 125 nominees for various jobs who have had hearings 
in committee, who have testified in committee, who have been voted on 
in committee, who have cleared through the entire committee-vetting 
process and are now waiting for a vote on the Senate floor--125 of 
them. Most of these people have bipartisan support. They will be 
confirmed easily and eventually. They should be confirmed immediately. 
There should be no reason for Democrats' stalling tactics except, once 
again, to slow down the pace of other progress in the Senate on 
legislative issues.
  Mr. President, look at what happened with one judge last week. It is 
a case you are very familiar with. Scott Palk was nominated by 
President Trump to serve on the U.S. district court. He had bipartisan 
support in the Judiciary Committee. He went to the committee, had a 
hearing in the committee, and with bipartisan support was voted out of 
the committee. That was in June--more than 4 months ago.
  Now, apparently that is not good enough for the Democrats--not at 
all. They are only interested in slowing down the work of the Senate. 
So we had a cloture vote on the nominee. It was 1 of the 47 cloture 
votes that we talked about. We had to have a cloture vote. Every 
Republican and 27 Democrats voted for him. So he had bipartisan 
support. We still had to allow all of this wasted time for the debate. 
We couldn't conduct any of the other business of the Senate during the 
time because the Democrats insisted that we use all of the debate time. 
Now, they could have very easily agreed to waive the rules, as we do, 
and go straight to a vote. We wanted to do that. The Democrats refused.
  So how much of that time--those 30 hours--did the Democrats actually 
spend on the floor debating this person's qualifications to be a 
Federal judge? How many of those 30 hours did the Democrats use? None. 
How many minutes did they use? None. Not one Democrat came to the floor 
of the Senate to talk about that judge. Not a single Democrat even 
bothered to say a word against his nomination. There were fewer than 20 
minutes of total talk on the floor of the Senate. Through hour after 
hour after hour of ongoing time, there were fewer than 20 minutes spent 
actually talking about the judge, and it was all spent in praise by the 
Republicans. We still had to run out the clock because that is the 
delay game the Democrats are playing in the Senate. The Senate had to 
waste hours and hours when we could have finished debating in less than 
20 minutes. The Democrats have done this same thing time after time 
after time, day after day, wasting day after day.
  Things take time in the Senate. We understand that. That is what the 
Founding Fathers had in mind when they formed the two bodies of 
Congress, the House and the Senate. There is no excuse, though, for 
Democrats abusing the process to make things take even longer. 
Democrats aren't using the rules for debate. They are not using the 
rules for deliberation. It is only for delay. It hasn't always been 
this way, and there is no reason it should continue to be this way.
  The Senate had a different standard for nominations a few years ago, 
and that was in the 113th Congress. In years 2013 and 2014, the Senate 
allowed just 2 hours of debate after cloture was invoked on nominations 
for district court judges. That is 2 hours more than the Democrats 
actually spent debating this judge's nomination last week. The rules 
said that we would have up to 8 hours to debate executive branch 
nominations below the Cabinet level. Then, for Cabinet Secretaries, for 
Justices on the Supreme Court, and for circuit courts, it was the full 
30 hours of debate. Thirty hours now is what we allow every nomination 
today, and Democrats have shown that in most cases it is far too much 
time because even though we have to spend all the time, they use very 
little of it talking about the nominees.
  We need a fair debate on every nomination. The procedure from 2013 
and 2014, with fair debate on nominations, is one that was fair. The 
way the Democrats are wasting time today to keep us from doing our work 
is not fair. I believe it is time to return to the rules for debating 
nominees that the Senate used 3 years ago. There will still be plenty 
of time for Senators to debate the nominees, to raise objections if 
there are any. Every Senator could be on the record. There are just a 
lot of hours that we could avoid that are being wasted today that could 
be used to do the people's business of this country. A President's 
nominations of qualified people to important jobs was never meant to be 
a tool for delay in the Senate or to be an obstruction the way the 
Democrats have been using it.
  Now, these rules that we used in 2013 and 2014 were the result of a 
compromise. Democrats controlled the Senate at the time. A Democrat, 
Barack Obama, was in the White House making the nominations, and 
Republicans agreed to make these changes to the rules. It was part of a 
bipartisan group, and I was part of that group. There were eight 
Senators. They worked on this compromise--four Republicans and four 
Democrats. Senator McCain and Senator Alexander were part of this 
group. Senator Schumer, who is now the Democrat leader, was part of 
this group. There was overwhelming support for these changes on both 
sides of the aisle.
  It is time to do it again. Let's change the Senate rules and go back 
to the process that Senator Schumer supported in 2013 and 2014. Today, 
the schedule allows us to do one or two nominations in a typical week. 
If we go back to the 2014 standard, we could clear multiple nominations 
in a day. The Republican Senate has been busy this year, and we have 
made progress on behalf of the American people. We have passed 15 
resolutions rolling back destructive, Obama-era regulations using the 
Congressional Review Act and signed into law by the President. We 
passed a budget that will help give Americans at home a raise by 
cutting their taxes and giving us an opportunity to do the kind of tax 
relief, tax reform, tax reductions, tax cuts that the American people 
are looking for. We need to do more. It is time for Democrats to stop 
abusing the rules just to delay the process. It is time to go back to 
the previous standard of debating nominations. It is time to pick up 
the pace and do the job the American people expect us to do.

  Now, if Democrats have a different approach and don't want to accept 
the standard of debate that was set in the previous Congress, then I 
believe it is time for us to force that change. If Democrats maintain 
their lockstep opposition to real progress on judicial vacancies and 
other nominees, we should give them a chance to vote on their continued 
obstruction. We can vote on these nominees in a straightforward


and efficient way or we can vote to return to the precedent of the 
113th Congress. That is the choice. Either way, it is time to vote.
  Thank you.

"|7
CREC-2017-11-01-pt1-PgS6938-3-8|Mr. BLUMENTHAL|B001277|CREC-2017-11-01-pt1-PgS6938-3|"  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, the magnitude of this moment should be 
apparent to all. A sitting U.S. President's campaign chief and his 
protege have been indicted for conspiring against the United States. 
Another campaign adviser has pleaded guilty for lying to the FBI about 
meetings with Russians. At those meetings, he illegally discussed 
obtaining dirt on the President's political opponent and emails that 
had been stolen.
  Two points need to be underscored for the American people. First, 
these indictments and conviction are a sober, shattering moment in 
American history. Second, all of us on both sides of the aisle should 
come together to support the work of the special counsel and assure 
that he is able to follow the facts and the law and all of the 
evidence, wherever they may lead.
  This moment will stand as a landmark in American history, just as 
many of the moments in Watergate did. This investigation has proceeded 
more quickly than Watergate did. John Mitchell was indicted in 1974 for 
conspiracy, perjury, and obstruction of justice. He was convicted a 
year later. That indictment took a year and a half of investigation. 
These indictments have occurred just 11 months after the election and 
barely 6 months after the beginning of the investigation.
  We know that the President's campaign hired two alleged criminals and 
one admitted criminal. Two of them were foreign agents, and the 
campaign was run by a Russian agent, unregistered, now charged with 
conspiring against the United States. He was supported by another 
Russian foreign agent who was also charged with the same 12 criminal 
counts. These two individuals, Paul Manafort and Rick Gates, were 
significant people in the Trump campaign.
  In the case of Gates, his influence continued through the early 
months of the new administration. Manafort ran Trump's campaign at its 
most critical point, and he organized and directed the 2016 Republican 
National Committee convention, including the critical delegate-
corralling effort against a potential ``Never Trump'' insurrection, 
securing the Republican nomination for Donald Trump.
  Under Manafort's leadership of the Trump campaign, the Republican 
Party stripped language from their platform that would have called for 
arming Ukraine against Russian aggression. Ahead of the convention, 
Manafort also offered to brief a Russian billionaire on the state of 
the 2016 race. The convention he helped organize became a venue for a 
meeting between Attorney General Sessions and the Russian ambassador, 
after which the Attorney General misled Congress, implying--indeed 
stating--that it never took place.
  The Trump campaign also worked extensively with George Papadopoulos, 
a foreign adviser whose actions constitute the most significant 
indication of possible collusion--so far the most significant--between 
the Trump campaign and Russian officials.
  Papadopoulos was named a foreign policy adviser in March 2016 and 
began communicating with Russian nationals the next month. He met with 
a professor for breakfast in London. They discussed stolen emails from 
Hillary Clinton and subsequently shuttled messages to the Kremlin and 
back for the Trump campaign.
  He worked with officials at the highest level of the Trump campaign. 
His direct boss, in fact, was Jeff Sessions, who was then the head of 
Trump's national security advisory committee, and he is now, of course, 
the Attorney General. He communicated extensively with the campaign 
manager and members of the national security team.
  President Trump tweeted today that he was a ``young, low level 
volunteer,'' but the President sang his praises at a meeting with the 
Washington Post editorial board in March 2016, calling him an ``energy 
and oil consultant, excellent guy.'' These revelations are stunning.
  Now the President is at a critical juncture. He can choose the course 
of cooperation or confrontation. He is literally teetering on the brink 
of a decision that could prove disastrous for himself and for America 
if he chooses a constitutional confrontation.
  We are at a moment very much like the one that occurred in Watergate. 
It is still memorable to many of us in this Chamber, although we were 
not here at the time. Our Nation could be careening toward a 
constitutional crisis. Some of the actions the President has already 
taken, such as firing Jim Comey as FBI Director, may be evidence of 
obstruction of justice in the investigation by the special counsel. As 
part of our oversight responsibility, the Judiciary Committee must 
continue its work in investigating that firing and other actions that 
may constitute obstruction of justice.
  Firing the special counsel himself is something only the President 
could try to do. It would be the ultimate act of contempt for the rule 
of law that is rightly seen as the actions of someone who has something 
to hide.
  At stake is more than just this President or this special counsel. It 
is literally the rule of law. To this President, the rule of law may be 
meaningless, a facade or a fiction, but that is exactly why Congress 
must give the judicial branch specific, enforceable power to stop the 
President from firing the special counsel.
  That is the purpose of legislation I have introduced, along with 
colleagues. I am here to call upon this body to support and pass the 
Special Counsel Independence Protection Act.
  I called for the special counsel to be established in February of 
this year and was joined by 10 of my colleagues in that call. It was 
based on credible allegations that the Trump team had colluded with the 
Russian Government. The Special Counsel Independence Protection Act, 
which I have cosponsored along with colleagues, seeks to forestall the 
kind of potential constitutional crisis raised by the President's 
threats not so long ago and his labeling the investigation a hoax and a 
witch hunt.
  The Washington Post reported today that advisers close to the 
President are urging that, in fact, he take more aggressive action 
against the special counsel. The specter of Presidential action against 
Robert Mueller, designed to stop or stymie a virtually unavoidable and 
necessary criminal investigation of the President himself, makes 
safeguarding the special counsel more urgent and necessary now than 
ever before.
  Rather than encouraging Presidential abuse of power by inaction, the 
Congress must move forward right away to check potential malfeasance 
and abuse before it occurs. Even the threat of such political 
interference constituting potential obstruction of justice undermines 
the special counsel's investigation. It makes witnesses less likely to 
cooperate. It discourages the agents and investigators working for the 
special counsel. It creates unnecessary confusion in the American 
public. Only judicial review can provide the check against such abuse 
and ensure confidence that the special counsel will proceed 
methodically and systematically to uphold the rule of law and follow 
the facts in evidence, wherever they may lead. That is what the 
American people want him to do. That is what we should guarantee that 
he will do. Make no mistake, this investigation will continue and 
conclude fairly and fully. The only question is how much turmoil and 
how much damage is done in the course of that investigation.
  Clearly, like any investigation and prosecution, this one is a 
mosaic, consisting of many different diverse pieces and already it is 
coming together on the Trump campaign's contacts with Russian 
officials. They include, for example, campaign adviser Papadopoulos's 
contacts with a Russian agent who claimed he had ``dirt'' on Hillary 
Clinton; Donald Trump, Jr., and the campaign aides' Trump Tower meeting 
with Russian agents to obtain information on Clinton; Jared


Kushner's meetings with sanctioned VEB Russian bank CEO Sergey Gorkov; 
Sessions' meetings with the Russian Ambassador; the Cambridge Analytica 
CEO's outreach to WikiLeaks to obtain Hillary Clinton's missing emails; 
and former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn's dining with 
President Putin in Moscow. Those pieces of the mosaic are only the 
beginning. We are at a critical stage--the end of the beginning, not 
the beginning of the end.
  As a former prosecutor, I know investigations take time. The best 
investigations are done without deadlines. In an important case like 
this one, and in a complex and challenging one, we must allow all the 
time necessary to assemble that full mosaic and put together the pieces 
of this puzzle.
  The Watergate scandal took 2 years to unravel, from Bob Woodward and 
Carl Bernstein's first piece in the Washington Post in June of 1972 to 
Nixon's resignation in August of 1974. We are less than a year into the 
Trump Presidency and fewer than 10 months into this investigation.
  The first individuals to be indicted in the Watergate scandal were 
considered to be generally outside the President's inner circle. They 
were E. Howard Hunt, G. Gordon Liddy, and the Watergate burglars in 
September of 1972. No one knew--and many denied--the conspiracy that 
involved the President and his top lieutenants at the time of those 
first indictments. In these cases, too--in these first indictments and 
conviction--a lot more is to come.
  We cannot wait until the President potentially shuts down his special 
counsel to come to his defense. Already, the rule of law is under 
threat. On Sunday--the day before the indictments were handed down--the 
President tweeted: ``DO SOMETHING!'' with regard to the Russia 
investigation. Although his reference was unclear exactly what he meant 
and whom the message was targeting, it certainly was an indication that 
some kind of action might be taken to thwart the investigation.
  Any interference in this investigation will be a red line for me and 
for others in this Chamber. Let the President hear that message loud 
and clear. There is a red line that cannot be crossed. It is political 
interference or intrusion in the special counsel's investigation, and 
it will be met with a firestorm, I hope, on both sides of the aisle. My 
conversations with our colleagues on the other side of the aisle 
indicate they would share our outrage and outcry if there is an effort 
to stop and stymie this investigation or if there is any other kind of 
political interference in it.
  Senators Graham, Booker, Whitehouse, Coons, and I have cosponsored 
measures that will help protect the special counsel. There are two 
measures now, but they are so closely similar that they should be 
brought together, and conversations are underway to do so. I expect we 
will have a single bill in the very near future.
  We should stand with one voice against obstruction of this 
investigation. I ask that my colleagues go on the record now to state 
that they will absolutely resist and oppose any interference by the 
executive branch into this investigation or investigations that are 
underway by our congressional committees--on the House side, the 
Intelligence Committee and, in the Senate, the Judiciary Committee 
along with our Intelligence Committee. The congressional committees 
have separate purposes. In the Judiciary Committee, we have the unique 
responsibility of oversight over the Department of Justice and the FBI. 
We have the unique responsibility to prevent the obstruction of justice 
and to uncover it, as is indicated by the firing of Jim Comey. My hope 
is that investigation will proceed and that it will be bipartisan, so 
we will have hearings and subpoena witnesses with public testimony 
under oath and eventually some report to the American people. That is 
my hope, and that will be our decision here.
  The decision we cannot and should not make is what the outcome will 
be of the special counsel investigation. We must guarantee--and we have 
this responsibility in the Congress--that there is adequate funding and 
authority for the special counsel, that there is no effort to either 
cut resources or limit the purview of the special counsel or place 
constraints on the time it may take for this probe to conclude. There 
should be no firing and no pardons, and we should speak out and stand 
up to assure that message reaches the White House loud and clear.
  This moment is one of historic magnitude. I cannot emphasize how 
strongly I feel but also how deeply my colleagues have expressed to me 
their own feelings about our responsibility in this moment.
  The grand jury that is bringing these indictments is an arm of the 
courts, which should be independent of both the executive and 
legislative branches. That independence gives the special counsel some 
new measure of permanence and protection, but the President can still 
try to fire the special counsel. He cannot fire the grand jury or the 
U.S. District Court judge who impaneled the grand jury. Judicial review 
of any firing of the special counsel, which is the core principle of 
our measure--the Special Counsel Independence Protection Act--would add 
a highly significant protection to not just deter misguided and deeply 
mistaken actions, throwing our Nation into turmoil, but also assuring 
that confidence and trust remains with the special counsel, and he can 
follow facts and the law with the full support of the American people. 
The American people can put their trust and faith in him and in our 
courts. We should assure that we uphold that faith and trust.
  Thank you.
  I yield the floor."|8

                               Healthcare
"|11
CREC-2017-11-01-pt1-PgS6938-3-12|Mrs. MURRAY|M001111|CREC-2017-11-01-pt1-PgS6938-3|"  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, since day one, the President of the 
United States has made it clear that his top priority, when it comes to 
healthcare in our country, is to score political points by attacking 
ObamaCare. He has even said repeatedly that healthcare in our country 
will ``implode,'' but this was not just a prediction that President 
Trump made, it was his goal, and he has tried virtually everything he 
can do to make that implosion a reality.
  In January, he abruptly pulled funding for outreach days before the 
end of the 2017 open enrollment period without any analysis of how that 
might affect patients and families, and he signed executive orders 
specifically designed to inject uncertainty and increased costs into 
the healthcare system.
  President Trump then dedicated the spring and summer to attempting to 
jam partisan, extraordinarily destructive legislation through the House 
and Senate to repeal the Affordable Care Act, despite one independent 
analysis after another showing that each version of TrumpCare would 
cause premiums to spike, take coverage away from millions of people, 
rip protections away from patients with preexisting conditions, and gut 
Medicaid.
  This fall--after TrumpCare failed another time in the Senate--he 
slashed by 90 percent the investments that help inform families about 
their coverage options and followed through on his year-long threat to 
discontinue payments designed to lower out-of-pocket costs for low-
income enrollees.
  This is a scenario that healthcare experts said would cause mass 
consumer confusion and anxiety, one that insurance companies planned 
for by shifting that burden of uncertainty to patients and taxpayers in 
the form of higher premiums and fewer options in State marketplaces.
  Now, this is by no means the full list of ways President Trump has 
attempted his healthcare sabotage, but it does explain why we are here 
now. Today is the first day of the open enrollment period for 2018, and 
as a direct result of this President's actions, families are going to 
see higher premiums, more out-of-pocket costs, and fewer coverage 
options. Many families will have to change their coverage if they want 
to avoid paying hundreds of dollars more in premiums.
  At a time when we need to continue to do more to bend the healthcare 
cost curve in the right direction, taxpayers are being burdened with 
higher


healthcare costs to the Federal Government--not because of any 
improvement in quality or comprehensiveness, just because of the chaos 
this administration has caused.
  In fact, just last week, the Trump administration proposed a rule to 
double down on the sabotage in 2019 that would let insurers cover fewer 
services in addition to raising costs. I have to say, I just truly 
never imagined that a President of the United States would so openly 
and uncaringly root for the people of this country to be worse off. But 
that is exactly what President Trump is doing. It needs to be said, and 
it needs to be stopped.

  What makes this even more frustrating is that a lot of it could have 
been stopped months ago if Republican leaders hadn't insisted on trying 
to help this administration carry out its partisan, wrecking-ball 
healthcare strategy.
  Back in September, Chairman Alexander and I were very near agreement 
on a bipartisan bill to stabilize healthcare markets and protect 
families from higher premiums and out-of-pocket costs through regular 
order, through a process that actually engaged over half the Senate. We 
were on the verge of reaching an agreement when Republican leaders 
froze our negotiations. Why? In order to jam TrumpCare through the 
Senate one more time.
  Let me repeat that. Republican leaders hit the pause button on a 
bipartisan process that could have lowered premiums and stabilized 
markets, exposing our patients and families to the full impact of 
President Trump's sabotage.
  That is the bad news, but the good news is that the legislation 
Chairman Alexander and I ultimately agreed on can and will still have 
an impact--not just a few years from now but in 2018--if Republican 
leaders don't stand in the way again. Our bill would, among other 
priorities, continue out-of-pocket cost reduction payments and make 
sure that patients and families, not insurance companies, see the 
benefit of that certainty in the form of rebates next year. The 
legislation Chairman Alexander and I have proposed, with 12 Democratic 
and 12 Republican cosponsors, would do a lot to help us get things back 
on track. It would tie President Trump's hands on sabotage, and it 
would send a very powerful message that elected officials in Congress 
can work together to get things done when we focus on common ground 
rather than scoring political points.
  I would once again urge the majority leader to allow our legislation 
to get a vote. It has the support of 60-plus Senators, and it is 
growing. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has said that it 
provides billions in savings and would stabilize the markets this year 
and lower premiums in 2019. And the President told Chairman Alexander 
that he supports this process moving forward.
  There is no reason to wait. There is absolutely no excuse for 
inaction, and I am going to continue doing everything I can to make 
that clear until Republican leaders finally listen to the patients and 
families they serve.
  Mr. President, while I am here today, I also want to take a few 
minutes to speak on another way that I believe President Trump and 
Republicans are taking our country in a direction that is deeply 
harmful; that is, by stacking our courts with extreme conservative 
judges.
  The Senate this week is going to vote on four judicial nominees who 
each have the far-rightwing seal of approval. Two are on President 
Trump's short list for Supreme Court Justices, meaning they would 
automatically vote to overturn Roe v. Wade. Unfortunately, their views 
on many things--LGBTQ rights, sexual assault, criminal justice, and 
corporate interests--are just as deeply troubling. One of the nominees 
we are considering this week advocated for using electric shocks for 
criminal punishment, and two--Amy Barrett and Stephanos Bibas--were 
nominated only after Republicans blocked the nominations of Myra Selby 
and Rebecca Haywood--both who happen to be African-American women--to 
the respective benches.
  It is clear that as Republican leaders' list of legislative failures 
grows longer, their effort to enact their agenda by administrative 
action and by stacking the courts is only going to accelerate. That 
might appeal to extreme conservatives--in fact, I am pretty sure it 
does--but the truth is that whether it is healthcare or infrastructure 
or taxes, most people across the country really want to see Congress 
working together.
  I am going to continue doing everything I can to speak out and fight 
back against extreme, harmful steps that are being taken by this 
administration and allowed by Republican leaders here in Congress and 
also to show there is a better way to get things done--by working under 
regular order, across the aisle, and putting people, not politics, 
first. That is what families rightfully expect, and that is what we all 
should be focused on.
  Mr. President, I yield the floor."|12

                               Healthcare

  Mr. President, I also rise today to encourage Granite Staters--as my 
colleague from Washington did--and people across the country to take 
advantage of the health insurance open enrollment period, which begins 
today and runs through December 15.
  Every citizen deserves quality, affordable health insurance coverage 
to help them live healthy and productive lives. Access to healthcare is 
critical to the freedom, dignity, and well-being of our citizens, and 
it also contributes to a productive workforce and a thriving economy.
  I still remember meeting with a constituent named Jo, about a year or 
two ago, who has a chronic health condition. When she lost her job in 
2009 and lost her health insurance with it, her condition deteriorated 
to the point where she couldn't work, and a downward spiral ensued. She 
lost her home. She couldn't get healthcare because she had no 
resources. Because of the Affordable Care Act's Medicaid expansion, she 
was eventually able to get healthcare, to get the surgery and therapy 
she needed, and now she is working again. So healthcare is not only for 
the benefit of the individual who receives it; it helps that individual 
become a productive member of our workforce.
  Affordable, quality care is also critically important to those who 
are working but may not otherwise be able to afford health insurance 
even if employed. It is something I have heard often this year from 
citizens of my State, as my Republican colleagues attempted to pass 
TrumpCare legislation that would have led to higher healthcare costs 
for less care.
  At an emergency field hearing in June that I held with Senator 
Shaheen, we heard from a woman named Enna from Exeter, NH. Enna, who is 
self-employed, said that prior to the Affordable Care Act, her family 
was unable to maintain insurance consistently. Even when she did have 
it, her previous policy didn't cover critical preventive care that she 
needed. As a result of the ACA, Enna has been able to purchase 
affordable health insurance through the marketplace in New Hampshire 
for herself and her family of four, giving them the peace of mind that 
comes with having health insurance, while continuing to grow her own 
business.
  Enna's story is the story of so many people in New Hampshire, and it 
represents why it is essential for people across the country to take 
advantage of this open enrollment period.
  From today through December 15, Granite Staters and all Americans 
have an opportunity to sign up for a healthcare plan at 
www.coveringnewhampshire.org or www.healthcare.gov. It is also 
important for people to take this opportunity to see what other plans 
are available, to shop around and see whether other plans offer more 
savings than their current one does, and it is critical to educate our 
friends and neighbors about these options, given the Trump 
administration's attempts to sabotage our Nation's healthcare


system. These sabotage attempts include the Department of Health and 
Human Services slashing the Affordable Care Act's outreach and 
advertising budgets ahead of open enrollment, which provide key 
information and resources for those who need to sign up for care. It is 
clear that the Trump administration doesn't want people to know they 
can enroll, but that doesn't change the fact that the Affordable Care 
Act is the law of the land, people can still get covered, and financial 
assistance is available for many on the healthcare exchange.
  We must end this sabotage and continue to work together on efforts to 
lower costs and build on and improve the Affordable Care Act, and that 
is exactly what I am focused on.
  I was proud to join HELP Committee leaders, Senators Alexander and 
Murray, to cosponsor bipartisan legislation that would stabilize health 
insurance markets and lower costs for hard-working Americans. This bill 
includes a provision that the New Hampshire Insurance Department could 
use to support its proposal to create a reinsurance pool to help reduce 
premiums in our State's individual health insurance market. This 
legislation proves it is possible to work across party lines to make 
progress in our healthcare system. It is clear that it has the votes to 
pass. We need Republican leadership to bring it up for a vote.
  It is up to all of us to come together and make sure that healthcare 
is truly available and affordable to all of our people and to encourage 
our fellow citizens to sign up for the care they need to help their 
families thrive.
  The enrollment period is a critical time for the health and well-
being of our citizens and for our productivity, as well, as a country. 
I encourage Granite Staters to take advantage of this opportunity and 
receive the benefits that come with affordable healthcare.
  Mr. President, I also want to take a moment to address the continued 
efforts this week from President Trump and my Republican colleagues to 
push through nominees who will truly reshape our Federal judiciary.
  An independent and impartial judiciary is critical to democracy and 
to our march toward progress. Our Founders established our court system 
to serve as an independent arbiter that would protect the rights of all 
Americans and ensure equal justice under our laws. Unfortunately, the 
nominees who have been selected by the President and who have been 
voted on throughout this year have been handpicked by far-right groups 
to serve a conservative agenda. We have seen judicial nominees who have 
not committed to upholding the precedent of Roe v. Wade and protecting 
a woman's right to make her own healthcare decisions and control her 
own destiny in doing so, nominees who have stood against basic rights 
and freedoms for LGBTQ Americans and who have opposed protections for 
workers' rights. This is unacceptable.
  We are voting on lifetime appointments that require a commitment to 
equal justice, objectivity, and sound judgment. I will continue to 
oppose judicial nominees who do not live up to those standards, and I 
urge my colleagues to do the same.
  Mr. President, I yield the floor."|14

CREC-2017-11-01-pt1-PgS6938-3-18|Mr. GRASSLEY|G000386|CREC-2017-11-01-pt1-PgS6938-3|"  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I would like to address the issue we are 
voting on in a few minutes. The Senate will vote on the nomination of 
Michigan Supreme Court Justice Joan Larsen to serve on the Sixth 
Circuit Court of Appeals.
  Though she currently lives in Michigan, Justice Larsen was born in 
and hails from my State of Iowa. In fact, she and I share the same alma 
mater, the University of Northern Iowa, for our bachelor's degrees. I 
have also learned, since meeting Justice Larsen, that her father was 
the longtime CEO of the Lutheran Services in Iowa. He is now retired, 
but during the time he was the CEO, he was the very same person with 
whom I often met for breakfast when he would come to Washington to tell 
us about the concerns of the Lutheran Services in Iowa. At that time, I 
never knew I might be speaking in favor of his daughter. I didn't even 
know of his daughter at that time. So I am proud to see a fellow Iowan 
and such an eminently qualified nominee be nominated to the Sixth 
Circuit Court of Appeals.
  For those who may not be familiar with her career and 
accomplishments, a few minutes will give me an opportunity to share 
them with you. I think you will find, as I have, that Justice Larsen is 
particularly well suited to serve as a Federal appellate judge.
  Justice Larsen has an outstanding academic record, having received 
numerous awards during her undergraduate and law school careers. 
Justice Larsen was a Presidential Scholar at the University of Northern 
Iowa and graduated with the highest honors. She graduated first in her 
class at the Northwestern University Pritzker School of Law, where she 
won the Justice John Paul Stevens Award for Academic Excellence and 
served as editor of the Northwestern University Law Review.
  She began her legal career as a clerk for Judge Sentelle on the DC 
Circuit Court of Appeals and then clerked for Justice Scalia on the 
U.S. Supreme Court. Following her clerkships, Justice Larsen joined the 
DC firm of Sidley Austin, one of the largest law firms in the United 
States. Justice Larsen spent 2 years as Deputy Assistant Attorney 
General for the Office of Legal Counsel, where she provided legal 
advice to the President and executive agencies on difficult issues of 
constitutional and statutory interpretation.
  Justice Larsen has taught constitutional law and criminal law at the 
University of Michigan Law School since 1998, where she has earned the 
respect of faculty members and students alike. She won the L. Hart 
Wright Award for Excellence in Teaching early in her teaching career. 
In addition to her teaching responsibilities, Justice Larsen ran 
Michigan's clerkship program, helping hundreds of students and alumni 
pursue clerkships at the Federal and State levels. As an adjunct 
professor, she continues to run the law school's Moot Court Program.
  Her colleagues at the University of Michigan praised Justice Larsen 
and wrote:

       Even among the talented and ambitious lawyers at an elite 
     law school, Joan stands out for her ability to make the 
     penetrating insight that untangles some knotty problem of 
     statutory interpretation or judiciary doctrine. Especially 
     distinctive, moreover, is the rigor and even-handedness she 
     brings to her analysis.

  I will share one more example from that letter because I think it 
addresses some of my colleagues' concerns, who are on the other side of 
the aisle, as to her approach to the law.
  Her colleagues wrote:

       For those of us who have found ourselves on the opposite 
     side of a debate with Joan about a case, a statute, or some 
     broader issue of constitutional history, she has demonstrated 
     time and again that she is both a gracious and intellectually 
     honest partner in the collaborative project of figuring 
     things out. What matters for Joan is not winning but working 
     out the right answer.

  Now I bring emphasis to this last sentence.

       Even when you disagree with her, it is impossible not to 
     respect her and to take pleasure in the process of refining 
     the issues actually in dispute.

  In other words, as I see it, Justice Larsen is and will be a jurist 
who seeks to find the right answer, never simply one she prefers as a 
matter of policy.
  We can already see from her time on the Michigan Supreme Court that 
Justice Larsen is a principled jurist with an impressive legal acumen. 
She has served with distinction on that court since she was appointed 
in 2015. It happens that she was elected to the position in 2016, in 
her own right, by a resounding majority, winning every county in 
Michigan. Colleagues on the court have praised her sharp legal 
analysis, her clear and crisp writing, and, most importantly, her work 
ethic.
  Outside the courtroom, Justice Larsen is actively involved in 
volunteer efforts to serve disadvantaged children, and she works with 
Michigan's veterans, drugs, sobriety, and mental health court programs.
  Some of my colleagues have said they will not support the nomination


because Justice Larsen was included on President Trump's short list for 
the Supreme Court. Is there anything wrong with the President 
suggesting whom he is going to put on the Supreme Court if he is 
elected President? If you look at her background, it should be no 
surprise that she was included on that list. She is an accomplished 
legal academic, a mainstream jurist, and is well respected on a 
bipartisan basis throughout the legal community.
  Because my colleagues have been concerned about everyone on that 
list, at her hearing, I asked Justice Larsen when she learned that her 
name was on that list. She replied: ``The date it was announced . . . 
it was a complete surprise to me.''
  I also asked her about judicial independence and whether she could 
rule against the President who nominated her.
  She replied:

       I would have no trouble ruling against the President who 
     appointed me or any successor President as well. Judicial 
     independence means one thing, one very simple thing--

  At this point I want to emphasize--

     and that is putting the law above everything else, the 
     statutes passed by this body, and the Constitution of the 
     United States. So I would have absolutely no trouble, and, 
     indeed, that would be my duty.

  Here is the most outrageous reason I have heard for voting against 
Justice Larsen. This should surprise a lot of people. Some in the 
minority have suggested that she is somehow responsible for outside 
groups running ads that support her nomination in Michigan. The claim 
that she is responsible for the action of an outside group is 
ridiculous, and the allegation that these ads are in some way a 
guarantee of how she will rule in the future is the most absurd thing I 
have heard based upon her answers to my questions.
  I find it interesting that my colleagues who are complaining about 
conservative groups do not seem to have the same concern for groups on 
the left that are spending money in opposition to these nominees. One 
such group, Alliance for Justice, routinely issues reports and press 
releases on judicial nominees. Oftentimes, these so-called reports put 
forward incendiary and false criticisms of these nominees. My 
colleagues even make the same incendiary attacks against the nominees 
as these outside groups do. In other words, they use the same talking 
points. I do not hear that my colleagues on the other side are up in 
arms about their spending millions of dollars to oppose nominees.
  Of course, some may remember that last year groups on the left 
coordinated attacks on this Senator. I was followed all over Iowa by 
these groups and their members. They ran ads against me and put up 
billboards that opposed my election, and that had something to do with 
the Supreme Court, as one might recall. I don't remember hearing any of 
my colleagues on the other side of the aisle complain about all of the 
money those groups were spending at that time.
  As I have said before, I expect that outside groups on the left and 
on the right want to have their voices heard in the nomination process. 
Isn't that something to do with what we call democracy, representative 
government, freedom of speech, freedom of association? There is nothing 
wrong with that, whether it is done by the right or the left, but I 
take issue with complaints from the other side that do not acknowledge 
that all sides have interest groups that are spending and engaging in 
the judicial nomination process. It was completely appropriate for 
Justice Larsen not to wade in on the political debate regarding those 
political ads. Her answers to those questions were exactly what I would 
expect an independent nominee to say, particularly if she wants to be 
independent of any President who appoints her when she is appointed to 
the bench.
  Justice Larsen's nomination is supported by a broad and diverse 
coalition of lawyers, judges, and academic colleagues. It is easy to 
see why, for she is an accomplished and well-respected academic. She is 
a brilliant and independent jurist. Her careful and well-reasoned legal 
analysis puts her squarely within the mainstream of legal thought. I 
urge my colleagues, in a few minutes, to vote for her nomination.
  I yield the floor.
  I suggest the absence of a quorum."|18

Christian Community for Action (ACCA) on the occasion of its 50th 
anniversary. In 1967, Fred and Emily Ruffing realized that there was a 
great need for childcare services for low-income and working poor 
families who did not qualify for subsidized daycare. They decided that 
they needed to take action to address this problem so they organized a 
meeting with representatives from eight local churches to set up a day 
care center and ACCA was born.
   Since 1967, ACCA has continued to grow not only in size but in the 
number of services provided. What began as a group of eight churches 50 
years ago has grown to 26 member congregations. ACCA has also partnered 
with the Fairfax County Department of Neighborhood and Community 
Services (NCS) and its services and programs as well as the model of 
faith community and government partnership begun by ACCA has been 
replicated all throughout Fairfax County.
   ACCA gives back to the community in a variety of ways. The Child 
Development Center (CDC) provides both developmental childcare and 
early childhood education to over 200 toddlers, preschoolers and 
infants. The ACCA Pantry collects from churches, schools, community 
groups and local businesses and delivers food and other necessities on 
an emergency basis to area households. ACCA's Emergency Assistance 
program handles financial emergencies such as payment for rent, 
utilities, prescription drugs, and minor car repairs for low-income 
families who have few resources to fall back on in a time of crisis.
   The 26 partner ministries provide a safety net while the families 
recover stability. Furniture ministry volunteers collect and distribute 
gently used furniture to needy recipients, while volunteers from the 
Transportation ministry provide rides to medical appointments. Meals on 
Wheels volunteers deliver meals every weekday to elderly residents who 
cannot fend for themselves. ACCA volunteers also spend a Saturday in 
April repairing houses--more than 110 homes have been repaired or 
rehabilitated since 1990. With the exception of the CDC, all of these 
services are provided by volunteers.
   Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in thanking the staff 
and volunteers of ACCA and in congratulating them on this incredible 
milestone. Civic engagement is the foundation of a healthy community, 
and Fairfax County residents enjoy an exceptional quality of life due 
in part to the efforts of these individuals. Their contributions have 
been a great benefit to our community and truly merit our highest 
praise.

Joseph McGrath for his induction into the Wisconsin Military Academy 
Hall of Fame. LTC McGrath's long and distinguished career is 
highlighted by the numerous accolades and successes he achieved during 
his service in the United States Army and Wisconsin Army National 
Guard.
   LTC McGrath has been an integral factor in protecting America's 
security interests here at home, while also spreading peace around the 
world. Following the tragic events of September 11, 2001, LTC McGrath 
deployed to Nicaragua to help ensure the security of the Nicaraguan 
President and establish the future success of the joint Wisconsin-
Nicaragua partnership.
   In 2004, LTC McGrath was deployed to Afghanistan to direct 
operations in support of the Kandak ETT comprised of American and 
Coalition partners. LTC McGrath was also instrumental in providing 
direct liaison with the UN Ballot Counting teams, while also 
coordinating physical security for the provincial ballot collection 
compound during the Afghan Presidential election.
   Upon his return to the United States, LTC McGrath's leadership led 
to the creation of the Warrant Officer Candidate School at the 426th 
Regiment, a fiscally responsible move that brought greater strength and 
security to Wisconsin.
   LTC McGrath received the Bronze Star, among many other awards, for 
his honorable service and dedication to our country. LTC McGrath's 
commitment and courage have left a profound impact on the men and women 
he led and served with across the world, as well as continued security 
of our great nation.

commending LTC Joseph McGrath for his dedicated military service and 
congratulate his induction into the Wisconsin Military Academy Hall of

Silvana loved to play hockey. In her Massachusetts hometown, hockey was 
more of a way of life than just a sport.
  Her parents knew she was talented, and supported her dream to play 
even in college. When she was offered a scholarship in 2011, to be the 
goalie for the University of Connecticut, Silvana felt like all of her 
dreams had come true, so she eagerly accepted.
  She pulled out of her driveway with her packed clothes and hockey 
gear, but she could have never known that in a few days her life would 
change forever. She could not have foreseen how a lifetime of hard work 
and ambition would suddenly disappear tragically.
  Like all new students, she was eager to immerse herself in her new 
college life. On the third day at the university, Silvana went to a 
house party with some new friends she met. But, after two drinks, she 
began to feel dizzy, numb, and lethargic. She quickly lost the ability 
to walk, and she became very ill. As she drifted out of consciousness, 
a male hockey player at the party instructed others to carry her to his 
bedroom. When she woke up, she found him on top of her, sexually 
assaulting her.
  She immediately turned to the university for help and reported the 
assault at The Women's Center. But the counselor did not tell her to 
call the police, advise her to press charges, or help her in any way.
  Silvana then went to the on-campus doctor. But instead of treating 
her like a victim and offering her the care and support she needed, the 
doctor told her that he didn't want to know who assaulted her. Get 
this, Mr. Speaker: the doctor told her, the remedy was for her to 
transfer to another university. This is awful.
  One in five women on our university campuses are sexually assaulted. 
Of those, less than 25 percent even report the rape.
  It took an extraordinary amount of courage for Silvana to report that 
sexual assault, especially to multiple people she didn't even know. She 
was offered no help or no support by anyone. She was alone, and she 
felt it.
  The doctor wasn't trained to deal with rape victims and made it clear 
he wanted nothing more to do with Silvana. The university clearly 
viewed Silvana as a burden, just another statistic they didn't want to 
deal with.
  Mr. Speaker, universities in the United States should be required to 
have a victim advocate on staff, a sexual assault victim advocate. 
Also, to ensure that this doesn't happen to more victims at hospitals, 
I have introduced legislation that would require a hospital to provide 
access to a staffer--it is called a SAFE, sexual assault forensic 
examiner--who is trained to provide care and be sensitive to trauma 
rape victims, or have a plan to get that victim to a nearby hospital 
that does. Universities and nearby hospitals need to work together to 
make sure that rape victims are treated appropriately when they are 
assaulted on campus.
  The bill that I just mentioned is named the Megan Rondini Act. It is 
in honor of a college sexual assault victim on the University of 
Alabama campus, who was a Texas student, who was denied access to post-
rape treatment at a hospital. The university didn't help her, and the 
local law enforcement didn't help her.


  In Megan's case, because she was alone and abandoned by all three of 
those entities, when she returned to Texas, she later committed 
suicide.
  Anyway, after the rape of Silvana, the university left Silvana to 
pick up the pieces of her shattered life. She was traumatized and 
depressed. Claiming that she wasn't stable enough, the hockey coach 
removed her from the team. She never played a single game of hockey in 
college. She withdrew from the University of Connecticut shortly 
thereafter, but her rapist stayed on his hockey team and played for the 
university. Silvana had to successfully sue the university to get 
justice. She had to take the matter to court, where society and our 
justice system should have helped her initially.
  Mr. Speaker, rape is never the fault of the victim, yet Silvana felt 
that she was the one being blamed for what happened to her.
  We as a society must demand our universities and hospitals protect 
and care for sexual assault victims. No longer should they be allowed 
to suffer alone and be abandoned. No more excuses.
  And that is just the way it is.

  I think it is important that we note that a good coach can have a 
major impact on a kid's life. Coaches don't just teach a game to our 
kids, they ingrain important life skills in their minds. They teach our 
kids how to work with others and how to act as a team. They teach our 
children the value of practice and perseverance, and they teach our 
kids how to compete with honor, dignity, and how to win with grace.
  A good coach guides our kids along the road to success, which is why

to delay the release of their tax plan because it is so deeply 
unpopular. We haven't seen all of the details yet, but what we know 
about it is that this is really bad for working families.
  The nonpartisan Tax Policy Center says that the Republican plan 
raises taxes on many middle class families to pay for a massive tax cut 
for the people at the very top, the wealthiest Americans.
  The details matter. A family of four earning $50,000 could see their 
taxes go up 380 percent. Meanwhile, 80 percent of the benefits of this 
``billionaires first'' tax plan go to the richest 1 percent--80 percent 
of the benefits to the richest 1 percent. That is not middle class tax 
relief.
  And how do we pay for these massive tax cuts to the wealthy? What are 
we going to do?
  We are going to see cuts in Medicare, Medicaid, and education.
  If anybody thinks we can do this and go big on infrastructure and 
rebuild America's capacity to produce, they better think twice. Plus, 
saddling our grandkids with a huge debt.
  What happened to the deficit hawks in this place?
  This is wrong, and we ought to reject it.

Florida International University. Tuberous sclerosis complex, or TSC, 
is a rare genetic disease that causes uncontrollable tumor growth 
across the face, body, and organs of impacted individuals.
  Unfortunately, there is no cure for TSC. South Florida's own hero, 
Max Lucca, pictured here, was diagnosed with TSC when he was only 2 
weeks old. Now, he is 9 years old, and he has thrived because of the 
constant love and care provided by his parents, Vanessa and Max. The 
TSC Miami Walk brings together patients like Max Lucca and their 
families with supporters who are committed to improving their lives.
  Every year, the walk plays an essential role in advancing lifesaving 
research and programs to increase awareness of TSC, and expanding the 
network of resources that improve the lives of patients and their 
families.
  Mr. Speaker, I would like to recognize the work of Vanessa Vazquez; 
her husband, Max; and all of the other activists who are so needed from 
the Tuberous Sclerosis Alliance who work so hard to make this walk a 
reality.
  I want to thank everyone who came out to FIU last Saturday and made 
this event a resounding success. Due to your efforts, due to your 
commitment, I am confident that we will be able to increase the 
research and education needed to find a cure for this tragic disease.
  Meanwhile, go Max Lucca.


             Commit to Ending Pediatric HIV/AIDS Worldwide

CREC-2017-11-01-pt1-PgH8305-2|Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN|R000435|CREC-2017-11-01-pt1-PgH8305|"  Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I would like to encourage my 
colleagues to support H. Res. 593, a bipartisan resolution reaffirming 
our national commitment to ending pediatric HIV/AIDS worldwide.
  It is a resolution that I introduced with my friend, Congresswoman 
Barbara Lee. The fight against pediatric AIDS is a great example of how 
our country is a positive and transformative force in the lives of many 
across the world. Because of our leadership here in the United States 
over the past 12 years, there has been a 62 percent increase in the 
number of women receiving mother-to-child transmissions prevention 
services. Wow.
  Thanks to positive American involvement through programs like PEPFAR, 
more than 11.5 million expectant mothers around the world have received 
HIV testing and counseling, and nearly 2 million babies have been born 
HIV-free.
  However, even though we have made great strides in a fight against 
pediatric AIDS over the last few years, we cannot rest, Mr. Speaker. We 
cannot rest while more than 400 children around the world are born with 
HIV every day; 400. We cannot rest when less than half of the children 
suffering from HIV have access to the lifesaving treatments they so 
desperately need; less than half. Indeed, we must redouble our efforts 
to reach every single mother and child impacted by this terrible 
disease.
  For this reason, my friend, Congresswoman Barbara Lee, and I just 
reintroduced H. Res. 593, a bipartisan resolution recommitting our 
country, the United States, to eradicating pediatric AIDS worldwide and 
supporting those who have been impacted by this epidemic. Our 
resolution also supports our national efforts to provide women and 
children with HIV counseling, with HIV testing services, as well as 
expanding their access to lifesaving treatments.
  America's ongoing commitment has helped save the lives of many, but 
so much more remains to be done. We are one of the greatest hopes for a 
better future for countless others. Now, more than ever, it is 
essential to ensure that we remain committed as a nation to creating a 
future where no child suffers from HIV/AIDS.
  I urge my colleagues to support this worthwhile cause and cosponsor 
our resolution, H. Res. 593.

School in Wayzata for being recognized as a National Blue Ribbon School 
for academic excellence.
  This is a big honor. It is a big deal. I visited Oakwood myself, and 
only eight schools in Minnesota have received this recognition this 
year. That is because exemplary, high-performing schools like Oakwood 
rank among the highest performing schools with top scores in State 
assessments.
  One important note worth mentioning is that Oakwood Elementary School 
has done significant work addressing the achievement gap in their 
community so that every one of their students has what they need to be 
successful.
  Mr. Speaker, every one of Oakwood's teachers, staff, students, and 
parents should be commended for this accomplishment. Congratulations, 
again, to Oakwood Elementary School for being named a National Blue 
Ribbon School.

(Dan) Duncan as he steps down after serving for 10 years as President 
of the Northern Virginia Labor Federation, AFL-CIO (NoVA Labor.) As 
President of NoVA Labor, Dan led the largest labor council in the 
Commonwealth of Virginia and which represents nearly 70 unions and 
locals. In this role, he has been responsible for consolidating the 
missions and concerns of the various unions and their members into one 
unified voice while ensuring that all opinions are heard and respected.
   Dan has dedicated his life to improving the lives of working 
families. He is committed to the mission of NoVA Labor which is to 
bring economic justice to the workplace and social justice to our 
communities. He learned these values from an early age--his grandfather 
was a shop steward at a shipyard in Cleveland, Ohio and his father was 
a rank and file Machinist. Dan joined his first union, the Retail 
Clerks Union, in 1973 at the age of 17 while working for a grocery 
store in Tennessee.
   After graduating from the University of Chattanooga in 1978, Dan 
worked as a newspaper reporter. He later became director of the Fort 
Lauderdale senior employment program with the National Council of 
Senior Citizens (NCSC) which was formed in 1961 and evolved from the 
Senior Citizens for Kennedy organization. Working with the 
administration


of President John F. Kennedy, the NCSC was instrumental in rallying 
support for comprehensive health insurance for senior citizens. These 
efforts bore fruit when President Lyndon B. Johnson signed Medicare 
into law in 1965. NCSC's efforts were instrumental in passing this 
landmark legislation and the organization, now known as the Alliance 
for Retired Americans continues its fight to protect and preserve 
Medicare and Social Security.
   Dan then accepted a position with the Seafarers International Union 
where he has served for 30 years in various positions. For the last six 
years, Dan has held the position of Executive Secretary-Treasurer of 
the Maritime Trades Department.
   In his roles with individual unions as well as with the Northeast 
Florida Central Labor Council, the Northern Virginia Central Labor 
Council, and the NoVA Labor Federation, Dan has worked tirelessly to 
advocate for working families and support state and federal legislation 
that would even the playing field for the backbone of our society--the 
middle and lower class who deserve a fair wage for honest work and 
other employer related benefits.
   I have personally known Dan Duncan and his wife Karen for many years 
and have thoroughly enjoyed our countless conversations and discussions 
on issues of importance. While we have on occasion disagreed, mainly on 
their terrible taste in baseball teams, but also occasionally on the 
best way to achieve a certain objective, we both know and understand 
that we share the same goals. These exchanges of ideas and opinions 
have been invaluable to both of us as we continue to represent and 
serve our constituencies.
   Mr. Speaker, I ask that my colleagues join me in commending Dan 
Duncan for his efforts on behalf of the working men and women of our 
country and in thanking him for his service. Although he is stepping 
down from his position of President of NoVA Labor, I am confident that 
he will continue his efforts to strengthen and protect the rights and 
benefits of all and I wish him success in all of his future endeavors.

for their organization.
  Unker's Therapeutic Products' story of starting out with Patrick 
Henry's hard work in his garage to being a staple in Wyoming and even 
sponsoring racecars is the embodiment of the American dream. I am 
pleased to hear of the company's success and of the plans to continue

effort have played a part in its current and continued success.
  I extend my best wishes and congratulations to Patricia and to

engagement celebrated by these awards is a testament to the community 
spirit of Reston. I have often said that civic engagement is a key 
indicator of a healthy community and tonight's event proves that Reston 
is one of the healthiest communities in all of Northern Virginia! That 
is due in no small part to the actions of those honored here this

time to recognize the 2017 Distinguished Citizen Award recipients, 
presented annually by the Boy Scouts of America Calumet Council. To 
commemorate this special occasion, the organization hosted a 
celebratory event on Thursday, November 2, 2017, at Gamba Ristorante in 
Merrillville, Indiana.
  Since 1992, the Boy Scouts of America Calumet Council has presented 
the Distinguished Citizen Award to individuals whose efforts have had 
significant positive impacts on their communities in Northwest Indiana 
and across the state. This year, the Boy Scouts of America Calumet 
Council honored Tom Sourlis and Susan Eleuterio.
  Tom Sourlis is the founder and chairman of Mortar Net Solutions, 
located in Burns Harbor. Mortar Net, a product invented by Tom, 
prevents mortar droppings from clogging weepholes designed to allow 
water to exit a building wall. Mortar Net Solutions is a tremendously 
successful company, and the product is currently used on cavity wall 
construction throughout North America. In addition to his remarkable 
career, Tom dedicates much of his time and support to charitable 
endeavors throughout Northwest Indiana including Tradewinds, the Crisis 
Center, Parents as Teachers, and the Porter County Community 
Foundation. For his outstanding devotion to such causes, Tom is worthy 
of this great honor.
  Susan Eleuterio is currently a faculty member of Goucher College's 
Master's in Cultural Sustainability program in Baltimore, Maryland. She 
has established an extensive and impressive background that consists of 
many titles including independent folklorist, author, educator, 
activist, and consultant to non-profit organizations. Sue's 
extraordinary contributions to her community, however, are not limited 
to academia. She is active in her support for causes that improve the 
quality of life for others and encourage the protection of human 
rights, lending her time and talents to the Crossroads Fund. This 
organization, which is focused on the ideal that fundamental change 
occurs from humble, grassroots beginnings and supports efforts 
throughout Chicagoland and Northwest Indiana, benefits from the passion 
for justice, equality, and the academic knowledge Sue offers as a 
member of the Board of Directors, as the arts and the human condition 
are often intertwined. For these reasons, Sue is worthy of the 
commendation bestowed upon her.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues 
join me in honoring the Boy Scouts of America Calumet Council and its 
2017 Distinguished Citizen Award recipients, Tom Sourlis and Susan 
Eleuterio. For their lifetime of leadership and tireless dedication to 
their communities, Tom and Susan are worthy of the highest praise.

profound impact on the Northern Virginia community, Ms. Mary Beth Coya. 
I have been proud to partner with Mary Beth on many issues of 
importance to the residents of Northern Virginia and the quality of 
life we enjoy, and I consider her a good friend. This year marks 30 
years since Mary Beth Coya began her career with the Northern Virginia 
Association of Realtors (NVAR), beginning in 1987 as a Legislative 
Assistant. During her career, she has steadily advanced and currently 
serves as the Senior Vice President of Government and Public Affairs 
for NVAR.
   Prior to joining NVAR, Mary Beth began her career as a staff member 
with the Virginia House of Delegates Appropriations Committee in 
Richmond. From there she took her passion for advocacy to the private 
sector, where she lobbied at both the state and federal levels for a 
variety of associations and companies. Throughout her career, Mary Beth 
has used her knowledge and experience to advocate for policies that 
would improve the lives of the members of her community. This has 
perhaps most been felt in the area of transportation, where she serves 
as a member of the Board of Directors for the Northern Virginia 
Transportation Alliance (NVTA), a business-citizen coalition focused on 
advancing highway and transit projects of major importance to the 
region.


   I have worked with Mary Beth and the NVTA on efforts to construct 
the Silver Line Metrorail extension and the establishment of the 
Virginia Railway Express commuter rail system. In fact, NVTA was the 
first private sector organization to call for a dedicated funding 
source for Metro, which is a goal that I share.
   Mary Beth's career with NVAR and her role as a Board Member for the 
Northern Virginia Transportation Alliance are inextricably intertwined. 
At NVAR, she has been an experienced and expert advocate for the 
advancement of major legislation in the Commonwealth of Virginia. She 
was instrumental in obtaining dedicated regional and statewide 
transportation funding and has a passion for protecting the real estate 
industry. Due to her strong relationships with elected leaders at all 
levels of government and her extensive historical knowledge of the 
region, she has been an effective voice in ensuring that Northern 
Virginia remains one of the best places in the country in which to 
live, work, play, and raise a family.
   Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating Mary 
Beth Coya on the occasion of her 30th Anniversary with the Northern 
Virginia Association of Realtors and in commending her for her 
dedication to the betterment of our region. I am pleased to have had 
the opportunity to partner with her and NVAR on numerous issues and I 
look forward to continuing to work with her going forward.

Department is truly the greatest police force in the world, and they

Navarro in Monmouth, Oregon, and to continue to urge Speaker Ryan to 
put forth a clean Dream Act bill.
  Juan was brought to the United States, when he was 3 years old, from 
Guadalajara, Mexico. Juan suffers from cerebral palsy and was unable to 
walk. Juan was admitted as a research patient in Shriners Hospital, and 
after multiple surgeries and 12 long years of physical therapy, Juan 
now is able to walk without any support.
  While Juan was receiving care, his parents had to work two jobs, 
something we all used to do. They did this to provide a better life for 
Juan.
  Over time, Juan excelled in school, and Oregon became his home.
  Juan is an active member in the Monmouth and Western Oregon 
University communities. He serves as a diversity student mentor, works 
with the faculty at Western Oregon to create a campus website that 
lists available resources for undocumented students, works for the city 
of Monmouth as a community liaison, and started a support group for 
DREAMers at Western Oregon University.
  Juan is the first person in his family to graduate from college and 
is currently attending graduate school at Oregon State University's 
College Student Services Administration program. He currently works as 
a graduate assistant and hopes to bring more institutional changes for 
students of color.
  Without DACA, none of this would have been possible for Juan, and our 
country would have lost out on a motivated and talented person.
  Young people across the country are relying on us. We need to pass a 
clean Dream Act that will recognize Juan and the over 800,000 DREAMers 
as equal members of our community.

Connie LGBT Elder Americans Act, legislation I am introducing to 
support our country's LGBT seniors.
  The LGBT senior population is growing and is estimated to include 
nearly 6 million Americans by 2030. Unfortunately, the same generation 
of LGBT people who fought for rights in the workplace, equal marriage, 
and societal recognition are once again marginalized as they age.
  LGBT seniors have fewer support services, higher poverty rates, more 
social isolation, and inadequate access to healthcare services compared 
to the rest of older Americans. One of the primary barriers to 
providing services to LGBT seniors is a basic lack of information.
  The Older Americans Act, or OAA, already requires the Administration 
on Aging to collect data on the individuals receiving OAA services and 
the efficacy of OAA programs; but if we collected data on sexual 
orientation and gender identity, we could better understand this 
population and provide services that best fit their needs.
  Unfortunately, the data we do have shows that the poverty rate is 
higher for LGBT seniors, which is likely because many have faced 
discrimination while working, they have historically been unable to 
legally marry, and they have experienced gender and racial 
inequalities. We also know that LGBT elders are less likely than their 
peers to have community support and caretakers to help them.
  I know from speaking with LGBT seniors that many fear discrimination 
when receiving home healthcare services. They are twice as likely to be 
single and four times more likely to not have children. These are 
complex and important issues that require a personalized solution.
  The bill I am introducing today with Colorado Senator Michael Bennet 
and Florida Representatives Ted Deutch and Charlie Crist would help 
bridge the gap between LGBT seniors and the services they need.
  The bill is named for Ruthie Berman and Connie Kurtz, who sued the 
New York City Board of Education years ago for domestic partner 
benefits, and won their landmark case in 1994. In the decades since, 
Ruthie and Connie have continued their advocacy and fight as champions 
of LGBT rights.
  Our bill would amend the Older Americans Act to improve services for 
LGBT seniors and require data collection on sexual orientation so 
better decisions can be made.
  Additionally, the bill would permanently establish a National 
Resource Center on LGBT Aging and provide grants for organizations 
working to improve LGBT services, including access to healthcare and 
long-term care. The resource centers and the grants will help States 
and localities reach out to LGBT older adults and provide culturally 
competent support.
  By requiring specific consideration for LGBT seniors in the Older 
Americans Act, we can provide needed support to a vulnerable yet 
overlooked population.


  I thank my colleagues for their work on this important issue, and I 
hope many others will join us in supporting this bill to help our LGBT 
senior communities.

called Stop Settlement Slush Funds Act of 2017 (H.R. 732).
  The Department of Justice has long had the authority to enter into 
and enforce settlement agreements on behalf of the United States 
government. This includes payments to third parties that help right the 
wrongs caused by an entity that has broken the law.
  For instance, the government can negotiate a settlement that allows 
payments to groups like nonprofits that help aid in the recovery of the 
individuals and communities hurt by unlawful conduct. These third-party 
payments are particularly important when it is impossible


to quantify all of the harm done, as is often true of environmental 
cases.
  When a corporation responsible for dumping waste into a waterway or 
emitting pollutants into the air agrees to this type of settlements, 
the non-profits they pay restore coastlines, rebuild ecosystems, and 
often coordinate cleanup activities. This legislation threatens that 
critical remediation and recovery work.
  The Stop Settlement Slush Funds Act of 2017 ends this common-sense 
practice by prohibiting the U.S. government from entering into or 
enforcing settlement agreements that require payments to third parties. 
It also makes it much more difficult to provide relief for damage that 
is more generalized and non-quantifiable. When a power plant dirties 
the air of a community, the number of visits to the doctor or new cases 
of asthma cannot be precisely measured. That does not mean that they 
should not be held responsible for the harm they caused.
  House Republicans have used the first 10 months of this Congress to 
do little more than push policies that reduce corporate accountability 
and line the pockets of corporate bad actors. I oppose the Stop 
Settlement Slush Funds Act of 2017.

many colleges in the United States. Thousands of students who are 
submitting their applications are anxiously hoping for entry into a 
college, community college, or postsecondary school.
  As students try to determine what schools are right for them, it is 
clear they are missing some key information--information we all wish we 
had for our children: How likely are they to graduate? How long will it 
take to earn a degree or their certificate? How likely are they to find 
a job? How much money will they earn if they do find a job?

  As a parent, I know this information will be helpful. That is why I 
introduced the College Transparency Act. My legislation would utilize 
and make meaning out of the data we currently gather at the Federal 
level to enable students and parents to make informed decisions.
  I have over 35 years in workforce development and postsecondary 
education. I understand the difficulties that people have in making 
informed decisions about what is best for their future career. I also 
understand the reporting expectations for career colleges and 
universities. I understand which institutions have the information 
available and how they provide it. I also understand the burdens that 
occur in providing that information.
  Despite the incredible investment involved and the risk in pursuing a 
postsecondary education, we and students are left with too little 
information to answer the most basic questions: What can students 
expect to pay out of pocket? Can you imagine that really they cannot 
determine how much it will cost them to complete a postsecondary 
program? How do students fare in the labor market after leaving 
college? How likely are they to fare in order to enter into the labor 
market? How do students fare on other metrics of success we all 
consider important, like earnings, and loan repayment?
  A prospective student doesn't have the information about which 
programs at which institutions provide an adequate return on their 
investment, and on their parents' investment.
  As a consumer and a father, it is difficult for me to wrap my head 
around the idea that Americans have so little information about 
potentially what may be the largest investment they make in their 
lives, and certainly, the second largest. I am the father of six 
children. The reality is that we are investing and putting six children 
through a college or a postsecondary program. Think about how much 
money goes into that. Yet we operate in a vacuum on information.
  When you shop online, you are able to compare products, you are able 
to compare costs, you are able to compare features, the value to the 
consumer. At this point in time, try to do that about programs at a 
college, university, or career school. Try to compare one university's 
nursing program to another; or the architecture program, or history 
program, or the nursing program in a college. Try to find that 
information. You won't find it online. Try to call the university. Good 
luck on that.
  It is not that they don't try to provide it. In fact, they provide 
reams of data. The reality is that the current system simply doesn't 
gather that data in a manner that is useful to consumers, the people 
that ultimately pay the bill.
  The College Transparency Act would enable students to answer crucial 
questions, such as how likely they are to enter the workforce 
successfully, or what their chances are of transferring from a 
community college to a 4-year college and being able to graduate.
  Students past and present are owners of the $1.4 trillion outstanding 
Federal debt, and the clock is ticking. It is time for students, 
families, and guidance counselors involved in the college 
decisionmaking process to be able to assist students and have access to 
information that will make this huge investment make sense. Otherwise, 
we leave young people to make decisions based on: Well, those colors on 
the band uniform are really cool; or they have a good football team; or 
it seems like they have a really nice social life.
  But, ultimately, what we are making is an investment into the future 
of our children and the future of this country. They have massive money 
invested, and let's be honest, we all do as taxpayers as well. We have 
a huge investment in the preparation of young people for the workforce.
  It is time to streamline and update our higher education information 
system so that families and students can make better decisions on their 
path to long-term success. It is time to utilize and make meaning out 
of the data we currently collect to assist them in making the choice.


  The question I am asked is: Why did I submit the College Transparency 
Act? I spent 35 years operating a private career school group and 
working in workforce development. I worked at Chrysler Corporation, 
moved to another company, and also retired out of that field.
  The point is, I have worked in the field for 35 years. I understand 
the data that is reported. I understand the challenges that people have 
in trying to sort out what is the best career path for them, how likely 
are they to succeed in that career path, and what is it going to cost 
to go to school?


  This information all exists--and we will talk about that tonight--but 
it isn't made available in some coherent manner to students, and we 
need to fix that.
  We also can't tell students how long, on average, it takes them to 
complete their program. It used to be the day where they used to call 
them 4-year colleges. The reality, as you well know, Mr. Speaker, is 4-
year colleges are now a dream, 5 years is the norm, and 6 years is not 
uncommon, yet we don't talk about the cost it takes to do that. Again, 
we don't talk about the likelihood of completing even if you attend 6 
years. The reality is we have to fix that.
  In my 35 years of dealing with the system, what became clear to me is 
it is outdated, it is burdensome, it is unhelpful, and it conflicts. It 
led me to start working on the College Transparency Act as soon as I 
came to Congress. It was the first bill that I dropped and submitted in 
Congress. It is the one I spent the most time on. Why? Because we have 
a huge investment in postsecondary education, and, even more 
importantly, we have a huge investment preparing a labor force.
  I have not gone to an employer since I was sworn into office that has 
not said to me: We can't find people with the skills to go to work.
  Yet we have people who have graduated from college who can't find 
jobs that relate to their degree. We have people who will go to college 
for an extended period of time or to a postsecondary program who don't 
complete, but they meander their way through. They get lost. They don't 
have the information to make an informed decision, and then somehow, 
sometimes, frankly, we blame the consumer.
  It is our fault. It is our fault here. It is our fault at the Federal 
Government. We are making a huge investment, and we expect everybody 
else to cure the problem. Better information on outcomes in student 
success will certainly assist in closing the skills gap that we talk 
about nearly every day here in Congress and certainly every day in the 
Education and the Workforce Committee when we meet.
  Senators Hatch, Warren, Cassidy, and Whitehouse share my concern. On 
the Senate side, they have introduced a similar bill--almost 
identical--to address this critical issue. I believe on this issue we 
can get bipartisan support to move forward with an approach to inform 
the public and the consumers about the decision they will make with 
their money and, to be honest with you, our investment in their future.
  The current system is massively broken. This chart will show the 
current reporting system for higher education in the United States 
today. If you can possibly read it from there--and we will get it 
submitted for the Record--these are all the groups that gather data, 
all the places it goes, and all the information that is exchanged about 
students going to postsecondary education in the United States.
  I ask you, Mr. Speaker, can you make any sense of that? I have worked 
35 years in that field. I will tell you that a student enrollment for 
one system doesn't match the definition of enrollment in another 
system, it doesn't match the definition in the State system, yet we all 
report that information. Graduate information is all different 
depending on the system. None of the definitions match.
  Now, if we can't get definitions to match internally in a system 
between State accrediting agencies and the Federal Government, how is 
it we expect students and how are parents to understand whether they 
are likely to complete the program? And, by the way, none of this 
information adequately reports student outcomes in terms of employment 
and doesn't provide them any information on what they are likely to 
earn. And guess what? Earnings matter in terms of their ability to pay 
their student loans back. News flash to everybody: it helps if they 
know what they are going to make.
  A 2015 study completed by Boston Consulting Group indicated $11.1 
billion is spent by institutions to comply with regulations specific to 
colleges and universities. We don't need more regulations. Good God, 
help us. We have plenty--we have plenty of reporting.
  One of the most significant findings of the study was that small and 
medium colleges are disproportionately impacted by those Federal 
regulations with compliance eating up a much larger share of 
expenditures than the wealthier institutions.
  While we say we need more options for continuing and postsecondary 
education, for career and technical education at the postsecondary 
level, we are killing those institutions with rules and regulations of 
reporting that give us that, that isn't useful to the public that has 
to make a decision. Imagine that.
  We have an opportunity to fix that with the Higher Education Act. We 
have an opportunity to fix that with the College Transparency Act. We 
have an opportunity now.
  There are three main goals of the bill. This chart will show you what 
the bill will collect. First and most importantly, the goal is to 
provide accurate and complete information that is searchable for 
students and can be customized. Think about it. How many people have 
shopped for an automobile? They have on the website a comparison of 
whatever vehicle to other similar vehicles sold by other manufacturers. 
You can compare them dealer to dealer. You can get an idea what 
features are there. Shop for whatever you want, and then tell me if you 
can find that about any educational program offered by postsecondary 
institutions.
  This addresses that issue while reducing reporting burdens on 
institutions. I believe, and I think most of our party believes, that 
market competition works best when consumers can actually find out 
information and make rational decisions. They can compare complete 
information. They can compare the offerings, the costs, and the 
outcomes.

  With that competition, we can, in fact, address one of the other 
concerns we have, which is: What is the cost of higher education? We 
can compare it not just on what you pay for tuition, room and board, 
but the return on investment. What do they get for their time and money 
in a postsecondary education program?
  More importantly, choices will be made by consumers and not the 
Federal Government. We have seen how that works in so many ways, and 
the Federal Government should not be making choices about the future of 
Americans.
  If we arm consumers with that information to make informed decisions, 
then we can remove the Federal Government from the business of 
determining quality in education and let consumers and accrediting 
agencies address that.
  The bill also replaces a number of reporting requirements that the 
Federal Government has, most notably what is called the IPED survey. I 
did them for years. Routinely, we get questions that don't match their 
definitions because their definitions made no sense for many 
institutions.
  Thirdly, the bill aims to provide transparency to its students by 
requiring they be posted in a searchable database, and the costs would 
be identified there.
  Let me go through real quickly in that chart the information that 
will be available that is not currently available on a searchable 
basis. You can get enrollment patterns, you can get progress to 
completion, and you can get completion rates. Do you graduate from a 
program? Imagine that. You can find that out, and it is the same 
definition whether it is the University of Michigan or Michigan State 
where I attended. Wouldn't that be a great idea?
  You can find out about their postcollege earnings. It is really 
helpful. Most people go to college or a postsecondary school to find a 
job, earn some money, and support their family. Can they do that? What 
is likely to be the outcome?
  The cost of the program? I mentioned that a couple of times. It is 
not just tuition and room and board. The reality is that, depending on 
the program, your costs are significantly different. My 18- almost 19-
year-old stepdaughter attends an art school. Well, beyond tuition and 
room and board, there are huge costs for art supplies. Now, we knew 
that. I have experience in education. There are a lot of people who 
start these programs who don't understand there are other costs and 
what those may be. This process requires reporting of that from the 
colleges.
  Also, information about financial aid that is available for those 
institutions


so they can compare program to program, institution to institution, and 
make a decision that is best for them and their family. That is what we 
are trying to achieve here. It is achievable.
  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Garrett) who 
will speak for a few moments on the bill and its advantages."|3
CREC-2017-11-01-pt1-PgH8369-2-4|Mr. GARRETT|G000580|CREC-2017-11-01-pt1-PgH8369-2|"  Mr. GARRETT. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my colleague, Congressman 
Mitchell, for his leadership in this amazingly important area, and also 
to point out the bipartisan nature of this bill not only, Mr. Speaker, 
to you, but to those people who might be watching at home at a time 
when it seems that we can't agree on anything, here we have an 
agreement in a College Transparency Act in how to ensure a better 
investment for the futures of our children.
  Now, there are those who have opposed this bill, and I can't really 
wrap my brain around it, Mr. Speaker. Someone suggested that this might 
grow government. But that is absolutely not true. As a matter of fact, 
the data that would be made available in this act is already collected. 
But the problem is that that data is collected, and then it is siloed 
and accessible only to institutions or government entities and not to 
the end user. That strikes me as illogical, at best, and stupid, at 
worst.
  Someone says it burdens colleges with data collection requirements, 
yet, again, the data is already being collected. What about personal 
privacy? Does it disclose individuals' private information? Well, if it 
did, I wouldn't be standing here today extolling the virtues of this 
bill which I cosponsored and Mr. Mitchell sponsors that support it 
again across the aisle to include the likes of the distinguished 
gentleman, Mr. Polis, from Colorado.
  Instead of disclosing personal data of individuals, it discloses 
metadata of groups so what we would learn, for example, is that 
individuals who majored in X at college Y had an employment rate of Z, 
and that their earning potential was A as opposed to another university 
where it might be B.
  What more pertinent information, Mr. Speaker, could there be to young 
people as they seek to choose an area of study and a place to engage in 
that area of study than their likelihood of success based on those who 
have done the same thing at the same college or university before them?
  So we have addressed some of the things that this bill doesn't do, 
but let's speak briefly about what it does do. Without any ability to 
articulately argue, this bill increases transparency. When you step 
aside from the realm of national security, I can think of no reason 
that the Federal or State or local government should be in the business 
of collecting data that they don't share with the citizens who put them 
in office or the people who fund their endeavors. Indeed, this isn't 
national security, unless you contemplate the fact that right now our 
children attend universities deprived of information that might help 
them make better choices.
  So this increases transparency. It creates informed consumers. It 
allows individuals to decide for themselves which college or university 
might offer a program that they are interested in, is the best 
investment of their time, and perhaps their or their parents' or the 
government's money. It informs payers to that very end, whether that 
payer is the student, a family member, or the State of which they are a 
resident. It gives us a return on the investment.

  The fact that this data has been collected low these many years, and 
it took the leadership of Mr. Mitchell and good folks like Jared Polis 
working across the aisle to get us to this point, is lamentable, but we 
have the opportunity in the College Transparency Act to correct these 
wrongs, not to reburden our universities with more data collection 
requirements, but to take the data that is already being collected and 
give it to the end users, the students.
  So it is with that that I again offer a hearty congratulations to 
Congressman Mitchell, a begrudging ``I wish I had thought of that,'' 
and I implore my colleagues on both sides of the aisle that while we 
already collect this data, we do not disseminate it where it would be 
most useful, and that is to the end users. I hope that all can find a 
way to join us from both parties in supporting this commonsense 
measure, the College Transparency Act.
  Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from the president of 
the University of Virginia in my district.

                                           University of Virginia,


                                      Office of the President,

                                Charlottesville, VA, June 1, 2017.
     Hon. Tom Garrett,
     House of Representatives,
     Washington, DC.
       Dear Representative Garrett: On behalf of the University of 
     Virginia (UVA), I thank you for your co-sponsorship of the 
     College Transparency Act. I appreciate your support of 
     transparency, good data, and enhanced consumer information in 
     higher education, as well as the bipartisan efforts that led 
     to the creation of this bill.
       The College Transparency Act is a step in the right 
     direction for improving federal data, which is currently 
     limited, and at times, inaccurate. Improving data helps 
     students and families with the important decisions associated 
     with choosing a college, and also helps institutions of 
     higher education improve student success. The Association of 
     Public and Land Grant Universities, for which I serve as the 
     Chair of the Council of Presidents, compiled case studies 
     showing the importance of this type of data for improving 
     student outcomes. I look forward to working with you, in your 
     influential position as a member of the House Committee on 
     Education and the Workforce, on this issue and many others as 
     Congress moves forward with reauthorizing the Higher 
     Education Act.
       Once again, thank you for your dedicated support of UVA.
           Very truly yours,
                                                  Teresa Sullivan,
                                                        President.

bipartisan nature of this legislation both in the House and the United 
States Senate, which, as you well know, Mr. Speaker, some days around 
here is hard to achieve.
  Let me note real quickly we have a listing, which I will put up now, 
of the institutions and organizations that support the College 
Transparency Act. We are now at over 90 groups that have indicated 
their support for this legislation and the need for this legislation.
  I know it is difficult to read from there, but in a moment I will 
talk more about some of these institutions.
  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Stivers), who is 
my colleague and good friend. Yes, he is from Ohio and roots for Ohio 
State. I went to Michigan State, but I will certainly yield to Mr. 
Stivers to talk further about the College Transparency Act."|6
CREC-2017-11-01-pt1-PgH8369-2-7|Mr. STIVERS|S001187|CREC-2017-11-01-pt1-PgH8369-2|"  Mr. STIVERS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak in support of H.R. 
2434, the College Transparency Act. I want to thank my good friend from 
Michigan, Congressman Mitchell, for his leadership and bipartisan work 
on this very important bill.
  This time of year, parents and students are beginning to make 
important decisions about higher education for the next school year.


  Unfortunately, there is little information available about what can 
be expected from the large investment in a college or a university. 
This legislation will enable students and families to make informed 
choices about their education after high school.
  The College Transparency Act will provide actionable, customizable 
information for students and families as they consider college and 
universities by accurately reporting on student outcomes, such as 
enrollment, completion, and postcollege success across colleges and 
majors.
  Most importantly, this information will tell students how other 
prospective students have succeeded at an institution and help point 
them toward schools best suited for their unique needs and desired 
outcomes.
  The current college reporting system is overly burdensome on 
institutions, yet it provides little practical information for students 
and families due to significant gaps in college data reporting.
  Additionally, the data collected only reports graduation rates for 
students who begin as full-time students and finish at the same 
institution, leaving out successes of part-time students and


any student who transfers and completes a degree at an institution 
other than where they started. With more than half of bachelor's degree 
recipients attending more than one school and nearly two-thirds of 
community college students starting part-time, we have to ensure that 
these students count.
  One example of this impact from my alma mater, The Ohio State 
University, is a veteran named Tami. Tami returned to school to 
complete her social work degree after her military service. She 
completed an associate of arts degree at Columbus State, a community 
college, and transferred and eventually graduated with a social work 
degree from The Ohio State University. She had a 3.9 grade point 
average in the classroom and excelled in her two-semester field 
placement at the university's Office of Military and Veterans Services.
  Under this system, Tami's success story would not count toward Ohio 
State success. Under the new system, it will. Today, the system would 
not count Tami because she started at one school and transferred to 
another school. Under the legislation that Mr. Mitchell is working on 
and that I am talking about today, Tami would count again.
  We need to make people count again. Tami served our country. Tami got 
out of the military, came back, went to school part-time, then 
transferred schools, went to school full-time, and completed her 
practical experience. Under the current reporting system, Tami doesn't 
count.
  Let's fix that. That is what this bill would do. Under the updated 
system, institutions would securely report privacy-protected student 
level data to the National Center for Education Statistics, or NCES. 
NCES would be responsible for presenting summary information on a user-
friendly website for students and families, while securely storing 
student information.
  This legislation will help countless students and families make 
better decisions about where to go for higher education, where they 
should attend.
  I want to thank Congressman Mitchell and Congressman Polis for 
introducing this important, bipartisan legislation that will help so 
many students and families, students like Tami.
  I hope we can roll up our sleeves, work together, and get this bill 
passed. I urge my colleagues to support this bill."|7
CREC-2017-11-01-pt1-PgH8369-2-8|Mr. MITCHELL|M001201|CREC-2017-11-01-pt1-PgH8369-2|"  Mr. MITCHELL. I appreciate the gentleman's notation of the groups 
that support this bill. I was surprised, frankly, with the number of 
groups that stepped forward--as I said, over 90--to support the College 
Transparency Act. Some of the groups I would like to stress today 
include veterans groups.
  The Student Veterans of America and Veterans Education Success, among 
others, have endorsed the bill because it helps veterans determine 
which institutions and programs best serve their unique needs and 
improve their ability to make progress in the workforce to be 
successful, something that, frankly, we owe them as part of their 
service to our country.
  As Chris Cate, vice president of research at Student Veterans of 
America, said: ``Based on recent research, the value of the Post-9/11 
GI Bill is clear, as student veterans across the country succeed at 
rates higher than traditional students. Yet, determining these outcomes 
is currently a significant effort and not easily accomplished without 
abundant resources. Basing policy on research and data is imperative, 
and it shouldn't take as much effort as it does today, as we have the 
answer to this challenge staring us in the face.'' It is the College 
Transparency Act.
  We currently collect the data that people are begging to get to make 
informed decisions for themselves and, frankly, in this case, to assist 
veterans in making wise decisions on their GI bill.
  Let me talk a little more about some of the groups that support the 
bill, and then I will yield to another colleague of mine.
  Colleges, universities, and postsecondary institutions support this 
bill, which sometimes surprises me, given what we are trying to do, 
which is remake a reporting system and make transparent their 
performance. Think about it. They support the bill without exception. 
These institutions want more comprehensive information on student 
progress, completion, and outcomes so they can better understand and 
evaluate how well they are serving their students and identify areas 
for improvement.
  Institutions also know best student-level data collection will 
decrease the reporting burden and the financial and human resources 
necessary to report and complete the requirements of the Federal 
Government, State government, and accrediting agencies.
  Associations representing institutions serving the majority of 
college students support lifting the ban on connecting student-level 
data to help build evidence and improve the quality of the program.
  As my colleague Mr. Stivers indicated, as well as others, this 
information is disseminated and developed only at the metadata level. 
It is not like we are going to send your Social Security number out and 
post it on a Facebook page with your employment status; although, in 
your case, Mr. Speaker, everyone knows well your employment status.

  According to the Michigan Association of State Universities, which 
serves as the coordinating board for Michigan's 15 public universities 
in my home State: ``The College Transparency Act of 2017 represents a 
much-needed modernization of the Federal Government's college reporting 
system for postsecondary data. The current ban on student-level data in 
the Higher Education Act represents a gross injustice to students and 
families who require and deserve more accurate data on postsecondary 
institutional outcomes in order to be adequately equipped to make one 
of the most important decision in one's life--whether and where to 
attend college. By providing more accurate information about 
institutional graduation rates, salary levels, and other employment 
outcomes, and additional information on how students fare at individual 
institutions and in academic programs, the College Transparency Act 
will enable the creation of an essential resource for student and 
consumer information.''
  Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from the Michigan 
Association of State Universities.

     Re Endorsement of College Transparency Act, H.R. 2434/S. 
         1121.

     Hon. Paul Mitchell,
     House of Representatives,
     Washington, DC.
       Dear Congressman Mitchell: On behalf of the presidents and 
     chancellors of the 15 public universities of Michigan and the 
     nearly 300,000 students they collectively enroll, I write to 
     express strong support for the College Transparency Act of 
     2017, H.R. 2434, which you have sponsored, and its companion 
     bill in the Senate, S. 1121.
       The College Transparency Act of 2017 represents a much 
     needed modernization of the federal government's college 
     reporting system for postsecondary data. The current ban on 
     student-level data in the Higher Education Act represents a 
     gross injustice to students and families who require and 
     deserve more accurate data on postsecondary institutional 
     outcomes in order to be adequately equipped to make one of 
     the most important decision in one's life--whether and where 
     to attend college. By providing more accurate information 
     about institutional graduation rates, salary levels and other 
     employment outcomes, and additional information on how 
     students fare at individual institutions and in academic 
     programs, the College Transparency Act will enable the 
     creation of an essential resource for student and consumer 
     information.
       Introduced in both Congressional chambers, this bipartisan 
     legislation will also serve as an indispensable tool in 
     helping institutions assess and enhance their academic 
     programs. Michigan public universities rely heavily on data 
     to inform institutional policy and to better serve our 
     students.
       We commend your leadership and those co-sponsoring the 
     College Transparency Act and offer our support in advocating 
     passage of the legislation. America's students, families, 
     taxpayers and postsecondary institutions will all benefit 
     greatly from its enactment.
           Sincerely,
                                                 Daniel J. Hurley,
                                          Chief Executive Officer.

  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Smucker) 
to talk further about his views on the College Transparency Act."|9
CREC-2017-11-01-pt1-PgH8369-2-10|Mr. SMUCKER|S001199|CREC-2017-11-01-pt1-PgH8369-2|"  Mr. SMUCKER. I thank my friend from Michigan (Mr. Mitchell) for 
hosting this Special Order on the College Transparency Act.
  Mr. Speaker, I have spoken on the floor a number of times about the 
House's work to improve education in the country. I have been proud to 
work with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle in the Education and 
the Workforce Committee to improve career and technical education, and 
I have also spoken about my own experience with higher education as a 
nontraditional student taking classes at night while I ran a 
construction company during the day.
  Tonight, I am happy to be here to talk about ensuring that students, 
parents, guidance counselors, and legislators like us have access to 
information that can help students make informed decisions about what 
college to attend so that policymakers have access to research and data 
that will better inform our work on higher education policy.
  Today, colleges and universities report data to the U.S. Department 
of Education that has been collected by a voluntary survey available 
only to a limited group of graduates. The survey is not offered to any 
student who is attending college part-time, who is not seeking a 
degree, who has transferred from another college, or who doesn't have 
Federal loans.
  In today's economy, we are trying to make higher education more 
available and accessible to nontraditional students, yet we omit a 
large group of nontraditional students from this data. That is just one 
of the reasons why we need to pass the College Transparency Act.
  This bipartisan legislation seeks to modernize higher education 
reporting so that students and families can make responsible choices 
about what college or university to attend. It will help empower 
students and families to determine how much they need to take out in 
student loans and which programs at different schools provide the best 
paths toward their dream job or a career.
  Too many students today are graduating with massive amounts of debt. 
Too many students graduate with majors offering too few opportunities. 
At the very least, students need to have this data available to them to 
make informed decisions.
  This bill, as has been pointed out by Mr. Mitchell, is endorsed by 
more than 80 education and business organizations, including Advance 
CTE and the Association for Career and Technical Education, 
organizations that represent great schools like Thaddeus Stevens 
College of Technology in my district.
  This bill has bipartisan support in our committee, in the Senate, and 
the House, and it is essential for transforming our higher education 
system to meet the needs of a 21st century economy. So, again, I am 
happy to rise to speak in support of this act.
  I would like to thank my friend from Michigan for hosting this 
Special Order this evening, and I urge my colleagues to consider 
supporting this important piece of legislation."|10
CREC-2017-11-01-pt1-PgH8369-2-11|Mr. MITCHELL|M001201|CREC-2017-11-01-pt1-PgH8369-2|"  Mr. MITCHELL. I thank my colleague, Mr. Smucker, for taking time out 
of his busy schedule to come here tonight to talk about the act and its 
importance nationally and in his district.
  He made reference to something I wish to stress, Mr. Speaker, which 
is that, annually, at the Federal level, we spend $160 billion a year 
on student aid. We currently spend it into a vacuum, into a giant black 
hole, in which we hope we get outcomes and which students hope they get 
outcomes. Certainly, parents hope they get outcomes so they don't 
continue to live at home. We all hope that we can get success for our 
young people, and we don't have the information to determine that.
  Let me also stress that, beyond educational groups, veterans, the 
U.S. Chamber of Commerce and Business Roundtable have both endorsed 
this bill as being critical to the success of our Nation going forward.
  I want to stress for you and everyone in this Chamber, when you get 
the level of support from such a broad range of people, we have to 
start asking ourselves: Why have we not already moved on this? Why has 
it not already taken place? We need to move on this issue sooner rather 
than later. We can't afford not to.
  Let me talk about one other group that supports this bill 
passionately. Students want to know which schools are best fit for 
their needs. Deciding where to spend their time, their precious 
dollars, and incur debt is critically important to them.
  Surprisingly enough, these folks want to do more than go to college, 
meet new friends, and have a little party every now and then. The vast 
majority--85 percent--of college freshmen rate getting a better job as 
very important in their decision to go to college; yet the day-to-day 
need, as we have talked about repeatedly tonight, to discern which 
program's institutions will best address that objective is lacking.
  The ability to provide that information is at our hands. We have the 
technology. We have the data. We just don't provide it in a usable 
format.
  Groups that support this bill include the Big Ten Student 
Association, Campaign for College Opportunity, Young Invincibles, 
Institute for College Access and Success, the United Negro College 
Fund, Achieving the Dream, Student Affairs Administrators in Higher 
Education, Institute for Higher Education Policy, and the National 
Association for College Admission Counseling. They support the College 
Transparency Act.
  I would ask: How many more groups do we need to gather before we 
decide to act here in Congress?


  In the time I have left, I want to address some myths. And if my 
colleague, Mr. Smucker, who is still here, wants to weigh in on this, I 
invite him to join at any point in time he wants to weigh in, because 
we heard a number of myths put forward about the terrible things that 
the College Transparency Act may arise.
  One that amazes me is that while the bill requires institutions 
collect and report tons of new information on students--well, can we 
bring that chart back up of what we already collect? Let's look at that 
gem of what we collect currently. We are doing this now. Institutions 
are doing this now.
  So tell me, how are we going to collect tons more? In fact, every 
student who attends a postsecondary education institution in the United 
States has information reported on them now, whether they take student 
financial aid or not, because a 1098-T is filed by that institution 
with the IRS so, in fact, if they claim credit for going to school, 
tuition tax credit, they can claim that.
  There is no information that is not currently with one agency or 
another. The astonishing thing is the discussion that somehow there is 
some secret about whether someone is attending a postsecondary 
institution. It is astonishing.
  College universities, also, because of this reporting, hold the 
student-level data. They report much of it to the Department of 
Education, to NCES, and to the State Department of Education to 
accredit the agencies in a variety of formats. The number of formats, 
the array of those, will totally amaze you. If you would like, I can 
get those reports for you. You can spend the afternoon looking through 
the joys of reporting on educational activities in a postsecondary 
institution, and none of it makes any sense to anybody that isn't 
actually in the system, and I will admit, that data doesn't make any 
sense to me either.
  Colleges and universities also don't know if their graduates actually 
get a job, unless half the students come back happily and say they went 
to work and how much they are making. They don't get that information. 
They couldn't assist the student with that information if they tried in 
any accurate basis other than anecdotally. So they don't try. Why would 
you? You wouldn't do that. You wouldn't make that mistake.
  That information exists. Why? Because the IRS has a 1098-T on 
everyone who went to college or a postsecondary institution. That data 
can be matched by the Treasury Department to whether that student is 
employed, what they are making, and they can report that, as was noted 
earlier, through metadata to the Department of Education for 
development of reports without reporting one individual student's 
information.


  So I am lost in understanding how it is we lose our minds around here 
about student information being disseminated. It exists. It can be 
protected.
  Let me talk real briefly about another myth that exists, that somehow 
tracking the student data will lead to a Federal rating system, the 
Federal rating system of educational programs of institutions.
  Well, first, the Department of Education has tried a number of rating 
systems over there, all with mixed success, at best, and I am trying to 
be polite. It is late in the evening. Let's not be too blunt. But they 
failed miserably in doing so. They tried to rate institutions based on 
cohort default rates, and those are being repealed by many as being 
inaccurate.
  They tried to rate institutions on something called gainful 
employment, but they only do gainful employment for career schools, 
because, hey, you know, no one goes to a university for gainful 
employment. I assure you, my guess is the Speaker did as well, you went 
to the university hoping for gainful employment. I doubt there is 
anyone in the room who didn't go to a college or university in hopes of 
gainful employment.
  The reality is the Department of Education, as they have implemented 
this, has tried to create these Federal rating systems and failed 
miserably. So I tell you what, we did something unique. The College 
Transparency Act explicitly prohibits the creation of a single database 
by the Department of Education and expressly prohibits using that 
database for a Federal rating system.
  I give up. I don't want the Department of Education telling us what a 
good education system is because look how well they have done so far. 
We will let consumers decide. We will give them information so they can 
decide. They can make a wise decision rather than thinking that Big 
Brother can make that decision for them.
  If the government were doing so well with it, why is it that every 
Member in this room has heard from their employers the terrible 
shortage we have of people in current technical education, of workers? 
If they were doing such a great job of ratings and informing people 
what their opportunities were, why are we currently struggling with the 
workforce we have?
  It is a disaster. Let's stop thinking we can fix it, and let's let 
consumers have the information they need to fix it.
  The bill enables the NCES to aggregate student information from 
relevant agencies with the responsibility that they had to protect that 
data, which they have done for years.
  So now they are doing--not create some massive Federal database in 
which everybody's name, Social Security number, is accessible so we can 
determine whether or not you are a successful student. It doesn't do 
that, not even close to that, never has. It provides information on an 
accurate basis by a program institution of what your likelihood of 
success is.
  Last but not least, I talked a little bit about it, is keeping 
personal information private, the fears about privacy, and that somehow 
we can't achieve that under the College Transparency Act.
  The College Transparency Act requires that data collection should be 
led by the National Center for Education Statistics. I apologize. I 
have been using the abbreviation NCES because it has been burned into 
my memory over the years. It is a statistical agency with strong 
protocols for securing data and protecting student privacy. It has an 
excellent track record for doing so.

  They have consulted with the private sector, pretty good folks, about 
how to continue to work on student privacy in that data. NCES is 
already required by law to develop and enforce standards to protect 
individual level data. As added protection, the act requires, the 
College Transparency Act requires, an institute utilize the latest 
Federal data security standards developed by the National Institute of 
Standards and Technology. We require that they implement those on an 
ongoing basis and they maintain those.
  I have to tell you, Mr. Speaker, that is not commonplace in the 
Federal Government at this point. We are going a step beyond what 
happens every day in many agencies.
  Further, your personal information, Mr. Smucker's or anybody else's, 
will never be available to the Department of Education or to the 
public. Your employment status will never be available. What will be 
available is whether all of us who took a program in Michigan State 
University--come on up, you would love the school, some time--whether 
or not you graduated, you got a job, and whether you are gainfully 
employed and making money. Now, wouldn't that be a great idea for the 
money you put into a college education? All the aggregate information 
is available on the programs and institutions we are talking about 
here.
  The data developed by the Treasury Department on income and 
employment, once it is transmitted to NCES, is literally blown up. The 
file no longer exists. You can't hack what isn't there.
  So I would ask, at this point in time, rather than continue to extol 
the virtues of the College Transparency Act, I would ask all the 
Members to look at the act. We have a number of cosponsors at this 
point in time that I am very proud of. It is a bipartisan bill. I would 
ask them to look at the act, look at what it is achieving, and if they 
have questions, let's hear those questions, and let's make an effort to 
move this forward.
  We are already well into the decisionmaking process for young people 
to go to a postsecondary education program next year. It is too late 
for them to get this information, but, you know what, we can get it the 
following year. And the question I would ask is: How long are we going 
to wait while we are spending $160 billion in direct student aid alone 
hoping to get an outcome when we can do better and the ability to do 
that is at our fingertips?
  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

service and achievements of an esteemed and valued citizen, Captain 
Dennis DeWine, U.S. Army. He has dedicated himself to his community and 
nation and is an embodiment of the Army values of honor, loyalty, and 
selfless service. CPT DeWine is a fitting and worthy recipient of a 
Congressional Veteran Commendation.
  CPT DeWine joined the Army in 1967, graduated Helicopter Flight 
School in 1968, and spent the next seven years as a helicopter pilot; 
twenty months of which were two tours of duty in Vietnam. As a 
testament to his valorous service in Vietnam, the President of the 
United States presented CPT DeWine with the Distinguished Flying Cross 
award for his actions above and beyond the call of duty. After being 
Honorably Discharged CPT DeWine was inducted into the Ohio Military 
Hall of Fame for Valor.
  CPT DeWine's leadership skills have been invaluable throughout his 
post-military career. After rejoining civilian life, he became the 
founder, broker, and president of ERA Colonial Real Estate and Colonial 
Residential Properties, Inc. Despite his busy schedule, CPT DeWine 
remains dedicated to serving his community. He can often be found in 
jeans and boots working alongside his friends and neighbors. CPT 
DeWine's passion to serve is evident through his participation and 
leadership in numerous organizations, such as Central Texas Voices for 
Life, where he serves as Chairman. CPT DeWine has also proven his 
commitment to serving others through his company's efforts to 
successfully raise $100,000 for Muscular Dystrophy.
  Despite his business and charitable commitments, CPT DeWine has found 
time to raise a closeknit family, volunteer in community organizations, 
and remain active in his church. With admiration and deep respect, I 
pay tribute to Dennis DeWine for his sacrifices and the lasting impact 
he has had on his community and country

of longtime New York City Firefighter Robert ``Skippy'' Tilearcio, who 
passed away last Wednesday from a malignant tumor resulting from his 
months of recovery efforts at Ground Zero.
  Skip was a tireless advocate for the Zadroga 9/11 Healthcare Act. He 
came to Washington about six times to fight for its extension in 2014 
and 2015, even before he was diagnosed with a fatal tumor. I had the 
privilege of meeting Skip Tilearcio when he would make these painful 
trips to Congress. On his final visit Skip was confined to a wheelchair 
but his spirit was as strong as ever. Skip truly personified the 
courage of New York's Bravest.
  Skip Tilearcio was the 15th firefighter to die this year alone from a 
9/11 related illness. Many more are sick and suffering from these 
dreaded 9/11 illnesses. But because of Skip Tilearcio's heroic and 
successful effort to extend the Zadroga Act, these brave first 
responders will receive the very best medical care and treatment. My 
sincerest condolences go out to his wife Tina and his two children 
Tatiana and Robert. R.I.P. Firefighter Robert ``Skip'' Tilearcio.

St. Marys Area High School student Michelle Bauer on winning first 
place in the 34th annual Pennsylvania Municipal League high school 
essay contest.
  Participants were asked to reflect on the theme ``Civics and You'' by 
writing about opportunities in their community that allow for civic 
engagement and encourage citizens to volunteer to help with local 
challenges.
  Today, I would like to share a portion of Michelle's essay:
  ``When I hear the word `civic,' I think of governmental duties. I 
understand my duty as an American citizen to vote, obey laws, pay 
taxes, and serve on juries. These activities all involve one person: 
yourself. In reality, our civic engagement as Americans expands beyond 
a single individual and encompasses entire communities. The definition 
of a civic engagement is an activity that includes both paid and unpaid 
forms of political activism, environmentalism, and service. As I look 
at my community, it is apparent that we have a lot of civic 
engagements.
  ``As with most towns, mine has a city council that holds meetings and 
elections for positions on the council. These elections are open to 
every member of the city and are an excellent way for citizens to have 
a say in the politics of the town. Just as the elections are open to 
all citizens so are the weekly meetings. A unique feature about my 
town's council meetings is that they are televised on a local channel. 
For individuals who are unable to physically be present at the meeting 
or have commitments that require attention, this televised version 
provides a perfect solution to keep abreast of the issues affecting our 
citizens.
  ``Along with a local city council, it is also a civic duty of 
individuals in my community to vote and participate in elections and 
meetings at the school district level. Anyone is able to run for a 
position on the school board as well as attend the meetings. For me, 
our school board is a great way of civic involvement because the board 
is interested in new opportunities that can be incorporated into the 
education of our youth. Just recently, I attended a board meeting where 
the topic of robots was discussed. As a member of a small competition 
group, we were able to present our success and the benefit of 
curriculum that includes new technology. One month later, it was 
announced that a robotics class will be offered in the upcoming school 
year. This will allow even more students to enhance their education and 
perhaps encourage new career choices.
  ``In my community, the civic engagements do not stop on the political 
level. One of the most prominent forms of civic engagement I see in my 
community that is not related to politics is the placing of wreaths on 
the gravestones of fallen soldiers for Memorial Day. Citizens from all 
over town come together the weekend before Memorial Day and walk 
through the entire cemetery adorning and honoring the heroes of our 
country. This event is not for publicity or money but instead is for 
respecting our veterans. Additionally, it is for the betterment of our 
community by presenting a beautiful scene to those passing by.''
  Michelle goes on to write:
  ``Onlookers can also be mesmerized by the beauty of the mountainous 
rural area. Unfortunately, garbage and litter on the side of roads and 
highways is so commonplace that most individuals do not even do a 
double-take when they see it. The highway through my town is an area 
where individuals think it is acceptable to throw garbage out of their 
vehicles or litter the sides of the road with cigarette butts and 
wrappers. For the past 7 years, I have been a part of the National 
Honor Society highway cleanup. Every spring and fall, the society walks 
the sides of the roads picking up trash and making our town look 
beautiful.''
  Mr. Speaker, this is just a portion of Michelle's essay, and I

       When I hear the word civic, I think of governmental duties. 
     I understand my duty as an American citizen to vote, obey 
     laws, pay taxes, and serve on juries. These activities all 
     involve one person: yourself. In reality, our civic 
     engagement as Americans expands beyond a single individual 
     and encompasses entire communities. The definition of a civic 
     engagement is an activity that includes both paid and unpaid 
     forms of political activism, environmentalism, and service. 
     As I look at my community, it is apparent that we have a lot 
     of civic engagements.
       As with most towns, mine has a city council that holds 
     meetings and elections for positions on the council. These 
     elections are open to every member of the city and are an 
     excellent way for citizens to have a say in the politics of 
     the town. Just as the elections are open to all citizens so 
     are the weekly meetings. A unique feature about my town's 
     council meetings is that they are televised on a local 
     channel. For individuals who are unable to physically be 
     present at the meeting or have commitments that require 
     attention, this televised version provides a perfect solution 
     to keep abreast of the issues affecting our citizens.
       Along with a local city council, it is also a civic duty of 
     individuals in my community to vote and participate in 
     elections and meetings at the school district level. Anyone 
     is able to run for a position on the school board as well as 
     attend the meetings. For me, our school board is a great way 
     for civic involvement because the board is interested in new 
     opportunities that can be incorporated into the education of 
     our youth. Just recently, I attended a board meeting where 
     the topic of robots was discussed. As a member of a small 
     competition group, we were able to present our success and 
     the benefit of curriculum that includes new technology. One 
     month later, it was announced that a robotics class will be 
     offered in the upcoming school year. This will allow even 
     more students to enhance their education and perhaps 
     encourage new career choices.
       In my community, the civic engagements do not stop on the 
     political level. One of the most prominent forms of civic 
     engagement I see in my community that is not related to 
     politics is the placing of wreaths on the gravestones of 
     fallen soldiers for Memorial Day. Citizens from all over town 
     come together the weekend before Memorial Day and walk 
     through the entire cemetery adorning and honoring the heroes 
     of our country. This event is not for publicity or money but 
     instead is for respecting our veterans. Additionally, it is 
     for the betterment of our community by presenting a beautiful 
     scene to those passing by.
       Onlookers can also be mesmerized by the beauty of the 
     mountainous rural area. Unfortunately, garbage and litter on 
     the side of roads and highways is so commonplace that most 
     individuals do not even do a double-take when they see it. 
     The highway through my town is an area where individuals 
     think it is acceptable to throw garbage out of their vehicles 
     or litter the sides of the road with cigarette butts and 
     wrappers. For the past seven years, I have been a part of the 
     National Honor Society highway cleanup. Every spring and 
     fall, the society walks the sides of the roads picking up 
     trash and making our town look beautiful.
       Volunteering to pick up the litter is not the only way to 
     carry out civic responsibility. Everybody has either 
     witnessed or directly experienced an accident or fire that 
     required the assistance of a fire department. The fire 
     department is a critical part of a city keeping fires at bay 
     and lending a hand wherever needed. In my community, these 
     people work tirelessly day in and day out for the good of the 
     community. Much of their assistance is not what would be 
     depicted as heroic but rather, responding to flooding issues, 
     weather related emergencies, traffic control, helicopter 
     landing zones, and searching for missing hunters in addition 
     to the rescue and fire calls. They are all volunteers that 
     give up their precious time as a civic duty to their 
     community without expecting recognition. We, the rest of the 
     community, have a duty to help support these people. One of 
     the best ways to do this is to attend their pancake 
     breakfasts that are used as a fundraiser. I am not a huge fan 
     of pancakes and sausage so instead of helping the 
     firefighters out by purchasing a meal, I volunteer to serve 
     the meals to customers. It is the civic duty of individuals 
     in my city to attend this pancake breakfast and show support 
     to the members of this department who tirelessly serve and 
     assist us.
       Reporting for standby at a yearly event in July is another 
     aspect of service that our firefighters join their community 
     for. There are loud BOOMS echoing across the city and 
     suddenly bright orbs of colorful lights bursting in the sky. 
     This grand spectacle entrances onlookers for half an hour 
     with its bright lights and fun designs. A Fourth of July 
     fireworks display like this costs money. Every year, our city 
     struggles to come up with the funds needed to purchase 
     fireworks. Businesses around the town make it their civic 
     duty to help by setting out donation cans in their 
     businesses. The local Dairy Queen even has a day where 30% of 
     the profits from every blizzard purchased go to the city 
     fireworks fund. As citizens in the community, it is our duty 
     to go to Dairy Queen on this day and purchase a blizzard as 
     well as make donations in the cans set up at local 
     businesses. Eating ice cream is certainly an enjoyable way to 
     carry out a civic duty. The July show has been an important 
     part of our community for many years thanks to the numerous 
     supporters.
       We have many such events traced back in our records. Local 
     history is like the heart of the human body. It shapes us, 
     powers our being, and makes us unique. Without history, 
     individuals would not even be alive. A great example would be 
     the Forty-Second Pennsylvania Volunteer Regiment (Bucktails) 
     who were part of the Civil War. These rugged woodsmen were 
     skilled marksmen and ideally suited to the challenges of 
     battle. Stories say that this group was so influential in 
     fighting the war at Gettysburg that the entire outcome could 
     have been different without them. The grit and determination 
     of our local ancestors remains in current day lineage within 
     our community. By knowing local history, members of the 
     community have a sense of pride and can even feel at ease 
     understanding that future generations will uphold the same 
     virtues. My town has a Historical Society that is free to 
     enter and accepts donations of local artifacts and history. 
     As a member of the community, it is my civic engagement to 
     donate any pieces of history I have so that others may 
     benefit from it as well. It is also the duty of our community 
     to visit the Historical Society and learn about our heritage 
     and how we can use the skills of our people to better our 
     society just like the Bucktails did in the Civil War.
       Civic engagements are abundant in our community. From the 
     local fireman's pancake breakfast to the city council 
     meetings, civic activities are occurring all around us. It is 
     the obligation of the citizens to engage in these activities 
     to assist with local challenges and create a better community 
     for all of its members.

Hershel ``Woody'' Williams and commemorate a naval vessel, which was 
christened in his honor on Saturday, October 21, in San Diego, 
California. The ship will provide for accommodations for up to 250 
personnel, will offer a 52,000-square-foot flight deck, and will 
support helicopters and tilt-rotor aircraft.
  Woody Williams grew up on a dairy farm in Fairmont, West Virginia, 
and enlisted in the United States Marine Corps Reserve in Charleston, 
West Virginia, on May 26, 1943.
  Woody landed in Iwo Jima on February 21, 1945. Woody fought through 
the remainder of the 5-week-long battle and was wounded on March 6, for 
which he was awarded the Purple Heart.
  As a result of Woody Williams' courageous service in the 21st 
Marines, 3rd Marine Division in the Battle of Iwo Jima, he received the 
Congressional Medal of Honor from President Truman. Today, at 93 years 
old, he is the last living Medal of Honor recipient from that battle.
  I join all West Virginians in congratulating Woody Williams for this 
incredible honor. He is an unparalleled advocate for veterans from all 
eras and a fine example of what it means not only to be a West 
Virginian but an American.

which will not kill it or send it back to committee. If adopted, the 
bill will immediately proceed to final passage, as amended.
  Mr. Speaker, schools and counties across rural America are facing a 
funding and economic crisis. It has now been over 2 years since 
Congress has failed to reauthorize the Secure Rural Schools program. 
This is beyond unacceptable.
  Schools and counties across rural America are facing a funding and 
economic crisis, and the reauthorization of the Secure Rural Schools 
and Community Self-Determination Act will go a long way to helping 
ensure children get the education they need to achieve success in 
today's economy.
  Across my district, I have heard families, teachers, and school 
administrators in forest counties tell me about the dire straits 
schools will be in if SRS is not reauthorized.
  In Greenlee County, in eastern Arizona, the school superintendent 
shared with me that if the county doesn't see SRS dollars, they will 
have to close the school that provides special education services. This 
is after the school has already gone through major changes to save 
money.
  Across rural Arizona, schools face issues with access to technology 
and the educational opportunities that came with them. Reauthorizing 
Secure Rural Schools will allow more schools to develop innovative 
educational opportunities.
  In Yavapai County, where they are using distance learning, schools 
can share teachers. Making sure that students don't miss opportunities 
because they live in rural America is the right thing to do, and 
reauthorizing SRS will better enable coordination and support for 
students.
  Mr. Speaker, the people of rural Arizona and America are tough and 
innovative, but the simple fact is that they need resources to keep 
schools open and educate children. It is past time that we reauthorize 
SRS, and I call on my colleagues to do so today.
  Across rural America and rural Arizona, the need for infrastructure 
is only growing. In Gila County, a bridge is needed to make it safer 
for residents to cross a creek. SRS funding would make it possible for 
the county to make a greater contribution to get the project completed.
  If we are serious about passing a bipartisan infrastructure plan, it 
is critical that we make sure that local communities can begin 
planning. Reauthorizing SRS would allow that to happen.
  Nationally, there are 720 counties and 4,400 school districts that 
depend on Secure Rural Schools for education, as well as other critical 
services and programs, like law enforcement and infrastructure.
  Rural America is ready for a renaissance, but for it to happen, we 
need to make sure that folks have equal access to opportunities in 
school and in the workforce. That means that we need to guarantee that 
schools have the resources that they need to educate our children and 
achieve their potential. That means we need to make sure that 
communities have infrastructure that supports local economies and keeps 
people safe. That means we need to make sure that rural Americans have 
a fair shot.


  Mr. Speaker, I call on my colleagues to support my commonsense 
amendment on behalf of kids across rural America.
  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time."|24

Arizona presenting this issue about Secure Rural Schools. I am an old 
school teacher. I understand how significant and important it is.
  The issue, though, for Secure Rural Schools is not the 
reauthorization, it is finding a funding stream to keep it going. 
Unfortunately, this amendment doesn't solve the problem. It is not 
reauthorization, it is the funding, and this provides no funding 
whatsoever. It doesn't do what we need to do. It simply is another 
delay tactic.
  And let's face it, we are dealing with more significant issues in 
this Nation, like who is going to win game seven tonight. That is

  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1074. This bill would rescind 
criminal jurisdiction from the State of Iowa over crimes committed by 
or against members of the Sac and Fox Tribe on their lands. In doing 
so, the Tribe or the Federal Government would exercise exclusive 
jurisdiction under the Major Crimes Act. This is the most common legal 
situation for most tribes in America today.
  In 1948, Congress granted jurisdiction over all crimes committed by 
or against Indians on the Sac and Fox Reservation to the State of Iowa. 
In 1949, there was no mechanism in the Federal Government concerning 
criminal jurisdiction on the Tribe's land, and up until that point, the 
Tribe had largely policed themselves.
  Today, the Federal Government has criminal statutory authority on 
Indian lands, the Tribe is again ready to police itself, and the State 
of Iowa has


agreed that its Federal grant of criminal jurisdiction can be repealed.
  Accordingly, under H.R. 1074, the Federal Government will have 
criminal jurisdiction over crimes, especially major crimes, by or 
against Indians on the Tribe's lands. The Tribe would have jurisdiction 
over Indian offenders for crimes over which it exercises jurisdiction, 
and the State of Iowa would retain exclusive jurisdiction over crimes 
where both offender and victim are non-Indians.
  I thank the sponsor of H.R. 1074, the gentleman from Iowa (Mr. Blum), 
for his work on this bill, and I urge adoption of the measure.
  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time."|4

  There are laws on the books that stand in the way of true tribal 
self-determination and self-governance. One of those laws is Public Law 
80-846, known commonly as the 1948 Act. The 1948 Act targeted only one 
tribe, the Sac and Fox Tribe of the Mississippi in Iowa, also known as 
the Meskwaki Nation, and gave the State of Iowa criminal jurisdiction 
over their tribal lands.
  In 1948, the Nation did not have a formal mechanism for law 
enforcement and was not in a financial position to create one. This was 
used as the rationale for the stripping of these jurisdictional rights. 
But this has not been the case for many years. The Tribe has a full-
time police department as well as a fully functioning court system.
  The continued existence of the 1948 Act has resulted in an unfair 
system of crimes committed on Meskwaki land, whereby a Native-American 
defendant must face the possibility of two prosecutions, State and 
Tribal, but a non-Native defendant faces only State prosecution.
  That is why I join my colleagues in supporting H.R. 1074. By passing 
this bill and repealing the 1948 Act, we will remove the inequity it 
has created, and bring the Meskwaki Nation in line with how criminal 
jurisdiction issues are addressed on other Native lands.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the adoption of H.R. 
1074, and I reserve the balance of my time."|5
CREC-2017-11-01-pt1-PgH8323-2-6|Mr. COOK|C001094|CREC-2017-11-01-pt1-PgH8323-2|"  Mr. COOK. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Iowa

yielding and for his time managing today's floor debate.
  Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 1074, a bill I first 
introduced in the 114th Congress, which would repeal a 1948 law that 
granted the State of Iowa criminal jurisdiction over offenses committed 
by or against members of the Sac and Fox Tribe of the Mississippi in 
Iowa.
  Prior to this 1948 law, the Tribe had largely policed itself, and 
there was little, if any, Federal law enforcement on the Tribe's land.
  Historically, determining who may exercise jurisdiction over crime in 
tribal communities is complex. Generally, crimes committed by or 
against Indians in Indian Country are under the jurisdiction of the 
United States, pursuant to various Federal statutes. The 1948 Act was 
passed at a time when the Federal Government was attempting to shift 
its responsibility and obligations from tribes to the respective 
States.
  In 1953, Congress passed a law, commonly called Public Law 280, 
transferring criminal jurisdiction over all crimes, regardless of the 
Indian status of the offender or victim, in Indian Country of six 
States from the Federal Government to those States. Even though Iowa 
was not one of those States, for years it has been treated as if it 
were a Public Law 280 State.

  With respect to the law enforcement on the settlement today, a lot 
has changed since 1948. Today, the Tribe has a fully-functional 
criminal justice system, which includes a full-time police department 
whose officers are certified by the State of Iowa. The Tribe maintains 
and employs law-trained judges and a prosecutor who, together with a 
probation department, handle all criminal cases which arise on tribal 
lands.
  H.R. 1074, and its Senate companion bill, have bipartisan support 
from the entire Iowa delegation, as well as the support of the Iowa 
State Legislature, which passed legislation signed by then-Governor 
Terry Branstad in April 2016, that began this process of conferring 
jurisdiction to the Tribe and the Department of Justice.
  As my friend from California previously mentioned, the entirety of 
the Meskwaki Settlement is located in Tama County, Iowa, in my 
district. Since I have come to Washington, I have gotten to know the 
Sac and Fox Tribal Council and their representatives, and I was happy 
to first introduce this bill in 2016 after its approval by then-
Governor Branstad.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge the adoption of this bill, and I hope it 
continues to move through the legislative process so that the Tribe may 
once again have jurisdiction over many of the crimes committed against 
their members on their land, and restore another portion of the Tribe's 
sovereignty, which has been removed since 1948."|7

programs have reduced the Nation's uninsured rate for children to a 
record low of 5 percent.
  Republicans in Congress let CHIP expire back in September, 
jeopardizing the healthcare of millions of children.
  At the current pace, my home State of Hawaii will exhaust all current 
CHIP funding by the end of this year, leaving thousands of our keiki 
unable to visit a doctor for routine checkups and to receive

Susan Olson is my deputy chief of staff and general counsel. She has 
served Members of Congress, the Senate, and congressional committees 
for decades and is a well-known, beloved public servant around the 
Hill.
  Susan joined my staff when I came to the Senate in 2011, but she 
already had a long track record of distinguished service and respect 
from her peers. I got to know Susan when she served as secretary of the 
House NATO Parliamentary Assembly Delegation, of which I was a member 
during my years in the House of Representatives. Susan's knowledge, 
determination, and warm personality helped her earn the respect and 
admiration of Members and staff alike. She also served as a valued 
staff member on the House Ethics Committee where she was a legal 
counsel from 2004 to 2011.
  Prior to working on the Ethics Committee, Susan served in the office 
of former Congressman Doug Bereuter of Nebraska for 17 years as 
legislative assistant, legislative director, and chief of staff. During 
her tenure with Congressman Bereuter, she also served as the secretary 
of the House Delegation to the British American Parliamentary Group 
from 1998 to 2000.
  Susan's time on my staff has been marked by her wealth of knowledge 
and expertise on so many things. She is a trusted adviser, but more 
importantly, a dear friend to me and to everyone on my staff in 
Washington and Arkansas. We love Susan very much and appreciate all her 
hard work. She takes a personal interest in everyone she meets, from 
the many interns who cycle in and out of my office, to those on my 
staff and the countless men and women she has worked with over the 
years during her time on the Hill.
  We are so happy for and proud of Susan for reaching this milestone. I 
congratulate her for the many years of service she has rendered to the 
U.S. Congress and to our country.

that is coming to Congress this week, and if you don't watch out, it 
could be coming to your hometown soon.
  Up until yesterday, Mr. Speaker, I thought the new GOP tax plan was 
just run-of-the-mill, upside-down class warfare waged by the wealthiest 
people in the country against everybody else. I knew 80 percent of the 
windfall of the tax cut would go to people making $912,000 a year or 
more--the richest 1 percent of the country. I knew it would repeal the 
alternative minimum tax, the only reason that Donald Trump paid any 
taxes at all in the 1 year we know he paid taxes over the last few 
decades in 2005. I knew it would repeal the State and local income tax 
deduction, which would be terrible news for tens of millions of middle 
class people in States across the country, including mine in Maryland.
  I knew it would repeal the estate tax which only affects the 
wealthiest one-half of 1 percent of the country. All of these 
provisions would help to create a


hereditary oligarchical elite like the hereditary oligarchical elite in 
Russia today.

  This huge penthouse suite party will be paid for by the rest of us 
and blow a record-smashing $2 trillion deficit hole into our economy 
and programs like Medicare and Medicaid. I knew all of this. It is 
predictable enough.
  But then I noticed a provision yesterday that is absolutely 
gobstopping, shocking, startling, eye-popping, unbelievable in the GOP 
tax blueprint. It is called the territorial system, and what it means 
is simple. We will tax American businesses only when their operations 
are here in America. Here is what that means: if I am a businessman and 
I am going to set up a manufacturing plant on main street in my 
hometown, I have to pay the full freight of taxes. I pay everything.
  If I set my business, my new manufacturing plant, up in Mexico, or 
Bangladesh, or Ireland, I pay zero taxes. Let me repeat that: if I 
decide to set up my business in America, I pay 100 percent of the taxes 
I am going to owe. If I decide to relocate my business and all of the 
jobs abroad, I will pay zero taxes. That works even if I have already 
got the business in place here and I decide to ship everything 
overseas. Suddenly, I get a 100 percent tax break for all the profits 
that I earn overseas.
  Mr. Speaker, perhaps I misunderstand it. I am not a professor of tax 
law. I am a professor of constitutional law. So maybe I am not 
interpreting it right. I would love nothing more than for one of my 
colleagues from the other side of the aisle to get up and tell me it is 
not true, and correct me, and explain what I have got wrong.
  But if I have got it right, this shocking provision tucked into the 
bill that we are about to see is a job killer, a national emergency, 
and a dagger pointed at the heart of the American economy and our jobs. 
It is only a few, small, big businesses, a few big businesses that will 
benefit.
  Small businesses are not going to be benefited at all. The small 
businesses do not set up tax-dodging corporate subsidiaries in the 
Cayman Islands, or the Bahamas, or in Ireland. They don't ship 
overseas. So this is for a tiny percentage of the largest corporations 
in America, leaving the small businesses behind and taking millions of 
American jobs with them.
  Why would the majority do this to us when Donald Trump campaigned on 
a platform of putting America first and promising to bring American 
jobs back home--not export millions more with a devastating tax plan?
  Now I see why they are hurdling this through Congress. In 1986, with 
the tax reform plan, there were 63 days of hearings, and more than 450 
witnesses in Ways and Means and the Senate Finance Committee. It took 2 
years and 10 months. This plan they want to slam through Congress in 
less than 2 weeks, with barely any witnesses, maybe no hearings, maybe 
one or two hearings; and you know why? Because they are tucking the 
most massive job-killing provision anyone has ever seen into this bill.
  If anything, we should be imposing higher taxes on those businesses 
that ship our jobs overseas--not lower taxes--or they should pay the 
same. But this plan would wipe out any taxes at all, and it is 
dumbfounding that they would think this is something that Congress 
would put up with--just like they tried to slam through Congress the 
ACA repeal and we stopped it when people got the word.
  We have got to make sure, Mr. Speaker, that every American 
understands what is really in this tax bill coming our way.

  On numerous projects, he was the critical link between my office and 
the Kentucky Guard. I know that many on my staff who have had the 
privilege of interacting with him have appreciated Brigadier General 
Bullard's dependability and talent, which I am told also extends to the 
golf course.
  Entering officer training school at Lackland Air Force Base in 1985, 
Brigadier General Bullard took the first steps of his decorated 
military career. He later achieved the rating of master navigator, 
having completed more than 5,500 flight hours on various aircraft. Over 
the years, Brigadier General Bullard flew missions in 75 countries, 
including a deployment to Afghanistan during Operation Enduring 
Freedom. One might think that, with such aviation skill, he would have 
more luck traveling as a passenger on commercial air, but his 
colleagues report that throughout his career, a number of commercial 
flights he has traveled on have experienced weather or maintenance 
delays resulting in numerous nights in the airport for the trained 
airman.
  Brigadier General Bullard has earned and been awarded numerous 
military awards and decorations for his selfless service to the 
Commonwealth and his Nation. These honors include the Bronze Star 
Medal, the Meritorious Service Medal with two bronze oakleaf clusters, 
the Air Medal with one bronze oakleaf cluster, and the Kentucky 
Distinguished Service Medal. These awards are recognition of Brigadier 
General Bullard's distinguished actions on behalf of our Nation and 
Kentucky.
  The men and women of Kentucky's National Guard serve a unique mission 
in our Armed Forces. Their efforts to help fight our Nation's wars, 
defend our homeland, provide relief from natural disasters, and 
maintain critical State, Federal, and international partnerships in 
support of our Nation's safety and security have demonstrated the vital 
nature of the National Guard's service. I am proud to represent them in 
the U.S. Senate, and I am grateful for their sacrifice on behalf of our 
Commonwealth and our Nation.
  As we celebrate Brigadier General Bullard's retirement, we are also 
saddened to lose such a capable and dedicated public servant. In 
addition to his responsibilities at headquarters, Brigadier General 
Bullard has also worked as the chairman of the Louisville Armed Forces 
Committee, two terms as the president of the National Guard Association 
of Kentucky, and as the volunteer executive director of the Kentucky 
Committee for Employer Support of the Guard and Reserve. On behalf of 
the people of Kentucky, I would like to thank him for his 32 years of 
achievement and service. He has earned a relaxing retirement, spending 
time with his family and friends. Finally, I would ask my colleagues in 
the Senate to join me in paying tribute to Brigadier General Bullard, a 
brave American, a selfless public servant, and a proud Kentuckian.

States in many ways. He served in the military and taught in high 
school. He represented rural southern Illinois in the Illinois State 
Senate from 1984 to


1988 and in Congress from 1989 to 1998. I served with him for 8 years 
in the House of Representatives.
  Glenn was a strong proponent of campaign finance reform so much so 
that he limited individual donations and refused contributions from 
political action committees when he ran for Governor in 1998.
  Following his tenure in Congress, Glenn and his wife, Jo, founded the 
Poshard Foundation for Abused Children. The foundation has helped the 
abused, abandoned, and neglected children of southern Illinois for 18 
years.
  Glenn's service to the community also continued through his role as 
president of Southern Illinois University where he was the second 
longest serving president in the history of the Southern Illinois 
University system.
  Earlier this month, Glenn reminded us what service to our country and 
what the American flag means for us in an op-ed in the Southern 
Illinoisan, which I have included here.
  Dr. Poshard wrote:

       In 1962, I joined the U.S. Army on my 17th birthday. I had 
     just graduated from high school and was following in the 
     tradition of my family's military service. They had served in 
     the Civil War and fought their way across Europe and the 
     Pacific in two World Wars. Some were POWs and one, my first 
     cousin and closest friend, Dennis, awarded the Bronze Star 
     for bravery in Vietnam, was the first young man from our 
     county to be killed in that war.
       During my three years of enlistment, I served a tour of 
     duty with the First Cav Division in Korea. When my active 
     duty was finished in December 1965, I immediately entered SIU 
     Carbondale on the GI Bill. Protests against the Vietnam War 
     were already gripping the campus. They were abhorrent to me, 
     particularly when the American flag was used to symbolize 
     anger toward the government. But I was busy, carrying a full 
     load of classes, working three part-time jobs, and trying to 
     support a new family. By the time Old Main burned and the 
     campus closed in the spring of 1970, I was beyond anger for 
     the thousands of protesters desecrating our flag and 
     destroying my beloved university.
       I made no attempt to understand the difference between the 
     symbolism of the flag and the substance of the Bill of Rights 
     as it pertained to freedom to speak against perceived wrongs 
     of our government.
       Years later, as a member of Congress, I was forced to 
     grapple with this volatile issue again. In my first term, a 
     bill was submitted to amend the Constitution prohibiting the 
     desecration of the American flag as a means of protest 
     against our government. Now, I had to understand this issue 
     in its deepest, broadest context. My family and I went to 
     Philadelphia where I sat in Independence Hall, contemplating 
     those early debates of our forefathers on issues of equality, 
     justice and freedom. Moved to tears, I was about to cast a 
     vote of which the historical significance reached back to 
     arguments which formed the founding documents of our country, 
     the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution.
       We drove to Gettysburg and I stood where our greatest 
     President, Abraham Lincoln, delivered his address, taking us 
     back to our Declaration of Independence, which stated, ``All 
     men are created equal and endowed by their Creator with 
     certain unalienable rights, and that among these are life, 
     liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.'' When our forefathers 
     thought they had been denied these rights long enough by the 
     King of England, they fought a Revolutionary War to gain 
     them. And they fought a Civil War to extend those rights to 
     slaves. Over the next 100 years, they fought all over the 
     world to secure these rights for other people.
       President Kennedy spoke of this in his inaugural address. 
     He said, ``These same revolutionary beliefs for which our 
     forefathers fought are still at issue around the globe today. 
     The belief that the rights of man come not from the 
     generosity of the State, but from the hand of God. We dare 
     not forget that we are the heirs of that first Revolution.'' 
     The Declaration goes on to say that when any form of 
     government becomes destructive of these rights then it is the 
     right of the people to protest and alter that form of 
     government so that those rights are secured to the people. 
     And in the 1960s and '70s, people protested against what they 
     believed was an unjust war which imperiled their lives, their 
     freedoms, and their pursuit of happiness. They believed that 
     nearly 60,000 deaths were enough in a war our government 
     either could not or would not win.
       When hundreds of thousands of mostly white young men in the 
     '60s and thousands of mostly black young men today protest 
     against their government, it is because they feel their God-
     given rights are threatened. But why involve the flag? In a 
     Supreme Court decision, Board of Education v. Barnett in 
     1943, Justice Jackson wrote words especially relevant to this 
     issue. He said, ``Freedom to differ is not limited to things 
     that do not matter much. That would be a mere shadow of 
     freedom. The test of freedom's substance is the right to 
     differ as to things that touch the heart of the existing 
     order''--i.e. our flag.
       For many, it is not enough to write a letter to their 
     congressman, attend a meeting or participate in a march. They 
     must take the most important thing symbolizing our freedom--
     the flag--and cast it at the feet of their government to show 
     how emphatically they disagree with government allowing the 
     infringement of their rights. Millions of people of color in 
     our country today feel threatened. They just want to enjoy 
     the same security and freedom we all enjoy and the flag has 
     become central to their protest precisely because it matters, 
     as it did in the '60s to an earlier generation.
       When I protested as a young man in my church that it was 
     not necessary for God to send His only Son to be sacrificed 
     for my freedom, that He could have provided another way, the 
     pastor said, ``Oh yes it was, because He could not win your 
     freedom from sin by sacrificing that which didn't matter 
     much, He had to sacrifice the most important thing He loved, 
     His Son.''
       The Supreme Court has said that the use of the flag in 
     dissent against the government does not diminish it or the 
     contribution of the men and women who fought for our freedom, 
     but instead stands as a powerful symbol to illustrate the 
     substance of our Constitution's Bill of Rights.
       I listened carefully to the debate in 1990 on the flag 
     desecration amendment which for the first time in 200 years 
     would have amended our Bill of Rights. These words from 
     President Reagan's solicitor general, Charles Fried, express 
     my beliefs entirely. ``The flag, as all in this debate agree, 
     symbolizes our nation, its history, its values. We love the 
     flag because it symbolizes the United States; but we must 
     love the Constitution even more, because the Constitution is 
     not a symbol. It is the thing itself.''

  Reading Glenn's op-ed, I was reminded of the late John Glenn, 
colleague, friend, and legend. He testified to the Senate Judiciary 
Committee in 2004 about the flag of the United States. This is a man 
who carried the flag into space as an astronaut. He served in the 
Marine Corps. When presented with a flag-burning amendment, he said, 
``It would be a hollow victory indeed if we preserved the symbol of our 
freedoms by chipping away at those fundamental freedoms themselves.''
  Free speech is the bedrock of our democracy. As millions of Americans 
are participating in the freedoms guaranteed by our Constitution today, 
we should remember Glenn Porshard's point that they do so not to 
destroy our Republic, but to celebrate the strength of our 
Constitution.
  Thank you.

to be printed in the Record.)

  Mr. Speaker, H.R. 1488 would redesignate Indiana Dunes National 
Lakeshore as Indiana Dunes National Park.
  Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore was established by Congress in 1966. 
The designation of the national lakeshore as a unit of the National 
Park Service was the culmination of decades of work by 
conservationists, area residents, and elected officials.
  The original law included 8,330 acres of land and water. The National 
Park Service conservation advocates continued to seek expansion of the 
boundaries, and five subsequent laws increased the size of the national 
lakeshore to more than 15,000 acres.
  In October 1916, shortly after the National Park Service was 
established, NPS Director Stephen Mather held hearings in Chicago to 
gauge public sentiment on a Sand Dunes National Park. In a Department 
of the Interior report published after the hearings, Director Mather 
stated: ``No national park or other Federal reservation offers this 
phenomenon for the pleasure and edification of the people, and no 
national park is as accessible. Furthermore, the dunes offer to the 
visitor extraordinary scenery, a large variety of plant life, 
magnificent bathing beaches, and splendid opportunities to camp and 
live in the wild close to nature.''
  Despite Director Mather's support, the national park proposal was 
abandoned at the onset of World War I, and


several years later, in 1925, Indiana Dunes State Park was established. 
Redesignation of the national lakeside as a national park would make 
Indiana Dunes the 60th national park in the United States.
  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time."|4
CREC-2017-11-01-pt1-PgH8325-5|Mrs. TORRES|T000474|CREC-2017-11-01-pt1-PgH8325|"  Mrs. TORRES. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak on H.R. 1488, the Indiana Dunes 
National Park Act. This act seeks to rename the Indiana Dunes National 
Lakeshore to the Indiana Dunes National Park, one of the over 400 units 
of the National Park System.
  Upon successful redesignation, the Indiana Dunes National Park would 
become the 60th national park, areas which are known for their variety 
of resources, for encompassing large land and water areas, and for 
providing protection of resources within their boundaries.
  Designated in 1966, Indiana Dunes protects over 15,000 acres, 50 
miles of trails, and provides both summer and winter recreational 
activities for over 2 million visitors who trek to the lakeshore each 
year.
  When the lakeshore was admitted into the National Park System in 
1966, it was through the hard work of President Kennedy in 1963-64 to 
create a compromise for the national lakeshore and a port to promote 
the industrial needs of the area.
  Sponsors of this bill, including our esteemed colleague 
Representative Visclosky, believe that renaming the lakeshore as the 
Indiana Dunes National Park will capture the spirit and intent of the 
first National Park Service Director Stephen Mather.
  Director Mather visited the area in 1916 and recommended the area be 
included as a national park within the newly designated National Park 
System. Sadly, the United States' entry into World War I precluded that 
addition. Now, 101 years later, this bill seeks to redesignate 15,000 
acres of the Indiana Dunes National Park.
  I reserve the balance of my time."|5

yielding.
  I want to begin by thanking Chairman Bishop and Ranking Member 
Grijalva for all of their work on this legislation, as well as Chairman 
McClintock and Ranking Member Hanabusa and Mrs. Torres for their 
diligence.
  Mr. Speaker, the legislation we are considering today represents a 
very small change--one word--but it would have an enormous benefit of 
rightly placing the Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore where it belongs 
as the Nation's 60th national park and the first national park in the 
State of Indiana.
  As mentioned, located along the southern shore of Lake Michigan, the 
Indiana Dunes are a natural wonder and home of a vast array of rare 
plants. According to the National Park Service, Indiana Dunes National 
Lakeshore is the seventh most biologically diverse National Park 
Service unit.
  I believe the chairman and Mrs. Torres ably described the history of 
the dunes and its evolution. I thank them for that, and I would thank 
all of the citizens over that half century and more that petitioned for 
the creation of this great park.
  The lakeshore currently does encompass about 15,000 acres of wetlands 
and marshes, beaches, oak savannahs, and sand dunes. It is clear that 
the title of the Indiana Dunes National Park is fitting for such a 
unique natural resource.
  The American taxpayers, over a number of generations, have invested 
in the preservation of the park. It is incumbent that we do everything 
possible to encourage citizens and travelers from around the world to 
visit it, to learn about it, to recreate, and to simply enjoy the 
environment of northwest Indiana's lakeshore. H.R. 1488 helps to 
achieve this goal.
  Mr. Speaker, I am proud that the act is supported in a bipartisan 
fashion by the entire Indiana delegation. I would also like to thank 
Senators Donnelly and Young, who have introduced a companion measure in 
the Senate.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support passage."|8

  Mr. Speaker, I want to recognize Ranking Member Engel for authorizing 
this important measure on Hong Kong, the city once known as the Pearl 
of the Orient.
  I commend the gentleman for strongly advocating for Hong Kong's 
continued adherence to the ``one country, two systems'' policy that has 
allowed for Hong Kong's autonomy and prosperity for so long. I was 
happy to join him as an original cosponsor of this important measure.
  During a recent trip that I led to Hong Kong, I heard firsthand how 
measures like this are helpful in keeping the pressure on Beijing to 
keep its commitment to the Joint Declaration.
  Twenty years have now passed since the handover of Hong Kong from the 
United Kingdom to the People's Republic of China. At the time, the U.S. 
Congress played a vital role in the continuity of the U.S. relationship 
with Hong Kong by passing the Hong Kong Policy Act in 1992. This act 
established that the U.S. would treat Hong Kong as a nonsovereign 
entity distinct from China on commercial, cultural, and law enforcement 
matters so long as it remained ``sufficiently autonomous.''
  Since the handover, Hong Kong has continued to be a global economic 
force and a financial hub. In recent years, however, it has also begun 
to face increased social, economic, and political challenges, including 
external pressures.
  Mr. Speaker, we saw the Umbrella Movement protest in 2014, which was 
led by youth seeking to liberalize the electoral system and introduce 
true universal suffrage to Hong Kong in accordance with the Joint 
Declaration between Great Britain and China. In the intervening years, 
we have witnessed booksellers kidnapped from Hong Kong, Thailand, and 
Mainland China; legislator oaths being invalidated; and the jailing of 
protest leaders.
  For many of us here in Congress, there is growing concern about the 
apparent increased role of Beijing in the affairs of Hong Kong. 
Therefore, Mr. Speaker, it is important to reiterate here today that 
our special treatment of Hong Kong is dependent upon it remaining 
sufficiently autonomous. We want to see Hong Kong's highly developed 
rule of law, independent judiciary, and respect for individual freedoms 
remain as the lifeblood of Hong Kong and its economic prosperity as 
guaranteed, again, by China and Great Britain in the Joint Declaration.
  Passage of this resolution demonstrates our support for the 
continuation of the ``one country, two systems'' policy in Hong Kong, 
so I urge my colleagues to join me in support of this measure.
  I reserve the balance of my time."|4

Sherman, and Smith, and I want to thank them all for their partnership.
  I really listened intently to Mr. Yoho and also know that we make 
progress on the Foreign Affairs Committee because, as Mr. Poe of Texas 
said, we work in bipartisan measure, and we try to agree on the 
language and we try to make sure that the U.S. Congress speaks with one 
voice so that both our friends and adversaries around the world will 
understand that we put partisanship aside. We leave it at the water's 
edge, and I think that is very important.
  I think the kind of people the Foreign Affairs Committee attracts to 
serve on the committee, on both sides of the aisle, are the kind who 
keep perpetuating this bipartisan spirit because we have differences in 
policies, for sure, but we are all Americans. We all want to keep each 
other safe, and we all want to make sure that America does the right 
thing and that others do the right thing to America as well.
  So when we have the incident like we had yesterday with the terrible 
terrorist attack in Manhattan, it makes us pause, as a Congress, and 
think about what this all means.
  People in Hong Kong were made promises as well. They were made 
promises years ago that China would be one country, including Hong 
Kong, but two systems, that Hong Kong would be its independent system. 
And, of course, the Chinese officials and Beijing regime have tried 
every which way to go after student protesting, curbing the rights and 
values of the people of Hong Kong, so this resolution is really very, 
very important.
  I thank, again, Representatives Smith, Sherman, Yoho, and Chabot. But 
I also want to recognize Doug Anderson and Sean O'Neill on the 
chairman's staff for their contributions to this resolution, and 
Jennifer Hendrixson-White on my staff. It is a great example, again, of 
bipartisanship when it comes to foreign policy. We work together and we 
produce what I regard as superior products.
  For decades, Mr. Speaker, the United States has shared an important, 
unique relationship with Hong Kong. That relationship has been based on 
Hong Kong's autonomy from Mainland China. This resolution underscores 
our national security interest in seeing Hong Kong remain autonomous at 
a time when we have seen some troubling trends.
  Twenty years ago, at the time of the handover, China made a 
commitment that Hong Kong would continue to enjoy its special status. 
Today, China claims that the 1997 Joint Declaration is a so-called 
``historical document'' that has, again, ``no practical significance.'' 
But the UK and the United States believe in international law, and we 
are committed to holding China to its word, again, a ``one country, two 
systems'' form of government in Hong Kong.

  This approach was experimental when the Chinese and British first 
devised it. You may remember that Hong Kong was a British colony. The 
Chinese Government essentially said that Hong Kong would continue to 
have its own executive, legislative, and judicial rights, that the 
people of Hong Kong would continue to enjoy fundamental rights 
guaranteed in Hong Kong's laws. But Beijing is now backing away from 
its commitments, even declaring the Joint Declaration a historical 
document with no relevance today.
  Meddling in Hong Kong's elections by China's National People's 
Congress led to the Umbrella protests in 2014. Hong Kong residents 
critical of the People's Republic of China have disappeared, while the 
presence of the People's Liberation Army has grown.
  The credibility of Hong Kong's courts has suffered following 
decisions to send Umbrella Movement student leaders to prison after 
they had already served their previous sentences. Academic freedoms 
have eroded. Self-censorship has grown, and journalists face regular 
harassment.
  So we are worried, Mr. Speaker. We are worried about Chinese 
encroachment, about what is going to happen to the people of Hong Kong, 
and about the way China's newly aggressive posture is going to affect 
our relationship with Hong Kong in the future.
  Twenty years after accepting the so-called ``one country, two 
systems'' model, China's objective now seems to be making Hong Kong and 
the mainland ``one country, one system.'' This is not what the 
government in Beijing, the international community, the United States, 
Great Britain, or the people of Hong Kong signed up for.
  So this issue raises bigger questions, Mr. Speaker:
  To what degree will the Chinese Government live up to its 
international commitments as China continues to expand economically and 
grow in stature on the global stage?
  This measure says, ``Enough.'' It sends a message to China that we in 
the United States Congress expect Beijing to keep its word. That is not 
asking too much. It reiterates that our special bond with Hong Kong is 
based on our shared values, the values of democracy, and that we want 
to see that relationship endure for years to come.
  So I am grateful to my colleagues for working on this measure with 
me, especially Mr. Yoho. I ask support from all Members.


  In closing, Mr. Speaker, let me again remind everyone that Hong Kong 
is special because of its judicial independence and strong rule of law 
that is supposed to be protected under the ``one country, two systems'' 
approach. That is also the reason why the United States shares such a 
strong strategic relationship with Hong Kong.
  This resolution is a reminder of why our ties with Hong Kong are so 
important, and a call for all parties to respect the decades-old 
commitments that have underpinned Hong Kong's autonomy. At a time when 
China is growing more and more aggressive in its neighborhood, the 
United States cannot be seen as ceding ground. We need to stand up for 
our friends. We need to stand up for our values. We need to stand up 
for our interests. We need to hold all countries to their commitments, 
just as the United States lives up to our own.
  I ask for all Members to support this measure. I thank our chairman, 
Ed Royce, and Mr. Yoho for their remarks.
  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time."|5

  I, too, want to thank the ranking member, Mr. Engel; Mr. Royce, the 
chairman of the committee; Doug Anderson; and, of course, Hunter 
Strupp. I chair the Asia and the Pacific Subcommittee of the Foreign 
Affairs Committee. It has been a bipartisan committee, and to see 
everybody come together to work on these different situations, and 
different bills and resolutions, it is so important that we project a 
unified body.
  I would think China, as they move forward, would look hard to honor 
their commitment that they made because it is not just Hong Kong they 
are influencing. It is all of the other countries in the world, and it 
will determine future negotiations on how China, Beijing, honors their 
commitment that they made with Hong Kong that the other nations will 
look at.
  Hong Kong plays an important role in today's regional and world 
economy. Its open market and strong rule of law have served as an 
example to the region of how freedom and a rules-based society can 
foster a positive environment for its people's happiness and 
prosperity.
  The U.S. has benefited greatly from strong economic cultural ties to 
Hong Kong, and I would venture to say, the world has benefited from 
that. We want to continue this relationship, but to do so, Hong Kong 
must remain sufficiently autonomous. Our President is headed on a 5-
country, 12-day tour of the Asia area at the end of the week, and it 
will be his first time visiting China as President.
  With this resolution, we send a strong message from Congress about 
our support for Hong Kong's continued prosperity and special status. 
Thus, we urge faithfulness to the ``one country, two systems'' policy, 
as established by the joint declaration and the basic law with respect 
to Hong Kong's autonomy and its enjoyment of the executive, 
legislative, and judicial powers. Hong


Kong's independent judiciary must be sacrosanct.
  In closing, I would like to thank Ranking Member Engel again and the 
original cosponsors: Mr. Smith, Mr. Chabot, Mr. Sherman, and Connolly.
  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time."|6
CREC-2017-11-01-pt1-PgH8365-7|Mr. SMITH of New Jersey|S000522|CREC-2017-11-01-pt1-PgH8365|"  Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I commend Ranking Member, Mr. 
Engel, along with Chairman Yoho, Mr. Chabot, and Mr. Sherman, for 
introducing H. Res. 422.
  I am an original cosponsor of this legislation. As the Cochair of the 
bipartisan and bicameral Congressional-Executive Commission on China, I 
have been gravely concerned by the Chinese government's efforts to 
curtail Hong Kong's autonomy and crush pro-democracy voices in this 
city.
  Twenty years ago, China promised to guarantee Hong Kong's autonomy 
and freedoms for 50 years through the Sino-British Joint Declaration. 
These promises have been needlessly strained in recent years, calling 
into question the viability of a `One Country, Two Systems' model that 
has provided great benefits to both China and the world.
  The threats to Hong Kong's autonomy and its freedoms are progressing. 
At the recent 19th Party Congress, Communist Party General Secretary 
and President Xi Jinping reiterated the fact that Hong Kong's autonomy 
is limited by Beijing's ``comprehensive jurisdiction''--meaning that 
Beijing has the final say on what freedoms are exercised in Hong Kong 
and who gets to lead the city's government.
  On October 11, 2017, a British human rights activist, Benedict 
Rogers, was denied access to Hong Kong by the Chinese government. Mr. 
Rogers was also warned not to continue meeting with pro-democracy 
supporters in Hong Kong by the Chinese Embassy in London.
  Beijing is now telling foreigners with whom they can meet in Hong 
Kong and barring entry to those who will not comply.
  This is a chilling development that should be a concern from all 
countries and corporations that have an interest in Hong Kong's 
freedoms. Maintaining these freedoms and the rule of law are vital 
economic interests of the United States.
  The governments and legislatures of the UK and the United States 
should work together to ensure that the Sino-Declaration Joint 
Declaration remains in force to protect Hong Kong's unique way of life.
  Xi Jinping also said recently about Hong Kong that he would ``never 
allow anyone, any organization, or any political party, to separate any 
part of Chinese territory from China . . . and that attempts to 
endanger China's sovereignty and security, to challenge the power of 
the central government . . . [crosses] the red line.''
  Given Beijing's expansive view of its own security to include anyone 
peacefully seeking political reforms or rights protections, these are 
ominous words indeed.
  Beijing has ramped up efforts to destroy the pro-democracy movement 
in Hong Kong. This past year, six elected legislators were disqualified 
after the National People's Congress intervened in Hong Kong's 
judiciary. Then, in August, a Hong Kong court issued heavier sentences 
for Joshua Wong, Nathan Law, and Alex Chow, leaders of the peaceful 
Umbrella Movement of 2014.
  Mr. Wong, Mr. Law, and Mr. Chow should now be considered Hong Kong's 
first political prisoners. Though Joshua Wong and Nathan Law are out on 
bail at the moment pending an appeal, they face other charges and may 
be put back in prison in the future. They likely will not be the last 
political prisoners in Hong Kong, as other Umbrella Movement leaders 
were convicted recently, including Professor Benny Tai.
  Senator Marco Rubio and I, with whom I cochair the CECC, have 
announced our intention to nominate Hong Kong pro-democracy Umbrella 
Movement for the 2018 Nobel Peace Prize. I hope all Members will 
consider signing on to that initiative.
  I support this resolution, but it should not be our last word. In 
1992, the U.S. Congress passed the Hong Kong Policy Act, saying that 
U.S. policy toward Hong Kong was contingent on the preservation of Hong 
Kong's autonomy and freedoms. With these fundamental elements being 
diminished by the Chinese government, we should consider amending a 
bill passed 25 years ago to better protect U.S. interests.
  That is why I introduced, along with Congressman Tim Walz (a fellow 
CECC Commissioner), the Hong Kong Human Rights & Democracy Act (H.R. 
3856)--a bill that I introduced in the last Congress and which has been 
introduced by Senator Marco Rubio and Senator Ben Cardin in the Senate.
  If Hong Kong is to be just another Chinese city, then we have the 
responsibility to reassess whether Hong Kong warrants special status 
under U.S. law.
  We all have a stake in ensuring Hong Kong remains an open city, with 
the rule of law and guaranteed rights currently unavailable in Mainland 
China.
  I support passage of this bill and thank the gentleman from New York 
for his leadership on this issue."|7

CREC-2017-11-01-pt1-PgS6963-2-0|Mr. GRASSLEY|G000386|CREC-2017-11-01-pt1-PgS6963-2|"  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, last month the Environmental Protection 
Agency--EPA--Administrator, Scott Pruitt, issued a directive to all 
Agency employees that prohibits the so-called sue-and-settle process. 
This is good news for good government.
  Most of us here are familiar with the term ``sue and settle.''
  These are tactics whereby the EPA has, in the past, resolved certain 
lawsuits against it through agreements negotiated behind closed doors 
with politically favored interest groups. As we saw under the Obama 
administration, some of these agreements committed the EPA to take far-
reaching regulatory action, all without an adequate opportunity for 
those people most impacted to have a seat at the table, as would 
normally be done through the regulatory process.
  Today, I come to the floor to applaud Administrator Pruitt's 
leadership in working to end these tactics, which make a mockery of 
laws that Congress has put in place to ensure a transparent and 
accountable regulatory process. The commonsense reforms outlined in 
Administrator Pruitt's directive will, no doubt, help restore 
transparency and accountability, and these reforms should stand as a 
prime example for all Federal agencies to follow.
  Accordingly, I call upon President Trump to use his full authority 
through Executive order to ensure that similar reforms are adopted 
across the entire bureaucracy. Regulatory decisions that affect key 
parts of our economy should be made in an open, transparent, and, 
consequently, accountable manner. But as we have seen with sue and 
settle, Washington bureaucrats and their interest group pals would 
prefer to do things their own way.
  It works like this. First, an interest group sues a Federal agency, 
claiming the agency has failed to take regulatory action required by 
law. Through the lawsuit, the interest group seeks to compel the agency 
to take action by a new, often rushed, deadline. These plaintiff 
interest groups often share a common regulatory agenda with the agency 
they sue, such as when an environmental group sues the EPA or the Fish 
and Wildlife Service.
  Instead of challenging the lawsuit, the agency and the interest group 
enter into negotiations behind closed doors to produce either a 
``settlement agreement'' or a ``consent decree'' committing the agency 
to take regulatory action. There is no transparency, no accountability, 
which you would get through normal regulation writing.
  Noticeably absent from these negotiations are the very parties who 
will be most impacted, such as farmers, manufacturers, and even the 50 
States themselves, which will be charged with enforcing some of these 
regulations. In 2010, for example, an environmental interest group sued 
the Obama administration EPA to force the agency to revise certain 
wastewater regulations.
  Wouldn't it be nice to have the people who are affected by those 
regulations involved in the process in an open way--the way the 
Administrative Procedure Act is designed?
  Oddly enough, the same day the lawsuit was filed, the plaintiff 
interest group submitted a consent decree already signed by the EPA, 
which committed the agency to take prompt regulatory action. Such a 
scenario should raise serious questions about how truly adversarial 
these lawsuits and negotiations are.
  To add insult to injury, regulations that have resulted from sue-and-
settle tactics impose tremendous costs on the American economy. 
According to the American Action Forum, from 2005 to 2016, 23 sue-and-
settle regulations resulted in a cost burden of $67.9 billion, with 
$26.5 billion in actual costs. Sixteen of the rules imposed paperwork 
burdens on American job creators of more than 8 million hours. Think 
about that. Nearly $70 billion in regulatory costs were imposed on 
American business owners, manufacturers, farmers, and probably 
taxpayers, all without due regard for transparency and the normal 
rulemaking process required by the Administrative Procedure Act.
  Decades ago, Congress enacted the Administrative Procedure Act for 
the sole purpose of ensuring transparency, accountability, and, more 
importantly, public participation in Federal rulemaking. The EPA has 
been described as the citizens' ``regulatory bill of rights.'' A pillar 
of the Administrative Procedure Act is the notice-and-comment process, 
which requires agencies to notify the public of proposed regulations 
and respond to comments submitted--in other words, transparency.
  Rulemaking driven by sue-and-settle tactics frequently results in 
reprioritized agency agendas and rushed deadlines for regulatory 
action. This renders the EPA's notice-and-comment process a mere 
formality. It deprives regulated entities, it deprives the States, and 
most importantly, it deprives the American public of sufficient time to 
have any meaningful input on final rules. The resulting regulatory 
action is driven not by the public interest but by the special interest 
priorities.
  Sue-and-settle tactics also help agencies avoid accountability for 
their actions. Instead of having to answer to the public for 
controversial regulatory decisions, agency officials will simply point 
to a court order and say that their hands are tied, when really they 
welcomed that process.
  The American people deserve better, but don't just take my word for 
it. The Environmental Council of the States, a national nonprofit, 
nonpartisan association of State and territorial environmental agency 
leaders, adopted a resolution in 2013 entitled ``The Need for Reform 
and State Participation in EPA's Consent Decrees which Settle Citizen 
Suits.'' The rationale behind it


provides that ``state environmental agencies are not always notified of 
citizen suits that allege U.S. EPA's failure to perform its 
nondiscretionary duties, are often not parties to these citizen suits, 
and are usually not provided with an opportunity to participate in the 
negotiation of agreements to settle citizen suits.''
  The Environmental Council of the States further resolved that 
``greater transparency of citizen suit settlement agreements is needed 
for the public to understand the impact of these agreements on the 
administration of environmental programs.''
  Obviously, I agree. We need more transparency, more accountability, 
and more voices at the table. In other words, the public's business 
ought to be public, not some new regulation agreed to behind closed 
doors. I am happy to say that this administration is working to 
accomplish that, thanks to Administrator Pruitt. In his own words: 
``The days of this regulation through litigation . . . are 
terminated.''
  His directive puts a swift end to sue-and-settle tactics by this one 
agency, the EPA. It does so by adopting commonsense reforms to promote 
transparency and public participation in the regulatory process. It 
requires the publication online of notices of lawsuits filed against 
the EPA. It requires the EPA to reach out and notify any States or 
regulated entities that will be affected by the lawsuit. It requires 
the EPA to seek the agreement of any affected State or regulatory 
entities before the agency can enter into a consent decree or 
settlement agreement. Further, it prohibits the EPA from entering into 
any consent decree or settlement that converts a discretionary duty of 
the agency into a mandatory duty to issue, revise, or amend a 
regulation. Most importantly, it requires the EPA to post online for 
public comment any proposed consent decrees or settlement agreements 
before they are entered into by the court.
  These and other reforms in Administrator Pruitt's directive mark a 
very strong step toward ensuring that States, American job creators, 
and the public at large have a seat at the table when regulatory 
decisions are made, which is exactly why Congress passed the 
Administrative Procedure Act.
  Before I close, I will add one more thing. Earlier this year, I 
introduced the Sunshine for Regulatory Decrees and Settlements Act. 
This bill would make permanent the very types of reforms outlined in 
Administrator Pruitt's directive. If it becomes law, it can't be 
changed at some later date. In other words, it would ensure that future 
administrations can't simply roll back the great work Administrator 
Pruitt is doing through this directive.
  I am pleased to hear that the House of Representatives just passed 
the companion bill introduced by Congressman Doug Collins. We will 
continue our work to build bipartisan support here in the Senate for 
this commonsense decree.
  But, today, I urge President Trump to move forward with the example 
set by Administrator Pruitt because Administrator Pruitt is draining 
the swamp through this process. The President loves to sign Executive 
orders. He would probably do more good in draining the swamp by 
producing an Executive order like this than almost any other Executive 
order he could do.
  There is simply no reason these reforms should be limited to just the 
EPA. Transparency and public participation are core elements of a more 
accountable government. Simply stated, they are part of the process of 
representative government, where people make the laws and where 
administrators carry out the laws, not where something is done behind 
closed doors because some special interest wants something or because 
the agency is begging to do something--which maybe someone doesn't want 
them to do--to get it done and to do it behind closed doors, just to 
work it out the way they want it and not necessarily the way it would 
be done if people were participating.
  I applaud Administrator Pruitt's directive. I urge the President to 
promptly see to it that similar reforms are implemented across the 
administration.
  So for a third time today, President Trump, issue an Executive order 
to all departments to do what Administrator Pruitt has done at the EPA.

occasion of its 60th anniversary. There are few human needs more 
precious and more critical than access to fresh and safe drinking 
water. Indeed, we have seen what can happen when those needs are 
neglected, as the tragedy in Flint, Michigan reminds us. Prior to the 
creation of the Fairfax County Water Authority (now known as Fairfax 
Water), water was supplied to Fairfax County through many small, mostly 
private water systems, and a limited number of public systems. There 
was no standardization between systems and each system maintained its 
own rate schedule and level of service. In order to improve service 
reliability, establish equitable rates, and provide effective fire 
protection throughout Fairfax County, the Board of Supervisors created 
Fairfax Water in September 1957 for the purpose of ``acquiring, 
constructing, operating and maintaining an integrated water system for 
supplying and distributing water.''
   The acquisition of water systems began in 1959 with the purchase of 
the Annandale Water Company. Over the next eight years, Fairfax Water 
acquired an additional 17 systems and began to build a comprehensive 
water-supply system. By the end of 1967, Fairfax Water had 832 miles of 
mains, 3,354 fire hydrants, and 54,000 metered accounts serving more 
than 425,000 people. By 1982, that number had grown to more than 1,800 
miles of mains, more than 10,300 fire hydrants and nearly 126,000 
metered accounts serving more than 650,000 people. By 1994, it would 
reach more than 2,700 miles of water mains, more than 17,300 fire 
hydrants and more than 197,300 meters.
   Those numbers show a county undergoing tremendous growth in both 
population and urbanization. The challenges associated with that are 
numerous and the temptation of providing service while overlooking the 
quality of that service is real. However, Fairfax Water has never 
allowed itself to fall into that trap. Instead, it has approached every 
new challenge with its mission in mind: providing safe, clean drinking 
water to Fairfax County residents and ensuring that the County's water 
supply is maintained. There have certainly been no shortage of 
challenges--from supply issues stemming from the use of a single source 
(the Occoquan River) to natural disasters to the threat of terrorism, 
Fairfax Water has risen to meet those challenges. Its work stands as 
testament to the strength and character of the ethos of public service 
in our community.
   Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating 
Phillip Allin, Charles Murray, the members of the Board of Directors 
and the entire staff of Fairfax Water. I thank them for their service 
to our community and for maintaining the proud legacy of this 
organization while adapting it to meet the challenges of the future.

honor the passing of Stanley Coolidge and his fiancee, Roseann Hannah.
  Their lives were tragically lost on October 9, 2017, while trapped in 
their northern California home as it was destroyed by wildfire. What 
began as the faint smell of a distant fire quickly turned to tragedy as 
the area surrounding Stanley's longtime home was ignited rapidly by a 
fast-approaching fire. As Stan and Roseann attempted a hurried 
evacuation, the house was engulfed by flames before they could escape.
  Stan was a retired attorney, born in San Francisco, but lived his 
last 50 years in the mountains of Loma Rica, California. Roseann was a 
resident of Grass Valley, California. Both she and Stan were very 
valued members of their communities.
  Our thoughts and prayers are with the Coolidge and Hannah families as 
we ask the Lord's blessings for comfort and healing at this very 
tragic, very sad time, as well as the families of all who we have lost 
as a result of the fires in the West.

Elementary School of Brownsburg, IN, for being named a 2017 National 
Blue Ribbon School by the U.S. Department of Education.
  Established in 1982, the National Blue Ribbon Schools Program 
recognizes schools that have demonstrated a vision of educational 
excellence for all students, regardless of their social or economic 
background. Since its inception, this program has allowed schools in 
every State to gain recognition for educational accomplishments, 
particularly in closing the achievement gaps among students.
  White Lick Elementary School currently serves over 600 students and 
offers a variety of education and extracurricular opportunities for its 
students.
  White Lick Elementary School has been effective in tailoring its 
curriculum to the educational needs of each individual student. As part 
of its commitment to students, the school provides programs like 
Learning Lab, which offers students struggling academically extra 
support in reading and math in a small-group setting every day for 30 
minutes.
  The school also prides itself on the professional development of its 
staff. Teachers are given the chance to learn and grow through weekly 
meetings with their professional learning communities. In these 
meetings, teachers come together to analyze test scores and other data 
as they discuss how to better meet the needs of their students.
  The school's investment in students is reflected in the diverse 
opportunities it offers. Whether it is through the ``Step-a-thon,'' 
where students participate in a physical challenge to help raise funds 
for various school programs or the numerous afterschool clubs, White 
Lick has excelled in offering resources and programs beyond the 
classroom.
  I am proud to recognize White Lick Elementary School principal Susan 
Wise, the entire staff, the student body, the parents, and the entire 
Brownsburg community. The effort, dedication, and value you put into 
education has led not only to this prestigious recognition but will 
benefit your students and Indiana well into the future.
  On behalf of the citizens of Indiana, I congratulate White Lick 
Elementary School, and I wish the students and staff continued success 
in the future.

CREC-2017-11-01-pt1-PgS6937-7-0|Mr. McCONNELL|M000355|CREC-2017-11-01-pt1-PgS6937-7|"  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, yesterday, when the Senate confirmed 
the nomination of Professor Amy Barrett to the Seventh Circuit Court of 
Appeals, we took another important step to ensure that the Federal 
judiciary fulfills its role in our constitutional system. Now we have 
an opportunity to confirm another well-qualified woman to the bench, 
Michigan Supreme Court Justice Joan Larsen. President Trump nominated 
her to serve on the Sixth Circuit, and she will be a strong addition to 
that court and a benefit to our Nation.
  After graduating first in her class from Northwestern's law school, 
Justice Larsen served as a law clerk for Judge David Sentelle of the DC 
Circuit Court and then for Justice Antonin Scalia. These clerkships 
honed Justice Larsen's legal abilities and respect for


the rule of law, preparing her for a distinguished career.
  Joan Larsen also served as the Deputy Assistant Attorney General in 
the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel. Former government 
officials from both Republican and Democratic administrations wrote in 
strong support of her nomination, each of them holding her in the 
highest regard.
  Joan Larsen later joined the law faculty at the University of 
Michigan, teaching there for many years. She excelled in academia, 
earning the praise of her students and the esteem of her colleagues. In 
fact, more than 30 of Michigan's deans and law professors wrote to 
support her nomination. They wrote that Justice Larsen's ``commitment 
to the rule of law and her capacity for top-flight legal analysis are 
both of the first order, and her personal integrity and decency are 
exceptional.'' Even when they disagreed, her colleagues praised Justice 
Larsen's generous manner, her personal integrity, as well as her legal 
acumen.
  In 2015, Larsen was appointed to the Michigan Supreme Court. The next 
year, she won election to a full term, winning every single county in 
the State. Her fellow justices--even those with different ideologies--
praised her intellect and her commitment to apply the law as it is 
written to every case before them.
  Joan Larsen's time on the Michigan high court has shown a record of 
independence and of fairness. Here is how one practitioner put it in a 
letter to the Judiciary Committee: ``I am not a Republican,'' he wrote. 
``Justice Larsen approaches cases with an open mind and an independence 
from party affiliation. . . . I believe that . . . Justice Larsen has 
had a very positive influence on the Michigan Supreme Court. In my 
view, she would be a deserving addition to the Sixth Circuit Court of 
Appeals.''
  Another lawyer wrote the committee, advising that he ``has practiced 
law in Michigan for 39 years'' and is ``a past president of the 
Michigan Association for Justice (formerly the Michigan Trial Lawyers 
Association).'' He goes on to say that Justice Larsen ``has 
demonstrated on the bench that she is precisely who she is in person, a 
genuine, thoughtful individual who respects precedent, the common law 
and the role that lawyers and judges play in society. . . . I have no 
hesitation in telling you that Justice Larsen will make an excellent 
judge on the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals.''
  In conclusion, President Trump continues to nominate smart, well-
qualified, and impartial individuals to our Nation's Federal courts. 
Justice Larsen, like each of the other nominees before her, was 
nominated on the basis of her belief in the rule of law and her 
commitment to apply the law fairly to everyone who enters her 
courtroom.
  Once again, I would also like to thank Chairman Chuck Grassley for 
his leadership on the Judiciary Committee, tirelessly working to bring 
the President's nominees to the floor.
  I look forward to voting to confirm Joan Larsen today, and I urge all 
of my colleagues to join me.

California (Ms. Roybal-Allard) for 5 minutes."|0
CREC-2017-11-01-pt1-PgH8298-1|Ms. ROYBAL-ALLARD|R000486|CREC-2017-11-01-pt1-PgH8298|"  Ms. ROYBAL-ALLARD. Mr. Speaker, last week, the Labor-HHS 
Appropriations Subcommittee had a most remarkable hearing on Down 
syndrome, which moved us to a new understanding of this disability.
  DS is a genetic disorder that affects over 300,000 men, women, and 
children in America. It is the most common chromosomal disorder and the 
most frequent genetic cause of learning disabilities in children.
  Each year, approximately 6,000 babies in the United States are born 
with Down syndrome, a condition resulting from an extra 21st 
chromosome. Sixty years ago, people with DS had a life expectancy of 
less than 20 years, and most lived their lives in institutions. Today, 
due to early medical care and being raised in loving homes, these 
children can expect to live well into their sixties.
  Last week's hearing was one of the most emotionally charged and 
inspirational hearings I can recall as a member of this subcommittee. 
The room was filled with children and adults with DS and their 
families, including my young constituent, Jose Cisneros. Amidst the 
tears, laughter, and applause, we heard inspiring stories about the 
amazing accomplishments of DS teens and young adults in sports, 
scouting, community activism, and film acting.
  We learned that they are graduating from high schools, attending 
colleges, and working at jobs in their communities.
  And, most importantly, we saw how these young Americans are teaching 
our country about the value of diversity and inclusion, while at the 
same time increasing the happiness quotients of those lucky enough to 
be in their very wide circle of friends.
  We also learned some very surprising and amazing facts about Down 
syndrome. Researchers told us that individuals with DS are medically 
very special. On the one hand, they are highly predisposed to 
autoimmune disorders such as thyroid disease and rheumatoid arthritis; 
children with DS are 50 times more likely to develop


childhood leukemia, and virtually all adults with DS will develop the 
brain pathology of Alzheimer's by the age of 40.
  But they also said that due to a small difference in their genetic 
makeup, persons with Down syndrome are naturally protected from heart 
disease, high blood pressure, and most solid-tissue cancers. 
Researchers said studying these unique genetics could help discover 
ways to prevent or cure diseases such as cancer, autoimmune disorders, 
and Alzheimer's disease.
  With such promising potential, one would think the Federal Government 
would invest heavily in Down syndrome research. Unfortunately, what we 
learned was that over the last two decades, DS has been one of the 
least funded genetic conditions at the NIH.
  This hearing left no doubt about the need for a significant and 
sustained investment in Down syndrome research. A trans-NIH DS 
initiative could help not only find answers and cures for DS, but 
discover its mysteries, which could answer questions about other 
serious and life-threatening diseases.
  While the benefits of DS research are unquestionable, it will take 
time to realize its full potential. In the meantime, we must ensure 
those living with DS can access and afford high-quality, coordinated 
healthcare and the long-term services and support they need to live 
productive lives in their communities.
  Medicaid long-term supports and Medicaid community-based services 
gives them that opportunity by enabling them to maintain gainful 
employment and stay in their homes and in their communities. Sadly, 
across our country, thousands of people with Down syndrome are on very 
long waiting lists for those services.
  As lawmakers, we have an obligation to find a bipartisan way to 
protect and expand Medicaid services so all individuals with DS and 
other debilitating diseases have access to the lifelong interventions 
and support they need.
  The time has come for this country to embrace the gift and potential 
that Down syndrome brings to our society. The 300,000-plus Americans 
living with DS today want and deserve the same opportunities available 
to all of us: to live a full life and to reach their true potential.

consume.
  Mr. Speaker, the terrorist attack last night in New York City comes 
as a devastating reminder that the enemies of liberty will not cease.
  Eight people were killed and 11 more were injured in what law 
enforcement officials are now calling New York's deadliest terror 
attack since 9/11.
  The perpetrator of this attack was radicalized domestically by ISIS, 
highlighting the grave threat posed by this terrorist propaganda.
  Mr. Speaker, the terrorist last night was an immigrant from 
Uzbekistan, but we know that even within our midst, there are Americans 
who sympathize with those who seek to destroy our freedom.


  As many as 250 American citizens have sought to travel to Syria, and 
more than 100 have joined ISIS' ranks. Many of these individuals have 
received terrorist training while overseas. Some are under the command 
and control of terrorist leaders who have instructed them to attack the 
United States whenever. Others are inspired by the perverted ideology 
of hate that the terrorists post on social media sites. Many of these 
are American social media sites.
  These American citizens are a direct threat to our homeland. 
Unfortunately, our current safeguards are insufficient to protect us 
against such vulnerability.
  In 2014, a 22-year-old Florida native became the first American to 
carry out a suicide bombing in Syria. He had battled hard and been 
trained by al-Qaida's Syrian affiliate for some time. This same 
American was waved through U.S. border inspections when he traveled 
home to Florida a year earlier.
  After spending some time in Florida, the man made his way back to 
Syria to kill in the name of al-Qaida. When he ultimately blew himself 
up in May of 2014, al-Qaida released a video of his last will and 
testament. He said: ``You think you are safe where you are in America. 
You are not safe.''
  Mr. Speaker, today we are at a dangerous crossroad. As ISIS loses 
more territory in its so-called caliphate and it collapses, the threat 
to our homeland will really grow. Americans who have been fighting with 
ISIS will be looking for ways to come home to stage deadly attacks.
  In recent weeks, a man from Alexandria, Virginia, was convicted on 
terrorism charges for joining ISIS. He was sentenced to 20 years in the 
penitentiary. This terrorist traitor to our Nation named four other 
Westerners who had joined ISIS and who left Syria with intentions to do 
harm in their home countries.
  Law enforcement officials and terrorism experts have been warning of 
this foreign fighter threat for years. This is a serious threat, and we 
must address it before it becomes worse.
  Having betrayed our Nation, we must revoke the privileges that come 
with an American passport. That is why my colleague, the gentleman from 
Massachusetts (Mr. Keating), and I introduced H.R. 425, the Foreign 
Terrorist Organization Passport Revocation Act. It authorizes the 
Secretary of State to revoke passports of those who have joined foreign 
terrorist organizations.
  I might add, Mr. Speaker, this is a legal term, what a foreign 
terrorist organization is. It is only those organizations.
  These individuals are U.S. citizens, but they betray our country. 
They should clearly not be allowed the privilege of international 
travel with an American passport, and they should definitely not be 
able to come back into the United States when they travel overseas, 
such as in Syria. This bipartisan bill will also stop these Benedict 
Arnolds from using their passports to travel to other war zones or 
cross borders to attack any of our allies.
  Mr. Speaker, there is absolutely nothing in current regulations 
specifically to support foreign terrorist organizations. The Secretary 
of State does not have the authority to revoke passports on a broad 
national security basis.
  It is time our laws change and catch up with the modern world and the 
new and real threats to our Nation. Let me be clear, Mr. Speaker. This 
bill would not strip American of their citizenship. It would deny those 
Americans who have sided with foreign terrorist organizations the 
privilege of travel internationally.
  The bill also would not impinge on any American's due process rights 
if they want to appeal the revocation of their passport. Anyone whose 
passport is revoked or denied is eligible for a due process hearing 
within 60 days. The bill would actually increase oversight on this 
process by requiring the State Department to report directly to 
Congress whenever the Secretary moves to revoke or deny an American's 
passport on these grounds.
  Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my colleague from Massachusetts (Mr. 
Keating) for working with me on this bill. We both sit on the Committee 
on Foreign Affairs' Subcommittee on Terrorism, Nonproliferation, and 
Trade as the chair and ranking member. We have both been working on 
this issue of foreign fighter threats for some time, and we believe 
this is a good first step to protect our homeland.
  I also want to thank Chairman Royce for his help in getting this 
important bill passed in the committee, and also Ranking Member Engel 
from New York, where this unfortunate tragic event occurred last night.
  Mr. Speaker, the point is this: the traitors among us who have chosen 
to


make their allegiance to a murderous ideology instead of the country 
that gave them life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness must face 
the consequences. If you take up arms with our enemies, you deserve to 
be treated like one.
  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time."|4
CREC-2017-11-01-pt1-PgH8363-5|Mr. ENGEL|E000179|CREC-2017-11-01-pt1-PgH8363|"  Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume, 
and I rise in strong support of this measure.
  Mr. Speaker, as a New Yorker, my heart aches today. The appalling 
loss of life on the streets of Manhattan yesterday is a reminder that 
terrorism remains a threat that demands our focus.
  Confronting violent extremism requires sound, reasoned policies; 
policies proportional to the threat, policies based on good 
intelligence, careful analysis, and a clear understanding of what we 
are up against, not policies based on hysterical reactions or biases 
against certain faiths or nationalities.
  I support this bill because it will ensure that the State Department 
has the tools to prevent American terrorists from traveling abroad or 
returning to our country.
  Under this legislation, the Secretary of State could refuse to issue 
a passport or revoke a passport for any American who has provided 
assistance to foreign terrorist organizations. Importantly, it also 
affords anyone affected the right to an appeals process, helping to 
ensure due process rights.
  This bill is just common sense. It is also a vital aspect of the 
fight against terrorism. We don't want known threats crossing our 
borders or slipping from country to country anywhere in the world.
  The bill we are considering today would not have, obviously, 
prevented yesterday's attack, but this is important. This is just a 
piece of a larger strategy.
  The President yesterday called our judicial system, which would 
prosecute the perpetrator of yesterday's attack, a joke and a laughing 
stock. I beg to disagree. That is our judicial system, which 
successfully prosecuted shoe bomber Richard Reid; Ramzi Yousef, the 
1993 World Trade Center bomber; Faisal Shahzad, the Times Square 
bomber; and Sulaiman Abu Ghaith, Osama Bin Laden's son-in-law, in March 
of 2014.
  Mr. Speaker, the judicial branch has done quite a good job in 
prosecuting terrorists. Let's show them a little confidence and give 
credit where credit is due.
  This is deadly serious. The man suspected in yesterday's attack was 
reportedly radicalized after he arrived in the United States. We have 
seen this before in San Bernardino and Orlando. ISIS inspires its 
adherents from thousands of miles away. That is a problem. And just as 
this bill gets at a narrow, specific potential vulnerability, policies 
to deal with homegrown extremists and terrorists should take a hard 
look at causes and take appropriate action to prevent this sort of 
radicalization on American shores.
  We won't solve this problem by slamming shut America's front door and 
clamping down on immigration. In fact, doing so just contributes to the 
terrorist's ideological ammunition and recruitment efforts. There are 
proven ways to combat terrorism, but demonizing a religion or chipping 
away at constitutional rights won't work. Those approaches play right 
into the tactics terrorists use to radicalize vulnerable Americans, 
making us less safe and less free.
  I want to thank Representatives Poe and Keating, who lead our 
Committee on Foreign Affairs' Subcommittee on Terrorism, 
Nonproliferation, and Trade. Mr. Speaker, this bipartisan bill gets to 
the real concern in the fight against terrorism. I am pleased to 
support it.
  With all due respect to Mr. Poe, that is just the way it is.
  Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Massachusetts 
(Mr. Keating), the ranking member of the Terrorism, Nonproliferation, 
and Trade Subcommittee."|5
CREC-2017-11-01-pt1-PgH8363-6|Mr. KEATING|K000375|CREC-2017-11-01-pt1-PgH8363|"  Mr. KEATING. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding time to 
me.
  Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 425, the Foreign 
Terrorist Organization Passport Revocation Act.
  Mr. Speaker, I can't speak to the subject of terrorism without 
condemning the senseless and heinous attack that took place yesterday 
in New York City. My prayers are with all the individuals and families 
that were affected. My utmost respect goes to the New York City 
community that, once again, stands strong, stands together, 
unintimidated.
  Mr. Speaker, I introduced this important piece of legislation, H.R. 
425, together with Chairman Poe of the Foreign Affairs' Subcommittee on 
Terrorism, Nonproliferation, and Trade.
  As we have discussed, this legislation works to strengthen the tools 
we have at our disposal for combating terrorism. Put simply, the 
Secretary of State can refuse to issue or revoke the passport to any 
individual the Secretary determines is affiliated with or has aided, 
assisted, or abetted a designated foreign terrorist organization.
  The terrorist treats that we face today are complex. Our Federal, 
State, and local agencies are fighting terrorism at a time when ISIS 
and other terrorist organizations are able to use new technologies and 
means of communication to connect with individuals around the globe to 
fund, to direct, and inspire acts of terror.
  Modes of international travel are more accessible and affordable than 
ever, and cross-border flows of people and goods have increased as we 
have become more connected in the global world. While these are very 
positive developments for exchange, competitiveness, and quality of 
life, we also have to be sure we are managing the risks that go along 
with this increased connectivity.
  We have to make it harder for anyone supporting terrorism to benefit 
from the increased ease of global movement. That is why our legislation 
is important. We must ensure that the Secretary of State has the clear 
authority to refuse a passport to anyone affiliated with or supporting 
a designated foreign terrorist organization.
  This legislation provides that specific statutory authority, as well 
as improved congressional oversight, are in place. It is also important 
that there are safeguards in place in order for any law to be 
successful. That is why I am pleased that H.R. 425 also includes a 
right of review for anyone whose passport has been refused or revoked.
  It is absolutely possible to fight terrorism while still upholding 
protections for individuals' rights and the rule of law, and it is 
critical that we do both. In fighting to protect our communities and 
our democracy, we cannot compromise these very things we are fighting 
to protect.
  Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank Chairman Poe for joining me in 
introducing H.R. 425, the Foreign Terrorist Organization Passport 
Revocation Act. I would like to also thank Chairman Royce and Ranking 
Member Engel for their support with this bill as well within the 
Foreign Affairs Committee.
  Mr. Speaker, in closing, I urge that all of our colleagues join 
together in support of this important legislation."|6

out of innovation, out of careful analysis, not out of fear.
  We all feel the sting today of an attack on American soil yesterday.

here in Washington, D.C., and it sure shocks a lot of folks back home. 
But most of the


things that come before the House floor have been bipartisan pieces of 
legislation.
  We spend a lot of time on legislation and almost always come to the 
House floor with unanimous votes, or mostly unanimous votes, on the 
committee level. We work very well on these issues because these are 
not partisan issues; these are American issues that we are talking 
about.
  Mr. Speaker, there are about 61 designated foreign terrorist 
organizations that our State Department has said are foreign terrorist 
organizations and, to prevent individuals in America who side with 
these organizations, who support these organizations, who are part of 
these organizations from traveling around the world and coming back 
home, based upon their activities, this legislation by Mr. Keating is 
introduced. Keep them from traveling, because we know who those people 
are, and keep them, especially, from coming back to the United States.
  So what would happen if a passport is revoked and some American is in 
Syria and is radicalized and he tries to get on a plane? Well, he is 
not allowed to get on the plane. He is stopped, and then he is turned 
over, eventually, to Department of Homeland Security and our Justice 
Department and handled that way.
  Now, there are only a few places under our law where a person's 
passport can be revoked. Not paying your child support, drug 
trafficking, sex tourism--those are three of the examples. So we are 
not talking about a lot of examples, but we are talking about this 
example.
  I am a former judge, and I know Mr. Keating is a former prosecutor. 
Due process for Americans is always important. The Supreme Court has 
already ruled on whether or not passports can be revoked under certain 
circumstances, and they have affirmed the authority of the State 
Department to revoke passports in specific cases based upon national 
security reasons.
  This bill allows for due process of those people who have their 
passports revoked. This is a good step in protecting the United States. 
This is bipartisan legislation. I think it is very important that we 
take this step.
  Once again, my prayers, our prayers, are for those folks in New York. 
But, Mr. Speaker, we are not going to allow terrorists to have their 
day. We are not going to allow them to have their way.
  And that is just the way it is.
  I yield back the balance of my time."|8
CREC-2017-11-01-pt1-PgH8363-9|Mr. SMITH of New Jersey|S000522|CREC-2017-11-01-pt1-PgH8363|"  Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 425--
the FTO Passport Revocation Act of 2017--by my friend and colleague 
Chairman Ted Poe. I cannot help but see this measure as a common sense 
tactic to prevent terrorists from entering or re-entering our country. 
However, more needs to be done to build on this useful foundation for 
security from terrorists originating in this country or foreign-based 
terrorists.
  Just yesterday, the streets of New York were the scene of carnage 
caused by a man from Uzbekistan who won a diversity visa lottery to 
enter this country in 2010. He has lived here for seven years before 
going on the murderous rampage that killed 8 people and injured 12 
others. Clearly, we need to look closer at the background of those 
admitted through this lottery as they could eventually obtain a U.S. 
passport. That was the conclusion by the Government Accountability 
Office ten years ago--three years before New York terror suspect 
arrived in this country.
  The GAO report in 2007 called the diversity visa program ``an open 
door'' for terrorists. According to the report 9,800 people from 
countries designated by the State Department as State Sponsors of 
Terrorism had used the program to enter the country. These people could 
eventually qualify for a U.S. passport.
  We also must be more vigilant about people coming from countries not 
designated as State Sponsors of Terrorism. The 9/11 Commission reported 
back in 2004 that as many as six of the hijackers of the three planes--
who were from Saudi Arabia, Egypt, United Arab Emirates and Lebanon--
had used fraudulent or manipulated passports to enter the United 
States. In 2013, a Saudi citizen entering the United States through the 
Detroit airport was detained because he couldn't satisfactorily explain 
why he was carrying a pressure cooker like the one used in the Boston 
marathon bombing. However, upon inspection, his passport suspiciously 
had a missing page. Would that have been caught without the presence of 
the pressure cooker? We are told that even the slightest tweak to a 
passport will be caught, but one failure could result in a terrorist 
entering our country, and they could eventually become terrorist 
sleepers who acquire a U.S. passport.
  Finally, in order for the FTO designation to be effectively used to 
stop terrorists from getting passports or having their passport 
revoked, our government must make that designation in the first place. 
I tried for two years to get the previous administration to designate 
Boko Haram as a terrorist organization. They finally did so in 2013, 
but how many potential terrorists may have gotten through before then 
and acquire sufficient status to receive a U.S. passport? We also need 
to use the FTO designation to identify those giving support to 
terrorist organizations, especially in cases of such support coming 
from those living in the United States who could be or potentially 
could be U.S. passport holders.
  As I said earlier, I consider H.R. 425 a common sense measure on 
which to build, but we must take steps to make this bill as meaningful 
as it must be for our security. I ask my colleagues to approve this 
legislation."|9

Government of Ethiopia's continued pattern of repression and violence 
against its own people, and I urge the House of Representatives to vote 
on H. Res. 128, the Supporting Respect for Human Rights and Encouraging 
Inclusive Governance in Ethiopia resolution.
  This resolution calls on the Government of Ethiopia to take clear, 
decisive steps towards becoming more inclusive, more democratic, and 
more respectful of the basic human rights of its own people.
  This resolution has overwhelming bipartisan support, with more than 
70 cosponsors, and it passed out of the House Foreign Affairs Committee 
unanimously on July 27.
  The ongoing human rights crisis in Ethiopia is extremely troubling to 
me, to the resolution's other cosponsors, the many Americans of 
Ethiopian heritage, and too numerous to list human rights groups. I 
firmly believe that the passage of this resolution will encourage the 
Ethiopian Government to end its practice of violence and repression and 
provide a strong basis for an inclusive government.
  Specifically, this resolution condemns the excessive use of force by 
Ethiopian security forces and the killing of peaceful protestors; the 
arrests and detention of journalists, students, activists, and 
political leaders; and the Ethiopian Government's abuse of the anti-
terrorism proclamation to stifle political and civil dissent.
  The resolution does not simply highlight the Ethiopian Government's 
increasingly authoritarian acts, but it also encourages the United 
States to support efforts to improve democracy and governance in 
Ethiopia.
  I believe that the United States can take actions that will 
positively influence the Ethiopian Government and use our existing 
institutions to further democracy and effective governance in Ethiopia.
  Critically, the resolution calls on the Ethiopian Government to admit 
U.N. human rights observers so they can conduct an independent and 
thorough examination of the current state of human rights in Ethiopia.
  On March 9 of this year, the House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on 
Africa, Global Health, Global Human Rights, and International 
Organizations held a hearing to discuss specific steps the United 
States can take to bring about positive changes for the Ethiopian 
Government and their people.
  Among those who testified was Deacon Yoseph Tafari of the St. Mary's 
Ethiopian Orthodox Church located in Aurora, Colorado. Deacon Yoseph 
was raised in Ethiopia and has experienced the daily struggles too many 
Ethiopians have faced living in abject poverty under an oppressive 
government.
  Deacon Yoseph fled from Ethiopia in 1976 and came to the United 
States as a refugee. He and many of the members of the Ethiopian 
community in my congressional district of Colorado, including the Oromo 
and Amharas, have worked diligently to organize and assist those still 
suffering from repression in their home country.
  Oromo community president of Colorado, Jamal Said, has also shared 
his concerns with me, and both of these gentlemen have no motives other 
than a concern about the safety and state of democracy in Ethiopia. I 
appreciate their leadership in the community as they continue to fight 
for democracy in their homeland.
  Unfortunately, stories like this are not uncommon in my district, and 
I am disappointed that the House has not yet scheduled a floor vote on 
H. Res. 128. I note that on two prior occasions a vote was tentatively 
scheduled. In both of these instances, it is my understanding that the 
vote was postponed due to pressure from the Ethiopian Government, which 
continues to make promises to curb human rights abuses against their 
own people, but fail to deliver.
  Additionally, it has been brought to my attention that the Ethiopian 
Government has threatened to cut off security cooperation with United 
States should we proceed with H. Res. 128.
  I am particularly dismayed that rather than solving their problems 
and moving towards becoming a more democratic country, the Ethiopian 
Government has chosen instead to hire a D.C. lobbying firm at a cost of 
$150,000 a month to ``work with the Ethiopian Government to develop and 
execute a public affairs plan to enhance the dialogue and relationships 
with policymakers, media, opinion leaders, and business leaders,'' in 
addition to ``meetings with Members of Congress, their staffs, and 
executive branch officials.''
  The issue the Ethiopian Government needs to address is the repression 
of democracy and its citizens in Ethiopia. The solution to whatever 
negative perception it has in the Halls of the U.S. Congress is not a 
public affairs one, but, rather, what concrete steps are being taken 
against democracy in Ethiopia.
  That is why I remain committed to working with House leadership to 
have a vote scheduled on H. Res. 128.
  Mr. Speaker, I encourage leadership to schedule a vote, and I call on 
my colleagues to vote in favor of and pass H. Res. 128. I will continue 
working with local Ethiopian community leaders in Colorado and across 
the country to raise awareness of the human rights abuses occurring in 
Ethiopia and to bring relief from oppression to the Ethiopian people.

  John and Andy have been climbing and hiking for over 10 years. When 
they decided to tackle the largest mountain in the world over a year 
ago, they began their training between heavy work schedules, preparing 
their bodies and minds for the physical and mental challenges such a 
climb presents. On the afternoon of May 21, all of their preparation 
paid off when they announced on their Facebook page that they had 
reached an elevation of 29,052 feet, the summit of Mt. Everest. 
Alongside the goal of just conquering the tallest mountain in the 
world, the cousins also used the opportunity to help raise awareness 
for veterans with PTSD. They plan to use the network they built in 
promoting this climb to help veterans and their families learn to use 
outdoor activities to help manage stress.

give voice to the elderly, the children, the disabled, the most 
vulnerable who are once again facing your proposal, Mr. Speaker, to rip 
healthcare and the safety net from them.
  Is this the best you can do, Mr. Speaker, to once again, over and 
over again, propose this legislation to cut trillions of dollars from 
Medicaid and Medicare to fund tax cuts for corporations and for 
billionaires, and to do this, to slam this through the House without 
transparency?
  Mr. Speaker, Republicans like to call me a ``tax and spend liberal,'' 
but today we see this GOP fiscal plan as another ``borrow and spend to 
pay for billionaires tax cuts.''
  Now, the Wharton School and the Goldman Sachs studies both show that, 
at best, this plan would produce a paltry one-tenth, maybe two-tenths 
of 1 percent growth, but we all know that it will increase the national 
debt by trillions of dollars.
  This is a horrible investment, a horrible return, a negative return 
on investment. It is a terrible process. This is terrible legislation. 
It will produce terrible results for the overwhelming majority of 
Americans, especially the millions who rely on Medicaid and Medicare.
  Now, here is the deal, Mr. Speaker, that you are trying to push: if 
Americans are willing to give billionaires


windfall tax cuts today and also trade their health security and safety 
net, then you, Mr. Speaker, will give average Americans the empty 
promise of wage growth tomorrow and you will be able to file your taxes 
on a postcard.
  I say ``empty promises'' because studies and our experience have 
shown that this unicorn of wage growth from tax cuts will never, in 
fact, happen. It is reminiscent, Mr. Speaker, of the gluttonous Wimpy 
in the ``Popeye'' cartoon: ``I will gladly pay you Tuesday for a 
hamburger today.''
  Now, this is a great plan if you are rich. It is dollars for fool's 
gold, but the American people are not fools, Mr. Speaker, and that is 
why the Republicans want to rush this through with minimum 
transparency.
  This is madness. Trickle down has not worked, it does not work, and 
it will never work. We have got deficits under Reagan and under George 
W. Bush to prove it.
  The tax cuts will not pay for themselves, Mr. Speaker. The tax cuts 
won't magically produce increased salaries for workers. The tax plan 
will not lead to these claims of economic growth.
  Mr. Speaker, we have all lived long enough to know that these are all 
lies. It is not even wishful thinking anymore, because we know better.
  Congress should not be considering tax cuts for the rich and opening 
up even more tax loopholes. Mr. Speaker, we cannot spin gold out of 
straw, and that is what we have here.
  This plan will make most Americans poorer and sicker, if not dead. I 
urge all my colleagues to reject this bill.
  Instead, Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to fortify our election 
system from Russian further interference; build new infrastructure, 
that is what creates jobs; fund the Child Health Insurance Program that 
Republicans let expire; ensure that all 3\1/2\ million American 
citizens in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands can have access to 
water, power, and healthcare this holiday season. That is what we 
should be doing.

support of H.R. 2936, the Resilient Federal Forests Act of 2017, that 
was introduced by Congressman Westerman.
  The House will consider this bill today, which will improve forest 
management and cut the bureaucratic red tape that has been preventing 
sound management practices for the Forest Service.
  Mr. Speaker, devastating wildfires have resulted in the loss of 
property, loss of pristine landscapes, and, most importantly, the loss 
of life. 2017 has been the costliest wildfire season on record, with 
the Forest Service spending over $2 billion. While not the only issue, 
the greatest cause for this increase in wildfire is a severe lack of 
forest management.
  This bill provides Federal land management agencies the immediate 
tools to expedite and increase the scale and efficiency of forest 
management projects without sacrificing environmental protections.
  Mr. Speaker, we must do everything in our power to stop these 
catastrophic wildfires and encourage better land management of our 
forests.
  Today's bill is one step in the right direction and I encourage my 
colleagues to support this important legislation.

the ability to feed and clothe our own people and fuel this American 
economy, we need a strong and sustainable rural America like the 
district I represent in west Texas.
  What would this country be without the hardworking energy and 
agriculture producers in small towns across this great land? The heart 
of small-town sustainability is access to healthcare. There are over 
5,000 hospitals in the United States, and roughly half of them are in 
rural America, serving one out of every five Americans. Without access 
to basic medical services, communities in America's breadbasket and 
energy basin would not survive.
  Hospitals serving rural communities face unique challenges: an aging 
population, low patient volume, higher percentages of Medicare 
beneficiaries, to name a few. Each translates into a higher per-patient 
cost which has left 41 percent of rural hospitals operating at a loss.
  On top of this problematic patient volume and patient mix, ObamaCare 
has heaped a backbreaking $54 billion in additional regulatory burden 
in unfunded mandates. Since 2010, the year ObamaCare was enacted, 80 
rural hospitals have shut down, 11 of which were in my home State of 
Texas. If this rate continues, in less than 10 years, an unimaginable 
25 percent of our Nation's rural hospitals will close. That would 
cripple rural communities across this country and deliver a devastating 
blow to our agriculture and energy economy, affecting all Americans, 
including our neighbors in urban and suburban America.
  For some Texans, the nearest hospital is already 100 miles away. In 
an emergency, this distance can mean the difference between life and 
death. Point of fact: 60 percent of all trauma deaths occur in rural 
America, despite the fact that rural America only makes up 20 percent 
of the country's population.
  Here is a startling fact and outright scary scenario: one-third of 
rural hospitals have been deemed vulnerable to closure. If all 673 of 
those hospitals were to close down, it could result in over 130,000 
jobs lost and almost $300 billion in GDP lost. When unemployment goes 
down and wages go down in those small towns, folks move away in search 
of better opportunities.
  In order to sustain the critical lifeline hospitals provide for our 
rural communities, I have introduced H.R. 4178, the Healthcare 
Enhancement for America's Rural Towns Act, or the HEART Act. Why? 
Because small towns are the heartbeat of America; the heart of our 
food, fuel, and fiber production; the heart of traditional American 
values. This legislation extends two programs vital to the 
sustainability of rural hospitals and the community they deserve: the 
Low-Volume Adjustment program and the Medicare-Dependent Hospital 
program. These programs account for less than one-tenth of 1 percent of 
all Medicare expenditures, but they go a long way to ensuring that 
rural community hospitals with a higher percentage of Medicare patients 
have adequate funding to serve the unique populations.
  By extending the Medicare Low-Volume Adjustment program for 2 years, 
and for the first time permanently extending the Medicare-Dependent 
Hospital program, we can provide the assurance and continuity that our 
rural hospitals desperately need in order to serve our communities in 
the future. Just as importantly, we do this in a way that is budget 
neutral and without spending any additional taxpayer moneys.
  Let's pass this legislation. Let's protect the heart of rural America 
and give our community hospitals the certainty that they need to keep 
our people and our communities healthy.

  Under the leadership of Ms. Malene Davis, West Virginia Caring's

compassionate and dignified care during one's end of life, we must

for his dedication to our country while serving 25 years in the Army. 
LTC Truitt exemplifies what it means to commit his life to his country 
and has more than earned our admiration and respect. He is a deserving 
recipient of a Congressional Veteran Commendation.
  Upon his commissioning as a Second Lieutenant from Sam Houston State 
University in 1979, LTC Truitt began his military career as an Infantry 
Officer with the Texas National Guard and then entered the United 
States Army. As Lieutenant, he conducted more combat patrols inside the 
Korean demilitarized zone than any other officer in the 2nd Infantry 
Division, and as Major, he served in a variety of 5th Special Forces 
Group assignments. Just prior to being promoted to Lieutenant Colonel, 
he was diagnosed with terminal colon cancer, which he successfully 
overcame in the next year. LTC Truitt used that time to revive the 
Columbus State University ROTC Program as a professor in Military 
Science.
  This brave soldier is also a committed citizen. Following his 
military career, he continued to support the military in the Central 
Texas Special Forces Association. As President, he is responsible for 
an annual raffle that raises thousands of dollars annually to support 
homeless veterans' programs and local non-profit organizations to meet 
immediate community needs. His work to make his community a great place 
to live and work have made lasting and positive impacts on the region.
  I commend LTC Truitt's selfless service to his community and nation. 
His dedication to our country and community reflects the best values of 
central Texas. I join his family and friends in saluting his great work

  Mr. Speaker, small businesses, entrepreneurs, and emerging companies 
are what drive the American economy. We meet them in our districts and 
see firsthand the benefits that their dreams, their innovations, and 
their hard work provide to our constituents and to our communities.
  These innovators, entrepreneurs, and risk takers are critical to our 
country's economic growth and prosperity. In fact, small businesses are 
responsible for more than 60 percent of the Nation's net new jobs over 
the past two decades. Sixty percent of all of the new jobs over the 
past two decades come from these small emerging companies.
  Their ability to raise capital in the private markets is critical to 
the economic well-being of the United States.
  So if our Nation is going to have an economy that provides 
opportunities for every American, then we must promote and encourage 
the success and growth of our small businesses and our startups. It is 
this notion that brings us to this legislation that we are discussing 
today.
  Under current law, accredited investors are allowed to purchase 
securities that haven't been registered with the Securities and 
Exchange Commission. These types of offerings carry more risks than 
public offerings. The thought is that individuals with enough financial 
sophistication or net worth can bear the potential losses that may be 
associated with these types of securities.
  How the law works today is that this definition of an accredited 
investor is solely based on wealth.
  The ability to participate in a private offering should not be 
limited to individuals that pass some type of Federal Government assets 
test. Instead, the ability to participate should be expanded to include 
all individuals who demonstrate that they have sufficient understanding 
of the offering. That may be a doctor who has gone through the training 
and has an idea that a new piece of equipment might work for them; or a 
scientist who has done research in the lab who says: You know what, 
this makes sense to me, and they understand the risk that they are 
entering into.
  Well, H.R. 1585, the Fair Investment Opportunities for Professional 
Experts Act, introduced by Representative Schweikert and Representative 
Hill, will expand the definition of an accredited investor in a way 
that will appropriately increase the pool of potential investors, 
thereby providing additional investment opportunities for more 
Americans and enabling the businesses they invest in to create more 
jobs.
  The expansion of the accredited investor definition will enhance the 
ability of many companies, particularly small and emerging companies 
and businesses, to raise capital and grow by increasing the pool of 
potential investors. These are investors, again, that are very 
knowledgeable about that particular area.
  This will both provide greater investment opportunities for more 
Americans and will enable these businesses to begin investing to create 
more jobs.
  H.R. 1585 is a bipartisan bill that will help create jobs and a 
healthier economy. The bill provides Americans with more investment 
opportunities and enhances small companies' ability to raise capital.
  This legislation overwhelmingly passed the Financial Services 
Committee by a bipartisan vote of 58-2, and I urge all of my colleagues 
to vote ``yes'' on this particular bill today.
  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time."|4
CREC-2017-11-01-pt1-PgH8320-5|Mr. FOSTER|F000454|CREC-2017-11-01-pt1-PgH8320|"  Mr. FOSTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1585. This bill will 
expand the definition of accredited investor, a status reserved for 
investors who possess the sophistication and financial means necessary 
to invest in private securities offerings.
  Currently, accredited investors are limited to persons who have an 
annual income more than $200,000, or $300,000 together with a spouse, 
or a net worth in excess of $1 million, excluding a primary residence.
  Aside from the primary residence exclusion added by the Dodd-Frank 
Act, the accredited investor definition has not been updated since 
1982.
  In light of the growth of private markets and increasing complexity, 
the SEC's Investor Advisory Committee recommended that the SEC conduct 
additional study of adjusting the current thresholds for inflation and 
establishing alternatives based on existing credentials, investment 
experience, and limits of investments.
  An updated definition is long overdue. Current law speaks almost 
exclusively to the ability to bear a loss rather than the 
sophistication of the investor.
  The bill we consider today is the product of bipartisan compromise. 
Last Congress, it was significantly narrowed to include only persons 
who qualify based on current income and net worth tests: registered 
brokers, and investment advisers, and those who have the appropriate 
educational background and job experience as determined by the SEC and 
verified by FINRA.
  These categories are in line with the recommendations of the Investor 
Advisory Committee and effective proxies for sophistication, access to 
information, and ability to withstand losses.
  There is an inherent tension between democratizing markets and 
protecting investors on the basis of their ability to bear financial 
losses.

  This bill includes Ranking Member Waters' bipartisan amendment to 
require the SEC to adjust net worth and income thresholds for inflation 
every 5 years. This will establish the economic value of the thresholds 
in current law, as the dollar amounts are increased, with growth in the 
overall economy and changes in the value of the dollar.
  Doing so will preserve access to private markets for those currently 
investing in them. Private offerings can offer some of the best returns 
in the market, but they obviously carry different risks, like 
illiquidity, than securities in the public markets.
  While there can be investment opportunities that significantly 
increase a person's net worth, they cannot be immediately sold if an 
investor's financial circumstances change.
  So this bill strikes a good compromise between giving access to 
investments without exposing the retirement accounts of working 
families to excessive risks.


  Mr. Speaker, I urge broad support for the bill today, and I reserve 
the balance of my time."|5

me time.
  A little bit of history: this piece of legislation, the underlying 
idea, actually was fostered a few years ago. One of my closest friends 
in Arizona, Lakshmi, is freaky smart, electrical engineer, off the 
charts IQ. He and I were having a conversation about a company that he 
was really interested in that had been started by a handful of his old 
friends.
  Well, it turns out his old friends had gone through all this process, 
and he had just sort of been watching what they were doing.
  Now, Lakshmi is an absolute expert on the technology that these 
gentlemen are putting together, but because of a series of timing and 
other things, he was walled off from investing in a company that was 
using a technology he was an absolute expert in, because he didn't meet 
the accredited investor standards. He didn't have the million dollars 
in the bank.
  His argument to me was, should his knowledge on a company and its 
product, their risk profile, its opportunity to succeed and its 
potential failure in the marketplace be based on his bank account, or 
should it be based on his knowledge?
  Now, the legislation has gone through a couple generations of 
compromise. I personally preferred the original bill, a bit more 
expansive, but this is a good thing, because for our brothers and 
sisters on both sides of the aisle here, I think we are embracing this 
concept that we all care about the curve where we are seeing the 
wealthy getting wealthier in the United States and much of our 
hardworking middle holding sort of flat.
  This is one of the reasons: we have created these definitions where 
accredited investors, I think only, like, 600-some-thousand people, 
have gone through the process to hold that designation in our society, 
meaning it is a tiny sliver of our society that is allowed to invest in 
these types of businesses.
  We have a bureaucracy that for how many years now the regulator has 
said: Your ability to invest in these types of organizations is based 
on your bank account.
  Today, we take the sort of first step on a bipartisan basis to say: 
Yes, bank account is one, but how about your risk tolerance, your 
knowledge, your expertise, and your understanding that many of these 
fail, and many of these businesses become amazing successes, but are 
you able to process both the technology, the risk, and the information?
  For many of us, we are hoping that the opportunity to be part of the 
investor class starts to become much more egalitarian across our 
society instead of just being the hallmark of the ultrawealthy in our 
country.
  Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Huizenga for giving me a moment and for 
moving this bill forward."|7

Fair Investment Opportunities for Professional Experts Act. This is a 
bipartisan bill. It expands economic opportunities for many, many 
Americans because, to date, only an individual's wealth has been taken 
into consideration when defining whether he meets the qualifications or 
she meets the qualifications of an accredited investor under our 
securities laws. The simple fix proposed by this bill will empower 
those with financial expertise and those with experience to join the 
ranks of those who can invest in private, high-growth companies.
  It was explained very eloquently here by the bill's author, and I 
think that this commonplace change is going to broaden the pool of 
startup capital. That is going to help companies looking to grow, 
companies looking to add jobs.
  At the same time, it provides an investment opportunity, one with 
greater upside and more risk, to those previously locked out of the 
private placement market. This includes many educated young Americans 
who have not yet had time to grow their pocketbooks but do have the 
expertise in these areas.
  Mr. Speaker, in closing, I have seen firsthand that the 
entrepreneurial spirit is certainly alive and well in California and 
all across this country, and this bill before us today ensures that 
more Americans can participate in both the risk and reward of the 
startup economy.

of us came to Congress to do: solve problems and change laws.
  The current law excludes most of America from participating in one of 
the most dynamic parts of our economy, which is private placement 
investment into small startup companies or, sometimes, very big 
companies but they are not yet publicly traded. There are opportunities 
all over to do this, but there are only a small number of Americans who 
can make the investment.
  For many smaller companies, they are faced with a dilemma. One option 
is no option. They may not have the network of prospective high net 
worth, accredited investors who can take a look at the kind of capital 
that would help that company become a thriving larger company, that 
would help grow the companies that drive the growth in our economy.
  As investors, there are people who work in the investment industry 
who are doing the underwriting--charter financial analysts, for 
example. Whether they are working for a private equity group, they are 
doing the work but don't yet have the high net worth. They have true 
domain expertise.
  Imagine the skilled labor who is actually doing the technology 
implementation, who knows exactly everything that it would take in a 
program to make a program be the winner in the marketplace but is also 
well informed on the rest of the risks, has been well educated on the 
market, and he is prevented from participating.
  This act is a step in the right direction. I hope we can accomplish 
more together. I am confident we will see great success if we can pass 
this and build on it by taking a bigger bite at the apple soon.
  Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my colleagues Mr. Schweikert for

all job growth over the past two decades has come from small and 
emerging companies. This bill today recognizes that and encourages more 
of that to happen. It allows knowledgeable but maybe not wealthy folks 
to invest in areas of their expertise. In an era of crowdfunding and 
fund-me pages and those types of capital raises and investing, this 
bill makes sense. As the gentleman from Ohio, my friend Mr. Davidson, 
pointed out, it came through the committee unanimously.

importantly, it is the first day of open enrollment for the Patient 
Protection and Affordable Care Act.
  This year, enrollment only runs from November 1, today, through 
December 15. This is half the length of last year when open enrollment 
extended until January 30. It is 6 weeks shorter, so to sign up, get 
started today. You only have 45 days to do it. This is something the 
Trump administration is doing to


make it more difficult and less likely people will sign up.
  Don't let them do this. Sign up for your healthcare. During this 
shortened enrollment period, there will also be 12-hour periods of 
scheduled maintenance when the website will be inaccessible. These 
periods will occur every Sunday morning, except one, during the open 
enrollment period. December 15 is the last chance for individuals to 
sign up for health insurance for 2018, unless you have a major event 
like getting married, having a child, or moving.
  In previous years, individuals were notified of autoenrollment with 
time to change their choice. This year, that happens on December 16, a 
day after open enrollment ends, so there is no reason to do it. It just 
tells you what you have got, and you don't have the opportunity to 
change. So individuals should not rely on autoenrollment. They should 
use healthcare.gov to find the best plan for them and their families.
  In many cases, there are affordable plans. In 2018, in Tennessee, 88 
percent can find a bronze plan for under $75.


  In Memphis, many consumers earning $30,000 to $48,000 a year can find 
silver plans for under $100. This is particularly true for those in 
their late forties to age 64.
  You may qualify for premiums and cost-sharing reductions like in past 
years. In 2016, 88 percent of Tennesseans on the exchanges received 
premium assistance, and 58 percent received cost-sharing reduction 
subsidies.
  This is still true even as the President attempts to sabotage the 
Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.
  Marketing funding and funds for navigators to help people through the 
process have both been slashed. In spite of that fact, we are going to 
try to find some navigators still around and have a townhall in Memphis 
possibly Saturday, November 11. We are still in the process of 
scheduling that, but we want all of our people to get that chance. So 
we encourage all Americans to get that chance.
  Cost-sharing reduction subsidies will be available for individuals 
who qualify for silver plans despite Trump's decision to stop the 
government from reimbursing insurers.
  The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act is the law of the 
land. All current efforts to repeal and replace have failed because 
they have not come up with a better plan. Healthcare is difficult, and 
we came up with a plan that needs some tweaking but not repealing.
  Memphis has recently seen a decrease in the disparity of breast 
cancer mortality rates between Black and White women, a clear 
indication that access to affordable care saves lives.
  Memphis has done excellent work at expanding access to screenings and 
coverage. In addition to local efforts, the Affordable Care Act has 
helped to reduce or even eliminate copayments that women have to pay 
for preventive screenings, including mammograms.
  Access to affordable healthcare has saved lives in Memphis and 
throughout this country. The open enrollment for the Affordable Care 
Act starts today and runs through December 15. Avail yourselves of 
those opportunities.

Robert Wittman, rise today to recognize the twenty-five years that 
Master Sergeant Paul Contreras has served in the United States Marine 
Corps. MSgt Contreras is a true patriot who has significantly 
contributed to the defense of our Nation. He enlisted in the Marine 
Corps in April, 1992 and was assigned to Recruit Training Center, San 
Diego, CA. He subsequently attended Marine Combat Training before being 
transferred to Marine Corps Logistics Base, Albany, GA where he trained 
as a Packaging Specialist. Lance Corporal Contreras' first assignment 
was to Supply Company, 1st Supply Battalion, 1st Service Support Group, 
Camp Pendleton, CA. Within his first month of this assignment, LCpl 
Contreras volunteered to deploy in support of OPERATION RESTORE HOPE in 
Mogadishu, Somalia. Upon completion of this deployment, he was selected 
to attend Marine Security Guard training, transferring to Marine 
Security Guard Battalion, Quantico, VA. Upon graduation from this 
rigorous course, LCpl Contreras' first assignment was to U.S. Embassy 
Abidjan, Ivory Coast. In July 1995 Cpl Contreras was transferred to 
U.S. Embassy Santiago, Chile for his second post.
  Upon departure from Chile, Sergeant Contreras served with 1st Supply 
Battalion until early 1998 when he began the process of applying for 
the Marine Corps' Counterintelligence/Human Intelligence (CI/HUMINT) 
occupational specialty. Staff Sergeant Contreras was competitively 
selected to train as a CI/HUMINT Marine, attending school from January 
to June, 1999. SSgt Contreras' first assignment was with 1st CI/HUMINT 
Company where he served until being selected to deploy with the 13th 
Marine Expeditionary Unit. During this deployment, SSgt Contreras 
participated in recovery efforts following the bombing of the USS Cole 
in Aden, Yemen. In 2000, SSgt Contreras returned to 1st CI/HUMINT 
Company where he served until June, 2001 before being reassigned to 2nd 
CI/HUMINT Company, Camp Lejeune, NC. During this assignment, SSgt 
Contreras supported various exercises including BATTLE GRIFFIN in 2002, 
and deployed in support of combat operations to Kabul, Afghanistan in 
2002 and Babil, Iraq in 2004.
  In 2006, Gunnery Sergeant Contreras completed his active service to 
pursue a civilian career but remained committed to the Marine Corps, 
joining the Select Marine Corps Reserve later that year. His first 
reserve assignment was with the Marine Forces Pacific G2X office. From 
2006 to 2008 Master Sergeant Contreras supported exercises and 
operational requirements for Marine Forces Pacific. During this same 
time, MSgt Contreras was a part owner of a small defense contracting 
company dedicated to the further development and training of Department 
of Defense CI/HUMINT professionals prior to their deployments into Iraq 
and Afghanistan. In the fall of 2008, Master Sergeant Contreras 
returned to the CI/HUMINT school to provide support to the training 
staff. His next assignment in March 2009 was with Marine Forces Command 
G2X office. Due to his excellent reputation, MSgt Contreras was 
requested by name to mobilize with Marine Forces Europe from November 
2011 until August 2013 where he served as Counterintelligence 
Operations Chief. He returned to the United States for assignment to 
Intelligence Support Battalion, Marine Forces Reserve in Quantico, VA. 
In his civilian career, MSgt Contreras also joined the Defense 
Intelligence Agency's Counterespionage Division. He remained on Marine 
Reserve duty with Bravo Company until November 2014, upon which time he 
transferred to Individual Ready Reserve Status intending to retire. 
Recognizing the immeasurable contribution that MSgt Contreras had made 
to the CI/HUMINT profession, the senior leadership of Intelligence 
Support Battalion compelled MSgt Contreras to consider withdrawing his 
retirement request in order to serve one final tour with the Battalion 
and in February 2016 MSgt Contreras returned to Bravo Company. He 
subsequently participated in a US Army exercise at Guantanamo Bay, 
Cuba, and served as both Company CI/HUMINT Chief and Senior Enlisted 
Advisor until his retirement in November of 2017. During this same 
time, MSgt Contreras was hired by the Marine Corps Intelligence 
Activity in the Office of the Counterintelligence Coordinating 
Authority where he is able to continue to support his beloved Corps by 
influencing the development and direction of counterintelligence 
activities for the Marine Corps into the future.
  Mr. Speaker, few can match the dedication and Esprit de Corps that 
Paul Contreras has displayed over his twenty-five years of service to 
Corps and country. We wish Paul continued success in his future 
endeavors. Many thanks to Master Sergeant Contreras. Our Nation has 
benefited from his outstanding leadership

represent the community of the San Fernando Valley here in the United 
States Congress. I think it is my duty and responsibility to make sure 
that when something is going on in Washington, people should know what 
is going to happen to them and how it affects them.
  I think it is really important for everybody to understand that right 
now in the workings--and it is probably going to come to this floor in 
just a few days--is the Speaker Ryan-McConnell tax giveaways to big 
corporations, which will actually increase taxes for working families, 
working mothers and fathers.
  I think it is important for people to understand that this is 
something that is being sold as a middle-income tax cut. Actually, what 
it is going to do is it is going to cut the take-home income to middle 
class families.
  What it is going to mean is if you are a police officer or a teacher 
or a waitress, you are going to see less money every week. It might be 
$5 less a week, it might be $50 less a week, it might be $100.
  Let me tell you, the opposite of what is going to happen should this 
become law is that the biggest corporations in America are going to see 
$1 million less in taxes a week, maybe $50 million less in taxes paid a 
week, maybe $100 million less per week paid in taxes.
  Some people are thinking: Well, they earned it. They should keep it.
  Well, okay. I understand what you are saying. But, see, this is the 
fundamental problem of this $1.5 trillion reduction in the ability for 
our Federal Government to fund things like Medicaid and Medicare. 
Because when we see less money, you are going to see Members on this 
floor and in committees throughout this House and in the United States 
Senate saying: Well, we don't have the money.
  When they see a mother whose child has cerebral palsy and she is 
saying, ``I go to work every single day, and thank you, government, for 
allowing my child to be in a program so that he or she can be safe 
while I go to work,'' they are going to say, ``You know what? I agree 
with you, ma'am. We should fund that, but since we don't have the money 
anymore, we are going to stop funding that.''
  This is a woman who just wants to work for a living. This is a person 
who just wants to make sure that she can have the dignity of work and 
have her child in a safe place, but we are going to cut those programs 
if we have this tax giveaway go through Congress and signed by this 
President.


  You see, it is a multistep process. And what some of my colleagues--
and


so far, the only ones voting for this tax giveaway are my Republican 
colleagues. I say that accurately, not to be partisan, but just to be 
honest and accurate. They say we have to do this; it is going to 
stimulate the economy.
  Well, also, in this package, this plan that they want to make into a 
law, basically what it will do, it will actually incentivize the 
biggest corporations in America, American corporations. It is going to 
incentivize them to go ahead and close up shop in your neighborhood and 
go set up shop somewhere else in the world.
  And the only connection they are going to have with you, ladies and 
gentlemen, is they are going to want to sell those products to you, 
built by other than American hands in other parts of the world. The 
only other connection they are going to have is this: They are going to 
be able to bring their money, their profits, back to the United States, 
pretty much free and clear, and just count their money here, where they 
call themselves an American corporation.
  I think it is important, ladies and gentlemen, that we recognize that 
this is something that is wrong. This is something that is going to 
hurt the middle class. This is something, again, if you are a teacher, 
if you are a police officer, if you are busdriver, this is going to 
hurt you.
  If you are a single mother who is working every single day, proud to 
do that, you are going to see that you are not going to have the 
support you need to make sure that that childcare continues for your 
child.
  If you are a family member that has a mother or father whose only 
income is Social Security, they probably depend on Meals on Wheels. 
They probably depend on programs like that. Some of that comes from 
your Federal Government. But when these Republican colleagues cut $1.5 
trillion out of the United States budget, it is going to come out of 
you, ladies and gentlemen. The people who have worked hard, seniors who 
are finally retired and should have the dignity of having a dignified 
life and having at least one darned meal a day, that is where it is 
going to come out of.
  Ladies and gentlemen, I am here to warn you, please call your Members 
of Congress. Please make sure that you let them know: I don't want that 
kind of giveaway."|1

Sadki, principal of Gar-Field Senior High School, as the 2017 
Outstanding High School Principal of Virginia.
   Each year, the Virginia Association of Secondary School Principals, 
which is the seventh largest school administrators' organization in the 
National Association of Secondary School Principals, selects a 
principal to represent the state as the nominee for the National 
Principal of the Year Program.
   As the 2017 nominee, Dr. Sadki is commended for his ``creativity and 
imagination in bringing about positive change, improving the 
educational program and student achievement; ensuring a school climate 
that reflects high staff and student morale; and for involving the 
community in the life of the school.''
   At the helm of Gar-Field Senior High School for the past five years, 
Dr. Sadki has implemented countless policy changes and program 
adjustments to address the needs of the increasingly diverse student 
population. Of the roughly 2,500 students enrolled in Gar-Field Senior 
High School last year, approximately half spoke a language other than 
English at home. One to never shy away from a challenge, Dr. Sadki 
rolled up his sleeves, transformed the teaching model, and embedded 
English instruction into the core curriculum to meet the needs of the 
diverse student body.
   For his foresight, engagement of the community, and commitment to 
ensuring that all students receive a world-class education, it is my 
honor to include in the Record, Dr. Cherif Sadki.
   Dr. Sadki is the standard-bearer at the regional and national level 
for educating English learners. He attributes much of his success in


reshaping the mission of Gar-Field Senior High School to the efforts of 
a supportive community, a focused group of educators, and a dedicated 
administrative staff. Instead of seeing students who embraced a failing 
attitude, he saw children who had not been given an opportunity to 
succeed. Dr. Sadki saw teachers who needed encouragement, training and 
support and a community that could be convinced that success was 
possible.
   I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing Dr. Cherif Sadki, 
principal of Gar-Field Senior High School on his selection as the 2017 
Outstanding High School Principal for Virginia. His leadership and 
dedication to the students, teachers, and faculty as he works to ensure 
a bright future for all who pass through the doors of Gar-Field Senior 
High School is truly commendable and worthy of our highest praise.

Republicans are trying to pass a massive tax cut for billionaires, 
millionaires, and wealthy corporations, and reward companies that ship 
American jobs overseas. The only way they can pay for it is by raising 
taxes on working people and cutting more than $1 trillion from Medicare 
and Medicaid.
  This is not what Donald Trump, the candidate, promised the American 
people when he ran for President. He promised he would protect Social 
Security, Medicare, and Medicaid, but it turns out that wasn't true.
  Wealthy Americans are doing better than ever. The top 1 percent are 
earning three times as much as they did 30 years ago, but working 
people haven't seen their pay go up at all.
  Let's get serious. Let's get working people a better deal that cuts 
their taxes. Let's get them a better deal that protects Social Security 
and Medicare. Let's not give tax breaks to companies that ship American 
jobs overseas.

  The open enrollment period ends December 15, so consumers need to act

  Cutting the open enrollment period in half, to slashing advertising 
and outreach funding by 90 percent, to announcing a shutdown of 
healthcare.gov on Sundays during open enrollment and other sabotage

tried to restrict the access to healthcare for Americans.
  I encourage every American who needs health insurance to visit

House of Representatives to join me in recognizing the Atlantic Coast 
Young Marines and their hard work during Red Ribbon Week.
  The Florida regiment of Young Marines has performed more than 50,000 
service hours since last October, with more than 35,000 hours of 
community service dedicated to our veterans.
  As you can see, the Atlantic Coast Young Marines and their fellow 
Young Marines throughout Florida are very active in their local 
communities.
  Reduction of drug demand is a major issue of the Young Marine 
program, and Red Ribbon Week is an excellent opportunity to recognize 
the Atlantic Coast Young Marines' emphasis on this mission.
  Red Ribbon Week is the oldest drug prevention program in the Nation, 
reaching millions of Americans during the last week of October each 
year. By wearing red ribbons and participating in community antidrug 
events, Young Marines pledge to live a drug-free life and pay tribute 
to DEA Special Agent Enrique ``Kiki'' Camarena.
  Special Agent Camarena was a veteran of the DEA assigned to 
Guadalajara, Mexico, where he was on the trail of the country's biggest 
drug traffickers. Because he was so close to unlocking a billion-dollar 
drug pipeline, he was kidnapped and murdered by drug traffickers. His 
tragic death opened the eyes of many Americans to the dangerous illicit 
drug trade.
  Red Ribbon Week celebrates Agent Camarena's life and his vision for a 
drug-free America.
  Last week, the Atlantic Coast Young Marines honored his life through 
events that helped reduce the demand for drugs throughout northeast 
Florida.
  These young men and women who participate in this education and 
service program are known to be excellent leaders inside and outside of 
the classroom. The Atlantic Coast Young Marines are a shining example 
of our First Coast youth.
  They also serve our veterans in numerous ways, by cleaning yards, 
making hospital visits, and simply writing cards. Their dedication to 
community service and our veterans is a shining example of noble 
selflessness.
  Mr. Speaker, I applaud the Atlantic Coast Young Marines for their 
service to Florida's First Coast community.

the aisle have wasted months in often misguided debate over repealing 
the Affordable Care Act. While this debate has raged within one 
political party, the Children's Health Insurance Program has expired.
  I received a letter last night from Governor Tom Wolf of 
Pennsylvania. He wants us to act to protect the hundreds of thousands 
of children in our Commonwealth who depend on CHIP funding to meet 
their basic healthcare needs.
  The GOP has failed to reauthorize CHIP over arguments of how to pay 
for it and the distractions of a failed effort to repeal the Affordable 
Care Act. That puts us in a tough spot in Philadelphia and the 
Commonwealth.
  I am convinced that something must be done because, as Governor Wolf 
points out, time is essential for our State and numerous others; yet 
300,000 kids are enrolled in CHIP, which will soon run out of money to 
pay for their care.
  The kids who rely on CHIP funding are some of the most vulnerable in 
our State, and, frankly, they need action now. The solution doesn't 
have to be partisan. Providing low-income kids and the hospitals that 
serve them isn't a Democratic or Republican issue; it is a commonsense 
issue. The failure to act is unacceptable, so I say now we need to do 
something.
  I urge my colleagues in the GOP to get to work on a bipartisan 
solution.

annually commemorate is National Domestic Violence Awareness Month in 
October. This is a time when we're called to increase public awareness 
and understanding of domestic violence.
  As noted by the National Network to End Domestic Violence, domestic 
violence is a crime that thrives when we remain silent. That's why the 
Senate today passed the resolution that I recently introduced with 
Senator Feinstein to commemorate National Domestic Violence Awareness 
Month.
  As stated in our resolution, Congress should continue to raise 
awareness of domestic violence in the United States. We also should 
pledge our continued support for programs designed to assist survivors, 
hold perpetrators accountable, and bring an end to domestic violence.
  Congress has made support to survivors a national priority for over 
three decades, through the enactment of the Violence Against Women Act, 
the Victims of Crime Act, and other Federal laws. Through the enactment 
of laws criminalizing domestic violence at the State and local level, 
we've also sent a strong signal to abusers that domestic violence is 
not a ``private'' matter.
  We've come a long way, but we still have much work to do on this 
front. Even now, domestic violence affects millions in the United 
States, including women, men, and children of every age and socio-
economic status. About one in five women will at some point in their 
lifetime become a victim of this crime, according to the Centers for 
Disease Control.
  I applaud the many individuals and organizations in Iowa and 
elsewhere around the Nation that work around the clock to respond to 
victims in crisis. They include the hotline personnel who provide 
support 365 days a year. They include the staff and volunteers at 
shelters, who provide safe havens for those escaping abuse. They 
include the advocates who champion survivors' interests at the State 
and Federal levels. Last, but certainly not least, they include the 
first responders who compassionately respond to victims in crisis.
  We applaud their continued service and we continue to support the 
goals and ideals of National Domestic Violence Awareness Month.

recognize a remarkable public servant from my district, Mayor Raymond 
G. Bodnar of Munhall, Pennsylvania, who is retiring after 53 years of 
service to his community.
  Mr. Bodnar has been the Mayor of Munhall Borough for the last 30 
years, but his service to his nation and community began long before 
that. As a young man, he served in the Army during the Korean Conflict 
and was honorably discharged in 1955. In addition to working for 40 
years for the U.S. Steel Corporation, he served eight years as auditor 
of Munhall and another fifteen as a member and then President of the 
Munhall Borough Council. In 1987, he was elected mayor, a position 
which he has honorably filled for the last three decades, and in which 
he has worked tirelessly to improve the Munhall community.
  During his career, Mayor Bodnar has supported and secured funding for 
such important projects as developing the Munhall waterfront, 
revitalizing the town's Main Street, modernizing the police department, 
and introducing public safety and crime prevention programs.


  Beyond his duties as a civil servant, he has also given back to his 
community in countless ways, including managing the youth Munhall 
Baseball League, organizing summer athletic programs, working with Boy 
Scouts, Girl Scouts, and church groups, and teaching local government 
to youth groups and schools. He is also a member of a number of 
community service organizations, including Knights of Columbus No. 
2201, the Catholic War Veterans Association, the Homestead Elks, and 
the Steel Valley Salvation Army Board ofDirectors.
  For more than 50 years, Raymond Bodnar has demonstrated wholehearted 
dedication to public service and community involvement, and I think 
that we can all learn something from his example. I wish to 
congratulate the mayor on his retirement and commend him for his 
lifetime of devotion to the Munhall community.

Elementary School of Carmel, IN, for being named a 2017 National Blue 
Ribbon School by the U.S. Department of Education.
  Established in 1982, the National Blue Ribbon Schools Program 
recognizes schools that have demonstrated a vision of educational 
excellence for all students, regardless of their social or economic 
background. Since its inception, this program has allowed schools in 
every State to gain recognition for educational accomplishments, 
particularly in closing the achievement gaps among students.
  College Wood's mission is to provide opportunities for all students 
to realize their potential. College Wood students have consistently 
ranked among the top 10 percent in annual standardized testing. By 
encouraging every student to strive for excellence, explore 
opportunities, and realize their full potential, College Wood students 
are equipped to succeed and graduate.
  College Wood strives to provide a quality, well-rounded education and 
teach students the traits of successful leaders and communicators. To 
that end, the school includes social and emotional learning in its 
curriculum. Social Thinking and Superflex lessons instill social 
awareness, emotional management skills, and perspective-enhancing 
experiences.
  The school also seeks to help teach students about the importance of 
service and helping others. Through several philanthropic endeavors, 
College Wood students, parents, and staff work closely together to give 
back to the community. Several donation drives throughout the year lead 
up to the school's biggest annual event to benefit the Leukemia and 
Lymphoma Society.
  I am proud to recognize College Wood Elementary School principal 
Kathryn Olssen, the entire staff, the student body, and their families. 
The effort, dedication, and value you put into education has led not 
only to this prestigious recognition, but will benefit you and the 
Carmel community well into the future.
  On behalf of the citizens of Indiana, I congratulate College Wood 
Elementary School, and I wish the students and staff continued success 
in the future.

  Mr. Speaker, over the last two decades, our Nation has experienced a 
37 percent decline in the number of U.S. listed companies--public 
companies. Equally troubling, we have seen the number of publicly 
traded companies fall to around 5,700. These statistics are concerning 
because they are similar to the data we saw in the 1980s when our 
economy was less than half its current size.
  Mr. Speaker, since 2000, the average number of initial public 
offerings, or IPOs, has fallen to approximately 135 per year, which 
pales in comparison to the more than 450 IPOs filed per year in


the early 1990s. Notably, there has not been a corresponding downward 
trend in the creation of new companies over that same period. This 
demonstrates that the regulatory costs associated with going public is 
deterring new and emerging companies from making the decision to go 
public.
  Now, you may ask: Why is this important?
  Well, first of all, it is preventing our capital markets from 
reaching their full potential, which sounds very academic and pie in 
the sky.
  What does that mean, though?
  What it really means is that it is not allowing Mr. and Mrs. 401(k) 
from participating in the economic successes that we have seen lately.
  Federal securities regulations are typically written for large public 
companies, and this one-size-fits-all framework imposes a 
disproportionate burden on small and emerging companies looking to go 
public.
  The 2012 Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act, or JOBS Act, which was 
a bipartisan bill signed into law by President Obama, created a new 
type of issue called an emerging growth company, which allowed these 
so-called EGCs with less than $1 billion in revenue to be allowed to 
communicate with potential investors before an initial public offering 
and file confidential draft registration statements with the Securities 
and Exchange Commission.
  On June 29, 2017, the SEC extended to all companies the option of 
submitting in advance draft registration statements for IPOs and 
follow-on offerings within 1 year of an IPO.
  H.R. 3903, the Encouraging Public Offerings Act, would ensure that 
all issues making an IPO would be allowed to communicate with potential 
investors before an offering and file confidential draft registration 
statements with the Securities and Exchange Commission. In other words, 
we are going to codify what the Securities and Exchange Commission has 
said we should be doing.
  H.R. 3903 simply codifies that practice into law and it will allow 
these companies to finalize their registration documents without undue 
expectations from outside influences, and it allows companies to time 
their offering with the market before making their Form S-1s public and 
beginning an investor road show.
  I commend the bipartisan work of Representatives Budd and Meeks on 
this important bill to ensure that H.R. 3903 applies to all companies, 
without losing valuable investor protections--a key element in this.
  This bill will also help encourage companies to go public, and I 
encourage all of my colleagues to vote in favor of H.R. 3903.
  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time."|4
CREC-2017-11-01-pt1-PgH8318-5-5|Mr. FOSTER|F000454|CREC-2017-11-01-pt1-PgH8318-5|"  Mr. FOSTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 3903. This bill will 
expand the ability of companies to test the waters prior to going 
public and to submit confidential filings for feedback from the SEC 
staff prior to filing of an IPO.
  The JOBS Act of 2012 created these mechanisms for emerging growth 
companies. Emerging growth companies are those with less than $1 
billion in revenue, $700 million in public float, and $1 billion in 
nonconvertible debt. The JOBS Act enabled these companies to speak to 
institutional investors prior to an IPO without it being considered an 
unregistered offering for sale of securities.
  The definition of a securities offering is appropriately broad to 
protect investors and ensure transparency in our markets by requiring 
registration and significant disclosures. However, companies 
considering a public offering should be able to talk to the most 
sophisticated investors in the markets, large institutional investors, 
to gauge the interest in the offering. Having that ability will help 
encourage public offerings because it enables companies to realize 
efficiencies in assessing demand.
  Research-intensive firms are more likely to test the waters because 
it lowers the cost of proprietary disclosure. These are the firms that 
drive economic growth by bringing new ideas to market.
  Research is obviously a passion of mine, having founded a company 
that was based on my intellectual property and subsequently designing 
particle accelerators as a physicist at Fermi National Lab. It is the 
new ideas that grow our GDP and improve the standard of living for all 
Americans.
  Moreover, new businesses with new ideas do more to grow the economy 
than incumbents with new ideas or just acquisitions. The public market 
presents an opportunity for small businesses to become big businesses 
without being bought out.
  Additionally, this bill would allow companies of all sizes to file 
confidentially forms with the SEC. This allows the firm to receive 
feedback without making inappropriate or unrequired information public. 
Disclosing the correct information helps the markets understand risks 
and price an offering appropriately.
  The bill also includes a provision giving the SEC discretion to 
ensure that these mechanisms are used in a way that benefits markets 
and investors. The U.S. capital markets are the deepest and most liquid 
in the world, and this bill will help more companies tap into that 
capital and grow our economy.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge broad support for this bill today, and I reserve 
the balance of my time."|5

  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the Encouraging Public 
Offerings Act, a bill that the gentleman from New York (Mr. Meeks) and 
I have worked on together, and I thank him for that.
  I also thank the Financial Services Committee, in particular, the 
staff and the subcommittee chairman, Mr. Huizenga.
  I also thank the chairman, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Hensarling). 
His leadership of this committee and his devotion and fidelity to the 
conservative principles are legendary. His retirement will be a great 
loss to this institution. The Hensarling legacy of conservative 
leadership will not be forgotten, and I am certain that his next 
chapter will be as great as this one. He will be missed by all, 
especially by those of us--myself among them--who share his vision and 
his limited government principles.
  Mr. Speaker, no other country has a better history of connecting 
money with vision than the United States of America. We rightfully 
celebrate our legendary entrepreneurs: Steve Jobs, Bill Gates, Andrew 
Carnegie, Tom Davis, John Rockefeller, and a whole host of others who 
built the companies that drive our economy. None of those men could 
have done what they did without capital. None of them could have done 
what they did without intermediaries to connect that capital to their 
vision.
  So, Mr. Speaker, the depressing truth is that our capital markets are 
the biggest, strongest, and most transparent connectors between money 
and vision, and they are not where they once were. We have the same 
number of public offerings on our stock exchanges that we did in the 
1980s, when the economy was much smaller. We have lost 50 percent of 
our public companies since the 1990s, and more and more companies 
choose to go private, or they never even sell their shares to the 
public.
  The hope is that, with this bill, we will increase the desire of 
companies to go public, getting our financial markets back to being the 
number one method for capital formation. To that end, our bill does 
three things:
  First, it allows the companies to file their paperwork for going 
public with the SEC confidentially. That way, if there is an error or a 
discrepancy in the documents, the company can work it out with the 
agency without getting embarrassed in public or exposing information to 
competitors.
  Second, it allows all companies to confidentially file their 
paperwork for a second stock sale after an initial public offering. 
Again, the point being to allow for a dialogue between the company and 
the regulator.
  Third, it also allows all companies considering an IPO to talk to 
sophisticated investors and qualified institutions and see if these 
investors might want to buy their stock before offering it to the 
public, which is called ``testing the waters.'' It is hard to know if


you should sell a product if you can't check and see if there is anyone 
out there who even wants to buy it.
  Mr. Speaker, these changes to the securities laws have received broad 
support. I want to quote the SEC chairman on this when he spoke at a 
hearing in our committee. He said: ``The initial data is positive. Not 
just people using it, but people saying, Thank you, we intend to use 
it. Both from an IPO perspective, but also from the perspective on 
follow-on offerings that occur in the first year . . . if there is any 
adverse views, I'd like to hear them. We haven't heard any.''
  The Center for American Progress, which has not traditionally been 
friendly to relaxing financial regulations, has said that these 
reforms, which were made available to smaller companies in the JOBS 
Act, were some of the most successful provisions in that law. This bill 
applies them to all companies, not just those with a certain amount of 
revenue.
  Finally, the Treasury Department gave favorable mention to these 
reforms in its report on the capital markets earlier this year. This 
bill passed out of the House Financial Services Committee with 
unanimous support.
  Mr. Speaker, the numbers on public companies are clear. We have a 
problem. The experts are clear that the changes in the Budd-Meeks bill 
would be a positive step towards fixing the problem. Similar bipartisan 
reforms have seen great success in the past.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge support."|7

support of this bill. It is the sort of commonsense, bipartisan fix 
that will make an incremental improvement to our public markets.
  However, I would also like to emphasize what I believe is the real 
threat to the health of our public markets, which is the concentration 
of wealth at the very top. It is no secret that the competition to our 
public markets are private equity and venture capital, and these are 
investment instruments largely, almost entirely, under the control of 
the very wealthy.
  We are, this week, going to begin debate on a tax bill that will 
decide, to a large extent, whether we accelerate or decelerate the 
concentration of wealth at the very top. I just want to emphasize that 
connection to make everyone understand that the continued health of our 
public markets, which historically have been such an important 
contributor to middle class investment in growing businesses. So I want 
people to consider that as we debate this bill, which I fully support, 
and, as well, the variety of important issues that we debate that 
really affect the distribution of wealth in this country.

a thriving U.S. economy. It allows companies to invest in growth and to 
develop new and innovative products and services. Historically, 
companies seeking a considerable amount of capital have preferred to 
use an initial public offering and have shares traded on a national 
securities exchange.
  However, the United States has experienced a 37 percent decline in 
the number of U.S. listed public companies, which is considerably lower 
than in the 1980s and 1990s.
  Public company compliance costs have grown sufficiently large that 
many smaller firms stay private rather than spend their profit 
overcoming these regulatory burdens. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Dodd-
Frank Act, and other legislative and regulatory actions have 
contributed to these costs.


  Title I of the JOBS Act created a new category of issuers known as 
emerging growth companies, or EGCs. These issuers must have less than 
$1 billion in annual revenue or $700,000 million in public float when 
they register with the SEC.
  While the JOBS Act made it easier for companies to go public, it was 
not enough to overcome capital formation obstacles entrepreneurs and 
small businesses are facing.
  H.R. 3903, the Encouraging Public Offerings Act of 2017, would allow 
any company, regardless of size or EGC status, to take advantage of the 
popular provisions of title I of the 2012 JOBS Act.
  Title I of the JOBS Act has proven to be a real policy success, and 
Congress and the SEC should continue to advance policy that will reduce 
or eliminate barriers to economic growth.
  Mr. Speaker, I applaud Mr. Budd and Mr. Meeks for their work on this 
important piece of legislation. I appreciate our chairman, Mr. 
Huizenga, for moving it expeditiously through our committee; and our 
chairman, Mr. Hensarling, for presiding over it.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes.''"|10

  Mr. Speaker, in closing, we know that trillions of dollars are 
invested in our economy through IRAs, 401(k)s, and other investment 
tools. However, these companies need to be publicly traded for Joe and 
Jane IRA or Mr. and Mrs. 401(k) to even be able to have the opportunity 
to invest in them. That is what this bill is trying to do.
  This bill is trying to make sure that those emerging companies, those 
small startup kind of companies, who may be very innovative or, 
frankly, might be even more mundane, but they are small and they are 
looking to grow, that they have an opportunity to do so.
  Who benefits? Everyone. Everyone is going to be able to take a much 
more broad view of how they are going to invest their hard-earned 
dollars that they have worked so long and hard for.
  Mr. Speaker, this is also, I believe, an important aspect, because we 
know that economic growth comes from small- and medium-sized 
businesses. That is where we are going to see really the engine of our 
economy rev up.
  It is maybe not as much of a headline grabber as some of those big 
companies adding 100 or 200 or even thousands of jobs, but all of those 
smaller companies adding people into the workforce add up to far larger 
numbers than those numbers are.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask all of my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R.

the occasion of its 10th anniversary. This project represents the 
fulfillment of a promise I made to this community more than a decade 
ago, during my time as both Providence District Supervisor and Chairman 
of the Fairfax County Board of Supervisors.
   Working with engaged citizens, we identified a need for new meeting 
space as well as a new library in the Oakton community. But we didn't 
stop there. We rolled up our sleeves and went to work. We worked with 
developers to secure the necessary land, with my colleagues on the 
Board to secure and pass the necessary bond referendums and with the 
community to raise awareness and support for this necessary addition. 
These efforts bore fruit and in 2007 we celebrated the dedication of 
the new Oakton Library. Ten years later, the library stands as a pillar 
of the Oakton community and I am confident that it will continue to 
serve that role for many more decades to come.
   I wish to give special recognition to the members of the Friends of 
Oakton Library, who worked with myself and others side by side on every 
step of this project. Together, we guided what was once just a concept 
into a brick-and-mortar reality.
   We are incredibly fortunate in Fairfax County to have such dedicated 
citizens, who go out of their way for the betterment of the lives of 
others. I have often said that local government is where the rubber 
meets the road. The level of accountability is absolute. You either 
solved the problem or you didn't . . . and everyone knows where you 
live and has your phone number! My colleagues on the Board of 
Supervisors and I accomplished a lot together during my time in Fairfax 
County government, but the completion of the Oakton Library remains one 
of my proudest moments in local government. A testament to what can 
happen when like-minded individuals are willing to back up their words 
and desires with concrete, often unglamorous actions. The Oakton 
community and indeed all of Fairfax County is better off today because 
people were willing to put in the work.
   Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating the 
Friends of Oakton Library and the entire Oakton community on this 
important anniversary. I commend them for their contributions to 
Fairfax County and wish them great success in all their future 
endeavors. I am confident that we will be observing many more 
anniversaries of this library still to come.

missed opportunities for the middle class under 8 years of the Obama 
administration, the American people elected a new President and 
Congress dedicated to getting our country moving again after so many 
years of failed leftwing policies. We are working hard on joint 
legislative initiatives on tax reform.
  We have also undertaken what has been described as ``the most 
ambitious regulatory rollback since Reagan.'' The administration has 
the ability to take serious action on its own, and it has. The Congress 
has taken important action many times as well. We have used the tools 
contained in the Congressional Review Act, which allows us to overturn 
certain regulations with a majority vote in Congress and the 
President's signature. The President signed all of the many CRA 
resolutions we passed already, which overturned regulations that 
threatened everything from job creation to economic growth.
  The President will sign another CRA resolution today, one that will 
overturn a regulation that threatened to drive up costs for millions of 
Americans who carry a credit card. It is a regulation dreamed up by a 
government agency, the CFPB, that claims to protect consumers but seems 
to have found a way to actually harm them. The Treasury Department 
released a study showing how this regulation has little to do with 
consumer protection and everything to do with lining the pockets of 
trial lawyers. This unaccountable agency ignored that study and issued 
its regulation anyway.
  We passed this Congressional Review Act resolution to protect 
consumers from wrongdoing while avoiding frivolous lawsuits that will 
only drive up costs for the millions of Americans who have a credit 
card. The CFPB continues to be one of the most unaccountable 
bureaucracies in Washington, and this Congress will continue to stand 
up for consumers even when the CFPB will not.

Committee met and reported a rule, House Resolution 595, providing for 
consideration of an important piece of legislation, H.R. 2936, the 
Resilient Federal Forests Act of 2017.
  The rule provides for consideration of H.R. 2936 under a structured 
rule, with four Democratic amendments made in order and two bipartisan 
amendments and one Republican-led amendment made in order.
  Mr. Speaker, this rule provides for consideration of H.R. 2936, the 
Resilient Federal Forests Act of 2017, a bill that is critically 
important to my district in central Washington State and to rural, 
forested districts like it across the United States who continue to 
face devastation from catastrophic wildfires as we have seen, just this 
last year, a great example of.
  This bipartisan, comprehensive legislation is aimed at addressing the 
disastrous consequences of wildfires by utilizing the tools the Forest 
Service and other agencies have to reduce the threats posed by these 
wildfires, by insects, by disease infestation, and by dangerous old 
forest overgrowth that serves as a literal tinderbox for wildfires. 
This legislation will expedite and improve forest management activities 
in Federal forests to counteract these threats.
  This legislation, spearheaded by my friend and colleague from 
Arkansas, Representative Bruce Westerman, who is a trained forester 
himself, is comprised of a truly comprehensive effort developed here in 
the people's House. It is bipartisan. This bipartisan support 
demonstrates that the threat of catastrophic wildfires does not just 
impact a red or a blue district, but, rather, it poses a threat to 
communities across the United States.





  H.R. 2936 would provide Federal land management agencies immediate 
tools to increase the pace and the scale of forest management projects 
to dramatically improve the health and resiliency of our national 
forests, ensuring robust protection of the environment. Active 
management leads to healthier forests. It is that simple.
  This legislation also allows expedited review for collaborative 
projects in Federal forests and removes incentives for special interest 
groups to file frivolous lawsuits. By requiring litigants opposing 
active management projects to propose an alternative management option, 
we can instill accountability into a system that is wrought with 
litigation.
  Additionally, the legislation bolsters locally led forest management 
and hazardous fuel reduction projects to improve forest health.
  By engaging local stakeholders, we can lessen the severity and the 
costs of wildfires, while protecting the communities and the 
environment.
  Mr. Speaker, another major component of our Nation's wildfire crisis 
is the broken system with which we fund firefighting suppression. When 
these firefighting costs exceed the existing budget, the U.S. Forest 
Service transfers funds from other vital forest management program 
accounts in order to pay for wildfire suppression. I and a lot of other 
people in this Chamber have been outspoken critics of this dangerous 
broken cycle known as fire borrowing. That also is a very bipartisan 
position that is taken. H.R. 2936 provides a major step forward in 
ending this cycle. By raiding accounts that provide for forest 
management programs which help prevent wildfires, we tie one hand 
behind our back in an effort to both prevent and suppress these 
catastrophic wildfires. This legislation will help to put an end to 
this longstanding problem.
  Mr. Speaker, my constituents know as well as anyone the immense 
threat that wildfires pose to local communities. In just the past 4 
years, the fourth district of my State, my district, has seen the two 
largest fires in Washington State's history. We have lost hundreds of 
homes and businesses and structures. My constituents are still 
struggling to recover from the Carlton Complex Fire of 2014 and the 
Okanogan Complex Fire of 2015. We lost three firefighters that year. 
That truly is a high cost.
  Active forest management is a matter of saving lives and livelihoods, 
of protecting our communities, and ensuring our constituents' health 
and safety, which is why I am proud to support this rule and the 
underlying legislation that it represents today.
  Mr. Speaker, as I have often said, we cannot continue to limp from 
one devastating fire season to the next. We must take significant steps 
toward reforestation, rehabilitation, and overall forest management. 
This legislation will allow us to do just that. We must begin to 
prevent, to suppress, to mitigate the threat of catastrophic wildfires, 
and the Resilient Federal Forests Act of 2017 will be a momentous 
opportunity to turn around our diseased and overgrown Federal forests. 
This legislation is essential and desperately needed to change the 
current path of forest management on public lands. It is outdated, 
unsustainable, and dangerous.
  Mr. Speaker, this is a straightforward rule allowing for 
consideration of this critical piece of legislation that will help 
protect our rural communities and ensure that we are prepared to 
respond to devastating and catastrophic wildfires that have plagued 
many areas of our country in the last few years.
  Mr. Speaker, I support the rule's adoption, I urge my colleagues to 
support both the rule and the underlying bill.
  Mr. Speaker, before I yield to my colleague from Florida, I would 
like to share one last note. Just a few weeks ago, the new chief of the 
U.S. Forest Service, Tony Tooke, came to Capitol Hill and briefed some 
of my colleagues, including me, regarding this year's devastating 
wildfire season.
  He reported to us that over 8 million acres, just this year, have 
burned. We have also lost dozens of lives, thousands of homes. Chief 
Tooke left us with the stark fact that while more than 8 million acres 
burned this year, another 80 million acres across the United States are 
at high risk of catching fire--80 million acres. Mr. Speaker, if that 
does not show how dire this problem is, then I certainly can't tell you 
what does.
  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time."|5
CREC-2017-11-01-pt1-PgH8309-3-6|Mr. HASTINGS|H000324|CREC-2017-11-01-pt1-PgH8309-3|"  Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  Mr. Speaker, before beginning my remarks, I would offer condolences 
to the grieving families who lost loved ones in yesterday's terrorist 
attack in New York City, and to have the people of New York know--and I 
know I speak for all of us, and there will be a more appropriate 
recognition at a time in the future, I am sure, but to have them know 
that all of us grieve with them and are concerned not only for those 
who lost their lives, but to assist in preventing measures of this type 
in the future.
  Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from Washington for yielding to me the 
customary 30 minutes for debate.
  This bill is a sweeping attack on responsible forest management 
policy that upends key environmental safeguards, limits public 
participation in land management decisions, and prioritizes commercial 
timber harvest over transparent, science-based management. In other 
words, this is business as usual for this Republican majority when it 
comes to protecting our environment.
  A footnote right there, my friend from the State of Washington does 
highlight, rightly, concerns not only for his congressional district, 
but areas throughout the country that have experienced wildfires.
  Many of us have talked about this in conjunction with other disasters 
and a need for this Congress to be able to address the shortfall in 
funding for such important measures.
  During this Congress alone, my Republican friends have brought to the 
floor bills that undermine the ability of the Environmental Protection 
Agency to issue independent and objective scientific conclusions, 
weaken regulations of pesticides, and repeal rulemakings aimed at 
effective, science-based management of public lands, just to name a few 
things.

  Repeatedly, my Republican friends ignore science and attack 
environmental protections all in an all-too-obvious attempt to help 
commercial interests over sound conservation policy. This focus not 
only undermines our public lands, but it also harms the health and 
safety of the American people.
  This bill continues the assault on our Nation's environmental 
protections, and it may be one of the most irresponsible examples yet.
  Under the guise of responding to the recent tragic wildfires in 
California and elsewhere in this Nation, this legislation attacks the 
National Environmental Policy Act, known as NEPA, which requires 
Federal agencies to assess the environmental effects of their actions.
  The bill also attacks the Endangered Species Act by requiring 
redundant and unnecessary reporting requirements. It blocks access to 
the courts and limits recovery in environmental justice cases. Just for 
good measure, this bill effectively overturns President Obama's 
administration's monument expansion.
  The bill does little to fix the true problem of wildfire management, 
namely the chronic underfunding of wildfire management. Any serious 
proposal must address the constant funding shortages at the U.S. Forest 
Service by increasing the amount of Federal funding available for 
wildfire suppression. A successful solution needs to provide advanced 
access to emergency funding.
  Unfortunately, today's legislation does no such thing. Yesterday, the 
administration offered its statement of administration policy, and, at 
best, it is tepid. It says, ``The administration appreciates the intent 
of H.R. 2936 . . . and is supportive of land management reforms like 
those outlined in the legislation,'' and then comes the however. ``The 
administration, however, has concerns about the legislation's revisions 
to the Stafford Act, which would force competition for funding between 
wildfires on Federal land and other disasters already covered by the 
Stafford Act, including hurricanes.''
  It goes on to say, `` . . . the administration supports a separate, 
annual cap


adjustment for wildfire suppression operations, which will resolve 
concerns about the sufficiency of funds for wildfire suppression and 
avoid unnecessary competition for Stafford Act funds.''
  Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record the Statement of Administration 
Policy.

                   Statement Of Administration Policy


H.R. 2936--Resilient Federal Forests Act of 2017--Rep. Westerman R-AR, 
                             and cosponsors

       The Administration strongly believes that funding for 
     wildland fire management must be addressed in order to enable 
     the Forest Service and the Department of the Interior to 
     better manage the Nation's forests and other public lands. 
     The Administration's second disaster funding request, 
     submitted to Congress on October 4, 2017, underscored this 
     belief. The request also noted the Administration's belief 
     that land management reforms are critical to solving the 
     problem of ``fire borrowing''--taking funds from forest 
     management programs to cover fire costs that exceed 
     appropriations--in a comprehensive manner, rather than 
     through a funding-only appropriations approach.
       The Administration appreciates the intent of H.R. 2936, the 
     Resilient Federal Forests Act of 2017, and is supportive of 
     land management reforms like those outlined in the 
     legislation. The Administration, however, has concerns about 
     the legislation's revisions to the Stafford Act, which would 
     force competition for funding between wildfires on Federal 
     land and other disasters already covered by the Stafford Act, 
     including hurricanes.
     Wildland Fire Management Funding
       Last year, Federal wildfire suppression spending reached 
     $2.9 billion, an amount that signals clearly the need for 
     Congress to address the rising cost of fire suppression 
     operations. The dependence on ``fire borrowing'' to cover 
     funding shortfalls in times of severe wildfire impedes the 
     missions of our land management agencies, including by taking 
     critical funding from programs that help reduce the risk of 
     catastrophic fire, restore and maintain healthy functioning 
     ecosystems, and yield timber production.
       The Administration, however, has concerns with re-purposing 
     the Stafford Act to address wildfires. The purpose of the 
     Stafford Act is to assist State, local, tribal, and 
     territorial (SLTT) governments that become overwhelmed when 
     responding to and recovering from natural disasters affecting 
     their jurisdictions. H.R. 2936 would modify the Stafford Act 
     by creating a new type of disaster declaration to address the 
     cost of wildfire suppression on Federal land, thereby 
     changing long-standing principles governing Federal support 
     to SLTT governments. As we have seen in this year's historic 
     Atlantic hurricane season, the Federal Emergency Management 
     Agency (FEMA) must continue to be focused on its existing 
     mission, and the Stafford Act's Disaster Relief Fund must 
     remain dedicated solely to that mission.
       Instead of the approach outlined in H.R. 2936, the 
     Administration supports a separate, annual cap adjustment for 
     wildfire suppression operations, which will resolve concerns 
     about the sufficiency of funds for wildfire suppression and 
     avoid unnecessary competition for Stafford Act funds.
     Improving Forest Management
       The Administration appreciates H.R. 2936's recognition that 
     fixing the funding component of fire borrowing will not, on 
     its own, stop the worsening trend of catastrophic wildfires. 
     Meaningful forest management reforms to strengthen our 
     ability to restore the Nation's forests and improve their 
     resilience to destructive wildfires must be a part of any 
     permanent solution. H.R. 2936's provisions that expedite 
     environmental approval for proactive forest management, 
     including hazardous fuel reduction and post-fire timber 
     salvage and reforestation actions, are important steps 
     forward. The Administration supports and will continue to 
     work with Congress on the details of the forest management 
     reform proposals.
       Although the Administration has concerns with H.R. 2936's 
     modifications to the Stafford Act, the Administration will 
     continue working with Congress to enact a sustainable 
     solution to ``fire borrowing'' that does not adversely affect 
     FEMA's critical disaster relief funding and that recognizes 
     the need for a comprehensive solution to the problem of 
     wildfires.

fix the true problem of wildfire management. Any serious proposal, as I 
have said, must address the constant funding shortages, and that is 
what, among other things, the administration suggested.
  Mr. Speaker, this year has been a wake-up call. We must do more to 
respond to the natural disasters that face our Nation. After three 
major hurricanes and devastating wildfires in my friend from 
Washington's State, in California, in Montana, and even in the 
Everglades of Florida we have experienced some wildfires, albeit not at 
the magnitude of loss of life or property as existed in some of the 
others, our resources and agencies are stretched to the brink.
  Weeks after the storms, millions of people across the Virgin Islands 
and Puerto Rico are without power and without reliable access to clean 
drinking water. FEMA Administrator Brock Long testified just yesterday 
that the response to these storms and wildfires and other disasters--we 
have had tornadoes that have come along as well--is costing the Federal 
Government $200 million a day.
  Mr. Speaker, I understand that the Office of Management and Budget is 
currently working to send a proposal to Congress for a third 
supplemental spending package to address the recovery needs in the 
affected areas. I urge them and my colleagues here in Congress to act 
swiftly to provide the resources that so many people desperately need. 
In the meantime, what have we gotten from Republicans? Bipartisanship? 
Sound science-based proposals? No. Instead, the Republican majority has 
ignored bipartisanship, and, yesterday, in the Rules Committee, a 
bipartisan measure was offered that was a thoughtful proposal on this 
topic, and was rejected, and presented this bill that we have here now 
that doesn't address the real issues facing public land and wildfire 
management, but, rather, guts environmental protection and overturns 
President Obama's monument expansion.


  Mr. Speaker, this is business as usual for House Republicans. But if 
we are going to seriously address natural disasters and how we respond 
to them, I encourage my friends on the other side of the aisle to put 
aside their partisanship, reconsider their denial of climate change and 
its effects on our environment, and join Democrats in working together 
to address this and other important issues faced by all Americans.
  There were two amendments that were offered yesterday by my 
colleagues from California. Both of those amendments were not made in 
order. I don't think it is right when people offer legislation, 
particularly those that have just been damaged, as our colleagues, 
Congressmen Thompson and Matsui, and others in the northern California 
region. They at least should have had an opportunity to offer up their 
amendment and have it voted against if people felt so here in this 
body.
  I would hope, in the future, we would make a correction of that kind 
of undertaking. I would hope all Members of this body would have an 
opportunity to present their ideas on any legislation, and something as 
important as this could have allowed for an open rule, rather than for 
partisan activity to reign supreme.
  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time."|7

  I do thank the gentleman from Washington State for this time. I urge

  Mr. Speaker, I want to focus my remarks on one specific and very 
important section of the underlying bill. This pertains to allowing 
young men and young women the opportunity to work and to learn the 
family trade of logging.
  Now, logging is a very big business in the State of Maine. About 90 
percent of our State, Mr. Speaker, is forested, and we have generations 
and traditions of logging in the State of Maine. Logging is often a 
family-run business where the practice and the technique of harvesting 
and then transporting saw logs to mills are passed down from one 
generation to another.
  Now, H.R. 2936 brings Federal regulations in line with this new 
technology and new standards of safety by allowing family-owned logging 
businesses


the ability to train 16- and 17-year-olds under very close supervision 
of their parents.
  We need to make certain, Mr. Speaker, that the next generation of 
loggers are able to learn what they need to know, how to run these 
family-run businesses, including the operation and maintenance of their 
equipment. We do this, please, by supporting the Resilient Federal 
Forests Act of 2017.
  This bill, Mr. Speaker, will ensure that the long-term health of the 
logging business industry is supported and can continue from one 
generation to another."|9

days since the President abruptly and irresponsibly terminated the DACA 
program.
  For 57 days, students have been panicked about how much longer they 
can go to school. Brothers, sisters, sons, and daughters, are terrified 
that they might lose their loved ones any minute. Parents are afraid to 
take their children to the hospital or to school, and breadwinners 
don't know whether they will be able to continue to earn a paycheck to 
support themselves and their families.
  For 57 days, the Republican-controlled Congress has been silent, 
doing nothing to provide certainty for 800,000 American DREAMers who 
are caught up in Congressional dysfunction. Without a permanent 
legislative fix, these young Americans, like Maritza from Texas, will 
be at risk of detention and deportation.
  Maritza works part time to help her pay for college so she can pursue 
her dream career in journalism after graduation. Over months, she and 
her family saved up $1,000 to pay for an attorney and the DACA program 
application fee. All she needed was her school to provide her records 
so she could finish her application.
  But then Hurricane Harvey hit and flooded her family's home in east 
Houston and shut down school for 2 weeks. While Maritza and her mother 
were recovering from Harvey's devastation, they were the victims 
of another disaster, but this one was created by their own government.

  They watched Attorney General Jeff Sessions announce on live TV that 
the Trump administration was ending DACA and cutting off new 
applications for young immigrants just like her. The devastating news 
crushed Maritza and her family. Now they and countless others have 
waited 57 days for us to fix it.
  Today we have the opportunity to uphold our values and to pass the 
Dream Act so that these young Americans aren't waiting in fear any 
longer.
  Mr. Speaker, there is a quote directly above your chair from Daniel 
Webster imploring us to do ``something worthy to be remembered.''
  So how will we be remembered? Will the Republican-controlled Congress 
continue to sit here and passively accept the Trump administration's 
cowardly decision to eliminate protections for countless DREAMers 
across the country? Or do we want to do something about it?
  We have an opportunity to protect our neighbors, coworkers, 
classmates, friends, constituents, and members of our military who have 
done everything to try to contribute to this great country. One vote 
would change the lives of nearly 800,000 Americans forever. One vote 
would allow them to pursue the American Dream, to go to school, to 
continue to work, to buy a house, or to start a business.
  Mr. Speaker, isn't that why we were sent here? Wouldn't that be 
something worthy to be remembered?
  I ask my colleagues to vote against the previous question so that we 
can immediately bring the Dream Act to the floor and provide certainty 
for Americans like Maritza, who want to continue to work, learn, and 
live in the country that they love, the only country they have ever 
known. We cannot afford to wait another day."|13

  This bill will give Federal agencies immediate tools to increase the 
effectiveness of our forest management projects while preserving 
environmental protections.
  While of immense benefit to preserving our national parks, the bill 
also supports the private sector by addressing obstructionist 
litigation against management activity, and rewarding collaboration by 
local governments and local stakeholders when they work together to 
foster more effective management projects.

State for not only yielding me this time and for his good work on the 
Rules Committee, but for his support of my bill, H.R. 2936, the 
Resilient Federal Forests Act.
  Mr. Speaker, I would like to speak right now not only as a Member of 
the United States House of Representatives, but also as a forester, 
educated at this country's first forestry school, licensed by my home 
State by exam to practice forestry. If there is an issue that I 
understand that comes before this Congress, it is our forests.
  As I listen to accusations from across the aisle, I trust my 
colleagues are not intentionally trying to mislead, but they seem to 
know so much about just what isn't so. This is a bipartisan bill with 
Democratic cosponsors and it is based on sound scientific management.
  Mr. Speaker, we are on the floor today to debate a rule and, as you 
know, this rule is part of the process of the House of Representatives 
that will conclude later this afternoon with votes not only on this 
rule, but eventually on the underlying legislation.
  The process of moving this bill through the House began earlier this 
year, as I and a number of Members representing multiple committees 
talked about and debated different ideas and what we hoped for in a 
final piece of legislation. After hundreds of meetings with 
stakeholders on all sides of this issue, on both sides of the aisle,


and countless hours of work by Members and staff alike, I believe that 
the House stands ready to vote to improve the condition of our national 
forest land.
  However, the hard work of everyone involved will be for naught if the 
Senate fails to act. For that reason, I encourage our colleagues in the 
Senate to take up this legislation, debate it, offer solutions, and act 
to make a difference on our national forests and our rural communities.
  Mr. Speaker, let's be clear. Our national forests are in the poorest 
condition this Nation has ever seen, and will continue to degrade if we 
fail to act and complete the work that has started here. However, I 
believe that we have reason to be encouraged. The Senate Environment 
and Public Works Committee recently held a hearing on a discussion 
draft that includes similar forest management provisions as H.R. 2936, 
and I know the other committees of jurisdiction are working on forest 
reform legislation as well.


  This is not only a forest health issue; it is a public health issue 
that demands action. Shame on us if we continue to stand idly by and 
watch our treasured national forests go up in smoke while people suffer 
and die. I stand here today to encourage the House to adopt this rule 
and pass this bill, therefore allowing the United States Senate to take 
up the legislation, or, at the very least, something similar to it. 
Pass it and allow us to meet at conference and work out the 
differences. Let us present a workable solution to the President for 
his signature.
  This year, more than 8.8 million acres of wildfire burned, as has 
been pointed out, and there is an additional 80 million acres on the 
verge of spawning more catastrophic wildfires. How many more acres must 
burn? How many more lives must be lost?"|18

the Rules Committee, as well as Mr. Westerman, for their work on this 
bill.
  I rise in support, Mr. Speaker, of the rule for consideration of H.R. 
2936, the Resilient Federal Forests Act, a bill that will help address 
the wildfire crisis that is plaguing our Nation as well as begin the 
very important process of restoring the health of our forests.
  As you know, Mr. Speaker, this has been one of the largest wildfire 
years in our Nation's history. We have seen livelihoods across the West 
threatened and seen the lives of our brave firefighters put in harm's 
way. These fires are deadly, and, tragically, more than 40 people lost 
their lives when fast-moving wildfires swept through northern 
California just a few weeks ago.
  Mr. Speaker, we have particularly felt the effects in my State of 
Wyoming, where we find ourselves in an absolutely indefensible 
situation. Fires are being caused and worsened by Federal 
mismanagement. Eight years of Federal policy opposing proven methods of 
forest management and, instead, focusing on efforts to prevent all 
human use of our forests have done significant damage.
  This damage is not just to the forests that we have had to watch 
burn, Mr. Speaker, but we have also seen tremendous damage to our water 
in postfire situations where the water is contaminated with ash; 
significant damage to wildlife habitat, the health of our forests, to 
property, and, most importantly, Mr. Speaker, to human life.
  Under the bad policies and the mismanagement from the Federal 
Government, we have seen our forests become overgrown, accumulating 
unsafe levels of hazardous biofuels that have become an absolute 
tinderbox for these fires. We must take action now.
  This bill, as my colleagues have pointed out, is a bipartisan effort 
to begin to take the steps we know will help reduce hazardous fuels and 
improve the management of our forests. We must also act, Mr. Speaker, 
as a Congress, to fix the fire-borrowing issue. The Resilient Federal 
Forests Act takes a significant step toward ending the practice of fire 
borrowing, and simplifies the process for implementing proper, 
effective forest management strategies.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge, therefore, the adoption of the rule and the 
underlying bill."|23

time.
  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the rule for H.R. 2936, the 
Resilient Federal Forests Act of 2017. This bill is a commonsense, 
thoughtful approach to restore our forests and minimize forest fire 
risk.
  First and foremost, I thank Representative Westerman for 
understanding the need for these vital reforms. He has been a great 
partner to work with and has a keen understanding of how to restore our 
forests.
  This bill contains a number of needed reforms, but, in particular, 
H.R. 2936 will put an end to obstructionist litigation that has been 
paralyzing the ability of the Forest Service to manage their own land 
for years.
  The legislation creates an arbitration pilot program that requires 
anyone suing to block a forest management activity to produce an 
alternative solution, providing effective resolutions to problems 
rather than frivolous litigant activity. The bill also puts a limit on 
the amount of taxpayer dollars that can go to pay legal fees of 
obstructionist groups when they sue to stop management.
  It seems that every year we have a longer, more devastating fire 
season. In my home State of California this year, it has been 
particularly devastating in both lives and land lost. These fires 
demand that we act, and we need to act now, to fix our forest 
management.
  Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman for his leadership on this 
issue.
  One last thing: Go Dodgers."|25

one way or another by catastrophic fires this summer. Particularly hard 
hit was the great State of Oregon.
  I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. Walden), the 
chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee."|26
CREC-2017-11-01-pt1-PgH8309-3-27|Mr. WALDEN|W000791|CREC-2017-11-01-pt1-PgH8309-3|"  Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from the Rules 
Committee, my colleague from across the river in Washington State. My 
apologies to Washingtonians because one of our fires, the Eagle Creek 
fire, actually spotted across the mighty Columbia River, set fire to 
part of the forests in Washington State down near Stevenson. 
Fortunately, that fire was extinguished. The one on the Oregon side was 
terribly dangerous, man-caused, human-caused. It blew out 14 miles in 
one night headed toward Portland.

  These are monster fires. We lost 678,000 acres this year to forest 
fires in my great State of Oregon. It is about two-thirds of the entire 
size of the State of Rhode Island. It is enormous. This is happening 
year after year, and the consequences are extraordinary.
  Smoke chokes our airsheds. Schools literally had to shut down and 
send kids home because it was too smoky to have them inside the school. 
The 30th anniversary of Cycle Oregon was canceled. That is a major 
annual bicycle ride that occurs; 30 years, the 30th anniversary, 
canceled. They couldn't find a way to pull it off. The Shakespeare 
Festival down in Ashland, nine performances had to be canceled; 
$400,000, Mr. Speaker, just in ticket receipts that had to be foregone. 
I am told they had to lay off people as a result.
  When you think about not only the lost forests--this is what a forest 
looks like after it is burned--the ground is often sterilized. You 
can't even go back and replant for a year or two in some cases because 
there is no soil left.
  The impacts are enormous on our environment. Those of us who are 
concerned about the environment, about carbon emissions into the 
atmosphere,


in 2015, when a like amount was burned in Oregon, the Forest Service 
estimated the blazes emitted more than 90,000 tons of fine particulates 
and 14.2 million tons of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. That is 
equivalent to more than 3 million cars; 3 million cars.
  The cause of these increasingly catastrophic fires, as Dr. John 
Bailey of the Oregon State University's College of Forestry pointed out 
during a hearing earlier this month in our Energy and Commerce 
Committee, in some cases, the forest landscapes in my part of Oregon, 
eastern Oregon that would have historically held about 20 trees per 
acre, have more than 1,000 trees growing there today.
  You see, we have stopped management. In many cases, we have stopped 
fire. The forests continue to grow, and die, and build, and get more 
dense, and so when fire does strike, it is with devastating 
consequence.
  My friend from Florida, and he is my friend, when he gets 
thunderstorms in Florida in the summer, he gets a lot of rain with it, 
I bet. If we have thunderstorms in Oregon, we don't get the rain. We 
went nearly 90 days without any rain, but we still got lightning. The 
lightning torches these forests and starts a lot of these blazes.
  A 2014 study in California by the Nature Conservancy, Forest Service, 
and others found that these types of projects can reduce the intensity 
of fires up to 70 percent."|27

issue is almost that of the fires we fight.
  We can reduce the size and intensity of fires by 70 percent if we do 
the kinds of projects that thin out the forest, better manage, and be 
better stewards of our public Federal forests that are contemplated as 
a result of this legislation.
  In Oregon, this bill would take away an arbitrary prohibition on 
harvesting trees over 21 inches in diameter that has tied the hands of 
our forest managers. We would clarify timber production mandates of the 
unique Oregon-California lands in southern and western Oregon to live 
with the underlying statute and actually have it enforced.
  When fires do happen, we would exchange this for a new, healthy 
forest that would grow green trees that sequester carbon and restore a 
landscape that we in the West so enjoy.
  It is long past time to fix our broken forest policy. I commend the 
Rules Committee for bringing this bill forward, and I commend Mr. 
Westerman, Mr. Bishop, and others who have worked on this on both sides 
of the aisle to help us stop the fires that ravage, and kill, and

I thank the gentleman from Oregon for his passionate words about the 
impact of catastrophic fires in his State.
  He is right. The fire from Oregon did jump the Columbia River into 
Washington, but that is not the only thing that they shared with us 
this summer. My own community, the Yakima Valley, was filled with smoke 
for probably 6 weeks this summer, causing all kinds of health issues 
for the citizens of central Washington, not just from Oregon, but smoke 
also from as far away as Montana and Idaho, and other parts of the 
Northwest.
  In fact, I was just handed a news article, I would like to note, from 
the Methow Valley News, which if you have never been to the Methow 
Valley, it is one of the most pristine, beautiful places on the face of 
the Earth. They are talking about the quality of air in the Methow 
Valley in the community of Twisp.
  The air pollution in Twisp, Washington, is considered among the worst 
in the State, if you can imagine that, in some of the most beautiful, 
clean, pristine areas that you can imagine. The air quality, largely 
due to these catastrophic fires year round, has been impacted 
negatively. That is something that, thanks to the Methow Valley News, 
they are making very clear to all of us that we need to do something to 
address this particularly important issue.
  I am pleased to yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Washington

yielding and for his leadership on this very important issue.

  I am pleased to see this legislation, the Resilient Federal Forests 
Act coming to the floor today. I also want to express appreciation to 
Representative Westerman for his leadership through the years on this 
issue. In recent years, in my home State, as has been mentioned, in 
Washington State, we have seen larger and larger devastating wildfires, 
breaking all of the records, and it seems like every year they just get 
larger and larger, and more devastating.
  They impact people's health. It is not unusual now for air quality 
warnings to be in eastern Washington, not just for days, but weeks at 
end, where it really does impact people's health. It jeopardizes our 
safety--the stories of people who are caught in the midst of these 
fires--and it is destroying our environment.
  We like to think of our forests as being green and healthy stands of 
trees, but, unfortunately, today, when you look at these forests, 
millions of acres, millions and millions of acres within the U.S. 
Forest Service are actually diseased, dying, bug-infested trees.
  I had the opportunity to meet with the chief of the Forest Service 
just last week, and he said that he estimated 80 million out of the 198 
million acres that the U.S. Forest Service owns needs treatment.
  The Forest Service has warned us for years that the forests are in 
terrible shape. It is really a result of decades of overregulation and 
frivolous lawsuits that have hindered forest management, and we are 
paying the price.
  I represent the Colville National Forest which is about a million-
acre forest. It is really the engine of our economy in the Northwest. 
Because what happens in the Colville National Forest determines whether 
or not we have Vaagen Brothers Lumber, or 49 Degrees North Ski & 
Snowboard Resort, or the biomass facility that Avista runs, converting 
wood waste into electricity.
  This is all providing jobs, energy, recreational opportunities, yet 
mills have been closed, and jobs have been lost. It is unacceptable. It 
is time to pass the Resilient Federal Forests Act legislation.

of the fire damage. If you can see that, this is from the Carlton 
Complex Fire that happened 3 years ago in my district in central 
Washington, taken just yesterday.
  The Carlton Complex burned through State, private, and Federal lands. 
So you can see that these dead, fire-damaged trees have not been 
logged, they have not been removed, and what they do is provide the 
kindling for the next catastrophic fire.
  So that is what we are talking about here, not disarming local 
communities but actually arming them and giving them the ability and 
the tools that they need in order to prevent these catastrophic fires.
  I would invite the good gentleman from Florida to come with me to 
witness firsthand the devastation and the potential devastation that we 
have and to really understand the nature of the issue. I would

  In the wake of the worst wildfires, as have been mentioned here by so 
many


of our colleagues, that the U.S. has experienced in quite a while, 
House Republicans, however, have responded by bringing to the floor, 
really, a tired bill passed last Congress that went nowhere in the 
Senate, a bill that does not fix the true problem of chronically 
underfunding wildfire prevention but, instead, doubles down in creating 
an unworkable system for wildfire suppression funding, a bill that 
rolls back environmental protection and limits access to the courts.
  It is dismaying to see the response to natural disasters in this 
country hinge on the same thing so many other important debates do: 
partisanship and ignoring facts and science.
  Despite a year in which we have seen historic hurricanes and 
wildfires, my Republican colleagues have yet again resorted to 
continuing to push policies that repeal environmental regulations, all 
the while denying the effects climate change is having on our 
communities and our country's economy.
  My friend from Oregon, a moment ago--and he is my friend--spoke about 
the thunderstorms that we receive in Florida. In his version, it is 
accompanied by rain, and that is true a lot. But we, too, have droughts 
in Florida, and Florida is known as the lightning capital of the world. 
Very occasionally, particularly in central Florida and in the 
Everglades, those lightning strikes produce wildfires in the 
congressional district that I serve and many others. Our response to 
these events needs to improve, and it needs to happen quickly.
  These disasters do not recognize congressional districts. These 
disasters do not target one area of our country over another and do not 
care about Republican or Democratic partisan gamesmanship. If we are 
going to adequately respond to the needs of millions of American 
citizens in the wake of these and future storms and future wildfires, 
we need to be advocating for sound policies based on science. This is 
the only way to protect future generations.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``no'' vote on the rule and the underlying 
legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time."|36

              Smoke Is a Year-Round Problem in the Valley

                           (By Ann McCreary)

       Autumn in the Methow Valley brings cool, crisp weather, 
     bright days and colorful foliage. And smoke. Just like every 
     other season of the year.
       The Methow Valley's clean, clear air--one of its key 
     attractions--is anything but clean and clear for extended 
     periods of the year. In fact, the Methow Valley has four 
     seasons of smoke, said Liz Walker, head of the Methow Valley 
     Clean Air Project.
       And it is not insignificant amounts of smoke, Walker said. 
     Air pollution in Twisp is among the worst in the state, based 
     on data from the Washington Department of Ecology.
       Each season in the Methow Valley brings its own source of 
     air pollution. In recent years, the all-too-familiar pall of 
     wildfire smoke has hung over the valley for days or weeks 
     during summer. As wildfires are put out by cooler, wet 
     weather of fall, the valley enters another phase of smoke 
     produced by prescribed burning in national forests, outdoor 
     burn piles and wood stoves for home heating.
       In spring, prescribed burning begins again, as well as more 
     burn piles. ``Maybe a respite in June and early July, and 
     then wildfire season will be upon us,'' Walker said.
       Although wildfire season can bring health-threatening 
     amounts of smoke to the valley, like last summer's Diamond 
     Creek Fire, poor air quality is a real concern in winter as 
     well, Walker said. ``We're susceptible to inversions and 
     stagnation in the winter months'' that trap wood stove smoke 
     on the valley floor, she said.
       Smoke is the air pollutant of greatest concern in the 
     Methow Valley, and is monitored by the Department of Ecology. 
     It is known as PM2.5, which means particulate matter that is 
     2.5 microns or smaller. These tiny particles are most 
     frequently caused by incomplete combustion, and can stay 
     airborne and can travel long distances, increasing the 
     likelihood that humans and animals will inhale them.
       Data collected by a Department of Ecology air monitor in 
     Twisp ranked air quality at that site among the eight most-
     polluted places in the state in 2016, Walker said. ``By 
     several of the measures the Department of Ecology uses to 
     look at PM2.5 pollution reported at air quality monitors 
     across the state, Twisp ranks among the worst in air 
     pollution--worse than metro Seattle or Tacoma. This is even 
     after PM2.5 from wildfire smoke is subtracted out,'' Walker 
     said.
       There was insufficient data from the air pollution monitor 
     in Winthrop to assess air quality there last year, ``but it 
     is typically only slightly better than Twisp,'' Walker said.


                              Public cost

       ``Our valley cares a lot about this, and we're working 
     together to improve it. There's a real public health cost to 
     air pollution. Anyone who has sat around a campfire, or gone 
     for a strenuous hike on a smoky day has had a firsthand 
     lesson in the toxicity of smoke,'' Walker said.
       Walker's concern about health impacts come from her 
     training as an environmental health toxicologist. Harmful 
     effects range from the inability to exercise outdoors, to 
     respiratory distress and infections, to increased risk of 
     cancer.
       ``For vulnerable populations--babies, children, pregnant 
     women, elders, and anyone with heart or lung issues--bad air 
     days can mean serious health repercussions. For everyone, 
     chronic exposure to high levels of PM2.5 can potentially 
     trigger or exacerbate conditions such as headaches, asthma, 
     bronchitis and cardiovascular disease.''
       There are economic costs of air pollution in the Methow 
     Valley as well, she said. ``We're a tourist economy, 
     dependent on the natural beauty of the valley,'' Walker said.
       The Methow Valley Clean Air Project was launched in 2015 by 
     Raleigh Bowden, a local physician, after she saw people 
     suffering health effects of poor winter air quality, Walker 
     said. A key goal of the project is improving air quality 
     during the home heating season, October through March.
       ``Due to our valley's frequent winter inversions, smoke 
     from woodstoves and outdoor burning pollutes our air to 
     frequently unhealthy levels,'' Walker said. ``We've focused 
     on the home heating season because this is when we can make 
     behavioral changes to improve our air quality. This is a 
     controllable source of pollution, as contrasted with 
     pollution from wildfires.''
       The Clean Air Project outlines measures residents can take 
     to reduce pollution from wood stoves, including: Properly 
     season wood so that it is dry and burns cleaner; clean 
     chimneys yearly; build small, hot fires and don't damp them 
     down; comply with burn bans; upgrade to certified stoves or a 
     wood-burning alternative; weatherize homes.
       The organization is also working to reduce outdoor burning 
     of yard waste and provide alternatives, including 
     ``vegetation drives'' sponsored by the Clean Air Project, 
     Walker said.


                           Successful drives

       Vgetation drives, supported by grants and partnerships, 
     were held in the fall of 2016 and spring of 2017, and another 
     drive is scheduled next spring. Past drives have collected 
     about 20 tons of vegetation, which prevented hundreds or 
     thousands of hours of smoke, Walker said.
       The yard waste was dropped off by residents and hauled to 
     the county landfill during the first drive, conducted over 
     two days. During the second drive, conducted over eight days 
     in partnership with the Town of Twisp, residents delivered 
     vegetation to a site near the Twisp wastewater treatment 
     plant, where it was chipped and offered free for landscaping 
     and mulching.
       ``The most unusual community participant brought his load 
     strapped to the back of his bicycle--now that's commitment to 
     clean air!'' Walker said.
       The Clean Air Project also partnered this year with the 
     Pine Forest Homeowners Association to provide support for 
     chipping branches and slash created when underbrush and trees 
     were thinned and limbed as part of Pine Forest's ongoing 
     Firewise efforts. The debris would otherwise have been 
     burned.
       Next spring's vegetation drive will be conducted in 
     partnership with the Okanogan Conservation District, Walker 
     said. She suggested that residents who have been accumulating 
     yard waste cover their piles this fall instead of burning 
     them, and haul them to the vegetation drive in the spring to 
     be chipped.
       Walker acknowledged that it takes extra effort, and a 
     different mindset, to participate in a vegetation drive 
     rather than burn yard waste. ``It's hard. Our valley is long. 
     It requires a truck, loading it up and hauling it in,'' she 
     said. ``People have been outdoor burning in the valley 
     forever. It's how you get rid of your stuff when you live out 
     in the country.''
       However, Walker said, many valley residents have been 
     supportive of the vegetation drives. ``People really 
     appreciate this as an option. They don't want to impact the 
     health of families and the community,'' she said.
       For people who want to continue the longstanding local 
     tradition of burning yard waste, the Clean Air Project 
     suggests ``best practices for burning outdoors in the most 
     safe and clean way,'' Walker said.
       ``Make sure the pile is as bone dry as possible. Make sure 
     you know what is a good day, with good ventilation, but not 
     too much wind. We've interacted with Fire District 6 and 
     smokejumpers. There are lots of folks with tons of knowledge 
     about how to build a hot, clean pile,'' she said.
       The Clean Air Project is overseen by a volunteer advisory 
     group. The Methow Valley Citizens' Council is fiscal sponsor 
     for the organization. More information is available on the 
     Methow Valley Clean Air Project Facebook page.

today's debate.
  The issue of proactive management of our Nation's Federal forests is 
critically important to the future and economic well-being of our whole 
country as well as to the health of our Federal lands and safety of our 
rural communities.
  Let me say that, if you have never been through a rural community 
that has had to face the devastation of a catastrophic fire, you are 
welcome to come to the State of Washington and see firsthand exactly 
the kind of damage that these fires can do.
  This is of the highest priority, and I urge all my colleagues to 
support this rule as well as the underlying bill in order to combat 
these catastrophic wildfires and reform the way in which we manage our 
forests.
  This rule provides for consideration of H.R. 2936, the Resilient 
Federal Forests Act of 2017. This is bipartisan, it is comprehensive, 
and it aims at addressing the disastrous consequences of catastrophic 
wildfires by utilizing the tools the Forest Service and other agencies 
have to reduce the threats posed by these fires, by insects, by disease 
infestation, and by dangerous old forest overgrowth.
  As I said, my district in central Washington and millions of acres 
across our great country continue to face this threat. We must take 
steps to prevent and address these fires, which this bill will do by 
reforming the way we prepare for, respond to, and fund wildfire 
response and mitigation efforts. These threats will only continue to 
worsen not only for my constituents, but for people all around the 
country.
  We are recognizing sustained drought conditions. Mismanagement and 
failure to conduct maintenance of our forests on Federal lands will 
continue to plague this issue. The underlying legislation is essential 
and desperately needed to change the outdated, unsustainable, and 
untimely dangerous system of Federal forest management on these lands.
  Mr. Speaker, this is a straightforward rule allowing for 
consideration of a critical piece of legislation that will help protect 
our rural communities and ensure we are prepared to respond to these 
devastating, catastrophic fires.
  I appreciate the discussion we have had today. I believe that this is 
a critical measure, and I urge my colleagues to support House 
Resolution 595 and the underlying legislation."|38

industry and a distinguished public servant, George Stevens, Jr. For 
five decades, George Stevens, Jr., served as the founding director of 
the American Film Institute, AFI, an organization that led the clarion 
call to preserve and celebrate America's film heritage.
  In honoring him, I would like to state the following in the Record:

       Whereas, George Stevens, Jr., stood in the Rose Garden of 
     the White House in 1967 when President Lyndon Johnson 
     announced there would be an American Film Institute in order 
     to address the crisis of America's disappearing motion 
     picture heritage.
       Whereas, through the extraordinary vision of the Library of 
     Congress and the American Film Institute, more than 37,000 
     motion pictures are now safely preserved in the AFI 
     Collection at the Library of Congress.
       Whereas, George Stevens, Jr., led the effort at the AFI to 
     create a rescue list of movies with the Museum of Modern Art, 
     Eastman House, and the Library of Congress and locate and 
     preserve missing films.
       Whereas, the collection includes classic American films, 
     including ``It's A Wonderful Life,'' ``Mr. Smith Goes to 
     Washington,'' ``The Ten Commandment,'' ``Puss in Boots,'' and 
     George Stevens, Sr.'s ``Gunga Din.''
       Whereas, George Stevens, Jr., expanded the horizons of the 
     next generation of filmmakers and visionaries with the 
     creation an AFI Center for Advanced Film Studies.
       Whereas, George Stevens, Jr., unleashed the power of 
     filmmaking in service to the


     American people, leading the United States Information Agency 
     Motion Picture Service and producing award-winning films 
     about the fabric of American life.
       Therefore, today in the U.S. Senate, I honor the 50th 
     anniversary of the American Film Institute and the 
     extraordinary legacy of George Stevens, Jr., director, 
     producer, playwright, and public servant without equal. 
     Thomas Edison may be given credit for inventing the film 
     industry, but it is George Stevens, Jr., and the American 
     Film Institute who have preserved it for future generations 
     to come.

to rise to share my passion and my love for this country, but also my 
frustration. I will use this graphic to set the tone for my remarks 
this morning.
  Although the Republican tax proposal will be introduced tomorrow, I 
believe, if you look at this graphic and the headlines, it says that 80 
percent of the tax relief will not go to you and you and you and to the 
American people, or maybe even staff and Members who are here who are 
Americans, salaried individuals; it will go, 80 percent, to the 1 
percent of Americans.
  Now, I am not going to talk about the tax legislation this morning. I 
want this to be a symbol of the wrongness of the direction of this 
country and the leader who leads this Nation. We are going down a wrong 
path.
  Many of us thought we had come together in unity, we had overcome the 
divisiveness because we were different,


we had recognized the beauty of all of us, rural citizens in West 
Virginia, Ohioans in the mountains of the Appalachian area, 
Midwesterners, Southerners, Northerners, Westerners, Far West, 
immigrant and nonimmigrant. But, unfortunately, in 2016, although some 
lost and some won, as we moved toward a new administration with the 
hopes and dreams of those who had voted, we looked for the unifying of 
what I know that all Presidents have done.
  It has been a privilege of mine to work with President William 
Jefferson Clinton, who didn't have an easy time but sought to unify the 
country. I worked with President George W. Bush, who did not have an 
easy time or an unconflicted election but sought to unify the country, 
in fact, was an enthusiastic signer of the reauthorization of the 
Voting Rights Act; and President Barack Obama, who rode in on a sense 
of hope and unity. That is the task of a President.
  In the midst of this, again, having been appointed to the Homeland 
Security Committee in the ashes of 9/11, having gone to Ground Zero 
while our brave first responders were recovering, were still looking 
for remains--it will penetrate my soul forever--unity was what we 
sought in spite of our difference of opinions.
  So I rise to thank the first responders and the quick response of the 
NYPD and Fire Department on yesterday's terrorist act. Yes, it was a 
terrorist act. We live in a different world. But rather than rise to 
the occasion, this morning the words come from the White House:

       The terrorist came into our country through what is called 
     the ``Diversity Visa Lottery Program,'' a Chuck Schumer 
     beauty. I want merit-based immigration.

  You tell me how many immigrants, how many Italians, how many Irish, 
and how many of those who escaped the Holocaust, who came before that 
from the Jewish community, how many of them would have met any test of 
merit. Did the slaves who were brought here as slaves meet a test of 
merit? All of these individuals helped build this Nation.
  And on the morning when people are mourning of their lost loved ones, 
rather than bringing the country together, there is a politicizing, 
calling out names of Members. We are working on merit based.
  Does he even understand what merit based is? Absolutely not.
  Taking away from the conspiracy charge against Manafort, taking away 
from the conspicuous collusion with Russians that George Papadopoulos 
has indicated, oh, he is worrying about him lying. But I am worrying 
about him telling the truth, and he is. They wanted dirty stuff on the 
opponent; they wanted to work with Russia; they wanted to work with 
Putin; and they wanted to conspire against the United States of 
America--as well as the misunderstanding or the devastating comments of 
his chief of staff about the civil war and NFL players being called 
inmates in a prison.
  Mr. Speaker, I am fed up with dividing this Nation. We are going in 
the wrong direction, and I am not going to accept it. I am taking a 
knee with all of those who believe in justice and what is right. I did 
it before. I do it now. I take a knee.

of the American Museum of Tort Law, located in Winsted, CT, which 
celebrated its second anniversary on September 25, 2017. In honor of 
its history and continued importance as a national educational 
institution, I would like to commemorate the museum and celebrate this 
milestone.
   Since its founding by Ralph Nader, the American Museum of Tort Law 
has attracted national acclaim from media outlets including Politico, 
the New Yorker, the Boston Globe and the Washington Post. Its vital 
importance to our citizenry has been recognized by former Supreme Court 
Justice Sandra Day O'Connor. Thousands of people have attended the 
museum and have come away educated, entertained, and impressed by its 
presentation.
   The mission of this unique institution is to educate, inform, and 
inspire Americans about their legal system, with a focus on the right 
of trial by jury and the benefits of tort law. Through school group 
visits, self-guided tours, quality curated programing, and its website, 
the museum has shown true dedication towards the fostering of greater 
civic knowledge and awareness.
   Moving forward, the museum has an ambitious plan to expand, 
including not just on-site operations, but broadening its reach by 
traveling across the country and becoming a resource for practitioners, 
judges, and legal scholars.
   I have thoroughly enjoyed the opportunity to personally visit the 
American Museum of Tort Law. As a former history teacher, I can attest 
to the tremendous value this museum provides through the details and 
historical context that brings to life the law and justice. Tort law 
has improved the lives of so many and this museum tells that story.
   I am proud to have such an exciting and important institution 
located in my district. Congratulations to the American Museum of Tort 
Law on celebrating its second anniversary. May it continue to educate 
and inspire for generations to come.

weekend in October for the last 34 years, the whole town turns out for 
the Needville Harvest Festival.
  The Harvest Fest is all Texas. There is a talent show with twirlers 
and clog dancers; barbecue cook-offs; contests for the best fajitas, 
the best pork loins, the best chicken, and the best pork ribs; and they 
give away a 4-by-4 Gator. City slickers think that is some sort of 
lizard. It is a big farm tool, a farm tractor.
  The best part is all the money they raise goes to their city to 
improve their 60-acre Harvest Park and the Needville schools.

congratulate Capital Chiropractic & Rehabilitation Center of Des 
Moines, Iowa for being named one of the 2016 Businesses of the Year at 
the Des Moines East and South Chamber of Commerce Annual Dinner and 
Awards Ceremony earlier this year.
  The Business of the Year award celebrates a local business that is 
dedicated to serving their community. Since Dr. Chris LoRang launched 
Capital Chiropractic & Rehabilitation Center in 2013, it has won 
numerous awards for the service they provide in family and sports 
medicine to people of all ages. The clinic encourages employees to be 
active in the community, and you can find them involved in 
organizations around the area, including neighborhood associations, 
school foundations, chamber of commerce council's and chiropractic 
societies.
  Mr. Speaker, I am honored to represent local businesses like Capital 
Chiropractic & Rehabilitation Center in the United States Congress and 
it is with great pride that I recognize them today. I ask that my 
colleagues in the United States House of Representatives join me in 
congratulating them for this outstanding recognition and in wishing 
them all nothing but continued success.
