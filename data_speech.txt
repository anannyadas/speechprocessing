Mr. Speaker, every November we commemorate Native American \nHeritage Month. I am honored to share a long-standing partnership with \nIndian Tribes located in Arizona and across the United States. This \nincludes our most recent efforts to extend the AMBER Alert program to \nIndian Country, which will ensure that every family in Indian Country \nis afforded the same resources to find a missing child.\n  Today I am especially grateful to recognize the valiant service of \nNative American U.S. Marines during the Iwo Jima campaign:\n  Ira Hayes, a member of the Gila River Pima Indian community, is most \nnotably remembered as one of the servicemen who raised the American \nflag over Mount Suribachi.\n  The Navajo Code Talkers were also irreplaceable during World War II. \nThe\n\n\nCode Talkers effectively transmitted combat messages across enemy lines \nto avoid interception and decryption.\n  Major Howard Connor said it best: ``Were it not for the Navajos, the \nMarines would never have taken Iwo Jima.''\n  Mr. Speaker, it is an honor to highlight their contributions to \nArizona and the United States.\n", "turn": 0, "speaker": "Mr. BIGGS", "itemno": 1}, {"kind": "linebreak", "speaker_bioguide": null, "text": "                          ____________________\n\n\n", "turn": -1, "speaker": "None", "itemno": 2}]
